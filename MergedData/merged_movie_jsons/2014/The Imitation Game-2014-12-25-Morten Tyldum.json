            "content": "Alan Turing was a fascinating, complex person who deserves to be better known to the world. Likewise his story is important and deserves to be told rather than forgotten. Had high hopes for 'The Imitation Game', after hearing so many good things about it, and it ended up being one of my favourite films of 2014.That 'The Imitation Game' is historically inaccurate and has distortions didn't offend me as much as some reviewers, biographical dramas are notorious for this so it's come to be expected by me (not that that is meant to be an excuse). All that was wanted was a film that made me think, moved me, was well made and well acted. 'The Imitation Game' was all those things and more.It isn't perfect, the political elements are on the preachy side and there are a few strands that could have gone into more detail, Turing's sexuality should have gotten into more depth than it was.However, 'The Imitation Game' is exceptionally well made. It's immaculately photographed and has some of the best production design of its best, especially in the costumes. The direction allows the film to be absorbing, while the music score is often hauntingly beautiful and never intrusive.In terms of the script, 'The Imitation Game' does a wonderful job in provoking thought and providing emotional impact and nuances and fleshes the characters out with remarkable complexity. What could have been potentially dry treatment of the subject matter turned out to be fascinating, thrilling and very moving.Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best performance of a very solid career, an outstanding portrayal that won't be forgotten for years to come. Keira Knightley is a sympathetic confidante and Charles Dance is excellent as always as his superior. The supporting cast are without complaint.Overall, wonderful film and its acclaim is a long way from an enigma. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Morten Tyldum's espionage thriller about Alan Turing is purely sensational with a performance for the ages by Benedict Cumberbatch...",
            "content": "It took a little over 24 hours before I weighed in on my official thoughts on Morten Tyldum's The Imitation Game from The Weinstein Company. My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year's best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. Full disclosure, I'm fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I've heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn't care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read \"Alan Turing: The Enigma,\" the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later.Masterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.Benedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's \"Sherlock,\" this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.The rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. I don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.Technical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg's efforts. It's something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let's not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year.The Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made. There are sub plots that all resonate and never feel forced. This will not only keep your tension level at a fever pitch but could leave you in tears to walk home with. It's a complete realistic view at the spy game that stands as one of the best films of the year and a performance for the ages from Benedict Cumberbatch. A captivating achievement that I'll likely remember for some time.",

            "review_title": "Annoyingly inaccurate",
            "content": "As the film announces at the start, it based on a true story. The essentials are true, and to get so much history into a film things have to be condensed. Unfortunately unnecessarily inaccurate things were portrayed which didn't save any time. For example, Turing mutters under his breath so most audiences will not notice, that the Poles made the first crucial breakthrough. By the start of the war, the Poles led by Marian Rejewski had been breaking Enigma for over six years and built the first machine, called a \"bomba\" in 1938.In July 1939 the Poles passed on all the information to the French and British including details of the bomba and their successes at a meeting which included Denniston. The problem started to mount for the Poles and later the British when other rotors could be swapped in and the indicator method was changed by the Germans. The film is correct in showing that Turing's genius was using known words from the coded messages to reduce the myriad of possibilities. This idea happened in 1939 and so he started from the outset to design the British \"bombes\" to use this method, not after they had been running for months.Four senior code-breakers, not just Alan Turing, but also Gordon Welchman, Stuart Milner-Barry and Hugh Alexander wrote to Churchill in 1941 over Denniston's head about the shortage of staff and praising Edward Travis. In February 1942, Denniston was demoted and transferred elsewhere. His successor, Edward Travis, transformed the procedures.Cairncross, played by Downton's ex-chauffeur, never appeared at Bletchley until 1942 and the alleged blackmail is an unnecessary red-herring.The idea that there would be a chart on the wall in Hut 8 showing the latest positions of all Atlantic convoys is laughable. This chart was in a secure bunker in Liverpool that was as closely guarded as Bletchley Park.Turing's team had no input into how the information was to be used, but it is true that Ultra intelligence had to be supported by other information and so patrols were sent out to find what was known to be already there.Lastly Turing would never, ever, have disclosed even the existence of Bletchley Park to a detective he had just met.The performance of Benedict Comberbatch is exceptional, and the rest of the cast good. Keira Knightley is pretty enough to have turned even Turing, but, despite the lines that told us, she never gave the impression she had a double first in mathematics from Cambridge.Good film, though it could have be closer to reality without making it longer or more complex.",

Featuring an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as war hero Turning and supporting acts from a brilliant cast including Keira Knightley, Charles Dance and Mark Strong, 'The Imitation Game' is a powerful and eminently well-made biopic that illuminates the facts whilst respecting the story it is based upon.

            "review_title": "A gross distortion of people and events.",
            "content": "Although well crafted and paced by good professionals in almost every sphere of film making, The Imitation Game is sadly reduced to a piece of populist pulp by the dominance of formulaic 'Hollywood' principles that entirely distort the key events and personnel involved.Alan Turing did not alone invent the code breaking machine seen in the film. He worked in a team headed by Dilly Knox, not even depicted in the film, who succeeded in breaking the code on 23 January 1940. Gordon Welchman, again not depicted in the film, later headed the military section that developed the 'Bombe' machine (called 'Christopher' in the film) albeit with Turing's help but not under his total dominance as suggested in this fiction.Moreover the 'Bombe' was not a computer as the film states. It was a mere calculator rather than a programmable digital machine. The first computer at Bletchly was developed years later under Max Newman when Tommy Flowers designed 'Collossus'. This film intensely distorts these events and is a disgraceful insult to those who actually did the work.Worse still the film completely misrepresents Joan Clarke who is depicted as a rather attractive crossword enthusiast recruited by Turing because she can solve puzzles faster than him. This was utter rubbish. Clarke, a 'plain Jane' type mathematician, was already employed at Bletchly when Turing arrived.Even Alan Turing himself is misrepresented in character. Eccentric he certainly was but the arrogance shown in the film has no real foundation. Moreover he was not uncomfortable with his sexuality or even the hormonal treatment he received as depicted at the end of the film. His friends report that he laughed about developing breasts that would increase his attractiveness to other men.But the film, funded by the powers that are today, cannot even suggest the dreadful possibility that Turing's death was not the suicide so adamantly stated at the end. Turing was devoted to his mother (also never depicted in the film) and the concept of his suicide without leaving her a letter is inconceivable. He had been warned by MI6 only months before his death not to continue his homosexual lifestyle (they were paranoid after the Burgess-Maclean saga) but he continued to visit Greece where he openly took up with gay men. Entirely happy only a few days before we are told that he then took his own life whilst eating an apple. His family and friends maintain the real chance that he was expediently removed by MI6 as a security risk. And poisoning food with cyanide was then a well used technique in security circles for such requirements.When a film depicts a Cambridge Professor of Mathematics attacking a machine with a heavy spanner because it is not working fast enough, when a film repeats the single memorable line about unimaginable people doing the unimaginable three times in 30 minutes, when a film states that the central character had the power to decide 'who was to live and who was to die' (again a total nonsense because how the code was used was decided at top Cabinet level and not by the code breakers at all) when such rubbish is presented alongside a string of historical distortions you will know that is essentially rubbish and a waste of time to watch.And Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, though competent, was too reminiscent of Derek Jacobi's famous BBC2 portrayal in places to be thought of as original. Timothy Spall as Mr. Turner was not even Oscar nominated for his excellent portrayal but Cumberbatch has been included to expand the Turing myth. Thank God Eddy Redmayne is there to take the prize for his staggering performance as Steven Hawking.",

I thought I'd quickly whack this in here, because I saw some negative reviews because it was a little bit inaccurate.The film itself I thought was brilliant. It was a wonderful performance from Benedict (never used that word to describe acting before which speaks volumes) and he carried the film in the parts where not a lot was going on.The plot itself was interesting and kept you in suspense throughout and it had great characters that were all likeable and kept you invested throughout!My only real problem I had was that when they finally figured out the code, the film kind of dragged. All tension was gone from the film and you're left with 20 mins or so of just wrapping up stuff and dragging scenes on that didn't need to be, so I got a touch bored towards the end. But other than that it was a really enjoyable watch and for someone who wasn't really familiar with the true story I found it educational also, which is a nice bonus.But yeah, it's definitely a film I'd recommend. 8/10 from me!",

            "review_title": "Good enough but historically sketchy",
            "content": "This is a good enough movie, but skirts around the true story in order to make a clunky point about a genius hounded to death for his homosexuality. The plot is simple. Britain is losing the war and desperately needs something to have a chance of survival. Cracking Nazi codes to stop attacks at sea and in the air might just tip the balance. Step forward the secret decoding establishment at Bletchley Park, where expert mathematicians and linguists are recruited to try and break the famous codes sent via the German Enigma machines. And step forward one Alan Turing of Cambridge University, resident if gay genius played by Benedict Cumberbatch. To break the codes apparently Turing invents a machine to do this. Of course, this is all nonsense -the Poles had built machines previously to do this work and had broken Enigma, but with increasing sophistication they no longer had the resources so handed over their work to the British, along with a captured Enigma machine from the Wehrmacht. So tension mounts as Turing uses tons of money on a new (sic) totally innovative machine which does not seem to be quick enough. On the way an overly attractive Joan Clark (played by Keira Knightley), a double first, helps out and gets engaged to Turing, while silly old Commander Dennison played by Charles Dance tries to close down the machine!!!!! Eventually a chance remark and a realisation of something bleedin' obvious puts Turing and co on the right track. Just time for - we must not use all information or Jerry will know we have broken his codes, so little chat about who is saved and who isn't, which is pretty peripheral, before getting to the climax where Turing is chemically castrated by an unfeeling and totally ungrateful country. The thriller elements are okay, but Turing can do no wrong except tell Clark to leave Bletchley, which gets short feminist shrift! Oh dear, the script cannot help itself from being so terribly 21st century liberal in its preachy parts. A pity some other unsung heroes like Tommy Flowers and the Poles do not get a mention! The acting is fine all round, the direction serviceable, and it works at its own level, but the one man band tub thumping with Cumberbatch twitching and not looking directly at people (obvious Oscar material like 'Rain Man') really does a disservice to the great team effort of the wartime code breakers. Remember, an even more advanced, valve-based machine for breaking codes was developed with little participation from Turing by a working class GPO man - Tommy Flowers, who used his own money to finance it. Hope his story is not overlooked just because he was straightforwardly normal!",

            "review_title": "Hello Best Picture frontrunner. Consider me satisfied.",
            "content": "There is something appropriately mechanical about The Imitation Game. It has a theatrical rhythm and attention to detail that ticks like a clock. That's not to say that it's necessarily overly dry and hard to connect to, this biopic of the extraordinary and tragic mathematician and inventor of the digital computer, Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is emotionally engaging and utterly endearing. With a slick exquisite script and an eclectic ensemble strong enough to deliver, it's an accessible film that although may feel familiar, is thoroughly refreshing, bringing laughter, tears and thrills. It will undeniably be a huge contender at the big awards this season, perhaps going all the way.Director Morten Tyldum's film follows Turing's journey to break the Enigma Code, the form in which the Germans communicated during WWII to conduct surprise attacks. He attempts it by building the first computer, a passion project of his that was frequently criticized for devoting so much Government time and money. He deals with a social ineptitude while also accepting his own homosexuality, which lead to unforgivable persecution and depression that caused Turing to take his own life. The film focuses on his life achievements rather than his demise, though it does explore that part of his life, if not illustrate it as much as it could have done.It's easy to root for Turing, even if his arrogance and standoffishness repel the other characters. Benedict Cumberbatch is a real crowd pleaser here. I've only seen him in short supporting roles such as last year's August: Osage County and 12 Years A Slave and I'm certainly quite impressed, if not quite as astounded. There's a very rehearsed quality about his performance, similar to Anne Hathaway's Oscar winning turn in Les Miserables. Every stutter and nuance feels perfectly placed rather than organic. But this isn't necessarily a turn off, it fits the tone of the film. He could go all the way to the Oscar but it depends on buzz and the competition.The highlight of the film is the writing by Graham Moore, adapted from Andrew Hodges novel 'Alan Turing: The Enigma.' It's not groundbreaking, but it has the right ingredients and the perfect recipe. Even if somehow it's the only film's nomination, it's still a frontrunner for the win in Adapted Screenplay. This will be a film known for 'ticking boxes,' but it does it in a way that all films should. It's economical without ever feeling like it's rushing or only scratching the surface. It constantly pummels the characters with adversity, presenting heart-wrenching moral dilemmas, particularly for Keira Knightley's Joan Clarke. It turns something complicated and bleak quite lighthearted, especially with the casual approach to war outside of moments of justified despair.Knightley will certainly get awards attention for her fine supporting role as Turing's counterpart. Her role may not be as meaty, lacking the highs and lows Cumberbatch has, but she makes the most of her relative sparing use, becoming the heart of the film. Thanks to her, their relationship is completely believable, given that Turing is a man who struggles with connecting to people, and the way she manages the choices her character is set upon is dealt with deft conviction. Charles Dance, Mark Strong and especially Matthew Goode are commanding side presences who bolster the film's charm. The titular 'imitation game' is essentially the Replicant test from Blade Runner, something Turing has practiced on himself. However, all the characters are human here, if with a confidence you only find in the movies.Instead of a linear structure, the film chooses flashbacks to flesh out the full story of Turing. It does seem a little extraneous to go back to school with him, but fortunately the focus of their objectives and the performances of the young actors make them worthwhile, as well as showing the origin of something that changed the world as we know it. The scale is further expanded with newsreel footage and scenes of the world at war, even if the special effects are relatively primitive compared to what can be achieved these days though that doesn't hold the film back as such. It's very easy to get suckered into films that convince you that you're watching one man change the world and The Imitation Game achieves that effortlessly.Although it's dense in character and plot, The Imitation Game flashes more on the surface than it has to offer beneath. Kinetic energy in the editing brings an instant gratification, especially in the edge of your seat sequences. There are liberties with the tone for such a somber event and protagonist that most likely doesn't reflect the honest emotions involved, but obviously it's easier to digest for audience. I was unsure at first, but then it had me under its spell. This also may be Alexandre Desplat's best bet at finally winning an Oscar. It adds to that whimsical cinematic tone, almost reminiscent on his work on Harry Potter sans the magic. It will certainly be warmly embraced in the mainstream. The film is poignant, but not powerful. Entertaining, but not enlightening.I'm content calling this the Best Picture frontrunner until further notice. The film feels like a combination of Argo, with the secrets and the camaraderie of the unit, and The King's Speech, with its Britishness and charming partnerships. It depends whether the Academy fall for the ambition of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar or the Chariots of Fire + The Bridge on the River Kwai formula of Angelina Jolie's Unbroken. Either way, The Imitation Game will belong amongst the most deserving winners, but the test of time remains to be seen. It's not like it'll be alone in that group. Nevertheless, with Queen Elizabeth II's pardon for Turing last year, there's never been a better time to educate the masses on his legacy that we use everyday.8/10edit: guess it isn't. Oh well.

You should pay attention, Alan Turing deserves your attention, his story deserves to be told.I went to see this at the London Film Festival last week and I am going to be one of the first ones in the cue to see it when it comes out next month. It is an excellently paced and executed script that has you gripped from beginning to end. The whole audience were laughing and applauding and crying in places, including the man next to me who had to borrow a hankie from his wife.The film switches between the drive of the team of code breakers to solve the Enigma code, young Alan Turing and the events after the war that destroyed his life. It is truly heartbreaking in places, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Alan Turing is outstanding. He really deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.It has been a very, VERY long time since I enjoyed a film so much, that when I came out of the Cinema I wanted to turn right round and go back in and watch it again. A lovely script that had you switching back and forwards between tears and laughter.I know some wanted a more in depth and in detail look at Alan Turing's life and have commented frequently that this does no focus enough on his sexuality or the events after the war.In this case I think less is more, this film highlights the man and the mind. It shows us the genius that was destroyed by a society that was seriously homophobic. It brings to life the man behind the facts and we laugh at his interactions with his fellow code breakers and cheer as he proves his theories and our hearts break as we watch him try to cope after his court case.One of the best films I have seen in a long time.

The story of Alan Turing, a key member of the team that developed the methods and machines that broke those ciphers is an important one, also deserving of an accurate telling.\"The Imitation Game\" is neither of these films. The story told by this film is watchable, Cumberbatch renders Turing sympathetically and, somewhat to my surprise, Knightley takes the thinly written role of Joan Clarke and turns it into something with a fair bit of heft. However, this film's story takes such liberties with the facts that it really cannot be recommended. This is *not* how the German ciphers were broken and it is not even a reasonable depiction of Turing's life, particularly so when it comes to the atrocious way he was treated after the war.You will not find Harold Keen or Gordon Welchman in this film, the writers preferring to insinuate that Turing was wholly responsible for the design and building of the bombe machines (except that Hugh Alexander is credited with the idea for improving their working that was actually Welchman's). However, you will find a Soviet spy in Turing's hut when in fact he did not work there. I could go on and list other inaccuracies.If you are unaware of the stories of Enigma and Turing, you may find this a quite interesting film to watch. If you are aware of these stories I think you may find it difficult to swallow the gross misrepresentations of both.I consider that filmmakers, when depicting real people or events, have a responsibility to tell the truth and not distort things simply for dramatic effect. When this responsibility is ignored the filmmakers have decided to, in effect, spread lies in the name of entertainment. \"The Imitation Game\" may be entertaining but it makes this dismal mistake and cannot be recommended.",

IMITATION... At least as far as I could see, seemed, more than anything else, rather taut and extremely entertaining! After all, isn\u00b4t that the essence of what CINEMA is SUPPOSED to be all about???10**********... A truly rewarding and outstanding Film!",

            "content": "While it is a moderately decent film on a noble subject matter, I never felt thrilled, moved or otherwise captivated in a way that deserves over the top praise from other reviewers in my humble opinion.I felt that many opportunities to create dramatic tension and stunning photography were thrown away as a result of the insertion of ill-fitting material (black and white footage of Hitler? really?) and poor script and acting (Keira is bland as vanilla I am afraid to say).It wasn't all bad. Translating the challenge of cryptanalysis into film is a challenge which I think was valiantly attempted, though excessively dumbed down.A number of sub-plots are introduced in different time frames, one in Turing's childhood and one after the war. Sadly they fail to deliver any meaningful drama, again as a result of mediocre writing. If anything they are distracting and defuse any tension that might have built up in the scenes that precede them. As such, the editing did feel amateurish. The ending was extremely disappointing: why use lines of text to depict that which can be shown instead? Finally there is a rather out of place scene with a barely disguised and hypocritical feminist agenda. I say that because that particular scene was fictional and never happened in reality, so its existence can only be justified by such an agenda. I refer to the moment Keira Knightly attempts to sit an exam to join Turing's code breakers' team. An incredulous usher, convinced she is present for a job interview as a secretary instead (because the evil patriarchy couldn't possibly contemplate she is as capable as men - see how subtle that was? wow) refuses her entry until our hero Turing intervenes and allows her in. We are also told this female character has a double first in mathematics from Cambridge. If wartime Britain was so sexist, why does she hold such a distinguished degree? And if sexism is so evil, then why fall does the script fall in the trap of using her as an emotional element in the story but glosses over the contribution her brilliant mind made to Turing's efforts? Now THAT my friends, is sexist and the film could have done without this ridiculous and off-topic political manifesto. It was the final nail in the coffin as far as I was concerned.I shall not watch this again, however I do fancy reading a biography of Alan Turing, maybe something the film can take credit for.",

            "content": "As with many films 'inspired by real events' much of what we see in this film has been changed; either to introduce antagonists or to make the film more interesting\u0085 whether such changes can be justified is a matter for the viewer; I will try to base my comments on what was shown on the screen rather than trying to compare it to real events.The film opens in 1951 when police arrive at the house of Alan Turing to investigate a burglary. There doesn't appear to be anything missing and he just wants the police to leave; something the investigating officer finds a little unusual. We then flash back to the dark days of the Second World War where Turing is applying for a post at the top secret Bletchley Park code breaking centre. His manner puts him at odds with his superior and those he works with. They are struggling to decode German Enigma codes by hand; an impossible task given the complexity of the system. The code key changes every day and there are millions of possible keys. Turing says he will build a machine that will be able to find the key but even when the machine is built they will have to find a way to reduce the number of possible keys. Intertwined with this story we see flashbacks to his time at school and more of the police investigation into Turing after the war; it is speculated that he is being secretive because he might be a spy; in fact he is hiding his homosexuality\u0085 which was illegal at the time and would remain so until the late sixties.Despite knowing how Alan Turing's story ended this was a gripping film; this is largely down to an excellent cast led by Benedict Cumberbatch's brilliant portrayal of Turing; I'm not surprised that he earned an Oscar nomination for it. He is ably supported by others including Keira Knightley who plays Joan Clarke, a fellow code breaker who Turing proposes to, and Charles Dance who plays his antagonistic boss Commander Denniston. The story is told in a way that doesn't assume the viewer knows anything about Turing so the revelation about his sexuality isn't overstated early on although there are obvious clues as the story progresses. If you are interested in this period of history I'd certainly recommend watching this; just remember it is merely 'inspired by real events'\u0085 hopefully it will inspire viewers to learn more about this great man and the contribution he and the others at Bletchley Park made during the war.",

            "content": "The British Official Secrets act prevented me as a kid growing up about Alan Turing. I would certainly have liked to know about him in my formative years on many levels. Over a 100 years after his birth he's a role model for gay geeks everywhere, but in his lifetime he would not have been known beyond his field of Mathematics.Benedict Cumberbatch plays the enigmatic man Alan Turing who many consider the founder of computer science. He was also a tortured gay man in those days when sodomy laws were strictly enforced. A respected professor of Mathematics he volunteers for the war effort. Not satisfied with how codebreaking efforts were going he goes right to the top and the sheer brass and effrontery persuade Winston Churchill to put this man in charge.I doubt Winston Churchill knew much more about what Alan Turing was talking about than I would now. But sometimes genius will out in just the way it's presented. I only wish we had gotten to see Churchill's reaction to Turing's now famous letter.As we well know now with what has been declassified how Turing and his picked crew broke the Nazi code and with some well used and specific intelligence at propitious moments we were able to win the war in Europe. Part of that crew is Keira Knightley who wins a battle for feminism to be accepted in this all male bastion. Keira and Ben's scenes have some real emotion to them. He confesses he's gay and she would still like to marry him as fascinated as she is by his sheer intellect. Cumberbatch made the right decision as so many gay men today still make the wrong one. He decides that marriage will just spread the heartache he has in not being able to live openly and proudly with whom he loves. For her role Keira Knightley got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.When different players play the same individual at different stages of life I've thought that some recognition is due. In flashback scenes to Turing's prep school days we see the understated but beautifully played romantic involvement of Alex Lawther as young Turing and Jack Bannon as Christopher Morcum. Those two juveniles are nothing short of magnificent in what they do with the part. Young Morcum's death while still in prep school was a secret heartache he carried for the rest of his life.The Imitation Game got several other Oscar nominations including Best Picture and took home one Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. The saddest thing about Alan Turing is that he's one of a handful of people who ever existed of whom it could be said he bent the course of history and in his life he could receive no recognition for it. In fact we do see what did happen to him post World War II. Now his nation and the world can appreciate him for what he was and what he did.",

            "content": "This movie is supposedly based on a true story, it says so right upfront. So that's a give-away straight off. It's mostly fiction. Set in the wartime Bletchley Park of screenwriter Graham Moore's imagination it's also supposed to be based on the factual account \"Alan Turing: The Enigma\" by Andrew Hodges (you'll see that claim in tiny print right at the end of the closing credits) which relates Turing's life and involvement with the breaking of Enigma. Anyone who has read that book will know that this movie bears little resemblance to that specific book (nor indeed to any other book on the subject), and I would even doubt that anyone involved with this production has actually read it, and that includes Graham Moore. Although names remain as in real life, also bearing little resemblance to reality are the characterisations of most others who were involved in the real events. Some of the main personnel who should have been included are missing, and events have been added that never happened, nor ever could have happened. The scene of the alleged breakthrough in the reading of Enigma traffic is totally absurd, as was the inclusion in the movie of the character of John Cairncross. Yes the latter was at Bletchley, but at a different time and in a different area, and would have been totally divorced from the events covered in this movie. It would seem that at the moment Cumberbatch can do no wrong, and his portrayal of Turing was precisely how the producers wanted him to play it, but it was most definitely nothing like the real Alan Turing whatsoever. And couldn't the producers have picked someone who actually looked like Turing? Likewise a look-alike to play Joan Clarke? As a fictional movie in its own right it was reasonable, but if anyone believes that it's an account of the true events then they'd be advised to do further research on the subject. There's hardly a line in the screenplay which would stand up to scrutiny. It's as false as the movie U-571, and equally as misleading on what really happened.I believe that Turing is one of Moore's heroes. I can only conclude by saying that (imo) he has given him a very unworthy epitaph. Given the service Turing gave to his country, the world, and to science in general, he deserves a much better epitaph than this pot-boiler of a movie.",

            "content": "When I read the Executive Producers were the Weinstein Brothers, I immediately knew the movie will take its creative license beyond reason. I wasn't disappointed at that. \"Based on true events\" doesn't mean anything as probably most have learned by now. Key events in the story line are almost entirely made up. True key events have been completely ignored, and the usual Hollywood political agenda's are on full display. I didn't ask for any personal political insights, I didn't want pay for that.This movie aims directly at promoting homosexuality through emotions. First we are directed to love Turing because of his accomplishment, then we are directed to feel sad for him because he pays a price for being what he is. At the end multiple tear jerking scenes were built in to help you towards that emotional state.The clunky behavior of the genius has been depicted the way it is always depicted: somewhat stuttering, looking at the floor, no sense of humor, not understanding metaphors. All in all, stereotyping and clich\u00e9 galore right here in the very first five minutes he was introduced.Turing finds the code by sheer coincidence more or less we are led to believe. The reality is that just about every story about accidental discoveries have been debunked. Newton's apple, Archimedes bathtub, all are stories which turned out not to be true. These grand discoveries, just like cracking the Enigma Code, have been discovered by hard work and professionalism.Poland discovered the logic behind the Enigma years before the British did. The Germans increased the number of combinations, which made the code more intensive to break. The Polaks ran out of funds to create a better decoding machine and handed over the know-how to Great Britain and France. Turing (and certainly not him alone) improved the machine the Polaks built and which they called \"Bombe\". Not a word about that in the movie off course. Just like in the movie \"Black Hawk Down\", where the crucial role of the Malayan (!) snipers to bail out the Americans has been completely ignored.Also, Turing was never investigated for being a possible spy, nor did he kept knowledge of a spy to himself. He would have played with his life if he did that. He was under investigation for being a gay tho. The scene was also used to connect Turing with MI6 even more, but that was unnecessary; as it turned out in the end, Turing was more than happy to work with MI6 for his own schemes (which is a lie too).The audience will learn nothing about the code itself. Not a clue on how it works (it's not even that hard!), nothing.Code breakers are hired if they could solve crossword or cryptographic puzzles. Needless to say that the smartest person is tardy but gets to participate in the test anyway (clich\u00e9 clich\u00e9), and turns out to be even faster than the great Turing himself! An oh, it's a woman! A completely made up event. Feminism at work in its fullest glory. Acknowledging her intelligence (she really was) is not enough it seems. She had to be the smarter than all men, including Turing. She already worked at Bletchley in reality. And she slapped Turing! Beating men is a sure sign of female strength in the doctrine of many feminists. That too never happened. In reality Joan Clarke was very submissive.Turing supposedly had a say in how to use this machine strategically. He contacted MI6 to scheme with, ignoring his employer. The reality is vice versa: MI6 instructed Turing what to do. Turing had no say. A feeble attempt to make Turing even better than he already was, but the attempt was over the top. I can't imagine the viewer didn't notice.So there it is people. This movie represents blatant promotion of multiple Hollywood agenda's, over-dramatization, over-simplification and factual incorrectness about all key events. This movie represents all that to its fullest.",

            "content": "If you see this picture without prior knowledge of Alan Turing's life, there is some probability that you might like this (otherwise, I can't explain its high ratings here or its raving reviews), but anyone familiar with the life of this remarkable individual will rightly see this movie as a travesty.But first let me put forward some good things to say about this movie: there are some fine production values, there is some fine acting here (especially by Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing) and a good, if flashy direction (by Norway's Morten Tildum). But they all struggle against a worthless screenplay. This is the worst screenplay I have ever seen put into a movie (and I have seen hundreds of movies, having reviewed almost 500 in IMDb). Worthy of a pretentious high school student, it is a mixture of ludicrous melodramatics and historical illiteracy.The movie give us a rough, true outline of Turing's life (brilliant mathematician, computer pioneer, very nerdy personality, helped break Germany's Enigma machine codes during the war, which proved very important in the battle of the Atlantic facing English ships against Germany's submarines, his career crashes dramatically in 1952 when after a burglary in his house police finds he is a homosexual, which was a criminal offense in Britain until 1967, forced by a judge to take hormone therapy in order to avoid prison).But alongside this true outline a lot of falsities are added. Just to mention a few of these falsehoods, without being exhaustive: 1) the movie never tells that it was the Poles before the War who first constructed a machine that was able to break Enigma. Turing and his team (not just him) did build an upgraded machine that was able to crack an upgraded Enigma, 2) Turing's military superiors - personified here by commander Denniston (Charles Dance) \u2013 hate Turing so much that they threaten to fire him, charge him as a spy or destroy his code breaking machine. Turing avoid their threats by appealing directly to Churchill. In reality, Turing did appeal to Churchill successfully for a higher budget for his outfit, but the relationship between him and his immediate superiors was nowhere near as bad as the movie shows, 3) when Turing was arrested after the war for homosexuality, there was never any suspicion by the authorities that he might be a Soviet spy.In the phoniest scene in the movie, Turing and his coworkers decide not to tell their superiors that they have finally cracked Enigma, since they are afraid that if Germany realizes that the code has been broken, they then will switch it to a harder code. This is made despite the tearful pleadings of one of the code breakers whose brother happens to be in a ship about to be taken down by German submarines. Decisions like this were actually made during the war, but they were taken at the highest military and political level, not by the cryptoanalysts.In the most ridiculous scene in the movie: Turing realizes that one of his fellow code breakers, named John Cairncross (played by Allen Leech), is a Soviet spy. He discovers this when he see he has a bible with a passage marked that has been used in a message by a mole. Cairncross tells Turing that if he blows his cover, he will tell Turing's superiors that he is homosexual, and Turing gives in to this blackmail. There was actually a Soviet mole named John Cairncross in Bletchley Park, Britain's wartime code breaking facility, but he never worked alongside Turing, and might never have met him.Turing was a remarkable figure, a scientific genius, a privately tormented person, who also did extremely valuable work during World War II. It is sad that his story is finally brought to screen (after so many decades) through such a terrible movie. The real story of Turing and the decipherment of the Enigma machine can be found in many places, either in books, TV documentaries or in the Internet. I suggest a fine book by Simon Singh called \"The Code Book\".Also with Keira Knightley, who plays a codebreaker who was for a time engaged to Turing - this was actually true.",

Almost every part of this production could have passed as a movie-of-the-week on some major television network.

The secret of Ultra started leaking out in 1967, hardly \"more than half century.\" Decryption of German messages was uneven, to say the least. It required carelessness on the part of users; the Luftwaffe was the worst offender. Since Goering managed to control what should have been ground forces, this gave away army secrets as well.At the movie's end, Turing is summarizing Ultra's contribution. The mention of Ardennes (aka, Battle of the Bulge) makes one wonder what the script writers really know. This was a monumental failure of Allied intelligence. The Axis were now using landlines and Hitler was keeping the operation largely to himself anyway. Ultra's greatest contribution was winning the war against the U-boats if only because this was foundational to all other efforts.",

During the war Turing was part of a team involved in breaking the Enigma Code.The character of Alan Turing tends to pop up in other novels and films usually in the periphery such as the Robert Harris fictional novel Enigma.The real Alan Turing's story had a tragic ending as he was arrested for homosexuality in the 1950s when it was illegal and he committed suicide.Over the years pressure have been placed to rehabilitate Turing's name. There is a road in Manchester named after him, his work in the field of computers and code-breaking in World War 2 eventually led to a posthumous pardon.The Imitation Game cast Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing and right from the early scenes we see our modern day Sherlock playing a genius like he was another Sherlock Holmes. Clever, insufferable, a loner, arrogant.I thought I would let that slide but the script which won the best adapted screenplay Oscar was I am afraid a ham-fisted clunker. It was determined to make the story uninteresting, dull and blah blah blah predictable.It is also probably far away from the actual true story. Just when you thought it was getting better it goes back to its default bad mode.For example when they do crack the code, the team start fighting and arguing and then one of them has a brother who just happens to be on a ship in the Atlantic which might get attacked.Then there is the communist double agent, but hold on there was a double agent in the fictional novel Enigma. It looks like that was added for dramatic effect.Then there is the ludicrous scene where the Commander and his cronies forcibly start to attack the code breaking machine having no idea what it does and wants to go back to manual code breaking when we have been already told that would take millions of years to succeed.It might had helped if it was explained to the audience how the code breaking machine worked.The real Turing also had a stutter which in this film is portrayed as being very mild. I much prefer Derek Jacobi's interpretation of Turing in the play and film, Breaking the Code where the stutter was more pronounced.The film is just clich\u00e9d rubbish and I was genuinely disappointed as to how poor it was. It got nominated for a Best Picture Oscar which is very much undeserved.",

Secondary, the plot was almost identical to every other movie about a genius - Turring was played as unrecognized and an oddball. The plot also felt too smooth edged, all the twists were predictable and the events were too coincidental to be believable. The spy subplot was unnecessary and added nothing to the story. This may sound pedantic, but some parts seemed out of place for the historical setting: the detective's too modern haircut and lines such as \"ohh my gosh\" which really brought me out of the story. Finally, the ending scene was unnecessary and should have cut straight to the ending lines. Speaking of which, the last line inferred that the two things mentioned were linked, but they were in fact months apart. This is an example of the film's unreasonable twisting of facts in order to give the plot and conclusion this type of film needed.

He and others at Bletchley Park were merely the smart folks who used Polish groundbreaking cryptography methods to tackle Enigma. Turing is portrayed here as a hero and the success as solely his, all according to the sneaky writers of The Imitation Game. Did they forget to carry out a proper research or was their mission to undermine Polish part a deliberate thing? Brits often forget about their 2WW allies, ascribing all the war effort success to themselves. But hey, even 'bletchleyparkorg', the official website, says \"The Poles broke Enigma in 1932\"...In 1939 with the invasion on Poland imminent the Poles reached out to Britons for help and thus Bletchley Park became the centre where cryptographers were unscrambling the code.

            "content": "I am astonished at the rave reviews this film is getting and depressed  at how many people will now go through life with their impression of  Alan Turing and code breaking at Bletchley \"informed\" by this film.  The plot is drivel. If you take this film at face value you will leave  believing that Turing was single-handedly responsible for just about  everything at Bletchley including the original idea for the Bombe  machine not to mention constructing it on his own in a barn,  recruitment of staff, the first breaking of any Enigma traffic, the  idea of using known words to crack messages, making strategic decisions  about whether or not to save trans-Atlantic convoys and countless other  things.  Most of the film is just nonsense. There is no way that Turing would  have been in a position to decide not to save the convoy (or even know  that there was one to save). He wasn't responsible for the idea of  using standard text in messages as ways into the Enigma settings (which  had been done since before the war). The construction of the Bombe  machines was a huge exercise involving a team of technicians and parts  supplied by external manufacturers, not Turing wiring it up alone in a  barn in his shirt-sleeves. It wasn't actually even his idea; the idea  of using a machine was brought to him by Dilly Knox from pre-war ideas  worked up by a Polish team. Nor could the machine spit out deciphered  messages after a couple of minutes. Turing wasn't in charge either, he  didn't come up with ideas of using crosswords to find recruits and he  wasn't alone in writing to Churchill; several of them signed the  letter. Oh yes, and there were several women code-breakers at  Bletchley.  The screenplay is also riddled with anachronisms, which just add to the  sense of \"Oh this is ridiculous\" throughout the film. No way would a  well brought up young lady in the 1940s say \"Oh my God!\" three times in  as many minutes. There are too many others to recall or mention.  Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the cast are excellent in their  roles with the material they are given (hence two stars rather than  one) but that cannot save what is ultimately a very disappointing film.  This is not a biopic of Turing, which is how it is presented, but a  nonsensical made up story tacked on to a heavy-handed political point  about homosexuality, which we all got without the banner at the end.

            "content": "When I first watched it, I thought it was pretty good. Then, I read the book upon which it was supposedly based and was fairly surprised in a negative way. Aside from the names being the same, the screenplay seems to have taken a left turn into fantasy and fiction. 1. Hugh Alexander would never have punched Alan Turing and did not have cause to punch him. 2. Alan never called the descrambling machine \"Christopher\".3. Turing's boss, Denniston, was not actively trying to get rid of him -- that would have been pretty insane of him to even try, given the value of Alan's intellectual genius. 4. It was not a case of Alan's smart approach versus everyone else's stupid, brute force approach -- that's fairly insulting to the rest of the cryptanalytic group who were generally extremely bright and talented as well. 5. Alan did *not* take over leadership of the cryptanalytic group from Hugh Alexander -- interestingly, Hugh, due to his superior management and people skills, eventually took over the group from Alan (which was probably for the best, since Alan was not really suited to head the department). So the idea of Alan taking over the group from Hugh was a complete and utter fiction.6. Although Alan liked to work alone and, in that sense, was a loner, socially, he was fairly gregarious and had numerous friends and friendly acquaintances. This is, of course, quite different from the movie/screenplay, which rather depicts as a guy with fairly poor social skills and a bit of a loner.I realize that a screenplay, can, at best, be a condensed version of the book. But, in this case, it looks to me like the screenwriter butchered the story. Basically, the screenwriter copied the names and a few facts and then constructed an elaborate fiction which bears little/no resemblance to what actually happened. And this makes me suspect that the screenwriter may have simply skimmed the original book, instead of actually reading it. The screenplay is just so off and so inaccurate, it's laughably wrong.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game is half a historical movie that takes place in the agency side of WWII and half a biography of Alan Turing. The movie introduces with a mission that sets up a plan of building a technology to crack a code while the rest is basically a study of what kind of a man Turing truly is. While both sides are quite gripping in its own distinct interest, the movie rather picks some conventional choices in its storytelling, making it sort of underwhelming and predictable, but its skilled direction and a terrific performance by Benedict Cumberbatch surpasses that fact, thankfully made most of it worth it.The first hour focuses on how they would break the Enigma code, while it teases some flashbacks where Turing learned his encoding skills. It normally tells this story as a mission out of luck, with a team who are only given little chance to succeed. But there is some sense of complexity on their task, like how the government doubts their promise, or how difficult for Turing to get along with his colleagues, etc. And it structures these scenes pretty well, but how the film resolves each of these events does often feel breezy. The next step of the story is the persecution of Turing's sexuality, which completely shifts the theme. It went from an argument of never underestimating one's capabilities in spite of his alienated attitude, to a sentiment about being tolerant with homosexuals. Both of them tell a good message, but the last one just randomly becomes the entire center of the film.It just lacks enough concentration, the movie just moves and changes too soon before it actually becomes engaging. Fortunately, it's still a decently crafted film. The pacing is consistently handled, there is also a strong production work. Looking around the structure is simply stunning. The actors did what they have to do, the best of them is obviously Cumberbatch who instantly makes the character interesting while you may also get connected with his eventual personal troubles. He's backed up well with Matthew Goode and Keira Knightley, even though there isn't much about their characters, same with other solid supporting like Mark Strong and Charles Dance who are mostly at the background.The Imitation Game still holds a fascinating story which remains itself as a good film. It just needs more depth; it needs more breathing for suspense at their mission, as well as it needs more exploration at the sudden shift of Turing's deeper character study. The film just easily jumps into the conventional celebration of the man's work and its effects to the war. But even with all of the contrivance, it's still easy to follow how this historical moment happened, even though its storytelling is not as groundbreaking as Turing's achievement. But to be sure, it clearly didn't rob enough of what makes it interesting.",

            "content": "First off, the historical revisionism is testament to the pure and brazen ignorance of the production crew and lack of an historical adviser when this went into production, with the almost terrifyingly obtuse view to making a film that follows the cheap tried and tested Hollywood formula that we've all witnessed a hundred times already.From the paper boy waving a paper saying bombs were about to be dropped in '1939', to god only knows how many facets of fantasy created out of a well documented Turing's life, and I can't remember accurately right now but I think they even mentioned Churchill as being Prime Minister in 1939 which is untrue, this film was an exercise in inaccuracies.These inaccuracies I was quite prepared to forgive until I started witnessing the exact same structure of film as I would be expected to see in a comic book film. We introduce an antagonist who causes great conflict, we already know our protagonist who is a victimised target of bullies and the entire world is out to shoot him down but he must overcome great odds to beat a much more powerful enemy. We even witness the classic buddy moment where our heroes at their lowest ebb have a motivational coming together of understanding and mutual respect where their bond of friendship gives them renewed vigour and hope, and not least of all, the power to overcome their great enemy, 'The Commander'. Not to mention of course that this film even managed to chuck a twist into the mix as well. Sure, it wouldn't be a Hollywood style film without a twist now would it? Add a couple of scenes that are so fake it'll make your head spin and you've got your film, e.g. 'his brother just happens to be on that exact boat!!??' Good grief, give me a break.This sickened me to the core of my being. Can film makers really not appreciate that people have more intelligence than that of a wombat. I'm starting to feel like a zombie whose soul reason in life is to watch the same generic film again and again and again with the odd good film thrown in like a needle in a hundred haystacks. Originality isn't even worth speculating about anymore, it's a myth that died a death with cuchulainn. It was such a bad ploy to create this absolute ass of a character and then have us empathise with him because the world is against him. It doesn't even try to speculate that he might bring it on himself. 'Just get the damn audience to EMPATHISE' said the director, I presume. There isn't much in the way of character here, he's an ass, played very well by Cumberbatch who can do no wrong at the moment it seems, but very one dimensional a character nonetheless, Oh yes, they try to get him to change and get along with everyone which he does, but just so we could have our great comic book buddy scene where the evil 'Commander' is put in his place until the next episode of Turing and Friends when the Commander tries to destroy the world with his next fiendish plot.And what was with all the gay apologies at the end? I thought this film was about Enigma. I use the phrase 'about Enigma' quite quite loosely here since this film had very little resemblance to reality. But almost all the blurbs were about him being gay, and other gays and how they were mistreated. I'm sorry, was this film not about Enigma? Clearly not, they must have been afraid that people wouldn't want to see a film about a gay man? Looks that way.So yea, I was disappointed with this, just didn't care about the main character, too much empathy mining was going on here. Not to mention the ridiculously simplistic way in which they supposedly cracked the code. But like I've said, dumbed down cinema for easy digestion.",

            "content": "In 1951, two cops called Nock (Rory Kinnear) and Staehl (Tom Goodman) , investigate mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) following an apparent break-in at his home. During an interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. In 1927, young Turing, unfortunately bullied at boarding school, develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but later on , things go wrong . When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston (Charles Dance) , he joins the brilliant cryptography team formed by Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross Allen Leech , Peter Hilton (Matthew Beard) , Keith Furman (Goodman) and Charles Richards (Jack Tarlton), who attempt to decrypt the Enigma machine that the Nazis use to send coded messages. The true enigma was the man who cracked the code . Behind every code is an enigma .Unlock the secret, win the war .An enjoyable biopic based on the real life story of legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing, the movie portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his expert team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II. Main cast and support cast are frankly well . Main starring Benedict Cumberbatch is terrific along with Kiera Knightley . They are well accompanied by a very good support cast as Matthew Goode , Rory Kinnear , Allen Leech , Matthew Beard , Charles Dance and Mark Strong playing Stewart Menzies, who is the basis for Ian Fleming 's boss \"M\" in James Bond series . It contains a rousing and sensitive musical score by Alexandre Desplat . As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Oscar Faura . The motion picture was well directed by Morten Tyldum .Adding more remarks to his biography , these are as follows: Alan Mathison Turing (1912 - 7 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. In fact , Winston Churchill stated that the Bletchley Park codebreakers made the single greatest contribution in Britain's war effort. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it's hard to estimate what effect Ultra intelligence had on the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. However , Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that \"gross indecency\" was a criminal offence in the UK , as he accepted chemical castration treatment to avoid prison punishment .

Alan Turing's life is interesting enough not to have to resort to making things up.The following are, in my opinion, some of the more egregious inaccuracies (taken from Wikipedia):Naming the Enigma-breaking machine \"Christopher\" after Turing's childhood friend and suggesting that Turing was the only cryptographer working on it with others not helping or opposed. In actuality, this electromechanical machine was called 'Victory' and it was a collaborative, not individual, effort. It was a British Bombe machine, which was partly inspired by a design by the Polish cryptanalyst Marian Rejewski. Rejewski designed a machine in 1938 called bomba kryptologiczna which exploited a weakness in German operating procedures that was corrected in 1940. A new machine with a different strategy was designed by Turing (with a key contribution from mathematician Gordon Welchman, unmentioned in the film) in 1940. More than 200 British Bombes were built under the supervision of Harold Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company.Showing a scene where the Hut 8 team decides not to use broken codes to stop a German raid on a convoy that the brother of one of the code breakers (Peter Hilton) is serving on, in order to hide the fact they have broken the code. In reality, Hilton had no such brother, and decisions about when and whether to use data from Ultra intelligence were made at much higher administrative levels.The depiction of the recruitment of Joan Clarke as a result of an examination after solving a crossword puzzle in a newspaper. In reality Joan Clarke was recruited by her former academic supervisor, Gordon Welchman, to the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)Exaggerating Turing's social difficulties to the point of depicting him having Asperger syndrome or otherwise being on the autism spectrum. While a few writers and researchers have tried to assign such a retrospective diagnosis to Turing,[106] and it is true that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film \u2013 an intellectual snob with no friends, no sense of how to work cooperatively with others, and no understanding of humour \u2013 bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing, who had friends, was viewed as having a sense of humour, and had good working relationships with his colleagues.Scenes about Turing's childhood friend, including the manner in which Turing learned of Morcom's illness and death.Suggesting that the chemical castration that Turing was forced to undergo made him unable to think clearly or do any work. Despite physical weakness and changes in Turing's body including gynecomastia, at that time he was doing innovative work on mathematical biology, inspired by the very changes his body was undergoing due to chemical castration.Stating outright that Turing committed suicide after a year of hormone treatment. In reality, the nature of Turing's death is a matter of considerable debate. The chemical castration period ended fourteen months before his death. The official inquest into his death ruled that he had committed suicide by consuming a cyanide-laced apple. Turing biographer Andrew Hodges believes the death was indeed a suicide, re-enacting the poisoned apple from Snow White, Turing's favourite fairy tale, with some deliberate ambiguity included to permit Turing's mother to interpret it as an accident. However Jack Copeland, an editor of volumes of Turing's work and Director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing, has suggested that Turing's death may have been accidental, caused by the cyanide fumes produced by an experiment in his spare room, and that the coroner's investigation was poorly conducted.Showing Turing interacting with Stewart Menzies, head of the British Secret Intelligence Service. There are no records showing they interacted at all during Turing's time at Bletchley Park.Including an espionage subplot involving Turing working with John Cairncross. Turing and Cairncross worked in different areas of Bletchley Park and there is no evidence they ever met.[88][89] Historian Von Tunzelmann was angered by this subplot (which suggests that Turing was for a while blackmailed into not revealing Cairncross as a spy lest his homosexuality be revealed), writing that \"Creative licence is one thing, but slandering a great man's reputation \u2013 while buying into the nasty 1950s prejudice that gay men automatically constituted a security risk \u2013 is quite another.\"",

I don't like how the script is structured (it intersperses flashbacks to his childhood and to a post-war time near his death in the mid-50s). The filmmaking is very pedestrian.",

I'm a theoretical computer scientist, so somebody who does work in a very related area that was founded by Turing's work (use it almost daily). For a film that boasts that it is \"based on a true story\", it is a travesty to portray such a well- documented persons' life and the events related to this movie so inaccurately. The liberties taken by the film are so dishonest that nobody should use this as a factual story. Turing wasn't so simple to lay out, his papers are a testament to this. If you want to get to know the actual story, get the actual biography the film is based off of, or even better (like I do), read his actual papers. I own most of them myself in collections from the 40's-50's.Go into this film to enjoy the acting, DO NOT use this as a real- true story tale. It has been demonstrated to be very inaccurate from the history of the Enigma to overshadowing Turing's most important contributions with emotional pleas that Turing held more as self-convictions than anything. He was a brilliant scientist, but this film just was so annoying as the inaccuracies got in the way.To make this blunt: This is the Patch Adams to films about mathematics and war. Totally inaccurate.I give it 1/10 because the acting is great, for what they're attempting to do. Truth-telling makes or breaks it for me, a computer scientist. If you're a young computer scientist or interested in this subject, get a more reliable source. Not this film.",

            "content": "It's becoming annoying that movies nowadays are based so much on the artistic part rather than delivering a message and telling a compelling story to the audiences so that after you watch the movie you'll say \"it was worth it!\". This movie is no exception from what I wrote above, here's why:The Science: In a movie about the invention of the first computer, you have to be scientifically authentic and I mean to use scientific terms or at least try to explain to the audiences what the hell is Enigma? In this movie Enigma is as enigmatic as the tesseract in MCU... The only moment when there's actually a hint of science is the scene between Alan and Joan where Alan tries to explain enigma to her but that scene makes Alan look like an idiot.. I mean a guy who knows so much about decrypting codes should sound like a guy trying to speak on understandable terms even though he might struggle with that due to the fact that he knows so many scientific things... Benedict tries so hard and I appreciate his effort but the writers are to blame here for a lame and hollywoodized script.The story. I don't know the actual historical facts but the way the characters are presented to us make them unbearable and way too clich\u00e9d. I couldn't care less for Alan who's story was just used only to gave the actor playing him a great performance in order to win the Oscar. The scene at the end where he is shown to have hormonal problems is supposed to make us care for him? Why didn't they developed that early in the movie so that his character had a reason for being this way. Remember when biography movies told us from the beginning that the main character had a problem that made us care for him and even start the plot (see King's Speech) , while here the protagonist's problem is thrown in the movie at the end like \"Hey! Here's Alan's problem and you should care for him!\" disgusting... There are tons of examples of great performances within movies that have great story and make you care for the characters and for what happens in the story. Take for example Colin Firth's performance in the King's Speech. That movie actually had a compelling story that made you care for the main character's problem, while here is just a display of Benedict's and Kera's acting. This movie's story has so many clich\u00e9s, even more than Spider-man 3 I should say and here are some examples: A girl is ridiculously smart and finishes the test so fast it just points to her BING! There's the hot smart girl in this movie. The only way to make her more clich\u00e9d I guess was to write a note on her forehead saying \"This is the hot and clever chick in this movie and she'll have a relationship with the main protagonist!\" Anyway moving on... Alan is being bullied like a high school kid for being to clever, this is worse than Tobey's Peter in Spider-man(at least that movie had a compelling story and a fantastic heart to it)... I could go on like this but there's a word limit.The music: Bland and typical Alexandre Dumas... although his score for Godzilla was way more epic and inspiring than this garbage which by the way gets nominated for Oscar, while the other score doesn't even gets nominated for an Oscar. Surprise? Just another soundtrack made to please the Oscars. There are tons of great soundtracks that didn't get nominated for Oscar and are way better than this sh*t. This just shows that not everything that is nominated for Oscars means is the best there is out there. This movie is again, no exception.To sum up my review: This is a typically Hollywood \"trying to impress and win Oscars\" movie that has no heart and no clever or intriguing plot. I rated this movie with 1, since it can't be compared with biography masterpieces like The King's Speech for example or Rush. This movie's real rating should be around 6-7 probably more towards 7, but with IMDb's rating system and with all the so called \"critics\" here, this movie's rating inflated to 8.1, which is even higher than The King's Speech.",

            "content": "A cursory read of Alan Turing's biography proves that the basic points of this film are factual. That some details have been tinkered with for cinematic appeal is possible. Turing was historically significant because he built a computer that broke the Nazi code, which helped win WWII. The script blends these events with Turing's personal life.Despite his genius brain, Turing nevertheless suffered as a gay man in a homophobic era, which brought loneliness and run-ins with the cops. With acquaintances he could be socially awkward, eccentric, arrogant, and humorously quirky.The script's non-linear structure makes for difficult viewing at times. Constant flashbacks to, and returns from, three different eras in Turing's life render unnecessary confusion. The first half is a bit boring, but drama picks up in the second half. The script conveys a realistic view of Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). Most of the supporting characters come across as a bit nebulous.Appropriate for the historical era, the film uses 35mm format wherein grain structure is obvious. In Turing's later years, desaturated colors dominate, to convey a gray, sad tone; brighter colors and more contrast highlight his younger years. B&W archival clips show actual WWII scenes. Editing and production design compliment the cinematography. The nondescript piano score is okay but too loud in some scenes. Overall casting and acting are acceptable; Cumberbatch gives a credible performance.Significant historical content and release dates suggest that the producers intended for \"The Imitation Game\" to be Oscar bait. The film is a recent addition to a list of culturally relevant films meant to confer on Hollywood a sense of legitimacy. Fine film aside, Hollywood's motives here reek of self-congratulatory prestige.",

The movie also takes place in 1927 with Alan as a student and Christopher Morcom as his only friend and love. In 1951, police detective Robert Nock (Rory Kinnear) investigates Alan for being a Soviet spy but discovers that he's only guilty of homosexuality.The first half of the movie is a rather traditional historical drama. Cumberbatch is impeccable. Knightley is too much of a starlet. Of course, Denniston is a military blowhard. Turing's homosexuality is limited. It all has the feel of a sanitized docudrama. Then the movie starts landing some solid punches. I love the Hugh Alexander character. Alan and Christopher's relationship is pretty compelling. There is nothing physical but they do use the word love. Menzies is another great character. Alan's confession to detective Nock is riveting and poignant. It's missing his suicide scene.

However Keira Knightley the most wooden of modern stars fails in every way to convince me of any chemistry on any level with her co star and playing a crossword genius even faster than Turing i almost laughed. I actually did laugh at some of the stilted dialogue that came out of the actors lips, poor Mark Strong seemed saddled with very the worst. Then there was the films stuttering format as it traversed three time periods, i thought these supposed insights added nothing to the film which should of contained itself to the events at Blechley Park and no more. Other big weaknesses were flat direction, poor period detail, poor character development and a all to rushed narrative of world war 2. In short,average in every way and rather poor history.

How, frinstance, it is possible that these super-geniuses (along with their supervisors) can't understand the importance of keeping their successful code-breaking a secret from the enemy? And as if they wouldn't had discussed about the matter since the day one? On top of the above mentioned, and while Benedict Cumberbatch acts flawlessly, the main character's totally alienating obscurity and antisocial manners made me utterly uninterested about his endeavours. Not to mention his homosexuality which demolished all the excitement and affection of his relationship with Keira Knightley too.

Perhaps conscious of this by the time the Oscars came about the film and the buzz about it seemed too have disappeared slightly even though on the big night it picked up one of the more prestigious awards for best adapted screenplay . I did have reservations before I watched THE IMITATION GAME . Alan Turing was of course a homosexual in an era when homosexuality was outlawed so I jumped to the conclusion we'd be watching some grief whoring PC bio-pic where the subtext gets all shouty and ranting that see how a nasty society treated a gay man who defeated Nazi Germany single handed . On top of that as ENIGMA showed from a few years back the premise doesn't lend itself to cinematic storytelling and despite being a work of fiction with a James Bond subplot shoehorned in that particular film ended up being very boring so I didn't have any great hopes for TIG What the film does superbly is painting Turing as an uber-geeky eccentric outsider . I've no idea what the real Alan Turing was like as a person but as the stereotypical view of a genius who knows the square root of everything while knowing nothing about social interaction Cumberbatch is vey good here . He was in the running as the eleventh DOCTOR WHO and watching him here you get the taste of what he'd be like as an alien genius in a performance that never seems forced in anyway . What the screenplay deserves great credit for is that any unpopularity wartime Britain had for Turing wasn't down to a homophobic society but entirely down to Turing lacking any social tools and the possibility that he might be a Soviet double agent when the Soviets still had a neutrality pact with Nazi Germany . Turing's homosexuality is addressed of course but this is a small part of the story . Best of all the film explains the impossible task of breaking Nazi codes that in theory would take 20,000 years Where the film does fall down is in overstatement . Breaking the enigma codes was only a very small factor in the defeat of Nazi Germany and quite often the allied leadership had to ignore the information since they didn't want to the Nazis to realise their codes had been broken . That said the one campaign of the war that terrified Winston Churchill was the U-boat campaign so this is valid . What possibly isn't so valid is the overdone clash between the enigma team and Denniston . Again I've got to put my hand up and say I haven't researched the real life story but people on this page claim to have and this is entirely fictional . I tend to agree and much of this interaction doesn't ring true and seems to be included to have an obstacle in the way of the protagonist .There is of course the constant criticism of nearly British film you've seen in the last couple of decades and that is the look of the production seems more in keeping with high budget television than cinema I found myself enjoying THE IMITATION GAME more than I expected . It has a strong cast on top of their game and the story which on paper doesn't seem all that interesting did hold my attention . That said one gets the feeling that much of this is done by playing hard and loose with facts to make a better film and John Ford was always saying \"Print the legend\". Treat it as entertainment rather than a fly on the wall documentary and you won't go wrong",

Churchill thought so.But, the trouble is, you see, Alan Turing was a homosexual. And the British Government (like many today did not like homosexuals). Homosexuals in the post war years were lepers of society. So the British Government chemically castrated him.Alan Turing was most likely also a sufferer of Aspergers Syndrome.He was, in every sense of the word, a genius.He was not a likable man because to make real, substantial change sometimes eschews popularity. He was not popular.It's a dream role for an actor of substance. That actor is Benedict Cumberbatch.At the time of writing Cumberbatch has seven movies in production, new episodes of the BBC's Sherlock and a couple of episodes of The Hollow Crown as Richard III as work in progress. It would seem reasonable to assume from this that he is a man in demand.Why?Because he is a brilliant actor. And this is his time. This is most certainly his movie. Yes, he has good support from Keira Knightley, Allen Leech, Matthew Goode and especially Mark Strong, as his 'boss'. Charles Dance moves on from his movie idol roles into the baddie spotlight and carries it off effortlessly. But make no mistake.

I have to admit, I went into this movie not knowing anything about Alan Turing and Enigma, but I love movies based on true events; especially those about the history of our country. Despite not knowing anything about Mr. Turing or the events of his life, as soon as I left the movie theater, I went home and looked him up and spent the next few hours learning of his life, everything he did for this country and the invention of what we now call 'the computer'.I want to start by saying that Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie is outstanding. He plays Alan Turing perfectly; his accent, his movements and just the way he plays the character on screen is beautiful. I can honestly say that this is the performance of his career! The movie focuses on different aspects of his life: it shows him and his team trying to break Enigma, it shows Young Turing during his time at boarding school, and the events after the war. There's a quote at the beginning of the movie: \"are you paying attention?\". Throughout the movie, that's what I did. It's all that I could do because the story and the acting kept my eyes glued to the screen and I couldn't take them away. It's emotional, it's exciting and it is truly heartbreaking in some moments. It was a very comedic movie, too. There were some scenes that had me in fits of laughter and that's what makes it a beautiful script; despite the movie being based on the darkest days of World War 2, they added comedy into it which brought the movie alive. I remember getting home and after researching Alan's life, I wanted to go back to the cinema and watch the movie again. It's rarely that happens to me but when this comes out in November, I will be straight to the cinema and purchasing a ticket to watch it. I've heard reviewers mentioning that this film doesn't focus enough on Turing's homosexuality. Now, be that as it may, it focus' enough on the subject. Remember: this movie is about his mind, about the man himself. He was a genius! This is the best British movie that I've saw in a long time, and it's probably one of the best movies that I've ever had the pleasure of watching, period. I would recommend going to watch this movie when it comes out because it will take you into the world of Mr. Turing and the struggles and successes he made in his short life.",

The film then flashes back to Alan's childhood in 1927 where he is a young boy who is given a code cracking book from his friend Christopher, a romantic friendship is formed between the two boys until the day Christopher doesn't come back to school. 1939 World War II, Alan travels to Bletchley Park, where, working under Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards. The team are trying to crack the ciphers the Enigma machine uses, the Nazis use Enigma daily to send out orders but every night at midnight the code changes its the teams job to decipher these codes giving the allies the much needed break they require to get ahead in this war. Alan is a real pain to work with and despises his colleagues who feel exactly the same toward him. He works alone designing the machine that will decipher Enigma. Alan approaches Denniston to fund construction of the machine but is denied, Alan not giving in decides he will go to the top and writes to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who then puts him Alan in charge of the team and also gives the funds to finish the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and to find their replacements puts a really difficult crossword in newspapers. Joan Clarke, surpasses all expectations and ends up on the team but due to her parents other arrangement about her newly found employment need to be arranged. Unfortunately in 1952 Alan is disgraced and sent to prison for the most disgusting reason imaginable I will not give away here...The story of Alan Turing and how he and his machine broke the unbreakable code was a real let down for me, Once the credits began to roll the only things going through my head was what I would have done differently had I directed the film myself, I really expected so much more and I'm more than surprised that such an amazing event in history was dealt with so placidly. According to the biography the film was based on a lot of the film was \"pampered\" to make it a lot more glamorous than it was in reality especially the relation between Alan and his fianc\u00e9 Joan, Alan as a human was a lot more than the mad scientist as portrayed but I don't think that was the actors fault more the direction he was given. So if you take away the truth of the film and facts you are left with something that is somewhat entertaining for at least half an hour. In all things though there are the bad and there is the good what was fantastic about the film was the actors, I personally feel they did an amazing job. Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek, Sherlock) plays Alan Turing and he did a brilliant job at bringing his character to life, apparently the family of the real Alan Turing were amazed at how well Benedict portrayed their family member which really says a lot in my book. Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean saga, Domino) plays Joan Clarke, Matthew Goode who also wrote the screenplay (Match point, Watchmen) plays Hugh Alexander, Allen Leech (Downton Abbey, Rome) plays John Cairncross, Matthew Beard (One Day, The Riot Club) plays Peter Hilton and Charles Dance (Dracula Untold, Game of Thrones) plays Commander Denniston. I think without all these amazing actors this film would have failed in what it delivered. Morten Tyldum (Headhunters, Fallen Angels) directed the film and for me I can't help feeling if the film was directed by someone with a lot more experience and know how would have delivered a five star film. One thing he did do right though was using Alexandre Desplat to organise the soundtrack and score for the film, the other amazing aspect of the film.The Imitation Game was long and at times boring due to drab scenes and a very disorientated time line, there was a very important part of Alan's life that was only slightly touched, I'm not saying the film had to be LGBT themed but if that's who the man was then surely the film should have had a lot more about who he was emotionally and not just mentally.",

            "content": "Benedict Cumberbatch is codebreaker Alan Turing in \"The Imitation Game,\" a 2014 film based on the true story of Alan Turing, a mathematical genius and the father of the modern computer.The first review on this site complained that the movie is historically inaccurate. Most biopics and films about famous events are historically inaccurate. Films say, \"Based on a true story,\" not \"an absolute factual true story.\" Events are moved or telescoped, characters are combined, etc. because it's a movie, not a book that lists facts. The idea is to become interested in the subject and go home and read about it.Detractors of this film, some of whom haven't seen it, state over and over that the Poles broke the Enigma code. This has nothing to do with the movie. The Poles broke the code, but NO ONE HAD EVER BROKEN THE German NAVAL CODE. Turing built his machine -- which looked like the one in the film, by the way, to break that code. You'll notice that everything discussed had to do with vessels, convoys, ships, etc. \"The Imitation Game\" is not about a machine. Also World War II, being one of our larger wars, was certainly not won by one man, but by the work of many, including the early work of the Poles, who are honored at Bletchley Park just as Alan Turing is honored.This is the story of literally a tortured genius, isolated, very much in his own head, antisocial, but a man who believed in his own abilities. He goes to work trying to break the German code; the codes are reset daily, which means if you can't break the code in a day, all your work is for nothing, and the next day, you start over. The idea was to get the code broken in a matter of minutes instead of hours using the machine.Turing is not easily accepted by his coworkers (Matthew Goode, Allen Leech, Matthew Beard) but gets along well with Joan (Keira Knightley), who urges him to be a little friendlier because \"you're going to need \"all the help you can get.\" They have to fight to continue their work, since it's not happening fast enough for the government.It's been said Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of a brilliant eccentric well, but this character is the complete opposite of Sherlock, though their minds might work similarly. It's a passionate, intense performance. He is perfect as the socially inept Turing, a true nerd, a bullied schoolboy who had but one friend growing up. His portrayal is heartbreaking.Let's hope we've improved as a people and, because of sexual proclivities are less likely to crucify someone who has made a tremendous contribution to the world. Genius takes many forms, and as Turing's friend Christopher says, \"Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.\"",

            "content": "Few injustices in the world have equalled that meted out to Alan Turing. Where would the world be today without him? He can justly be considered to be the father of modern computing, and yet as a homosexual he was prosecuted for gross indecency, chemically castrated and his genius thrown away by a seemingly uncaring and ungrateful nation that drove him to early suicide. (God bless Her Majesty, for giving Turing an official posthumous pardon last Christmas).Such is the distressing true(ish) story told in \"The Imitation Game\" starring the omnipresent Benedict Cumberbatch. The film largely centres on his contribution to the war effort at Bletchley Park in decrypting encoded German communications through the Enigma machine \u2013 a fearsomely complex device for randomising messages. I say \"true(ish)\" since having done a bit more digging into the background on this, the Imitation Game is not quite the story it purports to be. There is a muttered line by Cumberbatch about the \"contribution of the Poles\", but in reality it seems that the early Enigma machines were actually first cracked by some of the leading Polish mathematicians (notably Jerzy Rozycki, Henryk Zygalski and Marian Rejewski). The Bletchley Park team only came in to assist when the German's added a new layer of complexity to the machines. Never let the facts get in the way of a good story though: this simplification of the story probably helps a lot.Turing is portrayed \u2013 no doubt fairly accurately \u2013 as a spiky, anti-social and generally unlikable individual, despised by his co-workers until such time as his genius starts to earn him respect. His comrade in the Bletchley Park branch of 'Asperger's Anonymous' is the equally spiky mathematician Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), who he recognises an intellectual kin-ship with. Their rather unorthodox relationship, given his sexual orientation, forms another key element of the film.Flashing backwards and forwards (without warning) between three time periods: Turing's unhappy school-days; the Bletchley Park war years; and his dogged pursuit by a 50's cop (Rory Kinnear), a story that you might expect to be a fairly dry biopic zips along with enormous vim. Whilst this is a film that many critics will turn their noses up at as a 'crowd-pleaser', you can guarantee that it is one that will make the BBC Bank Holiday film schedules regularly for the next 50 years! On the acting side, the cast is excellent. Cumberbatch must be a strong candidate for at least a BAFTA if not an Oscar for his portrayal of Turing. There must always have been a danger with this casting of him flipping into \"Sherlock\" mode, given the similarity of the characters, and yet you rarely equate the two performances which is quite a trick to pull off. Knightley is also excellent in a 'terribly British' role. Charles Dance, Mark Strong (a 'goody' for once!) and Downton's Allen Leech all deliver excellent supporting performances. But particularly effective is Matthew Goode (\"A Single Man\", \"Stoker\" but perhaps best known to TV viewers as Finn Polmar in \"The Good Wife\") who is a magnetic big-screen performer and who should be getting more leading actor roles.Also outstanding is young Alex Lawther as Turing the schoolboy who delivers a memorable performance in a challenging role bringing to mind the screen presence of Haley Joel Osment in \"The Sixth Sense\": a young man to watch for the future.The decidedly non-English director is Norwegian-born Morten Tyldum, who directed the outstandingly black but entertaining \"Headhunters\" back in 2011.Also likely for BAFTA recognition is the Art Direction in this film (Production Design by Maria Djurkovic), which paints a nicely nostalgic vision of war-time Britain, and the costume design by Sammy Sheldon. The effective music score is once again by Alexandre Desplat \u2013 - does that man ever sleep? By the way, the title \u2013 \"The Imitation Game\" \u2013 comes from a famous paper that Turing wrote in 1950 and refers to what is now known as the \"Turing Test\" \u2013 the test to see if a user can distinguish whether the 'person' they are communicating with is human or machine. (This has a nice double meaning in the film given that Turing is imitating being a heterosexual for legal reasons). In many ways in chronicling the history of gay rights in the UK, this film makes a nice 'prequel' to another of this year's great films \"Pride\" \u2013 whilst Turing's prosecution for gross indecency was in 1952, the last public prosecution of this type was in 1967 with Pride being set only 18 years later. We live in more civilised times, thank God.You can tell that we are rapidly approaching the awards season again by the quality of the films on offer. This is a great watch, particularly for a slightly more mature audience that values acting, story and emotion over bangs and special effects. Highly recommended.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my archive of previous reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up for future notifications. Thanks).",

The film so subtly presses all the right buttons--tortured main character whose ailment (likely Asperger's) is never specified but is very current and topical; incredulous supporting characters who are eventually won over; triumph against long odds; tragic coda--that you will only later realize that you've seen this all before. It's called The Hollywood Movie.There's nothing wrong with Hollywood film, if that is what interests you. Director Morten Tyldum isn't Hollywood, but the writer Graham Moore sure is (10 Things I Hate About You). In any case, the film's tight crafting leaves you no room to breathe.

Without the work of the Poles (which they handed over on the brink of the German invasion) the Bletchely crew was unlikely to have been able to make headway, and certainly not in time for it to be useful.In any case, Turing's most important work (compared to which Bletchley pales) is his seminal work on computability theory.

The old press adage \"never let the facts get in the way of a good story\" doesn't even apply here as the story, as told in the film, is the most complete and utter tosh from start to finish.Anyone with even the most cursory knowledge of what went on at Bletchley Park and Turing's part in it should be infuriated with the raft of inaccuracies presented as fact here and the frankly ludicrous supposition that Turing would have told anything at all about his work there to a rookie detective.Special mention should go to the scenery-chewing performance of Charles Dance as Alastair Denniston, leading his band of Military Police thugs to destroy the Bombe (hand-built by Turing on his own at Bletchley and lovingly named 'Christoper' by him, according to this film, but in reality built in Letchworth by a large team which included Gordon Welchman, Oliver Lawn and chief engineer Harold Keen and actually called Victory.) Denniston was undoubtedly somewhat antagonistic towards his motley team of code-breakers, but this portrayal - no offence to Mr. Dance - is so over the top as to be laughable. Yes, the acting is good, given the drivel that is the script, but I finished the film furious at the injustice done both to the people shown and to those shamefully airbrushed out.As others have said, there are amazing stories to be told, both about Bletchley Park and about the life of Alan Turing and there are many excellent books, including Sinclair McKay's 'The Secret Life Of Bletchely Park', which tell a much more accurate and, in my view, engrossing tale than this appalling travesty. Do yourself a favour and read them rather than watching this steaming pile of ordure.What finally persuaded me to write this review was overhearing a conversation in a diner in Brooklyn where someone who had just seen the film was describing it to his dining partner with these words \"And this guy, this Turing, single-handedly saved the lives of millions of people despite being persecuted and blackmailed for being a fag.\" Way to go, film-makers.",

That's a lot of balls to juggle at once * of the three this was the most engrossing. Add to that fact that, of the three, this was only non-original story (I have seen other bios of Truring) so that leaves us with a paradox -- how can the least original be the most interesting? * the answer of course goes back to basics. Writing and acting. The writing is sharp, and it stays that way. The acting is to die for. Cumberbatch throws his Holmes mojo out the window and creates a Truring so memorable it will, I think, become the definitive one.

This year's holiday movie season has presented us with three very different war-based films - each a potential Oscar contender, and each with its own life lesson. Norwegian director Morten Tyldum (the excellent Headhunters, 2011) brings Andrew Hodges' biographical book to the screen in the form of the remarkable and true story of Alan Turing, the man credited by many (including Winston Churchill) for helping win WWII.Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician and cryptoanalyst. He was also homosexual. Celebrated for his work in helping Great Britain crack the German's \"Enigma\" messages, he was also persecuted (through chemical castration) for his homosexuality. His suicide at age 41 (1954) was the likely result of his \"treatment\" during an era when such \"unacceptable\" behavior overshadowed any and all mental genius.The film utilizes Turing's 1951 police interrogation by a sympathetic and curious detective (Rory Kinnear) as a framing device for the three significant time periods of his life. We see Turing as a bullied schoolboy (played by Alex Lawther) discovering the early signs of his own brilliance, as well as his first love. Most significantly, we witness Turing's work with the Hut 8 team at Bletchley Park as they worked on complex code-breaking; and finally we see the remnants of a broken man, bathed in solitude and work, who has no real place in society.Benedict Cumberbatch gives an astounding performance as Alan Turing. We cannot take our eyes off of him, despite his Asperger's-type social awkwardness. Cumberbatch manages to expertly capture each extreme emotion that befalls Turing, not the least of which is the frustration of the genius, when lesser minds are unable to follow his vision. Some of the best scenes are of Turing's confrontations with a Royal Navy Commander (perfectly played by Charles Dance), and of course, the critical moments with the other members of his code-breaking team (including Matthew Goode and Keira Knightley).There are so many aspects to Turing's story: his impact on ending the war, how society treats true genius, his isolated childhood and final years, the extreme lack of civil rights for homosexuals of the time, and how his work on \"Christopher\" led to the development of computers. The second half of the film certainly presents the moral quandary, and the performance of Cumberbatch as a tortured genius overpowers any clich\u00e9s that might creep in. Alexandre Desplat's piano and strings score is a nice compliment without ever becoming overbearing, and the use of actual war newsreels adds just enough reminder of what the mission was for this group of geeks (today's terminology).",

The sequences of young Turing at boarding school are well done with Alex Cawther making the teenage Turing sympathetic, and Keira Knightley puts in a good performance as Turing's temporary fianc\u00e9e.But this is Benedict Cumberbatch's film.

            "content": "This film is highly recommended.This year we have witnessed the rebirth of the bio-pic, films that are based on real life people and their \"based-on-a-true\" story genre. Most have been very sincere and earnest undertakings, telling those life stories with varying results from the superb to the overwrought. The Imitation Game falls into the former category and is one of the best films of the year. In Morten Tyldum's film, we follow the life of British mathematician and genius Alan Turing, a major force who, along with a team of similarly-minded decoders from Bletchley Park, help to end WWII by decrypting the Germans' top-secret messages called the Enigma Code. This hero fall from grace is the crux of this history lesson and makes for some powerful drama. That Turing also suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, stressing odd behavioral tics, strange mannerisms, and distancing him from others, plus carrying with him an illegal love that dare not speak its name, this solemn character has more than his share of hardships to overcome. That he is played by the resourceful and talented Benedict Cumberbatch only makes the film all the more watchable. Cumberbatch gives an astonishing performance. The actor zeroes in on his character's eccentricities in his stammers and hesitated speech patterns. His down-turned look and sudden glances add to Turing's many foibles in the most subtle of ways. Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, a smart no-nonsense British working girl who befriends Alan makes him become more human. Knightley brings an authenticity and poignancy to her role. Their final heartbreaking scene together has so much more impact due to their natural chemistry together and the nuanced acting choices these gifted performers bring to these two mismatched loving friends. The entire ensemble deserve kudos for their fine support: Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Allan Leech, Matthew Beard, Charles Dance (a perfect foe), and Mark Strong. Alex Lawther as a young Alan Turing and Jack Bannon as his friend, Christopher round out this glorious cast.Director Tyldum crafts a fine film and keeps the exposition to a minimum with effective use of war montages to visualize the era. He paces the film well and builds tension with the emotional and numerical parameters that are set within the limited technology that these crypt-analysts dealt with on a daily basis.The literate screenplay by Graham Moore tells its story without pandering to its audience. It expects moviegoers to pay attention to the quick-witted dialog and clever exchanges between all of its well drawn characters. The film structure bounces from Turing's childhood to his life after the war and the time-line becomes a tad disconcerting. Alan's private illicit life appears to be downplayed as to be non-existent, a decision that contradicts the film's tragic ending.The Imitation Game is a timeless and engrossing film that shows the dedication and sacrifice of one man's obsession to do the right thing when all the wrong things finally overwhelm and destroy his own life. Turing's final days will always remain an enigma to the world, that a man who gave so much of himself was given so little respect and love in return. At least this film is a well deserved testament to a great man. GRADE: A-",

Finally, before the true code story was finished -- namely how he helped them ingeniously use the information from the code breaking to help the war effort without tipping off the Nazi's that they'd broken the code is simply stated as an afterthought. He had a huge part in that and it was dropped so we had to go back to the police investigation that eventually led to his needless torment and his sad suicide (which also was referenced).

            "content": "Biopics have become so commonplace today that they often lack the prestige they carried 10-20 years ago. So when one stands out, it deserves an extra bit of recognition and praise, and \"The Imitation Game\" is one such film, commanded by a fascinating performance from Benedict Cumberbatch.The \"Sherlock\" and \"Star Trek: Into Darkness\" star plays mathematician Alan Turing, the wrongfully disgraced father of the modern day computer and a war hero, the extent of which remained classified until the '90s. Turing was a total genius and a recluse, whom many theorize may have had some degree of Asperger's syndrome. However, his reputation was marred most for being a convicted homosexual, as private sexual acts between men were deemed criminal in England until the late '60s.Turing shares many traits with the character that shot Cumberbatch to fame, Sherlock Holmes, another savant-like character devoid of social manners who puts work ahead of relationships. The difference, however, is the BBC series employs those quirks for kicks, whereas \"The Imitation Game\" is a thoughtfully constructed portrait of a deeply misunderstood individual.Although the film opens with Turing's arrest in 1951, it uses this to frame the core of the story \u2013 Turing's work for British Intelligence during World War II, when he helped crack the German Enigma code and swing the balance of the war into the Allies' favor. It also flashes back to Turing's schoolboy days, which help to explain more of his behavior during his time at Bletchley trying to build a machine to decrypt the Enigma messages.The beautiful thing about Cumberbatch's performance is that it's multi-dimensional \u2013 we see Turing's social struggles, his genius, his unlikable qualities and his tenderness. His performance generates a powerful empathy and understanding of who Turing was and how he struggled through the world and his life. These characteristics live in balance, without any exaggeration. Neither his social \"quirks\" nor his sexuality define this portrayal, yet they are crucial to it.Cumberbatch might be the primary focus, but he doesn't tower over the supporting cast, which includes strong performances from Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Charles Dance (\"Game of Thrones\") and especially Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, Turing's closest friend whose intelligence in ways dwarfed his own. Joan could've easily been reduced to very little, but Knightley gets good stuff to work with and as always, she brings strength and independence to her character.Still, the film's crowning achievement is Cumberbatch's performance, though much credit for his success in the role belongs to rookie screenwriter Graham Moore, who carefully selects the moments that best encompass Turing's multi-faceted identity and ultimately help us to understand him. And of course director Morten Tyldum deserves props for really giving Cumberbatch the time and space to thrive.\"The Imitation Game\" is also rather impressively paced for a biopic. At two hours long, it rarely drags, nicely interweaving the 1951 arrest story line with the main code-breaking plot and the flashbacks. Perhaps this credit belongs to the fact that Tyldum (\"Headhunters\") established himself as a director by making thrillers and editor William Goldenberg (\"Argo,\" \"Zero Dark Thirty\") has made his career on similarly suspenseful films.The only place \"Imitation Game\" seems to trip up a bit is thematically. Its notions of humans vs. machines as it relates to Turing are a little bold and don't quite land the way Moore intends, but the portrayal of Turing has enough emotional resonance to carry the film from simply being very good and missing something to excellent.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Thankfully, Knightley gives us a better performance than she has done for some time, though, some dialogue could have been better formulated. I might also quibble with the less than believable hat-less and cap-less characters at times - Charles Dance's luminous white bonce should often have been under a hat and, there should have been more Brylcream in evidence. But, hey, this is a really engaging film. Motives, scenes and quotes quite likely filched from other stories are used to set the scene - and set the scene they really do.

            "content": "This is the story of Allen Turing, who really existed. He is the mathematical genius who was engaged to try to break the German code \"Enigma\" during World War II. He is autistic and humorless, totally insensitive, with no regard for social interaction. He is driven by the task at hand and feels other things are superfluous. He is also under the gun from a commandeer who he insulted and who would love to be rid of him. Had his colleagues not reluctantly come to his aid when he was under attack, he would never have been able to do the work he did. He has one other problem. He is homosexual and at this time this is illegal and would get him drummed out of service and probably imprisoned. There are flashbacks of his youth, made horrible by his peers. It shows his relationship with Christopher, a boy whom he loves, the one person who gives him his due and his respect. Something terrible occurs after a school vacation, and Alan is left alone. The acting is quite incredible. Benedict Cumberbatch is turning into a major actor (to the chagrin of the \"Sherlock\" fans). Keira Knightly does a nice job as the female foil, who even agrees to marriage with Alan (although it is utterly doomed by his own admission). One of the stars is an amazing computer that Alan puts his life and heart into, designed to break the aforementioned code. It spins and clicks. For many, this was the first real modern computer (for all you abacus fans, I don't mean to be disrespectful). This is the story of another genius (keep in mind the current film about Stephen Hawking) who experiences heartbreak at every turn, whose peers hate but tolerate him. It's the story of a society that devalues a man because of the way he was born, that dismisses his accomplishments. There are two really emotional scenes. One is when he throws himself in front of his computer (which is named after his friend Christopher) as the military Philistines start to destroy it. And a scene with the headmaster of his school when Alan must say he barely knew the boy whom he loved. See this. One of the best films of 2014.",

            "content": "This is one remarkable movie.Yes, the story of the breaking of the enigma machine codes is a fascinating one, though, as one reviewer points out, this movie really doesn't get into the details of how that was achieved - details that most of us, myself included, could probably not have understood. And the tale of Turing, the man who led the team that cracked Enigma and thereby helped to save millions of lives by bringing WW II to an earlier end but then was persecuted under England's anti-gay laws, is a truly sad one. Again, though, it appears that the movie fabricates some details to make the tale particularly moving. But neither of those two historical events makes this the remarkable movie that it most certainly is.Rather, it's the same stuff that has made for great movies from the beginning: 1) a brilliant script that never plays down to the audience, but always keeps us interested 2) first-rate directing that knows how to bring such a script to effective life 3) first-rate acting that makes us forget we are watching actors and makes us believe we are watching real people going through real situations.This movie held my interest from the beginning and never let it go. I feel safe in recommending it to anyone who enjoys a really good movie.I see that some of the reviews on here talk about the differences between Turing and the breaking of the Enigma codes as presented in this movie and the historical truth. That's interesting, certainly, because this movie very much makes us want to know more about both, but it has nothing to do with the quality of this feature film. If I may make an extreme comparison, the real Medieval prince of Denmark, son of King Hamlet, bore very little resemblance to Shakespeare's masterful creation, yet we don't fault the play *Hamlet* because of that. This movie, like Shakespeare's play, takes aspects of certain historical events and characters and creates a remarkable and deeply moving story from them. It never pretends to be a documentary, and therefore should not be faulted for not being historically accurate.At the recommendation of one of the other reviewers on here, I have since watched the BBC TV movie *Breaking the Code* (1996) about Turing. Again the script is very good, and the performance by the actor who portrays Turing, Derek Jacobi, first rate. The presentations of Turing are VERY different, however. Jacobi's Turing is far less anti-social, and the BBC movie centers far more on the persecution of Turing for his homosexuality in the 1950s than on the breaking of the codes during the war. The presentation of Turing is far more sympathetic. I confess that I found *The Imitation Game* to be more engaging, however. Since Milos Forman's *Amadeus* was on TV the other night, I was also reminded of how similar the framing device in *The Imitation Game* is to the one used in that masterpiece. Once again the body of the movie consists of developments of scenes mentioned by the main character to an interrogator (a police man, a confessing priest) through whose reactions to the unfolding story we are given a key as to how to perceive it ourselves. The police interrogator's face, at the end, when he says that he cannot pass judgment on what Turing has told him reminded me of the thoroughly devastated priest who is left speechless after hearing Salieri's presentation of his battle with God.",

            "content": "If you know nothing about Alan Turing or the history of Bletchley Park, or you think \"World War II\" was a sequel to \"World War\", I suppose you might enjoy this film. However, if you are at all familiar with the history of Enigma or the life of Turing, my advice would be to give this an even wider berth than that nonsense with Dougray Scott.Why Hollywood thinks that the Enigma story is so dull that they have to dress it up this way is beyond me. I laughed out loud several times, and not at anything funny. The script piles clich\u00e9 on clich\u00e9 and I found the whole experience embarrassing and rather offensive. Alan Turing was a complex and difficult individual, but here he is reduced to a comical cardboard cut-out. Charles Dance chewing the scenery as a ridiculous caricature of Alistair Denniston, an even more ludicrous villain than Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham, was too much to bear.I couldn't think what \"The Imitation Game\" reminded me of for several hours, until I realized it was the inspired 1980s Comic Strip spoof \"The Strike\", in which a miner's memoire of the 1984 miners' strike is bastardized by a Hollywood studio for \"dramatic effect\", with Al Pacino parachuted in as union leader Arthur Scargill. Sadly, \"The Imitation Game\" didn't set out to be a spoof, though the end result is as much a biopic of Alan Turing as \"Carry on Cleo\" is a biopic of Julius Caesar.There is a reason why Enigma is not on sale on DVD in the gift shop at Bletchley Park. I can't imagine they are in a great rush to clear space on the shelves for The Imitation Game either.",

The whole opening, voice over narrating is just a brilliant way to get the audience to pay attention to the film. I like how the movie really challenge you to think. If you don't want to think, then the movie tells you to bugger off. It has some balls. The Imitation Game is a historical thriller film directed by Morten Tyldum, with a screenplay by Graham Moore loosely based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges. The movie is about British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), whom during World War 2, was trying to crack the Nazi Germany's Enigma code to help the Allies win the war. Without spoiling too much of it. The movie is indeed, Oscar baiting. It's bad and good. It has everything that the Oscars tend to like and want. First off, it's a periodic piece during World War 2 about a loose-cannon homosexuality genius, who might have some mental problems. This will clever help or hurt the film, as time goes on. Indeed, the film engrossing closer and closer to Oscar-caliber and would look so generic, because of those reasons. The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, and its shows why he deserve to be a leading man. He really makes this part, his own. He delivered in every way in his acting. The supporting cast was just as good. This is one of the very few, Keira Knightley's films, that I can stand her. She was pretty good as Joan Clarke. Another good actor in the film, had to be Mark Strong as Sir Stewart Menzies. He was just wicked. Allen Leech as John Cairncross was amazing to watch. He had this presence in him that make the character very charming, even with the deep dark secrets, he hiding from everybody else. The movie framing was also well establish. You really get what year, the movie is trying to portray, when the film jump from one year to the other. Each flashbacks works within the story structure and you can easily tell them apart. In terms of historical accuracy, there was some criticism from other critics regarding the film's purported downplaying Alan Turing's homosexuality. I agree that the war effect should be the main focus of the film, but I disagree on them that the sub-plot of Alan Turing's homosexuality problems is overtaking the main plot of the high stakes game of life and death of solving of Enigma concept. It didn't undermined it, at all. I think, they downplay it enough, so that the main focus on the film is about the war effect than his homosexuality. Yes, the movie has a lot of twist and turns, like a secret Soviet double agent in their midst of solving the Enigma code, but it's in the small scale. It wasn't until, the Enigma problem was solve, that the movie then focus on moral questions and Turing's sexuality. I like how the movie has a ticking time bomb. You really can sense, the pressure and need of them, to solve this problem. It was well balanced. While the broad outline of Turing's life as depicted in the film is true, a number of historians have stated that elements within it represent distortions of what actually happened, especially in terms of Turing's work. First off, the movie gives way too much credit for him. Progress was actually made way before he join in 1939 and to say, that everybody was against his computer plan was an understatement. About Turing's social difficulties. He never had Asperger syndrome or seem near in the autism spectrum. He was very well-fit, physical and mentally. He got along with most of his colleagues in the colleges, he was teaching before and after the Bletchley Park project. With his co-workers in Hut 8. They say that he was very well-spoken and often jokes when there is free time. This is not coming from a small group of people. By the time of 1945, thousands of people were working on the project. Not only that, he work for a time with American scientists in Ohio and Washington on their coding problems. To think, that Alan Turing was in-closed from the world is understatement. About the fact, that he name the Enigma-breaking machine \"Christopher\" in the film after Turing's childhood friend is very false. In actuality, the machine was widely known as the Bombe. It was originally designed in 1938 by Marian Rejewski, who along with other Polish cryptographers had had successes in decrypting Enigma messages during the 1930s. It wasn't anything new when Turing took over the machine. He just redesigned and made it effective. I can understand, why the writers didn't mention the real life setbacks after the codebreaking of Enigma, to highly the Hut 8's moral code about who lives and who dies, but to say that solving Enigma was their only problem isn't true. After solving the code, the Germen often change the design or the use of the German Enigma machines so that the Bletchley Park code breakers had to adapt, more and more as the war went on. In reality, decisions about when and whether to use data from Ultra intelligence were made at much higher administrative levels. About Turing working with John Cairncross. It isn't true. There isn't enough evidence to prove that they ever met. About the nature of Turing's death is a matter of considerable debate. It still a mystery if the suicide was accidental or not. Overall: it's still a pretty good film. It's hard to believe it took these many years for it to be produced. The film's screenplay often topped the annual Black List for best unproduced Hollywood scripts. This film will win Oscars. No doubt about that.",

The film shows various different points of Turing's life: His difficult school life, his triumphs during the war and his conviction for his homosexuality after the war.

His conviction following the war could have been focused on more and Keira Knightly is a bit jarring, but TIG is unshaken by its flaws and emerges a triumphant and deeply moving historical drama. Like many Oscar baiting movies it's all about the acting. Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely outstanding as Turing and as far as I'm concerned he's the best actor Oscar front runner for 2014. Everyone else is good as well, and Keira Knightly isn't totally unbearable. The acting is what makes the film and the film might be less memorable without Benedict, but the other elements of the film are well done too.Although the script uses a line to do with people others think nothing of doing something extraordinary a bit too often, otherwise it's a sensitive, moving and well written character study. All 3 of the parts from Turing's life are very well done. The part about his school life is very powerful and sad; the war part is suspenseful and fascinating while the final part revolving around his decline following the war is incredibly moving. The direction is very good as well and injects the film with real tension and power. TIG is in general told, directed and acted excellently and it's a very interesting and moving film. It's certainly not the feel good film of the year, but it is one of the best films of the year. It also doesn't feel like it's being made just to get awards and doesn't have that off putting Oscar baiting vibe to it. Even better than Nolan's Interstellar, TIG is an extraordinary movie and really deserves to be seen. And the best actor Oscar goes too....9/10",

I know this will get me in trouble, but Tury was not special because he was homosexual and was penalized for this in the last century; as pointed out in big letters at the end of the picture this torture of homosexuals was very common then. And his achievement may well have been due to his Aspergers; but this is not unusual either. Remove all mathematicians in history with Aspergers (which is what we call it now) from society and we'd be living in sheds.

However, he wasn't anywhere near solely responsible for making a machine to break Enigma. And there wasn't just a small clutch of codebreakers at Bletchley Park - the British devoted huge manpower to this crucial effort.The screenwriter added a collection of largely one-dimensional foils for Turing: the cruel patrician supervisor who cared about his pride more than about beating the Nazis; the handsome cad of a chess champion who abused Turing and assaulted his machine; the detective who broke rules to conduct an obsessive investigation into a burglary of Turing's home that just didn't smell right.Perhaps the most jarringly absurd moment came when Enigma had been broken. Immediately, someone assembled a map of all ships and submarines in the North Atlantic or whatever (based on Nazi messages) and one of the codebreakers blurted out that a group of U-boats was only 20 to 30 minutes away from attacking a British convoy. Well, sure - doesn't every mathematician know what speed a U-boat pack makes relative to a ship convoy? And then one codebreaker had his watch-me-act-and-break-your-heart moment, when he realized his brother was aboard one of the boats that would be attacked. (This did not really happen, of course.) Ugh.Cumberbatch led a wonderful cast that pulled all the levers to make the audience feel sympathy, and the production values were terrific. But so much of it felt like a paint-by-number exercise ... it's a pity that a \"realer\" version of Turing's amazing life couldn't have been devised.",

This results in few instances of cinematic inspiration, and too often witty one-liners or snappy conversations \u00e0 la Sherlock Holmes take the spotlight off the subject.It also leans on the crutch of occasional shots of war to retain disinterested viewers, a trope that requires A) competent CGI, and B) a reason to show this. Neither is present here, making these shots seem crammed in, as well as breaking any tension (try to create drama with planes that look animated in the 90s).Cumberbatch is, as per his standard, fairly note-perfect (although I do believe Turing's awkwardness was embellished somewhat), and some of the rest of the ensemble (Rory Kinnear and Charles Dance) do their best to follow suit. I found Keira Knightley to be a bit bland, a crime as much her fault as the script's.Visually it does look good, as these larger-budget period dramas tend to, but I was mostly impressed with the visualisation of Turing's machine than anything else, and little was to be seen of any cinematography outside the norm.All in all, I think the biggest failing of this film was its shying away from tackling Turing's life on a larger scale. The end of Turing is a tragic story, but something that deserves to be told on the big screen.The Imitation Game does a bad job of bringing this issue (and its severity) to light, instead devoting all of its time to the wartime story. This shows not only a failing from the production to honour him properly, but a lack of ambition from those who chose to tell his story.",

This statement is made three times during the film at the most poignant times in it. This is a well crafted film and though the film is essentially based on Alan Turing it doesn't overshadow the fact that Alan Turing cracked the Enigma code with a small team that helped win the war. It is also difficult to imagine that once upon a time in history to be a homosexual was a death sentence and it highlights also that woman were not allowed to go for or to do what was considered a mans job. I go to the cinema to be entertained, thrilled, shocked try and guess the ending to a thriller or to be educated. The film accomplishes most of that; but its the revelation that one of the Worlds greatest mathematicians and greatest minds at the time whose commitment to breaking Enigma and pioneered the modern age of the computer was treated so appalling in the end and it is a story that must be told and it is told here without patronising its audience. And Joan Clarke (played by Kiera Knightley maybe not as convincingly as the rest of the ensemble cast ) highlights just how hard it was for a woman with intelligence and Alan Turing's' vision to establish herself as an equal- Today it is almost incomprehensible that we would treat people with such disdain and so callously because of their sexual orientation or indeed women as badly - although women are still not treated as equal in some quarters-",

Maybe we were on an euphoric high after back to back solid films and our expectations were sky high. I do recognized aspects of it which were exceptional but they couldn't cover what I thought was a very safety glove affair with not much depth, especially for Alan Turing later years. So I didn't want to write anything unless someone does first Benedict Cumberbatch is marvelous to watch. In all his noteworthy roles, he plays these savant type characters with a serious lack of social etiquette coupled with arrogance. Here he essentially plays the same but with a difference - he is a human computer with a secret. His brilliant performance rightfully deserves an Oscar nomination.I like how the story is framed and with added context from his childhood years. But as most biopics go, this one doesn't set the genre alight. The plot simply plays it too obvious and the central focus is held tightly only on the human calculator, so much so that all the rest of the characters feel peripheral. At times, because of the homosexual secret and the reverence for Turing, the story seems to play it too safe. For instance, I find Turing later years nearing his suicide feel too vague and everything feels so touch and go. I mean I don't need to see Turing having sex, but it would help to illustrate vividly the shameful period in English history when homosexuality is a terrible crime and how these 'criminals' are inhumanely treated by the government is worst than the homosexual act itself.",

This life story of Turing is shown in three parts, swinging backwards and forwards.

Anybody that knows the true story concerning Cairncross knows that this interaction with Turing is a load of fiction.

Do they have so little confidence in themselves to assume they couldn't make it a worthwhile script without embellishing it with fiction? I do understand that a movie has to take a few creative liberties to more compellingly tell a real-life story about a mathematician. But I can't bear this much rewriting of history in a movie labeled as biopic!I'll start with the things I liked: In preparation I watched a Youtube video explaining how enigma machines actually worked and how the code got cracked. I think a basic understanding of that makes the movie more enjoyable. The epiphany scene was actually my favorite one. It was also interesting to get a glimpse of wartime life in Britain but they shouldn't have bothered with the cheap looking CGI war machines.Cumberbatch does act outstandingly which is no surprise as he already had mastered the role of a sharp genius in Sherlock. Keira Knightley was fine but I don't think the script allowed for her to really shine. However, I read that Turning's whole autistic persona was exaggerated, which I again blame on the script. Probably to fit the awkward genius Hollywood trope? This makes me question: What else is untruthful in this movie?Well, as far as we know there were no Soviet double agents in Alan Turing's team. Also, his team was not in cahoots with MI6 to decide which decoded Nazi plans should be stopped and which ones not (as it would be a dead giveaway that they had cracked enigma).All of that was made up so that the movie could have a bit of drama in the middle. They used a police interrogation as a framing device to bridge the 7 years after the war but it felt out of place. And the real story of Turning actually had a sad enough ending as it is, without making him a possible traitor. The government-mandated hormone therapy to \"treat\" his homosexuality was likely the reason for his depression and ultimately his suicide. At least the movie shows respect for some facts.",

When I was six I bought a book on cyphers and the first thing you learn is to search for recurring letters and words.

But the best thing about the film, is Benedict Cumberbatch, who portrays Turing, without missing a beat. 'The Imitation Game' Synopsis: During World War II, mathematician Alan Turing tries to crack the enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians.'The Imitation Game' engages you at most times, but a slowly paced first-hour, does get to you after a point. The sequences in the film's not-so-happening first-hour, hardly offer much power.

Morten Tyldum's Direction is dignified. He has handled this important biopic, with style. \u00d3scar Faura's Cinematography is sharp. William Goldenberg's Editing offers quality. Production Design is outstanding. Performance-Wise: Cumberbatch is pure genius, a fearless, versatile actor! He delivers an unforgettable turn as the late mathematical god.

            "content": "The Imitation Game concerns Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), an often unsung but wholly important figure of World War II, who worked as one of several code-breakers for Britain's secret Government Code and Cypher School. The men were a gaggle of mathematicians and linguists, who spent hours evaluating secret naval messages sent by the German's Enigma-software. Over three-thousand codes were sent through Enigma a day, and despite pervasive, around-the-clock work, the code was deemed \"unbreakable.\" The Imitation Game follows Turing, an humble but ambitious man who worked to construct a machine to decode Enigma, as well as Turing's frequently abusive childhood, his relationship with Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), a fellow-codebreaker, his other group members, and his personal recognition of his own homosexuality in a time when homosexuals were being charged with gross indecency.Alan Turing's story may be largely unknown by many people, but at least he has the honor of being played by Benedict Cumberbatch, one of the finest leading male actors working today. Much like his work in the now forgotten Fifth Estate last year, Cumberbatch is the stitching that holds The Imitation Game together, and makes the film more interesting than a film about code-breaking would suggest. He is meticulous in his portrayal of Turing, right down to mimicking his anxiousness and his often antisocial behavior, which would lead to him creating the Turing-Machine. Cumberbatch has always been an intriguing actor simply because he is eloquent and unpredictable in how he wants to approach the characters he plays, yet consistent in being a convincing screen-presence.Cumberbatch's acting ability is so strong he often distracts from some of The Imitation Game's lesser elements, such as the rather formulaic structure of the film, which cycles through flashbacks to tell stories in a vaguely disjointed manner. The film suffers from occasionally telling a remarkable story with either an indifference to the narrative structure or a foreseeable chronological timeline. Admittedly, however, screenwriter Graham Moore has quite the challenge at hand with The Imitation Game, as the material here isn't compelling in the traditional sense, and it's hard to concoct a great deal of suspense from a gaggle of guys trying to solve a cryptic message in one specific location. Because of this, Moore wisely decides to invite intrigue into the story rather than suspense, providing background to how Turing and company did their work and the meticulous process involved with cracking even a basic German message.In addition, The Imitation Game proves it's more of a thought-provoking, contemplative picture than anything when it shows off some of the year's most lackluster CGI in some of its action sequences. It's hard to place too much of an emphasis on the quality of the film's special effects, being that, again, the film is more about revealing the nature of the job of a code-cracker than anything else. However, the film features CGI that begs to be validated, as it almost looks as if the film was modeling itself after sequences taken from films over a decade old.Once again, though, it doesn't matter, for most people who will see The Imitation Game won't even bat an eye; they'll be too busy being completely amazed and captivated by the work of Cumberbatch and his ability to take a strange, off-kilter, but genius character and turn him into a human being through just a couple of scenes. Cumberbatch establishes Turing as not just an incredible man, but as a human, insecure, vulnerable, and unsure of himself when it comes to anything that doesn't involve his ability to create in just a few sequences, making most of the film centered on him and his issues for almost the entirety of its runtime. For an actor to not only be the foundation of a film, but the reason for the film's exceptional quality almost all around, sharing much of the glory with Moore, who competently structures the film around Turing as a human and works to make the film about the mystery of cracking the code, is quite the achievement.Starring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, and Charles Dance.

Armed with one of the most intelligent scripts of the year, he has managed to convey all the forces that lived inside a very special human being, Mr. Alan Turing. He was the man who for whatever circumstances, was able to understand the laws of logic, math, and strategy, in order to solve a riddle that would lead to saving many human lives and ending one of the worst catastrophes civilizations has endured.Recruited by a secret organization, Turing and a team set out to solve a complex set of codes that will allow England and the allies to stop the Nazis. It is a challenging task, and it appears impossible because of the laws of probability. There are just too many possible combinations. Turing, however, is a brilliant mathematician, and with the support of his team, and the invention of what many would consider the first computer, he makes enough advances to give the allies an upper hand. That is not enough because of the complexity of the matter, but he might have been a key element in ending the war.It is a world of secrets, and this motif evident throughout the film, as everything around the project is secretive. Some people know bits and pieces, and even those who supposedly know everything, are only allowed to reveal bits because otherwise, events might turn out differently. The bosses manipulate secrets to get results, the members of the team know enough to destroy each other, and most importantly, if one of these secrets came out at the wrong moment, the results could be catastrophic.In the end, the main secret comes out, and what results is one of the biggest tragedies that could have happened to the civilized world for a life is destroyed, a man who saved many others with his passion and his drive, and his skills. For years he lived in self-imposed darkness, aware of his limitations and living in fear, and when he is finally exposed, he gives up the personal. At the end, he's recognized for his achievements and \"pardoned\", but there is a concluding and ironic note of sadness because the civilization he struggled to save is the one that destroyed him.Cumberbatch carries the film, giving a raw portrayal of a moment torn by his own frustrations, a man who is good, can't truly fight he knows and fears, who in spite of his constant turmoil, puts others ahead of him. Yes, he is arrogant and knows he's special, but he is still a human being, and this shows. It is a difficult role and an amazing transformation. One that doesn't need vanity psychodrama or tricky egotistical trips. Life is complex, hard, and way more interesting than anything than can be written as fiction.",

Alan Turing, a socially-handicapped Cambridge professor and legitimate genius, led a team of brilliant mathematicians whose mission was to crack the code and win the war. The Imitation Game is sure to become a classic in the coming years, as it's one of the best biopics you will ever see.Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's Sherlock) knocks it out of the park with his highest profile leading role to date. He earned an academy award nomination for his focused, at times funny, sympathetic, and tragic portrayal of Alan Turing. The Cambridge professor may have gone on to become the father of computer science, but that doesn't mean he was easy to get along with, or even likable. His unconventional methods and behavior drew the ire of his fellow mathematicians, in addition to the stern and intimidating Commander Dennison (Charles Dance, Game of Thrones). Eventually, he tempers his arrogance and wins over his colleagues (the commander excluded), who (contrary to his initial belief) provide invaluable assistance in breaking the Nazi code and winning the war. Turing's time at Bletchley Park is fraught with conspiracy, agonizing decisions, betrayals, secrets, and the end of his story is sure to leave the audience legitimately heartbroken.To give each member of the supporting cast individual praise would take up too much space in this review, but it's safe to say that all cast members, especially Turing and his friends/colleagues, have excellent chemistry and are each given ample time to shine. Aside from Charles Dance, the most notable supporting roles come from Allen Leech (Downton Abbey) and Kiera Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean). Leech nails his first major film role as John Cairncross, a mathematician on Turing's team who shows his loyalty to him right off the bat and sympathy for his struggles. The feisty Joan Clarke is seemingly the best of both worlds (a genius and socially adept), but Knightley's portrayal, while delightful, may not quite convince the audience she had a double first in mathematics at Cambridge.Despite covering a complex and intellectual topic, the film gracefully glides between the main story and two other plots. Thanks to its Oscar-nominated editing, The Imitation Game keeps audiences equally invested in the main story, Turing's troubled time at boarding school, and when he's under investigation for \"indecency\" (the term used when homosexuality was illegal) a few years after the end of World War II.The Imitation Game is possibly the best film of 2014. 10/10",

That is historical bunkum. The truth is that the machine he invented, which was called the Bombe, was an electromechanical device that was created to crack the Enigma codes, which indeed it did, but the far more complicated Lorenz codes were cracked by Colossus, which really was an electronic computer, and was far superior to the Bombes, and it was it that was the true precursor to the modern computer, It was invented by Tommy Flowers, whose genius surpassed that of Alan Turing, because he managed it without access to an actual Lorenz machine, unlike Turing who was provided with an Enigma machine. Flowers just worked out how the Lorenz worked from a 4000- character mistake made by a German operator. Enter 'bombe and Colossus' into Google and read the Wikipedia article to get the facts straight. Turing had some input into the Colossus machine (ultimately there were ten of them at Bletchley), but to pretend that he was all-important in the winning of the war is an overwrought notion of events wilfully twisted to make a point consistent with fashionable present-day propaganda. We would have won the war without Turing; with most of the world against him Hitler's over-reached lusts were unsustainable; and there were other people of genius. Victory might have taken longer and killed many fewer people, although we cannot know that for sure despite the claim made in this film , but there were many clever minds and strategies from many people that gave the Allies victory (the invention of radar, is one of many examples). If any one person at Bletchley is to be singled out above all others it should be Tommy Flowers, not Alan Turing. Turing was a genius and valuable, yes, but Flowers surpassed him. But Hollywood cannot make out of him a politically-correct song-and-dance-act to the tune of current ephemeral memes.",

            "content": "Not many people knew who Alan Turing was, other than the fact that he was the father of modern computing and related artificial intelligence. As a biopic centered on Turing's crucial years, The Imitation Game is a stirring film behind his genius and why he remained an unsung World War II hero until recently.Set between 1939 and 1945, but flanked by plot arcs set in the early 1920s and 1950s, Norwegian director Morten Tyldum gives us a glimpse into three phases in Turing's life, where each phase reveals a little more about who he was, what he did, and how he helped end World War II by as early as four years. The central aspect has Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) working with British Intelligence as a code breaker in London's Bletchley Park, the UK's Government Code and Cypher School. His job is to break and decipher what the Allies referred to as the unbreakable Enigma Code \u2013 Germany's highly encrypted radio transmissions that allowed the Nazi war machine superior naval and aerial assault on vulnerable Allied positions. Assigned to a small group of code breakers including one female, Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightley), Turing is initially an outcast due to his reclusive and eccentric nature. With time running out, Turing eventually finds favour in his MI6 supervising officer Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong) whose connections with Prime Minister Winston Churchill lands him enough resources to build a machine that has half a chance at breaking the Enigma code.That World War II ended in Allied victory is retrospective of the final push between the Allied forces and Hitler's Third Reich. While cinema history is studded with countless war and action films encompassing this era, The Imitation Game, on the other hand, is not a war film and not a single bullet is fired by any of the characters. It is still a period piece and one that had to be told for at least two important reasons. In adapting from mathematician Andre Hodges' 1983 book Alan Turing: The Enigma, Debut screenwriter Graham Moore saves these reasons for the final thirty minutes of the story, thus limiting the story to a mere countdown spy-thriller, albeit well told in the hands of the director. After saving as many as 14 million lives, why wasn't Alan Turing a decorated hero? What were the real reasons leading up to his eventual suicide in 1954? And why was his memory granted posthumous honour but only in 2013? The answers are there, some of them shocking, but a little too late in the film which itself is about a story that is told a little too late.Understandably, Turing's work within the supposedly non-existent MI6 was classified until recently. The fact that this film was made after the declassification of his contribution makes sense. That being said, the final reveal feels restrained and panders towards social commentary rather than taking the time to venerate a war hero. But if you overlook flaws in the story, including a hokey 'Eureka' scene when they finally break the code, The Imitation Game is still a good film with several tense moments; one of which is the juncture the team arrives at when they break the code. It's a startling moment in the film literally illustrating the power of knowledge as godly.Thematically similar to the Academy Award winning A Beautiful Mind, with as many glowing reviews and the possibility of a parallel Oscar run, I conquer that The Imitation Game is well made and very well acted for a period piece. Cumberbatch anchors his role with absolute virtuoso in portraying Turing as an unlikable and egotistical individual with superior intelligence, while ultimately exposing his vulnerability as a misunderstood introvert. Together with Knightley, they make formidable pairing depicting interpersonal relationships that are equally charming and tragic. It is indeed a tragic story considering what Turing could have achieved for humanity, only to be utterly disregarded by what is supposedly modern civilization.",

It has a very powerful story that is told in the deep and serious tone that it should be, I honestly never knew about Alan Turing before I saw this, but after watching it I think everyone else should, he is a brave man who saved millions of lives and dosen't receive the credit he deserves, there should be documentaries about him, he should be on history books. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers the performance of his career in this, I've always been a fan of him but I never expected to see him act as stunning as he does here, every line of dialogue he blurts is powerful and you can tell he really means it, hopefully he will get more great roles like this in the future. Dramatic and uplifting, the Imitation Game is an outstanding film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good biography film or drama. Alan Turing, a mathematician, tries to break the enigma code with the assistance of several other gifted mathematicians in order to shorten the Second World War. Best Performance: Benedict Cumberbatch",

            "content": "World War II wasn't won on the battlefields but on the field of intelligence as information was the nerve of the war to the point the Allies not only needed German information but to let false ones leak from \"spies\" or arrests in order to mislead the Axis. Secret as well as human intelligence were involved but WWII allowed a third form of intelligence to rise.When Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is applying to a job in Bletchey Park, things don't go as well as expected, his commander Denniston (Charles Dance) opens the door, ready to throw this cocky self-absorbed prick away, Turing utters one word: Enigma, and Denniston closes the door. And I was enthralled already by the premise because Enigma was probably the only name I remembered from a 2000's documentary series about how the world war was (really won) and I knew Enigma was beaten by the ancestor of our modern computers.I'm a math buff and a real nerd who loves crosswords and plays on words, so I could relate to Turing who took Enigma as an intellectual challenge, on which millions of lives were pending. The Germans had made a machine that could encrypt codes made of complex and apparently random sequences of letters and with a new coding system each day, which makes a combination of billions and billions of possibilities to work on every day and after midnight, having to get back from scratch, over and over again. Even by hiring people working on different codes without stopping, day and night, the amount of time required to break the codes would be counted in millenniums.Alan Turing leads team that includes a champion chess player Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) and later, a crossword prodigy Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), but only he knew it would more than human minds to break Enigma, his project was to create an artificial intelligence, a universal machine to do the job at faster speed than human brain, imitating our brains process, our maybe improving them. The film chronicles the process that allowed him to get to decrypt the code and while it works on the thriller level, there's more to appreciate, \"The Imitation Game\" is not just a study on math and information but on fascinating man who finally gets his long overdue recognition.While striking as an individualistic snob, Alan Turing gets progressively more complex as we get hints of his past experiences with bullying and a growing childhood romance that leaves no doubt about Turing's sexuality. In fact, it is very fascinating that his passion for cryptography came from the 'I love you' messages he sent to his friend, as if math wasn't just a passion, but an area of total freedom, a mirror of personal truth where he could express himself to the fullest. He had made math his own world, but only with the value of team-working, he could overcome the obstacles, including the patronizingly antagonistic attitude of Denniston.But I didn't care much for these 'dramatic' bits that, while not unbelievable, were not worthy of such a complex personality, I doubt that Denniston could really order to destroy the machine or if he submitted that deadline. The film also suffers from similarly doubtful moments: I couldn't believe Joan Clarke wouldn't want to join the team, I mean didn't a MI6 official tell them that they were serving the country? She was just contemptibly dismissed by a nosy clerk who took her for a secretary and now, she wouldn't take part to a project because her parents thought it wasn't correct? The film didn't need these moments, Turing's story was enough good material.I must admit I was first perplex about the part involving his sexuality but it became apparent that this was a part of Turing's life that couldn't be overlooked because it highlighted the tragedy of a man who saved millions of peoples' lives but never got the credit he deserved, on the contrary, he faced a public indignity because of a sexual scandal, which indirectly lead him to suicide. That a man who saved people, who should be seen as a benefactor of humanity, had his legacy ignored for years made me realize two things: math are too abstract and people believe what they see, virtually, Turning saved people but no one could materialize it, to measure up the glory of his work.There's a magnificent moment where the code is broken and when his friend is ready to jump at a phone and prevent a ship bombing, Turing stops him. If they change the course of the war right now, Nazis will immediately cancel Enigma and annihilate their years of research. That's a subtlety that is extremely hard to accept, sacrificing thousands of people, to save millions, or to shorten the war, one could say that Turing let British people die, but maybe this act itself has saved millions others. But human intelligence is too blind to see it, what a tragic irony that the man who saved millions of people with artificial intelligence was sacrificed on the altar of human stupidity.But the film at least respect our intelligence and says a lot without words, two standout moments I got at the first viewing: Alan tells Joan about the machine's name, Christopher, something is odd and she doesn't mention it, and yes, it took me a few seconds to realize that I expected a woman's name. And that was a brilliant hint of Alan's homosexuality before the revelation. A second moment is when he's in London train station with Joan and mothers and soldiers stare at him with disdain, he's obviously seen like a coward. How ironic that they'll never know this man is as heroic as them.\"The Imitation Game\" is an imperfect film but from the subject it handles and its importance, it is as highly recommendable as if it was a masterpiece.",

In particular, the depiction of Turing's colleagues and of his boss, Alastair Denniston, unacceptably, and unnecessarily, traduced them, and Turing himself. Denniston had been a schoolmaster before he became a code-breaker, and understood his people. When recruiting for the forthcoming war, he realised that mathematicians were going to be needed as well as linguists. And there is no evidence whatsoever that Turing's colleagues regarded him with anything other than affection and respect, as evidenced by his nickname of 'the Prof'. As to the 1951 episode, Turing told the police himself that he had been with a young man at the time of the burglary. The truth is dramatic enough, and I cannot understand why the film lacked the confidence to stick closer to the facts. In the end I could not stand it any longer and switched off.

            "content": "This is not the first movie to investigate the Bletchley Park team that cracked the Nazi Enigma code and hastened Germany's defeat. This version puts a lot more meat on the bones of the code-breakers' story and, more importantly, gives mathematician Alan Turing the full credit for his role as creator of the Ultra machine that finally broke the code. We now know that Turing is part parent, part midwife, to today's PCs and iPads and Smartphones.We also know that Turing was a homosexual in an era when gays were prosecuted and cruelly punished, although the writer and director of THE IMITATION GAME seem to be unsure about how far to go in exploring this side of Turing's fatally (as it would prove) flawed genius. Flashbacks to his boarding school days show geeky Alan clumsily and inarticulately in love with a fellow pupil, but his great love in the Bletchley Park period is Joan (Keira Knightley), the only female on the team. Benedict Cumberbatch perfectly catches the adult Alan's equally clumsy courtship of Joan, whom he loves but does not desire. The moral dilemma the Bletchley Park team - and the government - faced once they had broken the German code is chillingly presented but the movie's fatal flaw, for me, was in declaring Turing's homosexuality (and its terrible consequences) but not exploring it in any depth. We see the postwar police doggedly building a case against him, but we get few clues as to the kind of gay man he was. Perhaps Benedict was OK about playing gay but didn't want to fully \"do\" gay? What the Turing movie needed, I think, were a couple of the scenes like Gary Oldman had in PRICK UP YOUR EARS, candidly but not not too explicitly showing Joe Orton's naughty weakness for cottaging and rent boys. THE IMITATION GAME is a visual feast with well-judged performances from the entire cast, but it settles for being a Merchant Ivory-style period piece with (as the poster proclaims) more than one enigma at its centre. This is not the definitive biography of Alan Turing.",

Obviously at some point the script writers decided that spending more time on Turings homosexuality would make the movie more interesting.

            "content": "Let me start this review off by saying that the movie is mostly good. Cumberbatch has been able to show his acting skills and Knightley is great in her supporting role. The historical inaccuracies, however, are unforgivable.It is completely understandable that a movie based on a true story has to, in part, fictionalise some events, in order to be more exciting or moving. But what the filmmakers failed to understand, in this case, is just how extraordinary Turing's life was. Does one really need to distort the life of the man who created modern computer science as we know it and who was one of the most impactful people in the second world war?This movie is filled with inaccuracies from beginning to end. For example, Joan Clark wasn't hired with a crossword on a newspaper, the machine was never called \"Christopher\", Turing never hid his sexual orientation and there never was any reciprocal love with his friend Christopher Morcom. Many others can be found on the IMDb page. Most of these mistakes are relatively minor by themselves, but the sheer number of them feels manipulative in the extreme.The most blatant one, however, is the depiction of Turing as lacking social skills. In fact, most people who had the opportunity of working with him regarded him as a sociable man with a good sense of humour. Why did they have to portray him according to the typical Hollywoodian clich\u00e9 of the mathematician? If, for any reason, a filmmaker believes that a socially inept protagonist is more compelling, then they should tell a fictional story, instead of abusing an actual lived experience to push a stereotypical image.I will give \"The Imitation Game\" credit for telling an important story and, if you want to see a well-crafted drama set during the second world war, watch this movie, by all means. But if you'd like to discover more about Turing's life, please just read more about him. To think that Turing's impact hasn't been recognised for decades and what made him known to a wide audience is a woefully inaccurate movie is saddening. Sorry Alan, you deserved better.",

            "content": "There is a danger that, come February 2015, there may be three British men vying for the Best Actor Oscar. There is plenty of buzz surrounding Timothy Spall's Mr. Turner and Eddie Redmayne's performance in Professor Stephen Hawking biopic, The Theory of Everything, and keeping them company is the ubiquitous Benedict Cumberbatch, star of The Imitation Game.With WWII raging and the Germans edging closer to victory, it was one thing seizing an Enigma machine but an entirely more challenging task cracking the code that changed daily. Mathematician, Alan Turing (Cumberbatch) was recruited by the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's code breaking centre. Heading a select team in Hut 8, while his aggrieved colleagues battled daily to crack each new configuration of the Enigma code, Turing was obsessed with creating Christopher, an innovative machine designed to think faster than even the team of brilliant cryptanalysts aiming to shorten the war.Based on truth, director Morten Tyldum's (Headhunters) film is incomplete as a biopic but draws the viewer in as a historical thriller where the enemy is time and the most visible battles, both literal and emotional, occur in a small hut with his colleagues and superior, Commander Dennsiton (Charles Dance). Turing's life is pr\u00e9cised and the impact of his life's work is only hinted at in the final summary. Turing accelerated the development of computers, he became a figurehead for the campaign for equality and the legalization of homosexuality, was instrumental in the shortening of the war and his reward was persecution, prosecution and a royal pardon almost sixty years after his apparent suicide.The Imitation Game cannot possibly do justice to his story but what Tyldum does beautifully is give an insight into the man, his daemons and proclivities, and a brief, intense and hugely significant chapter in his short life. The explosions in Turing's war occur in his mind, in his difficulty in relating to his colleagues, not least of all Hugh Alexander (Belle's Mathew Goode), and in the bustling hub of invention and cypher cracking.Graham Moore's screenplay, based upon Andrew Hodge's book, is a prodigious feature debut, cutting to the core of Turing's tortured mind and his platonic relationship with Joan Clark (Keira Knightly), the closest he is able to come to a friend. It would be easy to overcomplicate The Imitation Game with information and data or slip into a slanted portrayal that inevitably fails to right the wrongs a puritanical society did to Turing. Fortunately, Moore guides us instead through the excitement of the drama and the peripheral relationships that were mere fripperies compared to Turing's focus. We already know the outcome but, like Valkyrie, the conclusion matters less than the journey. It doesn't matter that history tells us the result, we're still gunning for Turing and his team.Cumberbatch is on superb form, opening the mind and soul to us of a man that many found difficult to like and few ever really understood. He is awkward, obsessed, a prisoner of his own mind and intellect but Cumberbatch still allows us to warm to him, to be excited for him and outraged when stubborn superiors and peers seek to attack and thwart his unorthodox brilliance.Knightly is something of a yo-yo actress, swinging between intense and enthralling performances (A Dangerous Method) and bland turns in forgettable films (Begin Again), but in The Imitation Game she delivers a fine supporting performance of sensitivity and strength. This is without doubt Cumberbatch's film but solid performances from Knightly, Goode and Dance add depth and variety to an involving story of an enthralling achievement by a remarkable man.Alan Turing: saviour of millions, creator of the computer, source of Benedict Cumberbatch's first Oscar? Maybe. Subject of a fine film that glimpses through the glass and demands a detailed accompanying documentary? Without doubt.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",

Turing manufactures a machine for which he calls \"Christopher,\" named after a childhood friend. He suffers as a team player and alienates himself from others brought in to assist. He eventually sends out a crossword puzzle urging a meeting with anyone who can solve it under a specific time. Enter Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, bright young woman whom ends up engaged to Turing until he admits his homosexuality. This plagues him in his relationships until it leads to his suicide when it is deemed indecent by government and they place him on chemical castration. Clarke seems determined to accomplish her mission despite obvious disappointments in him. Strong supporting work by Matthew Goode, Charles Dance and Mark Strong either working with Turing or overseeing the project and threatening to halt it when results fail. Director Morten Tyldum details the project and its failings, frustrations and eventually its triumph when the war is shortened by about two years thanks to this decoding machine.

A popular and charismatic rival who later becomes a friend. A woman who starts as a follower but later moves to the center of the protagonist's attention. A major revelation thanks to flirting with girls in a bar. A final breakthrough and the major success. Turn to the worse, the dark times and the dark secrets. Loneliness and impotence, with the only friend living inside your head. Acceptance of own fate. And finally a widespread recognition and a legacy that's hard to overestimate.It's funny how similar the stories can sometimes be. Is it because the filmmakers simply want to use the same instruments? Or because the people on whose lives those movies are based, brilliant but controversial, are bound by their fate to pass through such hardships to fulfil their destiny and find regard for their achievements? One can hardly tell. And maybe we shouldn't even dig deep into it, leaving it stay as a magic of the cinematographic art.As for 'The Imitation Game' itself, it is a very solid movie, gritty and dramatic, just as a life of Alan Turing itself, whose work made a huge influence on the course of the World War II, helping save millions of lives, but who ended up prosecuted in his own country for something that is now considered, if not a norm then, at least, a matter of one's private business. And while it may sometimes feel that the movies covering the WWII period are too aplenty already and that the filmmakers should move on and look for some fresher and more burning topics, films like 'The Imitation Game' allow us to see a whole epoch via the eyes of a single man, feel not only the world as it was but also what it was for real people to be a part of it, to live in it.But despite having an Oscar-winning screenplay, this film would not be what it is without the people who act it out. Benedict Cumberbatch may be hugely overrated and overpraised, but here he proved to have enough spirit, emotional charge and diversity to be really considered a great actor. Keira Knightley deserves the similar regard for portraying her character, but one has already come to expect that ability to make a teeth-clenching delivery of characters of any complexity from her. And although you can clearly see that she's not a young girl anymore, it seems that maturity only enriches her acting talents.Maybe 'The Imitation Game' is not an all-time masterpiece for which the last year would be remembered, but it's still pretty much worth watching. Even though it's about mathematicians, it's not school-boring, and after watching it you might even find more value in the everyday things that surround you, like having no government control over your intimate life or having digital gadgets that do not occupy a whole room or take forever to load a web page or play back a song.",

I am not a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch but I saw a trailer for it and was actually impressed that it intrigued me. The film is fascinating, a terrific story and very entertaining. In a weekend where I ended up inundating myself with \"Based on True Story\" films inadvertently and this was by far the best of them. However, the film is as good as it is solely because of the amazing, outstanding performance by Cumberbatch. He has proved to me that he can really be astounding. But more on him in a moment. World War 2 stories are a dime a dozen but usually they do end up being very, very good. We are fascinated by stories of war for whatever reason. This is a different side of things as we never actually see the World War 2 front but Alan Turing and his team do more for the war than any other operation if the story is even partially accurate. Despite the fact that the story of the code breaking is the driving plot of the film, there is a far more important and fascinating story about a man who struggles to understand human interaction and fit in and find his place in the world when he is up against so many walls. It is a really great character study defined by an amazing performance.The film itself is good but the star Benedict Cumberbatch is mesmerizing. He is well deserved in getting an Oscar nomination which seems to be the popular opinion. He just captures this character and draws you into his eccentric personality. Matthew Goode is decent in his role as Turing's colleague and eventual friend Hugh Alexander. Goode's biggest hurdle is that he has to stand up to Cumberbatch so he doesn't quite get as noticed. I am not a Keira Knightley fan, I know she's been in a lot of great movies but I usually find her very irritating. However, she actually does alright in this film. Her role is mostly small and she has the proper chemistry with Cumberbatch which is this awkward friendship that seems to work. Matthew Beard, Allen Leech, James Northcote and Mark Strong all round out the main supporting cast in decent but not spectacular roles. Its a small cast but ultimately this is the Cumberbatch show and he shines in it so this is definitely a vehicle for him.Director Morten Tyldum has a great story on his hands here and he got very lucky with such a strong leading performance. The Imitation Game is a very interesting story but really its just a good movie. Not an amazing one. The single reason why this is getting so much intense recognition and Oscar buzz is because of Cumberbatch. Have I said that enough? Remember that I am not a huge fan of his so for me to constantly gush about him is an even bigger deal. This is definitely a great bio pic and drama and a fascinating film for anyone who loves a character study or a World War 2 film that is completely different than others out there like it. I can't see this film taking home any nominations outside of Best Actor but it is still a great movie to check out. 8/10",

Unfortunately I left the cinema very disappointed. In my view, Morten Tyldum should not have applied the recipe of a Harry Potter movie to such an exiting historical drama. Or maybe a comparison to the Sherlock Holmes movies by Guy Ritchie would be closer, just without the action. It is difficult to express the immense irritation and frustration the format of this movie created. The cast is excellent, but the director's choice of a fairy tale format is ridiculous. If you are looking for a Disney movie, I guess you would enjoy it though.",

Perfect for those interested in history, technology, social conventions affecting groups (women, gay people, those with autism) and the struggles of visionaries way ahead of their time.I knew a bit about Turing from computer science studies, but was eager to learn more. While The Imitation Game does take some artistic license in dealing with the facts, it more than makes up for it by delivering an intense, thrilling and surprisingly funny drama with a tragic ending.The story covers the historical aspects of Turing's work and includes some glimpses of his earlier years in a beautiful, engrossing way, thanks to a stellar performance by Alex Lawther. Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best performance yet as the adult Turing, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. I was pleasantly surprised by Kiera Knightley's strong performance as Joan Clarke; she movingly portrayed the struggles faced by a brilliant woman in a technical setting, and she showed the compassion and support that helped Turing endure some of his struggles.",

But what worked well in old film has not succeeded here in anew one. My opinion - while that old one was a perfect mix of suspense, thriller, drama, war epic, tragedy and romance, here it is a bleak dull shaggy description of some ill and variously challenged man with a good mind. But it all falls flat with a painfully slow delivery, unpersuasive tonality, certain flaws and goofs and a very silly air of pathetic motto: Who, if not us. OK, they did a marvelous job, but some aspects of war were so mundane and boring that they do not deserve a film to show. Do we really need to see a highly unwell man breaking codes or very blatantly Oliver Stone style of interpolation being stolen? No, certainly not. What is also very obvious and painfully poor is that rainbow scheme flag agenda propaganda slyly creeping into a plot, delivering a certain ungodly message. Okay, we can watch this once and quickly dismiss",

It's even better that it's based off a true story. It does a fantastic job of building things up slowly, engrossing you with a wonderful story. Alan Turing's story is both fascinating and heartbreaking. We owe our lives to this man in some ways! If it wasn't for him, who knows what Hitler would have pulled off. Some of his tactics may have been unethical and questionable, but he was absolutely brilliant. Who cares if he was neurotic and standoffish! How does he get repaid? He gets medically castrated for being gay. No matter how many times that goes through my head, it never fully registers. He cracked the enigma code, saved lives, changed the world, among other things. It's absolutely baffling! The performances are amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch is incredible as Turning, and I wouldn't be upset at all if he won an Oscar. He's deserving of it. Keira Knightley is excellent. She continues to be one of the most dependable actresses in Hollywood! Matthew Goode has charisma in spades! I loved him. Rest of the cast are greatThis film moved me in many ways. It's a genuinely great film that stuck with me after it was over. It's well worth seeing in theaters! Highly recommended8.6/10",

            "content": "I saw posters for this film, and then I heard about what it was about, having never watched Sherlock before, and only seeing its leading star in War Horse, I was looking forward to seeing the leading actor in a full length film, playing another genius. Based on the true story, set during the darkest days of World War II, Alan Turing (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Benedict Cumberbatch), educated at Cambridge University, is called into the office of Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) in Bletchley Park regarding an important job position, he is a groundbreaking thinker, and he knows that British Intelligence are trying to break the impossible Enigma Code, being used by the Nazis to transmit their secret messages. With the authorised provisions and resources from Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Turing works alongside a motley group of scholars, mathematicians, linguists, chess champions and intelligence officers, but also an advertisement goes in the newspaper to find another genius, those who can solve a crossword puzzle in under ten minutes are invited to a meeting to test their problem solving skills, and following a test they find Joan Clarke (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Keira Knightley). As well as seeing Turing and his team racing against time to break the \"unbreakable\" Enigma code, with the hand built computer machine working through the millions of possible combinations, the film also sees the other key points in Turing's life, including young teenager Alan (Alex Lawther) educated at boarding school and gaining his interest in problem solving and cryptanalysis (translating and deciphering secret codes and ciphers), and forwarding to the 1950s when Turing is arrested, with Detective Robert Nock (Rory Kinnear) investigating his crime of gross indecency. While the unending problem solving goes on Turing struggles with his own personal identity, he had particular feelings for boys when he was younger, he does love and gets engaged to Joan, but he is in fact homosexual, the only one who knows is Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode), Turing does eventually tell Joan, but she does not want it to ruin whatever is between them. Finally Turing has a breakthrough with the Nazi messages, from some deciphering he and his team see that the Germans always mention \"weather\" and \"Hitler\", so they search all messages for these words, and they break the code, but they do not want to make the Germans suspicious or aware of their breakthrough, so they only mildly change the strategies that the British and ally forces have already planned. Following the end of the war, all evidence of the Enigma code work is destroyed, including the records of the people who worked on it, but in the years to come the authorities did discover that Turing was gay, which was at the time illegal, it is not seen in the film, but Turning was convicted for gross indecency, punished with chemical castration, and following this he killed himself with cyanide poisoning, the Queen however posthumously pardoned his crime in 2013/14. Also starring Allen Leech as John Cairncross, Matthew Beard as Peter Hilton, Mark Strong as Stewart Menzies, Tuppence Middleton as Helen, Steven Waddington as Superintendent Smith and Tom Goodman-Hill as Sergeant Staehl. Cumberbatch is outstanding as the charming, amusingly over thinking and credible genius, you really believe him as the brilliant, unfairly treated and now to be remembered war hero, there is also fantastic support from Knightley as his confidante and fianc\u00e9e, Kinnear as the detective who investigates his sexuality, and Dance as his firm superior. I agree with critics that this film could have taken a few more risks, there is not enough about how serious a crime homosexuality was at the time, and the horrendous punishment he received, but the script is very well written, all action included makes for a convincing portrayal of the story, and you are gripped watching the team, the cogs of the machine turn and how important solving the impossible was for the success of winning the war, a fantastic wartime thriller based on a true story. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Director for Morten Tyldum, Best Film Editing, Best Music, Original Score for Alexandre Desplat, and Best Production Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Screenplay, and Best Original Score.

It's highly recommended if you have a passing interest in either computers or WW II.The bad news: the film has been considerably dumbed down to make it suitable for mass consumption, leading to far-fetched dramatic setups, nonsensical science, forced dialog and a simplistic rendering of pretty much all of its characters. Knightley and Goode have little to work with, and Cumberbatch fails to fully tap into his inner nerd: Turing's social awkwardness is never real, and neither are his autistic mannerisms. You'd probably be best served to skip \"The Imitation Game\" if you know a lot about computer science or related fields, as it will leave you either underwhelmed or slightly insulted.",

            "content": "Norwegian director Morten Tyldum's English-language debut \"The Imitation Game\" is the type of movie that seems custom built for awards recognition. This classy historical drama explores the life and contributions of a man whose impact would not be acknowledged until many years after his tragic & untimely death. That man was Alan Turing, a mathematician who played a key role in breaking Germany's \"Enigma\" code during World War II.The screenplay is loosely based on a biography of Turing and, from what I understand, it isn't shy about bending the truth for dramatic effect. Personally, I don't find this to be a problem because the story is compellingly told and none of the fabrications or exaggerations strike me as being unreasonable in the name of entertainment. If you're only interested in stringent historical accuracy then you probably shouldn't be watching movies to begin with. That being said, for what it's worth, the screenplay was rewarded with an Oscar, which was surprisingly the only major award that the film received.The cast is comprised of a fine group of British thespians, with Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role. Cumberbatch is always good but this might be his best performance to date. Also notable was Keira Knightley in an Oscar-nominated supporting role. The rest of the cast is a model of professionalism and features the likes of Mark Strong, Matthew Goode & Charles Dance.From a production standpoint, the movie does an excellent job of recreating its period setting, from sets to costuming. Morten Tyldum's direction is nicely handled and the movie also sports a score from Alexandre Desplat (one of two Oscar-nominated scores from Desplat in that particular year). Overall, certainly a prestige picture whose individual components all show considerable care and attention.Although \"Birdman\" & \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" hogged most of the awards recognition for 2014, I think that \"The Imitation Game\" is right up there with them. Sure, it may play fast and loose with the facts but it sheds light on an important subject, all the while giving us a fresh perspective on World War II. I certainly don't have any reservations in recommending it, though you've been warned about what I feel are justified liberties taken with the truth for dramatic effect.",

It works both as a gripping wartime thriller, (and something seeming rather out of time from what we're used to seeing in our multiplexes in 2014), and as a fascinating biography of Alan Turing, the mathematical genius behind the breaking of the Enigma code. He's played magnificently by Benedict Cumberbatch and this is the film that is going to make him a major movie star. Cumberbatch has already established his pedigree on television, (winning this year's Emmy for \"Sherlock\"), and in the theatre, (an Olivier for playing both the doctor and the monster in the National Theatre's \"Frankenstein\"). Now he will almost certainly add an Oscar nomination, if not the award itself, to his tally of prizes and he is backed by a superb ensemble.As the only woman on Turing's team Keira Knightley is outstanding and there is very good work from Mark Strong, Charles Dance, Rory Kinnear, Allen Leech, Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard and Alex Lawther, superb as the young Turing. The director, perhaps surprisingly given the material, is the Norwegian Morten Tyldum, (he of \"Headhunters\" fame), and he does an exceptional job, both in building suspense and establishing atmosphere. The first-rate script, adapted from Andrew Hodges' book \"Alan Turing; The Enigma\", is by Graham Moore, (another probable Oscar nomination). Indeed, I can't really find fault with \"The Imitation Game\", (photography, production design, music etc. are all perfect). Kudos to everyone involved.",

I know that's an unpopular truth for many in Britain who think they defeated the Nazis by themselves but it's a truth all the same. The personality the writers gave to the character of Alan Turing is not at all like the real Turing and according to the movie he had a very small team of people who were pretty much lost without him, in reality there was a big team of scientists and mathematicians involved in the making of the machine.If it had been billed as a complete work of fiction instead of a true story it may have some entertainment value but to completely distort a story and call it true is annoying not entertaining.",

            "content": "Alan Turing, a man who is a hero of WW2 and someone whose technological achievements are still felt today. The Imitation Game is a movie about that man and what specifically he did during the war in regards to the Enigma machine and how he and his team managed to override the system so that the allies could essentially know what the next attack was and when. I found the film interesting but my word is this overrated, the kind of movie that is typical run of the mill Oscar bait and a piece that although could be well acted, really doesn't deserve all the praise it gets. Now OK this movie is far from bad, far from being poor really but it's only an alright film and really nothing that jumped out as different or new. Sure the story of Turing is important I agree but it didn't have to be so much like a Hollywood made movie that is way too full of over the top drama. The story is set into three time pieces, Turing's time at school, Turing during the War, and Turing before and shortly after being arrested on claims of being a soviet spy. The story really tries to tug at the heart quite often I mean it has it's moments of excitement and fun but a lot of the time it doesn't know whether it wants to thrill you or make you cry. The times it does know what its doing are when Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing is on the screen and usually in a scene where he has to really fight for his views, not only does Cumberbatch act it out well but also those scenes are the most beautiful. Cast such as Keira Knightley are OK and I liked the addition of Mark Strong although he is definitely not seen enough. Director Morten Tyldum I felt was pretty average really, his vision is not properly set out from what I could see and with him at the helm the movie suffers from the over dramatics I mentioned. Graham Moore adapts the movie from the book \"Alan Turing: The Enigma\" by Andrew Hodges but although he won an Academy Award for his work in writing it, it is far from award winning stuff in my opinion. The script is full of things we have all seen before, we know roughly how it will end (well the WW2 part anyway) and the dealings with the disgusting attitudes toward homosexuality in the day are not actually explored enough to make us feel as bad as we could do for Turing (although Cumberbatch goes a long way to make us so).Now if you go into watching this movie only thinking that you will find it great then scratch that because I and from what I have seen many others also find this your same old kind of story. The plot is fun at times but too slow to begin, the acting is not all good and although cast like Cumberbatch maybe deserve nominations for awards, I disagree with some other things this movie was nominated or won throughout the world. That said the movie is enjoyable, my review maybe seems a bit on the negative side but in truth the movie is satisfactory, enough is made of the typical plot to make this acceptable and sort of likable biopic of Alan Turing. So overall I would recommend it but not to everyone, if you like your stories that play out like this then go and see it, you may really enjoy yourself but I can't see why this is considered so great or incredible. So yes Alan Turing a true unsung legend of World War II and someone who should be remembered by the generations that will come as someone who not only helped win the war, but also saved possibly millions of lives too.",

Nonsense. He was, in fact, a friendly person who was happy to explain his ideas. He headed a large team who worked collaboratively with the full support of everyone above him. (Spoiler alert) He never met the soviet agent and was never threatened to have his homosexuality exposed. His team had nothing to do with deciding how and when to use the intelligence they got from decoding Nazi communications -- that was done by the higher-ups. Nobody on his team had a brother on the ship that got sunk. His relationship with Joan didn't end that way. Finally, after his death, the police concluded that he had committed suicide, however there is good reason to believe that his death -- which contrary to the movie, didn't occur until a year after he finished serving his sentence - - was accidental. There are other inaccuracies, but these are probably the most egregious. In my opinion, if a writer wants to make up things, he should write fiction. If you are going to write a historical drama, you should keep it factual since, for most people, it will be all they'll ever know about the subject.",

            "content": "This is a story about a saviour. An un-sung hero of World War II; Alan Turing, a genius British mathematician who secretly worked tirelessly to decode the German 'Enigma' code within the now famous Hut 8 of Bletchley Park. Remarkably, his breakthroughs in cryptography and technological achievements are still realized today in the form of 'Turing Machines' \u2013 to me and you, these are now called computers.We first meet Alan after the events of World War II within the confines of an interrogation room, here accused of the then indecency of his homosexuality. It is here we are transported into Alan's world, where when questioned about his work at Bletchley Park does he oblige, peeling back the seemingly cold-blooded, narcissistic veneer with a detailed narrative on his work, leading a team of linguists, mathematicians and problem solvers.Alan's clinical, precise and unrelenting witty focus to achieve the impossible begins to alienate his team mates and superiors, which ultimately creates a rift in support of Alan's grand plans to build a cutting-edge machine to help decipher the infamous German code. It is here we see the real Alan \u2013 the exposed Alan, in which his absolute genius forgoes his interpersonal skill set. This is a challenge in itself for Alan to embark upon, and it's a real heart- warming treat to watch how his relationships develop with his peers to an ultimate conclusion of sacrifice, friendship and mutual respect. Benedict Cumberbatch ultimately lays bare the man that Alan Turing was; a real man of warmth and soul that the numerous writings and texts after Alan's death in 1954, fails to capture.For a man who struggles with his words of affection toward others, we observe his capacity for compassion when he meets fellow mathematician Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), who herself is struggling with social hierarchy and her place as a woman in the 1940s on Alan's secretive team. It is not long before we see the genius of her work as she proves not only to play a pivotal role in the collaboration to break the 'Enigma' but she also provides Alan with moral guidance and support through his time working alongside her at Bletchley Park.It is apparent by the film's sombre conclusion that the somewhat brief and seemingly convenient engagement to Joan actually had a profound impact in Alan's life. Kiera Knightley's portrayal of Joan Clarke is certainly her most refreshingly spunky performance of late, bringing emotional weight to the tale of Alan Turing. She is essentially the yin to his yang and not for Alan's choice of sexuality (itself illegal in the mid-1900s), would they be the perfect team and companion for one another. It's delightful but ultimately fateful to watch on screen as the story begins to unfold and race towards its conclusion.It is fitting that the breakthrough in cracking the German's code comes courtesy of an epiphany of love \u2013 sometimes love makes us do things we don't always intend.It is emotionally trying to see the eventual outcome of Alan and his teams' work at Bletchley Park be ultimately foreshadowed by the politics and implications of Alan's homosexuality.Based on the book; Alan Turing: The Enigma, by Andrew Hodges, Director Morten Tyldum makes his English language debut here with none of the frantic mania that came with Headhunters, but with a more structured and methodical approach that flits between Alan's youth, middle-age and his work during World War II.The screenplay by Graham Moore is crafted with beautiful complexity and precision, gleefully layering in key events from Alan's life, compounding the reality of his tragic end \u2013 the relentless bullying at boarding school, his fondness of a fellow student that ultimately ends in tragedy, the constant pressure of hundreds if not thousands of lives lost every day, the discovery of a Russian double agent embedded within Hut 8, all whilst bearing the weight of the consequences of his sexuality, itself the focus of an investigation after the fact in the 1950s in an attempt by a keen detective (played by Rory Kinnear) to act on a Policeman's hunch, after investigating a reported break-in of Alan's place of residence.The simple but terrific score by Alexandre Desplat elevates the emotive narrative; and compounds into reality, the harsh realisation of war.The Imitation Game is the perfect platform in which to showcase the true acting chops of Benedict Cumberbatch in a performance that will remain very memorable indeed and a highlight of his career \u2013 a front runner for the Best Actor gong for sure. The best of British cast, including Kiera Knightly, Mark Strong and Charles Dance all prove to be very able in their supportive roles, not forgetting Alex Lawther in his breakthrough role of young Alan Turing also doing fine work here.Whilst not absolute perfection on all accounts \u2013 some pacing issues mid-way through; and jarring usage of CGI depicting sequences on the front line aside, this is clearly a passion project of everyone involved, and one that I can firmly say that without a doubt was very interesting, surprising and emotionally engaging to watch. If this film brings the story of Alan Turing (and rightfully so) to the masses, then I'm in full support. You should be too.Read more film reviews and features online at: https://carlpinnick.journoportfolio.com",

That is fair, but the bottom line is that you have to sacrifice 100% accuracy in order to make for a good story. And this is a very good story, full of moral ambiguity. A philosophy class could have a field day with how many ethical issues are presented: the war, hiding the code, destroying records, chemical castration...Cumberbatch did a superb job and if he was not already on people's radars, this will put him there. In a year with Eddie Redmayne doing a spot-on Stephen Hawking and an incredible buzz around Michale Keaton (for some unclear reason), this is not an Oscar year for him. But as a whole, this seems a real contender for Best Picture, or at the least Best Screenplay.",

It tells of Alan Turing's attempts at breaking the German Enigma code during World War II with his team of associates including a woman named Joan played by Keira Knightly. Both she and Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing deserved their Oscar nominations for their roles. Ms. Knightly is very touching and charismatic as the woman who seems to be one of the few people who could socialize with Alan on an equal basis. Turing's later tragic circumstances are heartbreaking especially when it's revealed how it all ended for him. Times were very different then as the Supreme Court ruling of the last few days can attest. In summary, me and Mom thought that this film, instead of Birdman, was the true Best Picture of last year.",

The story was interesting, but the action felt forced, the dialogue was both simplistic and overly modern, (\"what does that even mean?\") the preachy tone and oversimplified characters failed to convey any of the real issues of the society of the time, and the atmosphere of World War II never felt authentic even once from beginning to end.Other than that, though, it was a great film. Mr. Cumberbatch certainly does know how to convey the itchy, twitchy mannerisms that are understood to represent genius on the screen. Charles Dance is his irascible best as the cold, humorless, authoritarian naval officer. (Did you really think a modern film for an elite audience could depict a military man in any other way?) Keira Knightley is given the most perfunctory dialogue and still manages to shine, her stunning beauty shining through even though her hair and makeup are done very poorly. (The film's one concession to wartime realism?)The ugly truth is that the film makers don't really care what this man really did, or what World War II really meant. They just want to force a gay martyr down the audience's throat. They sentimentalize the protagonist in the shallowest way possible. (He was picked on at school! His best friend died! His own mother didn't like him!) And about fifty-six times in the film someone says, \"but homosexuality is ILLEGAL!\" Oh Jesus no! Sure, it was illegal. But it was going on everywhere, under all kinds of circumstances. Such as, aristocrats forcing themselves on servants and the poor. Older boys forcing themselves on younger boys at elite \"public\" schools. Senior officers forcing themselves on junior officers in the Royal Navy. But that kind of victimization, based on class, doesn't interest the film makers at all. I wonder why!",

The startling fact is that this is a true story. Mathematician cryptanalyst Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) is in the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his brilliant team of code- breakers (Keira Knightley, Allen Leach, Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard) at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II. All of the characters are well cast \u2013 a group that includes Rory Kinnear (particularly poignant as the detective), Charles Dance, Mark Strong, et al. Add to that the musical score by Aleandre Desplat and the cinematography of Oscar Faura and the costume design by Sammy Sheldon and there are still others that make this exceptional film so fine.

            "content": "Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a mathematics professor in the early 1950'2, has experienced a burglary at his home. Yet, when the police come to investigate, they haul in Turing himself to the police station. What the charges might be will follow all too soon but, first, Turing tells a story of his life to one of the officers. During WW II, Turing was part of the code breaking team trying to crack the German's communication system, Enigma, which changed DAILY. Chosen for the job by a by-the-book Naval Commander (Charles Dance), Turing initially seemed to be anything but a team player. He's arrogant, odd, uncommunicative and insists on being in charge. This upsets those already on the job, including champion chess player Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode). This is not the first time that Alan has had problems getting along. Flashing backwards, the film shows his childhood at an English boarding school, where he was scorned and bullied by all his fellow students save one, Christopher. The two became inseparable and excelled at all subjects, especially math. A tragedy changes everything, resulting in Turing's further isolation. Back in WW II times, Turing does become the leader of the group, invents an early computer to help with the calculations of the Enigma code and earns the respect of the other topflight mathematicians, including Joan (Keira Knightley) on the team. He even becomes engaged to Joan when her parents want to withdraw her from the group, believing she will never find a husband. It can't last, however, because Alan is gay and must admit this. The breakers DO conquer Enigma and help win the war. But, at the time of his arrest, homosexuality is a against British law. Since his work was top secret, no one knows how much of a hero he was and is and, in any case, they convict him. What happens at the end is very, very sad yet his tale is truly inspirational. This movie is extraordinary in almost all aspects. Cumberbatch's performance equals that of Eddie Redmayne in Theory of Everything; wish the award ceremonies ahead could have dual top honors. Knightley, Goode, Dance, Mark Strong, and all of the rest are wonderful, too, dazzling the audience. Great congratulations should also be extended to the marvelous script, the masterful direction of three different time periods, and the tremendous costumes, settings, and effects. Do imitate all serious film fans and don't put off seeing this one. Its riches will be as stunning to you as to everyone the world over.",

THE IMITATION GAME profiles the man who invented computers, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI), and shortened WWII by 24 months, \"saving 14 million lives.\" Since Mr. Turing was gay, his life was sad. Things \"might get better\" for some, but NOT for him. The only motivation for his life was to build a machine to replace his childhood buddy Christopher, who died young suddenly from tuberculosis. (Which is another way of saying that IF Christopher hadn't died as a schoolboy, the Allies may have LOST WWII!) An interesting sidebar is that the Germans STILL may have won the War, if they had not ended most of their encrypted messages with their standard \"Heil Hitler\" sign-off. Sadly, Mr. Turing was doomed because he was the first to point out that knowing ALL of Germany's war plans in advance could only be useful IF the information was used in an extremely selective manner (so the Nazis would not replace their compromised \"Enigma Machine\" with a less transparent device). Therefore, Turing and \"intelligence\" officers such as future novelists Ian Fleming and J.D. Salinger played God, \"allowing\" the Third Reich to kill millions of \"nonessential\" soldiers, sailors, and civilians at times less crucial than D-Day. This sordid mess was covered up for 50 years, and the mastermind deciding who lived and who died--Mr. Turing--was driven to a questionable \"suicide\" by the authorities (so they say). Truly, Turing was the gay Messiah.",

But as the narrative of The Imitation Game lurched from one Hollywood moment to the next, alarm bells began to ring. I know relatively little about Bletchley Park, but I found myself very much doubting that Turing had won World War Two single-handedly and in the teeth of opposition from establishment stereotypes.I had similar reservations concerning Castles in the Sky, the BBC drama on the wartime development of radar by a group of under-resourced mavericks, but to my delight the events of that film turned out to be firmly grounded in real life. Alas that is not the case here. The events of this film are fabricated to the point where it fails to serve any useful purpose as testimony to the life of its remarkable protagonist. And for an insight into the breaking of the enigma code you might as well watch U-571.Benedict Cumberbatch's performance is the engine that drives the film, and is very good, though the banalities of the script with which he is working prevent it from being Oscar worthy. Dance, Strong and Goode are sound without being stretched, as are Kinnear, Goodman-Hill and Waddingon as the coppers, but Leech and Knightly fail to suggest the required complexity in their roles. The acting laurels go to Alex Lawther as the young Turing, who does a remarkable job of channelling Cumberbatch's performance while surpassing him in emotional truth.Michael Apted 2001 drama, Enigma, based on Robert Harris' excellent novel, for all its thriller structure, felt a more truthful testament to the legacy of Bletchley Park than this cheesy, anachronistic hodge-podge.",

            "content": "Most people go to a movie hoping to see what \"they anticipate or expect\" based on a published story line (example as posted on IMDb or a local newspaper) and the posted movie genre of their preference that being an action, drama, thriller, romance, comedy or other. Mrs. Shullivan and I use Friday nights as our date night, dinner and a movie. Our deal is that we alternate who gets to pick the film we are going to see. On this particular Friday night it was my turn to pick our film elixir so I chose the autobiography (slash) thriller, The Imitation Game, and what a fine elixir it was for both of us! For all the mediocre and truly bad movies we sit through, when you eventually discover a gem like The Imitation Game the movie drug hits you once again and you realize that yes, it is still worth putting on your coat, stepping out in to the cold night and putting down your hard earned cash to go to the theatre rather than wait to purchase a DVD copy for half the price a feature film, popcorn and drinks will cost you. The Imitation Game is the type of film that quite simply just keeps you intensely focused on that large screen and allows one to escape anything and everything that is happening around you as if you were sitting in an empty theatre and the film is playing to an audience of one\u0085.you.Obviously this autobiography has taken liberties with Alan Turing's actual events. To create a truly memorable film the relatively unknown screenwriter (Graham Moore) and director (Morten Tyldum) would need to utilize the 114 minutes film length to reflect not only actual events that take place over decades from mathematician's Alan Turing's academic years as an introverted and closeted homosexual but also as a mathematical genius, problem solver whose interactions with fellow classmates, military personnel and fellow code breakers would keep Alan Turing as an outcast always looking in. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing with so much emotion and intensity that we the audience all were rooting for him to break the German's secretive code. When he eventually does break the code with his machine named (after his only friend from his school days) Christopher, Turing shows us how valuable he was to the British intelligence by realizing how effective mathematical probabilities really are in winning not the battle, but the war.This film depicts an unknown likely hero who through his efforts in building one of the very first computers saved hundreds, thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of peoples' lives with the assistance of Alan Turing's genius. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance has been rewarded with both a nomination for an Academy Award and Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor of January 2015. Whether he wins or loses these awards Mrs. Shullivan and I reward him with our gratitude for keeping our interest to continue to support the theatre box office.There are some other excellent performances as well such as by Keira Knightley who plays the only female code breaker Joan Clarke and true friend of Alan Turing, Matthew Goode who plays Hugh Alexander originally assigned as the Team Leader of the code breakers but is eventually ousted by British Intelligence in favor of Alan Turing, the quirky smart-ass unlikeable code breaker but persistent to no end in breaking the German code. Mark Strong who played Major General Chief of British Secret Intelligence Service M16 also played a very convincing role.The Imitation Game does not waste one minute of screen time. This film embodies a superb story line, wonderful cinematography, true wit when needed, and a stellar cast of actors that will be remembered for decades by their performance in The Imitation Game. As I stated at the beginning of my movie appraisal, this week was my turn to choose and the last film we saw was Mrs. Shullivan's choice and she chose a musical genre that was simply a stinker of a film. To break the mystery of Mrs. Shullivan's last (lousy) movie pick you will have to go back to my previous review under the genre \"musical\". Good luck if you choose to take the challenge and break the code.",

            "content": "What a fascinating subject Alan Turing is for a biographer! He's considered the godfather of computer science, a verifiable genius mathematician \u2013 some would call him a prodigy. He, along with his team of code breakers, helped win World War II for the Allies by building the world's first complex reprogrammable computer that enabled them to decrypt Germany's coded messages that included strategic coordinates among many other top secret information. And oh yeah, he was gay and eventually committed suicide after being ordered by a court of law to cure himself of his homosexuality by taking experimental hormone treatments among many other horrific methods. But enough about all that, we've got a war to win!Director Morten Tyldum was obviously taken by Turing's entire life story and who could blame him? The bulletpoints above only begin to chip away at the myriad layers of the man. That Tyldum set out to chronicle Turing's life isn't the issue; that he chose to whittle it down to a tidy hour and fifty-five minute melodrama is where you can start to point fingers. But I hope you have a lot of fingers because The Imitation Game has more issues than that.Turing is played by Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock, Star Trek: Into Darkness) with all the subtlety of a cannon being fired off in a tea room. He's a powderkeg of ticks and twitches that actually gives his character the only nuance that this script will allow. Yes, Alan Turing is a character in The Imitation Game, a biopic about Alan Turing the human being. Other characters include: the entire cast \u2013 also representing real human beings who actually existed \u2013 consisting of Kiera Knightley, Matthew Goode (Watchmen, Match Point), Charles Dance (Game of Thrones), Rory Kinnear (Penny Dreadful, Skyfall) among others. While there's nothing wrong with these performances per se, it's distracting from start to finish just how aware you are that these are actors giving performances. There's no room to just breathe and lose yourself in the human drama without constantly being nudged by the film itself, urging you to behold that very human drama playing out on screen. Knightley's performance rises to the top of the heap by default based on the fact that she just doesn't have as many bombastic lines of dialogue as her costars.We spend the first half of the film being introduced to everyone \u2013 literally. In fact, much of The Imitation Game is made up expository dialogue, right down to the bitter end, which we'll get to. We're told who's who, who does what, and so on by way of characters stiffly (or, in some cases, exaggeratedly) announcing this information for the sake of the audience. We're given facts and dates and endless information that you almost forget this is supposed to be a movie and not a basic history lesson for children. Ideas and phrases are introduced and repeated, ad nauseam. Again, distracting from the narrative and instead frustrating and annoying to anyone actually paying attention, which the film specifically asks of us in its in media res opening sequence.It's unclear how many hands were in the pot during the production process but The Imitation Game has the feel of a collaborative effort gone wrong. It seems as though Morten Tyldum only wanted to tell the story of Turing's war effort (crack the code, win the war) but this film isn't satisfied with just showing us that. We go back into Turing's past, we jump toward the end of his life, we're all over the place but we don't flesh out his character nearly enough during these sequences for it to have any significance. Why even bother delving into the man's past or future when you can't even bring him to life \u2013 at no fault of Cumberbatch's \u2013 during the era you've dedicated the most film to? Once again: distracting and frustrating. Even in the end we're treated to a half-assed title card informing us of what ultimately happened at the end of Turing's life. Yes, you read that correctly. The most tragic part of Alan Turing's story is relayed to the audience via text on the screen. This not only reeks of studio involvement, it just flat out reeks a stench of which I can't accurately describe.The Imitation Game is an incredibly uneven film with terrific actors belting out ham-fisted lines and gorgeous cinematography shoddily edited together and curiously paced. When it's not hammering you over the head with its big ideas, it's zipping through the man's life like a high school student cramming for an exam. I'm reminded of Ed Harris' Jackson Pollock biopic, Pollock which set out to earnestly tell the story of a misunderstood genius but ended up falling prey to many of the same pitfalls as The Imitation Game. I honestly don't think anyone set out to make a mediocre film here, but that's just what it ends up being. Hopefully a film will one day come along that can crack the code of Alan Turing's incredibly fascinating life story but The Imitation Game is not that film.",

The fact that he was also a gay loner trying to imitate others at the game of life, was poignantly woven into the story, but not in the in- your-face way that some activist movies do so heavy-handedly. Every element of this film is well-conceived and put together, from the scenes of Turing brooding in his house, to his odd platonic love affair with a brilliant puzzle solver played by actress Keira Nightley, to the scenes of combat and destruction that juxtapose with the brain- work of chess players and mathematicians trying to break a code before Britain loses the war. The film has its evil player in commander Denniston, played wonderfully by Charles Dance. We cannot help but sympathize with him, if we are honest with ourselves: Turing's plan is so improbable, would we not have tried to fire him after a year of arrogantly wasted money? Every character in this film has complexity, but without the over-development that occurs in some biopics.I particularly give this film credit for picking up a maligned and difficult-to-defend concept: that it can be more humane to look at the grand picture and do what is right, rather than let your emotions dictate your actions of the moment. It comes across when Turing stays his colleagues, who are about to save hundreds of people after cracking the code. Turing immediately realizes that to save millions, these hundreds must be sacrificed so the Germans can be kept in the dark and the knowledge of Enigma can be used subtly and to the greatest effect.My wife is not a big movie buff, so when she really likes a film, it must be good. She really did like this film. I can tell because she paused it several times to ask questions about it. Usually she is happy to let it zip by as fast as possible, give me the x2 button on the remote!Norwegian director Morten Tydlum only makes a film every 4 years or so, and I swear they have been getting better and better with time.

Throughout the drama of trying to break the code, Turing begins a relationship with a co-worker (Keira Knightley) while trying to keep his homosexuality a secret.THE IMITATION GAME is without question one of the best movies of the year and it works on so many levels. It's rather sad to think that Turing wasn't better known or respected during his short life time and it's even sadder when one realizes why he didn't live very long. I'm not going to spoil any of these true-story events but I think what I respected most about this picture is that it managed to give a strong message without having to preach. More on that in a bit but the film also contains some of the best drama you're going to see and some incredible performances that bring it all together.Cumberbatch turns in one of the strongest performances of his career in a very challenging role. The Turing character is one you hate at times. Egotistical. Mean-spirited. Caring. A mad genius if you will. There's so much going on with this character and his brain is racing a mile a second yet Cumberbatch manages to keep all of this stuff under control and give a very memorable performance. What was so remarkable about it is that he's playing a genius and he really makes you feel as if you're watching the real guy and seeing these events unfold in front of your eyes. There's a sequence towards the end of the film where we see Turing crumbling and just the look in Cumberbatch's eyes are unforgettable. Knightley turns in another terrific performance proving why she's one of the best actresses out there. Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard, Rory Kinnear and Tom Goodman-Hill are all wonderful as well.Director Morten Tyldum does a wonderful job at taking the various aspects of the story and making them all work. The screenplay jumps around from the events in WWII to Turing's childhood and then his later years. The subplot dealing with a detective trying to break Turing is extremely well-balanced with the rest of the film. Usually when films jump around like this you can lose certain bits of tension but that never happens here. Even more impressive is the wonderful music score, the excellent cinematography and some wonderful costumes. On a technical level the film is quite flawless and even the CGI isn't bad looking even though it's rarely used.Getting back to the preaching, it's rather sad to see what happened to Turing and there's certainly a political and social message here. A lot of films really would have beaten the viewer over the head but instead this film just lets it sink in that this brilliant man was cut short for the dumbest of reasons. It's rather sad to think of what could have been with this genius and the film makes you think of that. THE IMITATION GAME is certainly one of the year's strongest films.",

The rest of the movie retells the incidents of how they solved the code and the events that happened in between.You can argue that this movie is Oscar bait and technically you'd be right. But I found this movie to be very entertaining. It is suspenseful and exhilarating watching them try to crack the code. The mutual trust and friendship between the colleagues is uplifting. Also, the realization in their heroism is gut-wrenching.Also, there are some very depressing and sad moments near the end. It gives more insight to this dark tale by featuring them. I was more engaged into the film when it showed them.The constant cuts between time periods can be kind of heavy-handed but if you're able to get over it then you should like the movie.Also, this movie isn't confusing in terms of math.

When he starts working for the government. He is a bit of an oddball and doesn't really get on with his work mates. He then hires a young woman played by Kiera Knightly who was good at doing puzzles. She gets him to loosen up and enjoy life a bit more. Both actors, Bendict Cumberbatch as Turing and Knightly are great in this and will deserve both getting an Oscar nomination. What Turing achieved cracking code they believe shortened the war by two years, which is incredible. I really enjoyed how this film was told. It was a thriller, and interesting look at how to crack nearly impossible codes. I was never good at maths but this was still interesting to me. The acting was great all around. A very British cast.

I feel a little let down though, there wasn't a butt-load of CGI and/or special affects \u2013 just excellent acting (in case you missed it \u2013 that was sarcasm about the CGI and special affects). It was so refreshing and unique to enjoy a movie that did not count on CGI and/or special affects as a necessary co-star. This movie was depended solely on excellent acting and excellent directing (and all of the other stuff that goes into making a superb motion picture). So - let's open with, \"News Flash\" This movie was outstanding entertainment. Was this movie perfect? Well I guess it depends on who one talks to. For me, it comes pretty close. Keep in mind, there is absolutely no such thing as a factual movie \u2013 just ones that barrow facts and pedal it as 'really happening.' Is \"The Imitation Game\" any different? Let me help\u0085the answer sounds like 'go', but begins with 'n' and ends with 'o'. This movie reeks of superior talent, with a few facts tossed in \u2013 so \u2013 \"News Flash\" This movie was outstanding entertainment. Do I think \"Hollyweird,\" oversteps its bounds when it finds it soooooo necessary to be the world's PC arbiter\u0085yes. I actually believe any additional PC proselytizing would have overshadowed this person's greatness \u2013 but it did not. In fact, it was far less than many soulless hack-jobs, kind of like, \"The Iron Lady.\" I think the 'homosexuality issue,' was so well handled, it actually added to the entertainment value\u0085sooo\u0085\"News Flash\" This movie was outstanding entertainment. I am a little upset though. I feel Benedict Cumberbatch performed so flawlessly, that he will walk home with a \"Best Actor\" award. I bet (and hope) he beats all those frenzied narcissists and sweeps every stinking self-aggrandizement award show out there. He deserves the recognition and accolades. Sadly, I will miss his TV portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in \"Sherlock,\" but one must move on. Kiera Knightley, wow, she was so gob-smackingly good. I noticed some milk being spilled over the fact she looked great. I cannot believe people are whining about that. For those who are complaining about her looking so good\u0085maybe you should watch a movie some time. Every stupid flick produced now-a-days has some kind of window dressing, give me a break. It sounds like someone doesn't like the fact that she can actually act. Well cry me a friggin' river. If my vote counted, she would get my nod for \"Best Actress.\" I can easily go through the rest of the cast and site each of them for their superb jobs, but I won't \u2013 and I can't \u2013 my fingers are getting tired \u2013 and I have to proof this crap I wrote. Soooo\u0085\"News Flash\" This movie was outstanding entertainment. The director could have easily interjected a demand for buckets of tears, instead he opted more for a sense of emptiness \u2013 I like that (not the feeling of emptiness...but the fact he avoided the ever-popular waterworks closing out many \"real stories' hocked now-a-days). I will admit, I did not really like the injected notes in the closing credits, but they were important. If it were not for the superior quality of this product, my misgivings may have surfaced in some form of e-tears or e-whining...but the movie was just too good. I mentioned at the beginning this is the \"best movie\" at least for me, but obviously not for all. I recommend all should watch, \"The Imitation Game\", and formulate your own opinion. I did, and, for once, I did not run from the theater wanting my 2 hours of life returned. Good job \u2013 to one and all.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game (2014) was directed by Morten Tyldum. The film is about a remarkable achievement--the breaking of the German naval Enigma code, considered by everyone to be unbreakable.Most of the events depicted in the film are historical facts--as I learned from Wikipedia after seeing the movie. (However, don't read the Wikipedia article first, because it may ruin the film if you do.) A mathematical genius named Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, broke the Enigma code by essentially inventing the computer. There was a woman named Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) to whom Turing proposed. Social prejudice kept her from being a formal part of the code-breaking team, but she worked on the code with Turing informally.)We learn early in the movie that Turing was gay, and it appears obvious-- although not stated--that he had a condition somewhere along the autism spectrum. The film begins in media res--in 1951, when the police are investigating a break-in in Turing's home. That means that most of the scenes--Turing at school, and Turing working to break the code--are shown in flashback. This technique works, especially because the young actor playing Turing as a boy is excellent. How the break-in relates to the eventual outcome of the film wasn't at all clear to me. There was, indeed, a causal relationship, but if it was spelled out, I missed it. That's another matter that the Wikipedia article will clarify. I thought the acting in the movie was excellent, and the tension about breaking the Enigma code was almost palpable, even though we know that the code was broken. Sometimes director Tyldum is a little heavy-hand in telling us how important it was to intercept German messages. We see the code-breaking team staring glumly at another failed attempt, and then we see German tanks, or planes, or ships on the attack. Not exactly subtle.This isn't a great film, but I think it's definitely worth seeing. We saw it at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY, but it will work well on DVD.",

I didn't know anything about the German Enigma program prior to seeing this film, and it's actually quite illuminating to read some of the other reviewers here who know a lot about the subject. So maybe the value in movies like this is to point viewers in the direction of learning more about it's subject matter and become better educated in the process.With that as my starting point, I thought this was a brilliant film and exceptionally well made. Benedict Cumberbatch is riveting in the role of cryptanalyst Alan Turing; watching him on screen is a fascinating study in human behavior and contradictions. One has to admire the single minded dedication that any individual brings to their work and Turing by his example appeared to be a person obsessed with solving an impossible problem. When it was eventually revealed that he was homosexual, I didn't think it was done in a heavy handed manner. Since that was his orientation, I don't see how you can tell the story without making it central to the dilemma he faced in an era that wasn't as enlightened as the present day.I'm not quite sure what the title of the movie is meant to convey. One can take differing views of it I suppose. Was it the mission of the code breakers to 'imitate' their Nazi counterparts by creating a machine to decipher their secret messages, or was Turing himself 'imitating' a 'normal' person as he tried to bring his team to a successful outcome? I've only read a handful of other reviews posted here and no one tackles the subject, including it seems the message boards which I made a quick run through. Anyway, inquiring minds would like to know.In summary, it's a fascinating picture on a little known episode of World War II that contributed greatly to Allied success. It's a war picture with no battle scenes that challenges one's concepts of morality and the justifications made during war to achieve the greatest good while enduring or inflicting the least amount of damage. It's a rare film that leaves you with more questions than it answers, and quite notably, in a positive way.",

It's a movie that I could easily see again and again and spot something different each time.It's strange, but I knew nothing about the pioneering mathematician, logician and cryptanalyst Alan Turin, but was aware of the enigma code and the efforts to try and break it. Benedict Cumberbatch is a sensation as Turin, bringing a realism and believability that is often lacking in movies of this nature. I found myself feeling his every emotion as he battles his own demons, the many obstacles that present themselves and the people that want him to fail. I wasn't convinced by Keira Knightley in the role of Joan Clark, a woman with more on her mind than just helping Turin break the enigma code. I just couldn't embrace as her as usual in this role and I can't put my finger on why that is. I thought the computer was a joy to watch, churning away, searching for the elusive answers that could ultimately shorten the bloodiest war in history. The Imitation Game takes you away from the fighting, the bombs and chaos of the battlefield and tells a fascinating story of a small groups covert efforts to break the Nazis enigma code.Their chances of success are slim at best with the odds heavily stacked in the Nazis favour.",

As homage for a prestigious man, he displays acting caliber of the highest level. He dons the personality and quirks, brings out the best and also most fragile quality of a character. In no overstatement, he introduces a man on-screen and makes audience sympathizes with him as he should be appreciated in life.His role as Alan Turing is as splendid as one could hope be represented with. This probably rivals Russell Crows's performance in A Beautiful Mind. That being said, the rest of cast performs beautifully as well. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke is wonderful. She's not flashy or extravagance in this role, instead she is deceptively bland, but has a more approachable and kind nature. Her demeanor is calming, also effective in bringing a pinch of innocence on time of war. The charming accent doesn't hurt either.Script are well done, dialogues fit the characters in less complicated way. It helps significantly since the theme is already a complex one, yet the underlying message is resoundingly clear, it need not to be deciphered. Character interaction feels authentic, from the honest troubling confession to the more awkward banter, even though some of these must have been slight exaggerated for cinema. Still, it's a nice way to convey their feelings.Pacing is meticulously done, often the movie strolls between different timelines, and manages to highlight each portion with timely fashion. The transition doesn't feel forced, it moves just the way it should naturally. It cleverly depicts Alan Turing's life, the better part and also lonely part of his time.The Imitation Game has a heavy undertaking of presenting a man's personal story, and with excellent acting and amazing script, it has done so marvelously.",

Oscar season after Oscar season, British films always make the nominations for Best Picture or Best Actor. Of course this movie got the big nominations and I so glad this got a lot of nominations from the Oscars, because this movie was pretty incredible.Now we have seen Cumberbatch in pretty much everything now: Sc-Fi, TV shows, animated films, drama, comedy, action and good god this guy is everywhere. Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie almost brought me into tears with his excellent performance as Alan Turning. Benedict is always good at playing these smart-ass genius that's always higher than anyone else, well in this it's a lot different. Yeah he starts off a bit unlikable how he shows off that he's the smart guy in the room, but after a while it changes and I actually felt sorry for this guy when you get to know his past and his secret that he tries to hind for all of his life. Benedict Cumberbatch played this guy so beautifully well that I think this is by far his best performances in his career.Keira Knightley has well dose a brilliant job playing her character in this film. Now I'm going to get some hate for this but I never liked Keira Knightley has a actress. She never locked on to me and she never won me over. I don't think She's a awful actress or anything like that I just never got into her as a actress, but in this film she dose do good as a supporting character that's really important to the story. Good work Knightley.The film is directed spot on and this is the first Morten Tyldum film that I've watched from him, yeah he did some other films in the past but I never going to watch them (Just being honest) He got the drama right, he got the relationship between Benedict and Knightley right and I think this director is going to go off and do some (I'm predicting here) some fantastic work of movies in the future.The writing has well is the soul of this movie. The director is the heart of the film, the actors are the veins of this movie. The writing to me perfectly got the main character pain and deep inside torture of he his secret of being gay and you know back then he would be sent to prison for that, so you really feel the hard work on not just solving the Enigma code but to hind who he truly is.For issues I haven't really got much to be honest. But is this a film that I will watch again and again, no not really.

It's off-putting and doesn't give prospective viewers any idea what the film is about. \"The Imitation Game\" was the name of a mind-game the protagonist, math genius Alan Turing, played to learn about people. But the movie isn't about that game. It's about breaking the Nazi Germany Enigma code and the struggles Turing and his team go through to solve the code. Better names for the movie would be: \"Breaking the Nazi Code\" (or just \"Breaking the Code\" which would have a double meaning for the film) \"Decoding the Nazi War Machine\" \"Beating Nazis at its Code Game\" \"Nerds Take Down the Nazis\" \"Take that Enigma!\" \"No more Heil to Hitler\"Okay, some of those were serious, others not. The truth is, this is an excellent film, what great films can be, and I am worried the title will keep away viewers. It is a historical costume drama, and the English are often very good at that. The acting is superb, especially Cumberbatch. There are few false notes. That is to the acting and also an excellent script. The writers were able to propel the drama with the dialogue and put in some humour that allows us to learn about the characters along the way. No scene was added just to be dramatic; they all had duel purposes whether telling us about the relationships of the characters or demonstrating their struggles while continuing to lay out the plot. Of course the sets, edits and lighting were excellent; they had the budget to pull it off. The musical score is good and seldom noticed; the director didn't need to employ over-wrought music to force us have emotions. The drama spoke for itself. \"The Imitation Game\" was able to do what \"The Theory of Everything\" struggled with. First, there are three different time periods in \"The Imitation Game\" and the edits and transition back and forth between those periods are nearly flawlessly. \"Theory\" struggles with that. Also, \"Imitation\" showed us different aspects of Turing's life, personal, scientific, work, as parts of a whole without leaving us with nagging, unanswered questions. \"Theory\" was not nearly as good at that. Both films have stellar acting and plenty of nerd appeal, but if you can see only one, see \"Imitation.\" It is a much more human film where the emotion didn't play as false. Both are worth watching.Rating: Pay full price, see it twice. This may be the first time I have given a non-documentary full ratings. One of best aspects of the film is that war is not glorified while the need to defeat Hitler was made imperative. The film doesn't shy away from the British government's bigotry (and that of many people), hypocrisy and the tough choices the people who broke the Enigma code had to face. The film doesn't wallow in the tragedy like an after-school special, but it shows the warts and ugliness Turing had to face in mid-century England while breaking the \"impossible\" puzzle of Enigma.

Probably the idea was to have it play like a \"G\" rated movie so as not to attract too much censorship. It's entertaining but nowhere as good as the portrayal done of Turing by Derick Jacobi. The film would have been far better had it delved deeper into the character of Turing and also portrayed him with a bit more reality. This is a very sanitized version of the book on which it is supposedly based. Entertaining but very lightweight!",

            "content": "The secrets behind the true victors of World War II were only divulged not too long ago (interestingly enough, it's hard to come by the exact date of the reveal). This tale is about Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who went on to break the Nazis' enigma code and help win the war. Now, there's always that one Oscar-bait film every year that I like much more than I expected. Unlike the rubbish biopics like The Theory of Everything, The Imitation Game actually celebrates the genius. It doesn't try to sentimentally conclude that there's a genius in everyone (because there's frankly not)\u2014not another inspiring story about how everyone can achieve monumental achievements just like Stephen Hawking and Alan Turing. It was very clear from the beginning that Turing wasn't \"normal\"\u2014that he deviated from other people for a reason. Normality usually never ends with a tremendous legacy; it's the people who were ignored or unappreciated during their lifetime\u2014the people who were condemned; the people who really didn't care about expectations and general rules\u2014that eventually reach glory. In this case, it takes fifty years for Turing's vast accomplishments to finally be disclosed to the public\u2014let the countless biographic novels and films about him now come. Benedict Cumberbatch's sheer charisma never appears to end as he, once again, encapsulates another sort of personality\u2014the socially inept loner whose solely logical mind and utter arrogance centers on one goal, one total passion of his: the sizable computing machine he's building to crack the impossibly indecipherable German messages. (Keep in mind I've never seen the Sherlock series; so, I'm totally new to this refreshing side of Cumberbatch after seeing him portray a frighteningly menacing villain in last year's Star Trek sequel.) This might sound like typical Oscar-bait material, but it sometimes also largely depends on the particular film's execution. Take 2010's The King's Speech, for instance; what could've easily been another Oscar- checklisting inspirational narrative ended up transcending its material with absolutely believable and natural characters and performances that suck you in beyond any failures in the story's quality and lack of inventiveness. Again, unlike The Theory of Everything (which I have a feeling I'll be knocking down more and more as this review proceeds), we don't hear a lot of that soapy, Lifetime music that shadows the emotional moments. Alexandre Desplat's score here is incredibly emotional without the help of some manipulative, weeping piano notes. The music takes more of the tone of a grand, majestic story, or occasionally perhaps something that makes it feel more like a spy thriller rather than a standard soap opera. Another admirable trait of the film that further defied my expectations was the integrity that stayed with Turing's character to the bitter end; he never loses his conceit or eccentric personality. That clich\u00e9d Hollywood arc of character development (the distant bigot suddenly becomes a compassionate benefactor a la Dallas Buyer's Club) thankfully can't be found here. Right from the get-go, Graham Moore's impeccably sharp screenplay wastes no time in shaping these characters, especially Turing, himself, who's given a few humorous scenes to profoundly introduce himself to the audience. Kiera Knightley plays opposite Cumberbatch as an intelligent, dignified woman in the midst of a male- concentrated environment in a male-dominated time period. The dynamic between Cumberbatch and Knightley's Joan Clarke is sweet and amusing; there's no need for a traditional romantic interest/shallow plot line since this relationship is strictly platonic (and Turing, of course, is homosexual anyway).The complexity and intricateness of the heavily mathematical, scientific code-breaking concept of The Imitation Game is satisfyingly condensed so that the plot doesn't continue with frustrating convolution that of which frequently hinders many spy thrillers. Personally, a great screenplay can always simplify complicated ideas to the extent that it still feels natural and realistic. With all that being said, the script does tend to deliver some of the film's themes quite heavy-handedly in moments to the point of that sappiness that's become a staple of Oscar-bait biopics. Reciting the same line several times throughout the picture as to persist that thematic idea (\"Sometimes, it is the people who no one imagines anything of, who do the things that no one can imagine\") usually doesn't work, impacting with a mawkish taste rather than with sincerity. On another note, while I appreciated the inclusion of the disarmingly tragic conclusion to Turing's story, it seemingly glossed over it all as if in a rush to avoid a lingering gloomy mood to close on. The Imitation Game, regardless, is fully effective in its shuffling of undoubtedly significant subjects, including topical mentions of homosexual ostracism (and worse, punishment) and the important technological advancements of mankind\u2014the capability of the human mind and the lengths of its imagination\u2014and how much that has all reshaped our world\u0085from then to now. Most of all, as the credits roll and the beautiful score surfaces, your eyes water for the men and women that lived in stress and died without recognition or appreciation.",

There is seemingly a very interesting story to be told of Turing's life, but this movie gets a bit lost. The whole police interview as narration that starts at the beginning ultimately seems flat. It provides an interesting segue to the scene of his ultimate demise, but too little time is spent on what happened to him after the end of the war, or even after the initial success in breaking the code. Instead, the filmmakers seemed more interested in showing how difficult it was to spend time with him until he discovered the value of friendship with Keira Knightley's help. The writing in those parts just felt kind of boilerplate Hollywood. I did think the scenes of Alan as a boy were quite nicely done.",

I will not pause, I will not repeat myself, and you will not interrupt me.\"The flick takes birth with the aforementioned enthralling screenplay that smells of confidence dripping off Cumberbatch's brainiac- avatar. We like to listen to him that way. His bold voice that reeks of Smaug fury. That voice of Khan that reminds us of his sharp demeanor that he beautifully donned and carried throughout Star Trek. He literally breathes on screenplay. Don't you just wish screenwriters had more badass words to feed him?Enigma is impossible to crack. So the world told him. Alan Turing, the prodigy who defied a relentless encrypting machine, was the person responsible for reducing the devastating span of war that engulfed Europe by two years. The Father of Artificial Intelligence played God to minimize casualties and nobody knew. The biopic is a tribute to Turing which eases through 114 minutes of brilliance manifesting his love life, his genius, his eureka and his sorry demise.Cumberbatch as the polymath works extremely hard to project a guy who is different from the rest by imparting him an apt stammer and a clumsy gravity. Alexandre Desplat weaves magic in the background with his brilliant notes. Morten Tyldum's direction is good but there are times when you feel it could have gone better. Since, directors believe viewers to be laymen, most of them don't venture into the technical. What I personally believe is that a little bit fathomable technical is a welcome inclusion and if a director makes you understand the what and the how of the work entailed, big things like cracking a code should give you an equal and exact amount of thrill as projected by the protagonist. Precisely what the flick missed.Turing is a war hero often unsung and overlooked. What he gave the world is truly precious. Somehow something tells me, this guy's life deserves a series to portray minute crucial details that couldn't be possibly condensed in a movie. The grandeur of what he was doing and what he did is beyond time. A flick doesn't do justice to his remarkable life.The Imitation Game rivets you with Alan's ingenious almost instantly. Desplat's notes make sure that you don't get a jaded moment at all. Whilst Cumberbatch ensures you witness a prodigy. Goode, Knightley, Dance and Strong fill the screen aptly with their effective and memorable presence. Overall the movie turns out brilliant.A great biopic to watch. Highly recommended.",

Nearly every actor is great, especially Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, surprisingly delivers a pretty solid performance as well.The things I didn't like about the movie are that there are one or two \"clever British movie\" clich\u00e9s in there, which I didn't love. Just little things in the dialogue particularly at the beginning of the movie just felt kind of forced. Also, the movie feels like it just ends, pretty abruptly. It seems as if a third act is missing, or at least cut in half, missing the story behind Turing's years after the war.But overall, The Imitation Game is informative, well directed and acted and has earned a new spot in my heart as a biopic that doesn't play it safe, but ultimately scores.",

Benedict Cumberbatch made a shrewd move when he took on the role of Alan Turing in this film. Based on the true story of one the finest mathematical minds of his time, Turing is employed at Bletchley Park as part of a team charged with breaking the Enigma Code, and saving millions of lives. As with a lot of clever minds, he is grossly under appreciated and comes close to having the plug pulled on the whole project. Cumberbatch brings his own special qualities to what was a tortured mind, in a person persecuted not only for being more clever than those around him from a very young age, but also ultimately persecuted for his homosexuality, something that was illegal and punishable by law in his lifetime. Kiera Knightley played Joan, the only woman in an otherwise all male team and many will recognise Allen Leech, the lovely Branson from Downton Abbey as a fellow great brain in Turing's team. Another person to note is the detective, Robert Nock, played by the simply wonderful Rory Kinnear, who looks more like his father every day.

He was a genius, socially inept, abrasive and...a homosexual. This \"condition\" was considered a crime in England at the time.Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Turing and is in almost every scene. Consequently, this movie will rise or fall on Cumberbatch's performance. I am happy to report that Cumberbatch more than rises to the occasion. This is, IMHO, his best acting job to date and that is saying something. Cumberbatch plays all the facets of Turing's character and develops a real person with all the good - and bad - included. His performance is one that should - and is - being recognized at award time.Abling assisting Cumberbatch is Keira Knightley, in her Academy Award nominated performance as his assistant, Joan Clarke. I've always liked Knightley as an actress and am happy to see her continued growth. Also included in this top notch cast are veteran British actors - Matthew Goode, Charles Dance and Mark Strong.

Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who has a mind for the future. At the peak of the Blitz, the British government recruits him to crack the Enigma\u2014a type of code that the Germans used to communicate their naval positions. Discovering that it is humanly impossible to decipher the code, he brainstorms the idea to build a machine that could break the Enigma and save lives. To put it quite plainly, Alan Turing is the man who founded the first computer. His journey of working with a team to build this game-changing device is only part of the film. The movie also explores the man and his personal struggles of being a homosexual in a society that outlaws such \"behavior.\" This subject matter is handled with tact and is never in the viewer's face in regards to say, showing sexual situations. With Cumberbatch's pro-gay advocacy and him personally seeing Alan Turing as an idol no doubt made him the perfect candidate for the role. Putting aside all of these matters, there is no other British actor who could portray this man and his struggles. Interestingly, the film depicts Turing as a bit of a recluse and exhibiting Asperger's tendencies\u2014he says things bluntly and has no social graces whatsoever. He fires two employees out of merely \"slowing everyone else down\" and he does not understand or bear the time for diplomatic solutions for his fellow code-breakers. At first blush, he can be quickly seen as an egotistical jerk. While the film progresses though, we clearly can comprehend his problems, accept his brilliance, and even feel empathy for him as a human being. Cumberbatch has given us a complicated, multi-layered, yet honorable performance. Graham Moore's witty dialog has supplied Ben with plenty of ammunition for his character as well as add flare for both funny and serious moments. Moore makes a front-runner for the Adapted Screenplay category. The remaining actors in the film are merely good and never reach Cumberbatch's level. Keira Knightley though does have some great moments, particularly in a scene where she tries to help a depressed Alan back on his feet again. \"The Imitation Game\" is an exceptional film. It has a stellar performance by the lead actor. It is well rounded and explains character and plot in past, present, and future settings. It is supported with an emotionally charged score by Alexandre Desplat and has beautiful set pieces from the production design team. The ending is a little fast, but suitable.

Unfortunately and unjustifiably, Turing was persecuted for his homosexuality which was illegal in Britain during that time. Director Morten Tyldum's breakthrough direction is one of the finest of the year. Tyldum is no dumb-dumb by putting us right in the middle of the codebreaking challenges & actions, while also masterfully presenting the complex humanistic persona of his protagonist, Alan Turing. Graham Moore also delivers solid write play on his fine screenplay delivery to \"The Imitation Game\". It is not an enigma that Benedict Cumberbatch's astounding performance as Turing broke the Academy code for a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Keira Knightley does not completely imitate the grand performance of Cumberbatch, but the lovely Keira does shine with her supporting performance as Joan Clarke, the fellow mathematician who ends up engaged to Turing for non-conventational marital purposes.

In school we are all taught what a huge factor the soldiers and allied forces played in winning the war after the Normandy landings, but little is known about these code breakers that were able to crack the unbreakable Enigma machine that the Germans used during the War. From the opening scene, Norwegian director Morten Tyldum (Headhunters), catches our attention and delivers a powerful (although by the books) biopic. The film isn't groundbreaking and it follows most of the genre conventions biopics do, but it does so through some great performances and a solid production design that immerses us into the decades of the 40's and 50's. The film is told in non-linear fashion beginning with how Alan began being investigated by the Brtish authorities for indecent behavior. It later goes back 10 years to when Britain was at war with Nazi Germany and where Alan Turing began working with other scholars trying to crack the enemy's communication codes. The film jumps back and forth as we also get some background information of Alan's youth where he was introduced to the world of codes and cyphering. Alan's story is fascinating and deserves a big screen adaptation as strong as this one because despite being a genius and having saved thousands of lives by shortening the war, he was disgraced and shamed for his homosexual behavior when he should've been hailed as a war hero. The film's greatest strength is the inspiring fact-based story itself.Benedict Cumberbatch has delivered several groundbreaking performances over his career, but I doubt he's been as great as he is in The Imitation Game. Cumberbatch transforms himself completely and becomes Alan Turing. He invested himself for this role and it completely payed off. He portrays the conflicting emotions and inner turmoil of his character in an authentic and realistic way. Cumberbatch and Tyldum do an amazing job of honoring a man who never received the credit he deserved during his lifetime. Cumberbatch's performance and Tyldum's attention to detail in this period drama is what stands out other than the inspiring story adapted by Graham Moore. Keira Knightley and Mark Strong both deliver solid supporting performances as well. Knightley has received a lot of praise for her role here and deservedly so, but I was most pleased with Strong's strong performance as the MI6 director, Stewart Menzies. It's hard not to enjoy this film considering its story alone is fascinating, but Tyldum does deliver a solid biopic by working with a talented cast, having an eye for period detail, and hiring Alexandre Desplat as the composer giving the already emotional and touching story more depth.",

Being from Manchester where Turing spent his later life there is obviously a strong connection. The film is mostly focused on Turing's efforts to break the German Enigma code which was a seemingly unbreakable encryption code developed by Germany in world war 2. The methods that Turing employs in his effort to try and break the code bring him into conflict with many people who prefer more traditional methods.The film is also very much about the relationship Turing has with Joan Clarke(Knightly) who he takes a shine too. Cumberbatch is brilliant in the leading role and even though he will lose out (wrongly!)on the major acting awards this year, it cannot be long before he gets rewarded.",

The cast and the chemistry between them are electrifying with an extraordinary good authentic performance by Benedict Cumberbatch that could lead to an Oscar. With a quick witty sense of humour and dialogue Morten Tydlum's first English speaking motion picture starts very exiting like a real classic espionage thriller but looses it's excitement and only has some peaks throughout the film. It doesn't reach a masterwork piece like other classic nerve biting films, but is not far off from the modern classic Tinker Tailor Toy Soldier by Tomas Alfredson. In the film they show how peoples and societies fears, lack of knowledge and opinions took and keep taking away innocent people and heroes! The Imitation Game is a very well made film that will be awarded and remembered for the quality, the story and the awareness of history and individuality of people it brings up. / Peter A Eldon. 2014-11-05.",

These sorts of things happen when you get greedy.This a spy-movie most of all... I think. Or is it a biography of great Alan Turing? Or is it more of a character study about socially inadvertent, egocentric genius? As if that would not be enough - director tried to tie in several more serious plot lines with Alan Turing's homosexuality and problematics which it caused at the times. Some feminism - first and only female code breaker at bletchley, hiding as secretary (which was absolute bs, there were several female code breakers at Bletchley. Then there is this certain war-hero line breaking the \"Enigma\"-code in most crucial moment to save the Europe - historically absolutely ridiculous idea. Spine of the world war II was actually broken in Eastern Front, at the battle of Stalingrad, not at Atlantic Ocean.) There is actually another, even bigger stupid fiction about Alan Turing saving the world almost alone - as Enigma code was actually cracked way earlier by a Polish code breaking bureau and handed over to allies. Alan Turing was one of the people, who helped code breaking systems further down the road, but in no means did he broke the Enigma-system.Maybe its not crucial to be accurate, who actually broke the Enigma-system as this clearly is a fictional piece of entertainment so why not just give this movie a strong 6 for entertainment.Unfortunately that can't be done either. Benedict Cumberbatch without any doubt is not your average Joe and therefore tends to play eccentric characters. Still - to me it's not good enough to praise his performance - being eccentric - as he looked nothing like mildly sociopathic, genius mathematician like Alan Turing was. It's actually a pretty certain type of character - egocentric genius, who has strong rational, logical and mathematical way of thinking to compensate lack of empathy, social skills and emotional intelligence. Benedict Cumberbatch reminded more of a neurotically talkative, melanholic old lady with strong tendency to feel sorry for herself, occasionally bursting illogically egocentric phrases. I mean - every social type has it's certain logic. Cumberbatch's Turing just had none and therefore wasn't believable as a (fictional) human character. Same thing applies to Keira Knightley's Joan Clarke.So 4 from me. Too many ideas and narratives for just one movie. Cant fit the elephant in a jar - more does not equal always the better. Nothing really stood out to carry the main idea which got lost down the road. Too many stupid fictions about history to take this movie as a story of Alan Turing's life, either. So just a movie about some troubled guy saving the war to the world, dealing with issues at the same time. Poorly executed.",

            "content": "I must admit that upon hearing of this film's existence and who was slated to play Alan Turing that a sort of heavy sigh came to me. I thought this was going to be no more than Oscar bait tripe that plagues the theaters every November. 'The Imitation Game' though really delivers as does it's star the controversial polarizing Benedict Cumberbatch. This movie is multi-faceted and greatly respects Alan Turing. It doesn't try to needlessly or condescendingly canonize him for the sake of cheap dramatic effect. This movie realizes that Turing was brilliant but also very human. How refreshing is that when films like 'The Theory of Everything' come out the same year? The movie isn't just about Turing the man however, it's about Alan Turing's work. This may be the most thrilling aspect of the film.Benedict Cumberbatch has received both love and hate. It can be argued that he merely plays the same type of role, mirrors of his 'Sherlock'. On paper the genius Alan Turing may seem more of the same. He's not. This performance is essential in assessing Cumberbatch as an actor because I think it is so similar to the Cumberbatch 'type' and yet it's worlds away. Cumberbatch's Turing has all the intelligence of 'Sherlock' but none of the self- confidence, none of the edge. This is Cumberbatch portraying someone who is very vulnerable who has to try all the harder to get that edge out. Cumberbatch oozes charisma in his other projects and in his interviews and off screen persona. His Turing lacks all of that. It makes the triumphs and tragedies of this story all the more personal and painful. The story isn't only about Turing's homosexuality and the grave injustice done upon him. It serves as a central part of the character but it is not the only part. Cumberbatch and writer Graham Moore create a character that is so likable and real because he has such intelligence and power but is so alien and afraid.Turing's work is the focus of this film and it's exploration is by far the best thing about it. I know that might sound odd but I admire this movie more as a first rate war thriller than as a biographical study of Alan Turing. Taking Alan Turing and his work in cryptanalysis and mathematics and translating them into a narrative is a tall order. What Director Morten Tyldum and Graham Moore do is add such incredible stakes to the whole thing. It is stressed how important everything is and the lives that are at stake. We feel as if everything is life or death and that this code breaking is just as important to the war effort as storming the beaches. Creating that sort of presence with a film that takes place largely in confined rooms is not easy. It takes great writing, directing and acting to do this. The film is tense and thrilling.This film makes Alan Turing assessable and real to an audience. He isn't some super human or a label. He's an intelligent human being who used his intellect for good in war time. This approach respects Turing's memory and legacy and gives the audience a look at a fascinating historical figure in a way that is exciting. Highly recommended.",

There are so many heroes that go unnoticed for years until there is a movie made about them. I really had no idea the type of effort that people went through in order to crack the unbreakable code. Benedict Cumberbatch gives an extraordinary performance as, Alan Turing, the leader of the mathematicians who absolutely changed the war for the better.Cumberbatch is a revelation as Turing. We all know he is capable of grabbing our attention in whatever role he's in, but I did question his ability to lead an entire Oscar bait film. Well, I think that question can be put to rest. There is so much range to his performance that will surely make him a great Doctor Strange. But the supporting cast is also terrific. Charles Dance brought an undeniable presence to one of Turing's bosses. Matthew Goode won me over, as I was never a huge fan of his. But Keira Knightley gave what was probably her best performance of her career. It takes two charismatic leads to tackle the roles of Alan and Joan. These people were unbelievably intelligent, but I also appreciate the film touching on some of their flaws.I had no idea the amount of odds that were stacked up against them to crack the enigma code. The film said that it's worth 20 million years worth of data settings, and they have to crack it in 20 minutes. They only had a certain amount of time before the Germans would change the code and then all of their work goes to waste. Not only do they have to be intelligent but they have to be mentally stable under these pressures. I guess it really is the people you don't imagine doing the unimaginable things. I may have botched that quote, but the premise is the same.Alexandre Desplat had a terrific score, that is probably the only score this year that I wouldn't argue winning over Interstellar. I'm still humming the beautiful theme hours later. It contributed to the heartbreaking reality that was illegal to be homosexual during this time. Much like Selma, this film opened my eyes to the unimaginable things that humans did, and are capable of. I cant believe that he was given drugs in order to treat his \"illness\". The only real problem with the movie is that tries to give several special effects scenes that are a little too ambitious for a lower budget film. But Alan Turing is one of the true heroes of the war and saved over 14 million lives and shortened the war over 2 years. It's an inconceivable story that is worth everyone's time.+Cumberbatch's range +Supporting cast +Beautiful theme by Desplat+Unbelievable story -Special effects 8.9/10",

            "content": "What is truly amazing for this film is that it is based on a real story. Really this Cambridge professor helped Britain win the war by cracking a code? He really saved millions of people? And nobody knew about it for 50 years, and he ended up killing himself after having been forced to chemical castration because of homosexuality? And we're talking of the founding father of Computer science? If I hadn't heard of Turing before, I would have a hard time believing this is a real story.So this movie is brilliant because the story of Alan Turing is unbelievable. There's something intriguing about secret services, all these Top Secret files that few people in the world know about. Because we don't know what they say, we can expand our imagination limitlessly when wondering what do they actually say. As far as we are concerned, they might entirely change the way we conceive history. And this fact, the idea that Turing died without ever being recognized on his contribution in WWII because it was Top Secret, it's what makes you sit on the edge of the chair when watching this movie.The problem is that, when you do a little research, you find out that the movie takes HUGE creative freedoms when it comes to truthfully depicting the story. It creates struggles where they never existed, completely alters the nature of Turing's work at Blechley Work, and makes Turing meet people who in the movie blackmail him but that he actually never met (to just name a few...). All of this to give more drama to the story. And they succeed on it.Then yes, of course, Benedict Cumberbatch pulls out an amazing performance. The role of a compulsive genius allows him to show all his potential. The portrayal of Turing as a complete asocial allows the script to have a couple of very funny dialogues, that actually make you laugh. And Keira Knightley is not bad, but I bet the real life woman was not as beautiful.What makes this movie not perfect? It's actually full of common places. The one cheesy tagline that is repeated two or three times across the movie. The sudden realization that owes itself to a completely unrelated comment but requires the hero to run back to his workplace. The clich\u00e9 dramatic pauses before an important line. Tywin Lannister acting as Tywin Lannister, but with WWII uniform. Little things that, overall, don't spoil the movie that much. It's still very much worth watching.",

            "content": "Having seen majority of films from last year (except for Birdman), I can safely say that The Imitation Game is the best film I have watched in past one year, it's that damn good. In fact it was so good that I did a bit of research, surely a film this good can't be historically accurate and I found out it isn't which is OK. This is how films need to be, use a bit of creative license and make your product interesting while not compromising the spirit of the film. Not every film can be like Raging Bull (my personal favorite) historically accurate and be an excellent film on top of it, but they can try to be like Amadeus wherein facts are changed but the end product is so much better than a boring accurate movie (how mediocre was last year's winner 12 years a slave? I almost slept through that) . Now that we got that out of the way The Imitation Game is the first on screen adaptation of Alan Turing the father of computer and it's about time this man got his due. Alan Turing and his comrades played a crucial role in decoding the Nazi code Enigma, there is of course so much more to the story but The Imitation Game plays out like an old school spy movie, each character has layers of secrets which are unraveled during the course of the film. The film isn't just satisfied with giving you the breaking of the code but it also provides for interesting themes, Turing hiding his homosexuality which could have severe consequences at that time, caring for Joan a brilliant woman whom he got engaged to despite his sexual orientation so he wouldn't lose her, a double agent among friends, childhood love and how that concept influenced Turing's machine, interesting moral angles and some truly deplorable decisions and even some A.I. talks, this film has so much going for it. The actors are great Cumberbatch gives a career best performance, ensemble cast is excellent as well. It's nice to see Matthew Goode get roles, a talented actor who never gets his due. This film has my vote when it comes to the Academy awards I hope this wins the best picture. I am going to watch this movie in the theaters for a second time which I haven't done since 2013's Her.",

Based on real life events, it was gracefully transitioned into a film that told a significant story but also had all the factors of a great film. The film was filled with all sorts of emotions including Alan Turing's (Benedict Cumberbatch) witty humor and the heartfelt tragic nature of his story. I went into the film not knowing the sequence of events in depth that this story was based on. I was intrigued from the minute it started and left in awe when it ended. To me, it provided a whole new perspective to World War 2; a perspective that I did not know existed. The fact that this film is based on true events makes it even more gripping. Additionally, it adds a new dynamic and a very fresh way of viewing historical events and key heroes such as Alan Turing. The fact that his story was kept a secret for 50 years, leads me to question the extent to which our interpretation of historical events is accurate. The nature in which the film moves back and forth in time to slowly reveal Turing's past and his persona, is phenomenal and a key feature that allows the audience to be further indulged in his story. Throughout his life, Turing battled with various different struggles both internally and externally, which in a way ultimately determined his tragic fate. The most touching aspect of the film, was truly Turing's character. It was his genius personality in a world that did not necessarily accept him. In my opinion, the film revealed the most important aspects of Turing's life in a very cohesive and effective manner. His personality and life prior to Enigma was key in his achievements during the war. The story and Turing's achievements were truly monumental and although I truly wish Turing's eventual fate was different, the film was one of the most significant War films I have seen. Cumberbatch was a great choice for this character, and it will certainly be one that will be remembered for a very long time. The other characters added a strong backbone to the film and story as well. Overall, a must see film, one that I certainly think is Oscar worthy.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game, is a masterpiece of a film that I feel so glad to have been able to see on the big screen. My last visit to the theatre, I saw The Theory of Everything, which has a fair bit in common with The Imitation Game. Both are excellent films and some of the best of 2014, they are both British films, they are both period pieces, both based on true stories and real people and they deal with main characters (Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything and Alan Turing here), who are socially awkward and have very distinct types of personalities, but at the same time, while they may be limited in their social abilities both of these men were brilliant and both have changed how we view things and life here in the 21st century. Both films are equally fascinating dealing with genius minds at work and also how these characters function and deal with everyday life with their limited social abilities and other things that would later lead to difficulties for both of them. Both stories have elements of tragedy in and to them and yet at the same time both of these films and characters we learn to respect greatly and have admiration for, even with their flaws, errors of judgement and little idiosyncrasies. With, The Theory of Everything, as I stated in my review, I knew a little bit about Stephen Hawking before I saw the film. Not a lot mind you, bur I knew who he was and a little bit here and there about him. The Imitation Game, is a different thing altogether though. My history is more than rusty and I knew nothing about Alan Turing, or what he had accomplished and the story behind his life and work before I saw this film. In a way that was too bad that I did not know such a genius mind as his and all that he had accomplished, but on the other end of the spectrum, it was probably a good thing that I didn't know anything going into this film because everything that happened during this film was a complete and total surprise to me and I had no idea how the film would turn out (besides some of the more obvious and the little history I do know), but that I had not known about was surprisingly fascinating and captivated me while thoroughly entertaining me and giving me a rich and very rewarding cinematic experience. I would imagine that most people around my age group, or younger, would probably fall into the same category knowing little about the person, or subject matter, but again that doesn't matter and it makes the film all the more an educational and fascinating experience to be had. The screenplay here which is based on a book and of course, real facts is an excellent adapted screenplay giving much historical accuracy and deep study into the events and things that plagued these brilliant minds as well as the whole world during the second world war. The screenplay is also a great character study and delves deep into what makes Alan Turing, the man he is as well as exposing his insecurities, his social awkwardness, arrogance and pride as well as his downfalls and some of the torment he has carried with him his whole life as well. He is not just a simple character that is as easy to deconstruct as my review may make it seem. This is a multi layered character and person who has so much going on with his personality, emotions and what is in his mind that he is fascinating to study and to watch and the whole thing is further enhanced by Benedict Cumberbatch's spot on and excellent portrayal of him. Cumberbatch is now a household name and a popular one after his successful show and performance in the modern day Sherlock Holmes series as well as being in numerous excellent films over the past couple of years in supporting roles and doing a great job in them and now he has his own chance to shine, and boy does he ever. Keira Knightley, is also excellent in here as well. I find that when she is given great scripts and roles such as in Atonement, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World and now this, that she is a great actress as well and needs more of these type of roles. The whole cast here is excellent and worthy of acclaim and praise as well. The attention to detail during the film's period piece setting was both accurate and appropriate and I like how different aspects of Turing's life were brought up in this film showing many different sides and aspects of his life, some of which many of you do not know about and which I will not spoil for you in this review. All in all a extremely fascinating portrayal of an interesting man with a lot to offer, but dealing with his own demons as well and also this film does an excellent job of retelling an historical event and making it both fresh and important to today's movie audiences as well. The Imitation Game is a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2014.",

I am not a movie critic, and my writing style is not the best, but I just love watching movies and criticizing stuff.So I watched The Imitation Game two days ago and I must say, it wasn't bad at all. The problem is, it wasn't great either. I went into this movie with high expectations, because of it's great reception and its 8 academy awards nominations, and I believe this was the biggest reason for which I found this movie to be disappointing. Now don't get me wrong, the movie was objectively really good, and I loved the fact that thanks to this movie, one of my favorite underrated scientist of all time would finally get some more recognition, but maybe the fact that I knew Alan Turing beforehand ruined the experience for me. I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatch, and when I heard he would be playing Alan Turing, I was really excited. And boy did he disappoint me. His acting looked stiff and during the entire movie, I had the impression I was watching the 1950 version of Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, which really upset me. I can imagine that Alan Turing could have been this anti-social stuttering genius, but to me, it looked like the director wanted to turn him into this lovable dorky thats-just-how-he-is unconventional idiot/genius just to make the crowds love him, and it apparently worked. Cumberbatch's inconsistent stuttering and expressionless face made the fist 80% of the movie borderline unbearable to me. The music didn't make it better, quite the contrary. It had nothing special, and at some points seemed rather out of place. I caught myself regularly checking how much longer this movie was since it seemed to have no end. HOWEVER, I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 because even though I was really upset seeing Keira Knightley (I didn't like her as an actress) she actually surprised me. Her acting was impeccable and natural, and actually made me like her a lot more. The second point I wanted to praise was the ending. Now I am not going to spoil anything, but Cumberbatch's performance at the end turned from meh to marvelous. He was so convincing that he got me to completely tear up.Even though the ending was great, I did not like this movie. But I can imagine that people would like it, since (I repeat myself) it is objectively a great movie, even though I feel it is a bit overrated. I have the greatest admiration for Alan Turing and his work, so I am quite happy that the movie got such a large audience and so, that this genius finally got the recognition he deserved.",

            "content": "Britain is nothing if not arrogant, at the very least in terms of its name. How many other countries attach a statement of quality to their name: Great Britain? Of course there may well be historical reasons for this, and it may not actually be meant as a moniker of significance or quality; but as a citizen of the country it's always smacked of hubris. I've also always found the whole 'great nation' thing a little fatuous. How do we ascertain if a country is great? I hear many different claims for a country to be the greatest on earth, but seldom any independent verification of this. How do you judge a nation? How do you rank in terms of greatness? Most nations are great in the eyes of their own leader or citizens; but it seems a little aimless to try some sort of serious assessment of this. Why does one have to be better than the other? All this was in my mind during The Imitation Game, a true-story adaptation of one of the Second World War's more remarkable stories. Alan Turing - the subject of the film, played with characteristic commitment and insight by Benedict Cumberbatch - was the man who led the team which broke the German Enigma code, effectively shortening and/or winning the war for the Allies and saving a load of lives into the bargain. In doing so he not only achieved what many believed at the time to be impossible, but he also laid the template for every computer ever built. By any stretch of the imagination, surely Turing's was a great British achievement. It's certainly presented as such in this compelling and enjoyable film. Even if you are familiar with the story it's never less than utterly engaging; it's a story I know well and I still had to restrain an air-punch at the vital moment. It's a film that's hard not to enjoy. This is achieved with the understanding that the events of the film were a great moment in a great passage of history for Great Britain. It's not really a flag-waving film (apart from the entirely fair, correct and brief footage of people celebrating the war's end) so much as it's trying to be an honest and factual one. This was a great moment. (spoiler alert - if you don't know Turing's story and don't want part of the film revealed, skip to the next paragraph)Or was it? For the film doesn't leave it there. The euphoria is leavened by what comes next. The code-breaking is inter-cut with a post-war police investigation into Turing's private life, and scenes from his childhood. At the same time as his unique role in the war effort is discovered, so is his (then illegal) homosexuality. Given the choice between prison or chemical castration, he opted for the latter so he could keep working, Not long after, he committed suicide. Along with thousands of men of the era, his life was forever stained. It was only in 2013 that Turing received a posthumous royal pardon. Not so great. Even within the essence of an undeniably great British achievement are the seeds of something deeply shameful and unnerving. Greatness, it turns out, is a slippery and complex concept. We think about too simply. We see something admirable, and christen it with a title. Closer examination reveals it's not so simple. Whether it's a person or a country, a team or a charity, no one is entirely great. There's greatness in everyone and every group, every team and nation; there's also cruelty, shame, abuse, bullying, perversity and hate and any sin you care to name. There's only One truly deserving of the title 'Great'; really all other uses of the term should be with a small letter and a careful qualification. The Imitation Game is a very good film, but with a keen eye for British irony, not a great one. It's finely directed with a keen eye for detail and the importance of a good story. Occasionally it's just a little too mechanical to soar, too safe to really provoke in the way it perhaps could. It is, though, very good, exciting, funny and admirable. You won't be let down and you will, if you allow yourself, be made to think and look more closely at the previously untouchable and unsullied citizens of that far-off island called 'Greatness'.",

Allan Turing was still a mathematical genius, a hero and a very intresting person, well worthy to have his story told, without them also changing history so much. I don't understand, what's so wrong about the truth? Also, they dumbed down to movie plenty, I think. At least once they could have given some sort of explanation on how the machine actually works. Other than that, it was still a good film and I enjoyed it, much credit to Cumberbatch performance but it was also a nice picture in many other aspect and an interesting story to be told. And an important story to be told also. I just got a bit dissapointed when I looked up some actual facts afterwards and understood that much of the story for the film had been altered or completely made up. Still, in its essence, I believe it still holds true in many ways.",

They mention only once \"POLISH\" that they did some sort of poor cracking device machine ? Bunch of lier's. Made Brits hero's. Who don't know history will believe straight away in all that crap which was showed in that movie. The only real thing was the Enigma it self. So read this little past of history proved by facts! German military messages enciphered on the Enigma machine were first broken by the \"Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932\" This success was a result of efforts by three Polish cryptologist's, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki and Henryk Zygalski, working for Polish military intelligence. Rejewski reverse engineered the device, using theoretical mathematics and material supplied by French military intelligence. Subsequently the three mathematicians designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma ciphers, including the cryptologic bomb. From 1938 onwards, additional complexity was repeatedly added to the Enigma machines, making decryption more difficult and requiring larger numbers of equipment and personnel--more than the Poles could readily produce.On 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Poles initiated French and British military intelligence representatives into their Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment, including Zygalski sheets and the cryptologic bomb, and promised each delegation a Polish-reconstructed Enigma. The demonstration represented a vital basis for the later British continuation and effort. During the war, British cryptologist's decrypted a vast number of messages enciphered on Enigma. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed \"Ultra\" by the British, was a substantial aid to the Allied war effort.Though Enigma had some cryptographic weaknesses, in practice it was German procedural flaws, operator mistakes, laziness, failure to systematically introduce changes in encipherment procedures, and Allied capture of key tables and hardware that, during the war, enabled Allied cryptologist's to succeed.",

He is also a member of the Pantheon of Gay Martyrs, along with Oscar Wilde, Matthew Sheppard, and the 1980s AIDS Victims. On both accounts, he deserves a much better movie than this one. Never mind the gross simplifications and historical inaccuracies of his role in breaking Enigma -- that's just Hollywood dramatic license. Never mind that we are shown nothing of the sex life of an unhappily closeted gay man during the age of persecution. Never mind that we aren't shown his suicide by poisoned apple. The essential point is that we don't grasp the essence of the character because we're never shown anything of what he did or how he did it. As one of Turing's colleagues says (quote approximate), \"if you're going to play the eccentric genius, you have to BE a genius.\" This movie shows us only the eccentricity, and requires us to take the genius completely on faith. We are shown no trial and error, no conversations among colleagues, absolutely nothing to let us understand what the problem was, or what Turing saw that others didn't. All we get is a difficult, misunderstood individual, somewhere on the Asperger's spectrum, who turns out to be right when everybody else is wrong. Zero Dark Thirty does a much better job of presenting that kind of character precisely because it shows the thought processes involved.",

            "content": "I watched another film about the Enigma code recently, and it reminded me that I had not yet seen this one. It is a story I was broadly aware of \u2013 not to the point of having read the book, but certainly knowing the general sweep of the events. In a way this does suit the film, because it does brush across the main events in the life of Turning, rather than really delve too deeply into specifics. So we get key childhood moments, the stresses and moral conundrums of breaking the code, and of course his horrific treatment and death due to his sexuality.With this approach the film is actually very well structured as it mixes the global and the personal, as well as combining several running time periods (in a nicely edited construction). As such it is a solid and engaging story, which manages to fold together the central impact made by Turning, the roots of some of his character, and the sad treatment of him at the (early) end of his life. Of course as with any biopic, the film runs a lot together, simplifies wherever it can, and I guess probably will bother those that know the source material / real story inside out (as these things always do). For me I am always happy for such sacrifices being done in the name of a good story, just so long as the film does a good job of telling that story (it is not a documentary, and there are plenty of sources for that). In the case of this film, I think it works, because it is well told and engaging.The lead performance from Cumberbatch is the hook that a lot of it hangs on. He is convincing in his awkward difficultness but yet genius. He is perhaps not particularly well supported by Knightley, although to be fair this is not just down to her but perhaps more to do with how generic her character is. Outside of these two, the supporting turns are solid from those such as Kinnear, Strong, Dance, Goode, Leech, and others. Production values are high throughout, and the direction manages to get a lot of tension out of people in a room thinking \u2013 which is pretty hard to deliver as a cinematic experience.All told, it is a handsomely crafted film, with a fine lead performance, and a story that, although probably greatly simplified, is well told and engaging.",

In order for us to empathise more with him he's translated into the 'nerd' stereotype more appropriate to sets like 'Big Bang Theory'. Real history is bent beyond ridiculous farce to accommodate a storyline populated by 'jolly good chaps' that US public will like better, the whole thing feels filmed on a couple of generic 40s sets with few extras available. Just have a look on American sit-coms sets and you will feel the same horrible sensation that everything was put up the day before and props are all-plastic replicas (which is OK for sit coms).

(In fact, it's a perfect example on how the politics of Oscar campaigns trivialize the whole thing.) The film concerns itself with the tortured life of Alan Turing, whose machine eventually cracked the \"unbreakable\" Nazi Enigma code. Moore writes him as a compilation of idiosyncrasies and throws everything together into a blur that appears to be Asperger's Syndrome mixed with childhood trauma and homosexuality--it all seems so easy to diagnose that very little of it ultimately rings true, and when Moore tries to develop Turing's emotional growth midway through, you know the jig is up as to what the film expects you to feel. It's kind of an insult to Turing to simplify him so easily and to the viewer for not being respected enough to deal with complexity. There's a fair amount of suspense generated (what will be the \"aha\" moment that allows Turing and his group of math whizzes to crack the code?) but a dull Soviet spy subplot clutters the overall feel of the second half. With Keira Knightly, who specializes in period pieces in which she generates zero interest. The director is Morten Tyldum, also showing very little in the way of differentiation. Recommended only for Cumberbatch's performance, which keeps you engaged through his puppy-dog expressions; if the script gave him more opportunities to be as much fun as he is the beginning, the film would have been far more successful.",

Both main characters were exceptionally intelligent and both have a mental condition that will not make you like them immediately. However, this summary won't do justice to the injustice of how homosexuals were (and in some countries still are) treated.Firstly the acting: Mr Cumberbatch gives his Academy Award card. The supporting actors do a great job next to this absolutely fantastic performance. Secondly, in the beginning the dialogs are due to the lack of \"social polish\", very funny. There was a lot of laughter in the cinema.The twist is something you have to see for yourself. Truth become a very interesting concept during this journey. I wonder how much it will take from a person that is not aiming to gain power to actually have the power over life and death. Of course nobody knows how WOII would have turned out but one can assume that these people changed the lives of millions.

The characters are totally unlikeable, especially the lead character; you just can't feel for him or care about his issues. The female lead is likewise unimpressive and they never really develop her role in this story; she just appears on screen once in a while as if she was central to the whole story about Nazi code cracking which has really nothing to do with the story either.

            "content": "There is a film called 'Enigma' (2001), which is an action-adventure romp about code-breaking. It is a good film, worth watching, but perhaps a somewhat over-dramatised, and fictionalized, version of real-life events. 'The Imitation Game', whilst also using dramatic license, still retains much that is true, with few changes, to tell us a true story from World War II. It had remained secret until 1974. Film also puts centre-stage, Alan Turing, who played such a crucial part. As such therefore, this film, whilst having less action, is more down-to-earth and serious, and truthful, and thus is the better film.The film opens with some very good early scenes, that convey well the upheaval caused by the outbreak of the war. The crowd scenes are nothing new, but as time goes by, it must be harder to get the period details correct. The opening scenes, have that authenticity, as well as conveying the great social upheaval of the war. Not so much exciting, but rather impactful and panoramic. Good filming! Also seen in these early scenes is Londoner Benedict Cumberbatch, playing mathematician Alan Turing heading off for an interview. These early scenes, set the style for the rest of the film. Those fans of the TV comedy series 'The Big Bang Theory', featuring Jim Parsons as the obsessed socially-awkward genius Dr. Sheldon Cooper, will know what to expect, and will enjoy the comic similarities. Throughout much of this otherwise serious film, the tone is lightened by the behaviour of Alan Turing. Mr Cumberbatch may be playing a 'Cooper'-type character, but his portrayal is serious, and also so convincing, that we are utterly convinced that he is not playing, but is in fact, Alan Turing. The character is complex, the acting is of the very finest.Another fine performance is given by Keira Knightley playing the leading-female role of real-life character Joan Clarke. This is the third cinema release this year, in which this reviewer has seen Miss Knightley. Previously she played the wife of 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' and later the talented Miss Knightley gave a delicate and exquisite performance in the musically-themed 'Begin Again'. Whilst that was good, her performance here in 'The Imitation Game' is arguably even better. Both Miss Knighley and Mr Cumberbatch play characters trapped by social-conventions. They convince us of the reality of their situation, and a great plot, and great writing, show us the impact, reality, and resolution, of those said situations.There is a good supporting cast, with strong performances from Charles Dance and Mark Strong. Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, and Allen Leech also gave good performances. It was good too, to see brief appearances by Steven Waddington, and Tuppence Middleton. It's always good to see Miss Middleton, as I have now, also for the third time this year. A brief appearance earlier in 'A Long Way Down', was followed by 'The Love Punch'. After her earlier lighter films, it is nice to see her get a small part in a serious film. Last, but by no means least, young Alex Lawther gives a performance that is truly outstanding. His role is an essential part of the film, and he plays his character so that it fits seamlessly into the rest of the film.My one gripe with this film, is it's non-chronological style. I am not a fan of this style, but although I can see why it was done, I still think it unnecessary. It delivers some exposition and a nice little understanding of an element of the story, but in reality, it is not essential. Chronology would still deliver the same impact. I assume the film-makers wished to concentrate on the life of Alan Turing rather than the Enigma story. The film title suggests this and refers partially to his AI test of computer v human.Alan Turing made an important contribution to science with his machines, one that is our legacy still in the computer-age present-day. There is now a museum, that is open to the public at Bletchley Park. The film glamourized the life led then. In reality, people worked long hours, girls collapsed from overwork, no talking was the rule.It is estimated that their work shortened the war by 2-4 years. War-time British Prime-Minister Winston Churchill said 'Ultra' was of the utmost importance in winning the war. The work started by Alan Turing eventually morphed from WWII Bletchley to GCHQ. Alan Turing was awarded an OBE in 1945 for his work. However his work remained secret. He wrote two papers; one on probability, the other on statistics of repetitions, both only released in 2012, they were that important, and thus that secret.This film does not require it's viewers to be scientists. The science part is easily explained and understood. What we have here is an exciting film about scientists going about their work. It was an exciting time. It was war-time. The logic of war is shown in the choices made and the decisions taken.'The Imitation Game' is rated in the UK as 12A for what are described as moderate sex-references. It is not a kids film. The subject-matter is serious. Whilst not an action film, this film does have scenes that show the reality of war.Many ordinary people made great sacrifices, and worked very hard in their roles during WWII. Brilliant minds, like those of Alan Turing, also fought the war in their own most effective way. It was a time summed up best by Winston Churchill, when he said on the 18th of June 1940 \"... if the British Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years, men will say, 'This was their finest hour.'\" This film tells the true story of John Turing, and other scientists. Their story was secret for many years. This great film salutes him, and them. As do we. 9/10.",

While there was, in fact, a genius named Alan Turing who worked on breaking the Nazi's enigma machine, but while the film was entertaining, liberties were taken that to me seem both unnecessary and disappointing. I'd say the biggest issue was the creation of an antagonist for Turing (which apparently really upset the family of the antagonist). The obtuse, hard-headed boss is nothing but a clich\u00e9, and while the writer may have felt it created a nice dramatic tension, for me it was a little annoying in the movie and very annoying when I found out it was fiction.When asked about the way the script strayed from the truth, the screenwriter compared himself with Monet. Besides being wildly egotistical, it's a false analogy. Monet was not using waterlilies to make a greater statement about politics or gay oppression, he was experimenting with colors. He wasn't touting the fact that waterlilies exist in the real world to raise interest in his paintings; he used them as a vehicle for his art. The screenwriter said that, like Monet, he wanted to give the feeling of Turing's life, but his changes seem more designed for creating a pat but effective conventional narrative rather than to create a feel.I can understand not following anyone's life exactly - life is too messy for a movie - but to me it seems if you're going to veer this much from truth you are better off just writing fiction.My advice; if you watch this movie, which is quite engrossing and well worth watching, don't look it up on wikipedia if you care about truthfulness.

He moves from unlikeable to endearing without even a hint of effort, he delivers the film's razor sharp dialogue with such deadpan that half the audience burst out laughing every few minutes. He is compelling, convincing and so genuine that Turing's fate becomes even more terrible to imagine. He will be and should be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.If it is indeed possible to move away from Cumberbatch's performance and observe the rest of the film, there is still plenty to rave about. The film's screenplay is one of the best assets in its favour - filled with witty dialogue and plenty of enthralling scenes. The job interview between Charles Dance and Benedict Cumberbatch sets the tone for the rest of the film and is just one of many magnificent scenes. Alexander Lawther puts in a magnificently convincing performance as Turing as a child, Charles Dance is perfectly cast and endlessly entertaining, and Keira Knightley manages to hold her own in her scenes with Cumberbatch. Director Morten Tyldum has done a magnificent job creating the most emotional scenes in the film.The only tiny flaw in the film is that very little is done to depict Turing's sexuality. It feels very much like Tyldum is playing it safe by not showing any scenes in which his sexuality is demonstrated. However, this is only a minor flaw because Cumberbatch's heartbreaking performance removes any doubt that he is genuinely gay.The most heartbreaking true story I've seen since Milk , The Imitation Game is biopic cinema at its best.",

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsIn a nutshell, \"The Imitation Game\" is a moving tribute to an extraordinary man. It both brings to life and pays tribute to Turing's history-altering and pioneering work that paved the way for modern computing, with nearly every moment infused with apt and appreciable importance.During the winter of 1952, British law enforcement officials entered the home of mathematician, cryptanalyst, and war hero Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) to investigate a reported burglary. They instead ended up arresting Turing himself on charges of 'gross indecency', an accusation that would lead to his devastating conviction for the criminal offense of homosexuality - little did officials know, they were actually incriminating the pioneer of modern-day computing. Famously leading a motley group of scholars, linguists, chess champions, and intelligence officers, Turing was credited with cracking the so-called unbreakable codes of Germany's World War II Enigma machine - a credit that was never came to light until years later because the government had decided to keep the operation covert even after the war was over. An intense and haunting portrayal of a brilliant, complicated man, \"The Imitation Game\" follows a genius who under nail-biting pressure helped to shorten the war, and in turn, saved thousands of lives. If you don't know who mathematician Alan Turing was, then the film is a solid introduction to this complex individual whose discoveries were the foundation of the modern computer.What could have been a very dry and earnest film emerges, under the intelligent dexterity and watchfulness of Norwegian Director, Morten Tyldum - working from a screenplay by Graham Moore - as a engaging and rather extraordinary story. As gripping as its awe-inspiring, Tyldum's deft direction goes a long way in building tension as Turing as his bunch of eggheads bond in a common cause against the Nazis, while Moore's layered, pithy, and crisp script captures the highs and lows of Turing's truly remarkable life.The action here revolves around Turing tinkering with his machine, or simply thinking, which portrayed by an actor of Benedict Cumberbatch's caliber, is adventure of the highest order. He gives a performance that is, by turns, awkward, triumphant, heartbreaking, and, as a whole, superbly nuanced. Cumberbatch brings his immense talent and intelligence - and not too much glamor - to the socially awkward, notoriously disheveled Turing, imbuing the movie's protagonist with just the right amount of strangeness to make him endearing but not schmaltzy. Giving Cumberbatch fine company is Keira Knightley in the role of fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst - and vital cog in Turing's team, and at times even his source of inspiration - Joan Clarke. \"The Imitation Game\" is no doubt a mighty impressive piece of work, but a large chunk of that credit goes to Cumberbatch and Knightley's superlative performances.\"The Imitation Game\" is a highly polished picture with beautiful acting. Beyond introducing the existential and technological ramifications of Turing's work, it tells an extraordinarily true story, and also reminds us how little we actually know (even those with the most power) about what goes on behind the scenes of international relations. The film is fascinating, uplifting, and sad all at the same time. With an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch illuminating its fact-based story, \"The Imitation Game\" serves as an eminently well-made entry in the prestigious biopic- drama subgenre.",

During World War II, the British army led by Commander Denniston(Charles Dance) require Turing's help to crack the enigma code of the Nazis. Now, it is up to Alan Turing along with the help of fellow mathematicians, Joan Clarke(Keira Knightley), Hugh Alexander(Matthew Goode), John Cairncross(Allen Leech) & Peter Hilton(Matthew Beard) to crack the enigma code & end the war. The Imitation Game is an outstanding film. I'm really glad that the makers of the film decided to tell us this fascinating story. Alan Turing is truly an unsung hero. This movie deserves all the accolades & award nominations it has received. The performances are the highlight of the film. Benedict Cumberbatch has given the performance of a lifetime as Alan Turing. Cumberbatch's character is complex & goes through a roller-coaster of emotions throughout the film & Cumberbatch has portrayed Turing, flawlessly. Cumberbatch is so good that, in the last scene of the film, I teared up a little. Cumberbatch truly deserves his Oscar nomination. Keira Knightley is brilliant as Joan Clarke. Matthew Goode is outstanding as Hugh Alexander. Rory Kinnear is great as Detective Robert Nock. Allen Leach is good as John Cairncross. Matthew Beard is impressive as Peter Hilton. Charles Dance is excellent as Commander Denniston. Mark Strong is spectacular as Stewart Menzies. The Imitation Game is a must watch. Go for it.",

            "content": "Easily one of the best movies I've seen seen in at least a year or two.I checked the \"spoiler\" box just to be safe, but most people probably have heard a lot of the details of Alan Turing already.I knew a lot of Alan Turing and Bletchley Park et al, from many documentaries and, or, dramatizations about him and the Enigma machine, etc. But this was so finally done it had many more dynamics. Certainly the best dramatization movie thus far.For one thing the neat relationship to the woman that was his wife (despite him being homosexual). Incidentally whom I'm sure was a brilliant woman but frankly Joan Clarke doesn't look at all like Keira Knightley; but then that's the movies for you.Then what really struck me, was here this guy was Gay okay. It was different times back then. In England it was even a high crime. But in perspective you think about what he did, for at least the few people in government that knew what he did; out of how many lives the guy is directly responsible for saving..maybe millions?, they couldn't leave him alone.He was persecuted and publicly humiliated to the point where he commuted suicide at a relatively young age. This guy with all this courage, and the people that knew what he did for the country hadn't even a modicum of the same courage to stand up for the guy. He was clearly in this day one of the best war hero's of WW2.And if this wasn't tragic enough, one can only imagine what his work would have produced if he were not persecuted to death. We might have had personal computers by at least the 60's (vs the late 70's), etc.Also all the actors did excellent performances, the production value was very high, etc., about as perfect a movie as you would expect these days.A fine movie everyone should see, in particular to learn lessons of history..",

            "content": "Based on a true story, Turing is known as the man who broke the Engima code and saved years of more warfare. I hadn't known of his story and the connection he had with the war before, but I had heard of his name. So based on my limited knowledge, I found this movie quite interesting and compelling. With that said, I feel that the story was presented a little messily. It shows three points in time of Turing's life and though the one of his childhood is easily distinguishable as the past, I did not follow that they were showing two other points in his life; the time when he was working on the code, and the present. Perhaps I wasn't paying enough attention, but it really wasn't clear. This could also be because the British tend to have more subtle ways (for example in their humour), thus their films are more subtle as well.The acting was pretty brilliant. Benedict Cumberbatch whom I know from Sherlock but have never actually seen the show, was tremendous. His character is somewhat devoid of sympathy, and Cumberbatch shows that well, but at times when his character gets really emotional, that was when he was best. It was completely riveting. Knightley, Goode and Strong were great too. Strong has a natural talent to play a character that you cannot trust (not that he did in this movie), but his face just gives off that vibe. The chemistry between the characters were solid too.Also, I did not really understand some parts of the film. The thing with the Enigma code and machine kind of flew past my head at times. It wasn't that confusing but at the point of Eureka!, they were moving too fast for me to catch on. In addition, the conflict between Turing and John did not go into much detail and kind of just left it hanging.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",

            "content": "The Imitation Game is another biopic in a seemingly endless list of biopics that come out every year indistinguishable from one another. For all its self-important attitude and melodrama, it doesn't even attempt to shine above other similarly themed films; it actually revels in following convention to a T. Morten Tydlum, of whom I've only watched his acclaimed feature \"Headhunters\", which I quite liked, here follows the British Biopic Manual at every second, including but not limited to:* Heart-stirring but otherwise functional soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat. * Casting great British actors and giving them stereotypical roles. * Casting Benedict Cumberbatch in another misunderstood and antisocial genius. * Making up many unnecessary plot points. * Hundreds of historical inaccuracies.And so on, and so forth. Cumberbatch gives a good performance, but one that feels too manufactured and rehearsed. I still can't understand how Cumberbatch and Bradley Cooper were nominated over Jake Gylenhall's masterful performance in \"Nightcrawler\", but that's for another review. Speaking of undeserved Oscar nominations, even more baffling was the nomination for Tydlum's serviceable but entirely forgettable directing over David Fincher, Dan Gilroy, Christopher Nolan, etc. I guess the Oscar voters will have a heart attack if they even think of nominating someone who doesn't direct a polished British drama.Now, to my biggest gripe with the film, the historical inaccuracies. Of course every biopic has them, it's practically inevitable when doing a film you can't include every fact and person or otherwise it would be endless. But the matter is that other biopics haven't suffered in quality because of this; Spike Lee's Malcolm X is a monumental example of this and that film even now remains underseen and underrated, and was even practically ignored at the Oscars. The Imitation Game suffers because it's noticeable when something was drastically altered from history just to make it more digestible for a mainstream audience. Although I found it a little better on first viewing, my opinion on the film lowered when I read about the inaccuracies, such as Turing's personality, greatly altered to make him much more socially isolated than he actually was. Maybe the filmmakers thought he wouldn't be relatable or sympathetic otherwise, but given his eventual tragic treatment by the British government, I think they were rather mistaken.Despite all these flaws, the film remains an entertaining affair throughout; it's just that it never elevates itself from nothing else than an affable but completely forgettable film. At least it's a little better than \"The Theory of Everything\".",

            "content": "Review: I quite enjoyed this movie because of its well written script, which was witty in places and the great acting from the cast. The subject matter was also interesting and quite shocking because it's not public knowledge, until now. Its about a super intelligent individual who joins the British Intelligence Agency to break a Nazi code. He also has the help from some intelligent code breakers who help him build an extraordinary machine which, eventually saves millions of life's. I loved the banter between Charles Dance and Cumberbatch at the beginning and the shocking reason to punish him for being gay, was touching. The chemistry between the characters, really worked well and the storyline had a great mixture of elements which kept the movie interesting. What also amazed me was that this is a true story which actually happened during the war against Hitler. The sad think is that Alan Turing will never get the praise that he truly deserves, just because he was gay and he sadly committed suicide at they young age of 41. Anyway, it's a great story which is portrayed well by the director and the actors and I personally think that everyone should know what this genius achieved. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Its obvious that this extremely intelligent man was way ahead of his time because he really did build the first computer which is much used today in everyone's day to day lives in a modern society. He was given the choice to either go to prison for 2 years or undergo hormonal treatment so he picked to stay out of jail but the treatment was rotting away his body. At 41, he dipped an apple in cyanide and ate it, which killed him instantly. This is not shown in the film but I'm glad that I watched the bonus footage on the DVD to learn more about the man himself. I can only imagine what he could achieve today because everyone in the world has some form of technology in there life. Anyway, as a movie, I learnt a lot about a very interesting individual and I'm glad that the director showed the different aspects of his life. Charles Dance and Mark Strong were great additions to the cast and the geniuses that were working with Alan Turing were believable and we'll acted. In all, I really enjoyed the film and I'm glad that the director brought this story to light.Budget: $14million Worldwide Gross: $200millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas about a extremely intelligent man who builds a device to crack the Nazi Enigma machine which saved millions of life's. 7/10",

            "content": "Based upon a true storyDuring WWII math genius Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) leads a team of cryptologists to crack the German codes from the Enigma machine. Cracking of these German codes helped shorten WWII and saved millions of lives. It is more than a shame that the Academy could not see that there were 2-movies (the other one being the Theory of Everything) that were equally deserving of an Oscar for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director and Best anything else. The Imitation Game is wholly important because of Turing's building a machine that could decode Enigma, and, of course, the importance of Stephen Hawking's brilliance in science theories. What's wrong with having 2-movies share Oscars? Nothing. So there!There are 2-stories in here. One dealing with decoding the Enigma machine and the other having to do with his homosexuality which was a crime. in England. It was just talked about. We see nothing uncomfortable within. Too many critics are complaining that this was not presented in a more open way. The real story here is the impact and decoding of Enigma and the effects on the whole world. Detective Nock (Rory Kinnear) a local police detective believed there was something wrong with Turing when he investigated a break-in at Turing's house. The detective could not find anything in Turing's background including anything military, and suspected that he was a German spy. In the end Turing was charged with indecent exposure and agreed to Chemical Castration instead of going to jail. We see flashbacks to when Alan Turing was a student at a boy's school and meeting Christopher. Later Turing names his decoding machine Christopher. The whole production is first rate and Cumberbatch does an excellent job portraying Turning. The whole cast performed well enough to have this movie win Oscars (note plural). Notables included Mark Strong, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, and Charles Dance.Still the most important thing about this is the ENIGMA STORY itself. What happened during that time whether it concerned the Polish who were the first to decode Enigma or Turing's participation this must be HIT HOME: We live the way we do because of what happened during that time by all those involved. End of story. A great line by Joan Clark (Knightley) to Turning: \"the world is an infinitely better place because of what you did.\" So true. Since every time we get a \"True Story\" we really never know the whole truth about certain aspects. That is why those still interested in Alan Turing and Enigma should go to Wikipedia to learn more. And maybe those who do that will get a better appreciation of Alan Turing and of those who helped decode the Enigma machine. Alan Turing committed suicide in 1954 and it is believed he bit into an apple laced with cyanide. Some say that Steve Jobs used the apple (with that bite) logo in honor of Alan Turing who became instrumental in the development of computers. (10/10)Violence: Not really.

            "content": "Film-fan me loved \"The Imitation Game.\" The me who knows something about World War II felt that \"The Imitation Game\" was a bit of an unfortunate farce. Aesthetically \"The Imitation Game\" is like a hundred other movies about British people dressed in attractive but muted woolens who march about speaking about God and country and occasionally dropping their civilized masks and giving play to their violence or their lust. We've seen all this before: the vintage clothing, the vintage cars, the vintage architecture, the golden lamplight on vintage interiors. We've seen it on Masterpiece Theater and Merchant Ivory and Jane Austen films and Downtown Abbey which I've never watched but which I feel as if I have watched. \"The Imitation Game\" is also like a lot of bio pics. \"The Imitation Game\" treats very complicated subject matter: the breaking of an unbreakable code. I wanted the movie to tell me something about this topic that I didn't already know. The film just puts an enigma machine on a table and has a bunch of smart characters stare at it and announce that it can produce one hundred fifty followed by eighteen zeroes variations. Okay, but how? Give me something technical. The movie never trusts its audience, or its own storytelling skills, enough even to scratch the surface of the nuts and bolts of code-breaking. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a fine performance as the film's version of Alan Turing, the British mathematician who helped to decode Germany's Enigma during WW II. In the film, Turing displays symptoms of Asperger's. He doesn't get jokes and he has few friends. Everyone is mean to him. He lives an isolated life with only one significant human companion, his school chum Christopher. Turing is awkward and superior with his fellow codebreakers, and they hate him. He is light years more advanced than they. If only they could appreciate his brilliance! Turing is regarded with suspicion by his superiors. They almost arrest him. They break into and search his home. Again, this all feels hackneyed. Enter Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). Joan is a gifted code-breaker. Like Turing, she too faces difficulties because of others' ignorance and prejudice. People don't realize that a woman can be a worthy code- breaker and they keep her back and put her down. Joan encourages Turing to overcome his Asperger's symptoms and to befriend his coworkers. He does so. A casual comment by a secretary, that each German message ends with the words \"Heil Hitler,\" leads Turing to have the Aha moment that breaks Enigma. His jubilation is short-lived. He realizes that he can't rescue an English ship because if he does so, the Germans will realize that the English have broken their code. Turing devises a mathematical method to determine when to use information gathered from breaking the code, and when not to. Two other timelines are intertwined with the WW II timeline. We are shown Turing's schooldays. He interacts with Christopher, his schoolboy crush and only friend. Christopher departs from his life and Turing is heartbroken. The headmaster of the school is cold in breaking this news to young Turing. Poor little Turing must bear this hard news all by himself. In the other timeline, also interwoven randomly into the WW II timeline, Turing is interrogated in the early 1950s for \"gross indecency\" \u2013 homosexuality. Turing undergoes chemical castration. This affects his ability to think. He can't even do a simple crossword puzzle in the newspaper. He is a broken man. The film insists that his death was a suicide. Some, including Turing's mother, are not so sure of that. I was moved by the film. The scenes of little schoolboy Turing are very poignant; it's always hard to watch children suffer. Cumberbatch is a very competent actor and he plays intellectual intelligence well, which is a rare accomplishment. Not many actors could look as smart as Cumberbatch does. He is convincing as someone with Asperger's. The me who knows and cares something about accuracy in a film \"based on a true story\" about WW II was very disappointed with this movie. \"The Imitation Game\" erases the significant contribution of Polish war heroes and Polish mathematicians to the breaking of Enigma. Like Turing, the Poles were also cruelly and ignominiously betrayed by the very Brits they helped: from Churchill consciously lying about who committed the Katyn massacre to Churchill handing the Poles to Stalin at Yalta to Brits like Stephen Fry insisting that Polish Catholics caused the Holocaust. It was ideologically convenient for Brits to shaft the Poles, and the Brits did exactly that. \"The Imitation Game\" erases the Poles because the film wants Turing to be a lone genius and a lone, martyred homosexual. As it happens, during WW II, there were plenty of opportunities for heroism and martyrdom; Turing did not monopolize the supply. Turing was treated kindly by the headmaster around the Christopher incident, and Turing remained in contact with Christopher's family. Turing proposed to Joan Clarke because he liked her \u2013 he even told her he loved her \u2013 not to keep her in the code-breaking program. He tried to re-start their relationship years later. Turing could be funny and charming in real life. Etc. The filmmakers wanted to create an image of Turing as an isolated genius, unappreciated by anyone, and persecuted because of his homosexuality. In fact Turing was part of a team of other geniuses, and he was open about being gay. I wish the film had been able to tell us more about how a relatively privileged man had been so ill-treated. His working class lover was not chemically castrated, for example. \"The Imitation Game,\" though, is not really interested in probing complex facts, or in saying anything new.",

He's also the inventor of the Turing Test, in which a machine is to be said intelligent if someone conversing with it cannot tell whether it's a man or a machine. Which makes him the father of artificial intelligence as well.What a fascinating man, and to the film's credit, the actual story cannot be watered down. The film focuses on Turing's career as a World War Two codebreaker and his invention of a machine capable of breaking the Enigma machine, which the Nazis used to hide all their important messages, making war intelligence rather lopsided in their favour. Now, to be fair, the film is rather famously historically inaccurate. Turing was nowhere as near autistic as Cumberbatch shows him, he didn't really quarrel with military leadership, he didn't confront any spies and while he was homosexual, it didn't define his life like this film is trying to claim. And that last part is a big problem in the film. Sexual equality is an important subject, certainly, but with Alan Turing there is so much more to talk about. I'd be much more interested in finding out more about his theories concerning artificial intelligence than I am watching him figuring out his feelings about male gender. But now the movie takes its sweet time raving about homophobia, effectively splitting the narrative in half, with neither side coming out feeling whole and fully realized.Still, the majority of the story is interesting. Not a perfect film, but a serviceable period drama no doubt.",

Charles Dance makes an excellent villain, he is always good at this, he has some tremendous scenes of sabotage and obstruction before he disappears without tears. Keira Knightley makes a deep impression as Miss Clarke, and every scene with her lifts the film, especially the last heart-rending scene.

Benedict Cumberbatch channels a similar character to the one he played as Sherlock Holmes in the British TV mini series. There are a couple of very unsubtle suggestions that he was on the Autistic/Asbergers spectrum - firstly in his very literal responses in his interview for Bletchley Park, and inability to look the interviewer in the eye. Then if you missed those clues, an even less subtle separation of food colours on his plate. It's an easy device to explain single minded, focused genius used in a growing number of movies recently (think Social Network). Keira.Knightley is convincing in her role, as are the other supporting actors. The switching back and forth between 3 different timelines got slightly annoying after a while. But these are minor quibbles. If you want historical accuracy, read a book or watch a YouTube documentary on Turing or the Enigma team. But this movie is well written, well acted and a good yarn about a fascinating episode in British history. A thoroughly interesting and enjoyable movie.",

This was an ambitious, and in my view largely successful, to tell the story of the rivalry between Westinghouse and Edison for the control of the electric power industry.\nRegrettably, Moore's success as a novelist has not carried across into screen writing. He had first rate raw material: what could be more fascinating than how the British broke the German codes in WW2? And did it with such subtlety that the Germans were never aware of it.\nLet me be clear that I would not criticise a writer for simplifying events, merging characters or telescoping events. These are necessary to condense messy reality into a drama that can be absorbed in two hours or so.\nI do have problems when a writer completely mis-characterises the protagonist as a socially dysfunctional victim of autism/Asperger's when Turing in fact was not like that at all. Turing did not get engaged to Joan Ckarke. Hugh Alexander did not threaten to destroy a computer called Christopher with a hammer, not least because the computer was not called Christopher. Commander Denniston was not a prickly martinet.\nThese dramatic fabrications pile up to the point that the film simply loses credibility in the eyes of those with respect for historical authenticity. I am surprised that many reviews have been taken in by the Hollywood sheen and have failed totally to register obviously crass histrionics and stereotyped characters.\nThe acting was top class, the concept was simply amateurish.",

            "content": "Going into \"The Imitation Game\", I expected to see what had been cited as the main draws of the film, those being the magnificent story that is told and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, (playing Alan Turing), apparently worthy of an Oscar, for Best Actor. Yet these draws only half come to define what I thought of \"The Imitation Game\". When I look back, I think of how the film told Alan Turing's story and how this man, who had served his country so well, had been treated so badly by it simply because he was gay. Yet I think the film could have emphasised this point better. Again, when I look back to the film, it's not Alan Turing's injustice that jumps out at me, rather it is his achievement that does so. I suppose that's a good thing, but the film could have doubled up as a comment on homophobia as well as on Alan Turing's story.It's also worth making the point that, as an adapted screenplay written by Graham Moore, having topped the 2011 Black List and based on Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges, the dialogue was poor and I didn't really care about the characters, even to an extent Turing. Of course, responsibility for this also lands with the film's Norwegian director, Morten Tyldum, making his English- Language directorial debut. Yet after the film, I soon found out that the production team was also mainly Norwegian, tarnishing my views of what I thought was a British film and I think that this is such a shame. What can be praised though is the film's stunning cinematography, for which we can thank the Spaniard \u00d3scar Faura. Those colourful shots of Bletchley Park throughout the seasons did so well to make me think that it was summer again. Yet unfortunately the poor use of CGI to show London's bombing for example, makes up for this. These did well to detach me from what was going on at Bletchley Park and it took me a while back there to find myself re-immersed into the film. I think it would have been better if we had remained at Bletchley Park throughout, therefore not only just allowing for an almost relationship to be built up with the place, but also for us to experience more of those all year round shots.The second of the film's draws, Cumberbatch's performance, left me wondering what this less charming Sherlock Holmes was doing at Bletchley Park. To be honest, I was almost expecting us to be whisked off into Turing's mind palace at any moment. (I also found Charles Dance's performance, playing Commander Alistair Denniston, similar to his portrayal of Tywin Lannister from Game of Thrones.) Yet if this was what Alan Turing was like, the same goes with Denniston, then we can't fault their performances, it's just that for me I found Cumberbatch's performance to be nothing different from what I already know of him on screen. This has become the sort of role that I would associate with Cumberbatch, which I think he should be careful of. Although he does propel the story forward, I don't think his performance is Oscar worthy, especially when compared with what I thought were brilliant performances by Ben Affleck in \"Gone Girl\" or Matthew McConaughey in \"Interstellar\" respectively. I can see that Cumberbatch will be at the top of most \"Will Win\" columns and no \"Should Win\" columns come awards season. Keira Knightley's inclusion to be honest bored me and her character made me feel disengaged. Her saving grace came in her performance following Alan Turing's engagement. Before that I found her annoying, although I did find the scene in which she is late for Turing's test and is told that the secretary's applications are on the upper floor of interest. This scene makes a point in regards to our then attitudes towards women, and the film again fails to make a point of this. In general, I felt the performances across the board were mostly disappointing, except Rory Kinnear (playing Detective Nock) mostly because I don't think there was much wrong he could have done. It pains me to say it and to break from what most are saying, and I can see where they are coming from, but I didn't like \"The Imitation Game. Despite Cumberbatch's \"not-worthy-of-an-Oscar-performance and the choice of a Norwegian director, what disappointed me most was how I felt the film didn't go far enough in being a comment on both homophobia and women's rights as well as telling Turing's story. For me, the film earns its stars based on how Cumberbatch propels the film forward, its magnificent story, and it's beautiful all year round shots of Bletchley Park, even though each have their faults.",

There's no doubt that Alan Turing's government betrayed him, even after he helped them achieve their greatest victory. After it got announced that Queen Elizabeth planned to grant Turing a royal pardon, Stephen Fry said that Turing shouldn't have to get pardoned, since he didn't do anything wrong; instead, Fry proposed, Turing belonged on money. I agree. No one should forget what Turing did for the world, and everyone should see \"The Imitation Game\".I wonder what all the bigots who comment on articles dealing with LGBT issues just so that they can write homophobic things would think if they knew that they wouldn't even be using those computers if not for a gay man.",

            "content": "\"The Imitation Game\" was one of the big players in the 2014 awards season mounting in a Best Adapted Screenplay win at the Academy Awards. I have to say that I strongly disagree with this decision. The script may have been the weakest part of the movie. While it occasionally delivers and even shines, it also hits the lowest lows from all the factors that contributed to this film. Especially the beginning is extremely weak. The first 15-20 minutes only have one purpose, namely to show us what an unlikeable and antisocial character Turing is. And it does so with zero subtlety. It is as much uninspiring and in your face in an equally embarrassing manner as Graham Moore's Oscar speech was. Sorry, but screaming out to the world that you tried to kill yourself decades ago is just as low as it gets.But back to the movie: Turing fires a couple people he deems unqualified and acts arrogantly by saying that employing him is the only way to find out if the Nazi code can be really cracked. The whole movie is about decoding secret messages, so you would expect that the script would have at least a little bit reading between the lines and subtlety. For the most part, it did not. Then there is another problem with this whole story. Everything about it was a well-kept secret for a very very long time, so you could wonder how much about it is really accurate and how much is merely fictitious. One fictitious point is the way in which this film tries to tell us that decoding the system won the War. Very inaccurate. What mostly won them the war was German soldiers succumbing to the cold Russian winter, which is not mentioned a single time. However, there is a Russian spy sub-plot included, an inclusion that this film did not really need, and the only thing I liked about it is how people actually knew about him. Interesting counterintelligence reference.Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley (with some comedic delight) gave decent performances, but it was nothing they hadn't shown in previous performances already, so I disagree with the two Academy Award nominations. \"Sherlock\" and Assange had pretty much everything already that Cumberbatch delivered here. Among the parts that I liked about the film was pretty much everything at the end. The scene in which we see the two characters meet again and Turing suffer from his medication was very well done (much better than when he pushed her away in boring stereotypical manner minutes before) and so was the final shot when they burn their work after they succeeded. I also really liked the fact that they had to hide that they cracked ENIGMA in order to avoid letting the Nazis know. But even with this stroke of genius, the script failed again when they decided to randomly include a relative of the team being killed and they could do nothing against it in the grand scheme of things. Just completely unrealistic this coincidence, very cringeworthy. Easily the best part of the film is Morten Tyldum's direction. It would have been a lot worse without his great approach here and I'm glad to see he got the Oscar nomination. Great breakthrough for him. He was unknown outside of Scandinavia before his work here.Alexandre Desplat managed another Academy Award nomination for his score here and won the category, even if for another film. Special mention to Charles Dance who played his small role perfectly. Also Matthew Goode was in here and there are talks he may become the next James Bond. On the flashback scenes, I am not entirely sure if I liked them. I thought the Christopher reference was interesting, but they could have kept these shorter. Oh yeah, and another criticism about the script: There is absolutely no way that some of the smartest men of Great Britain would need a random comment from a female friend in order to find out that \"Heil Hitler\" is in every decoded message, especially with the two H's at the beginning every time. That was just unrealistic. Same can be said about a Russian spy being stupid enough to get caught by letting his Bible just lie around somewhere. One part that was very much in the face, initially funny, but quickly repetitive was how Turing was only able to decode the factual message his co-workers told him and did not realize for example they were asking him to grab a bite with them.All in all, it is an okay movie, mostly worth it for its historic value (if accurate), but it's nowhere near the best of the year or deserving the accolades it received except for Tyldum's direction.",

            "content": "It's difficult to show Benedict Cumberbatch, as Alan Turing, trying to figure out how to break the German Enigma code during World War II, just as it's difficult to show the effort being put into any cognitive enterprise. That's the trouble with making movies about writers, puzzle solvers, and chess players. You can't show them as action figures, shooting up a place, killing enemies by the thousands, wrenching heads off. The result is that you wind up concentrating on the drama of the personality itself. The protagonist's social relations, his triumphs and tribulations, his strengths and weaknesses.This one begins in 1951 with the oddball Cumberbatch dismissing the police from his room after an apparent break in, but we're soon back to 1939, with Cumberbatch newly out of Cambridge and recruited by \"MI-6\", which doesn't exist and is devoted to the breaking of Enigma at the famous Bletchley Park. The introductory scenes are sometimes amusing. Cumberbatch, always polite, seems to have no sense of humor and interprets expressions literally. His handful of colleagues stand up at noon and ask if Cumberbatch is hungry too. \"Yes, I'm hungry, he replies, but he doesn't get up and join them because no one asked him to. They only asked him if he was hungry. When a colleague comes up with a useful suggestion, his way of saying thank you is, \"That's not an entirely terrible idea.\"His artlessness is taken for arrogance and he's generally disliked except for one of his brilliant young colleagues, Keira Knightley. (Lucky him.) He likes her too but not for her contours because he turns out to be a pouf. That was a serious crime in England until 1967.Instead of trying to figure out how Enigma's decoding machine worked -- Polish scientists had brought one to England -- he decided to build a machine that would defeat the machine. Promoted to head of the department at Bletchley, he recruited more members for his team by publishing a crossword puzzle in the newspapers. \"If you can solve this puzzle in ten minutes or less call this number for an exciting and rewarding career.\" And the tradition of British crossword puzzles is that they are notoriously hard. \"Name a seed you put in the garage.\" (Caraway.) \"Name a major seaport in the middle of Czechoslovakia.\" (Oslo.) Those are examples from a recent edition of the London Times.The head honcho at MI-6 despises Cumberbatch and his gang and is just about to shut the whole affair down when there occurs a \"Man in the White Suit\" moment. Bingo. The first German encrypted message is disencrtyped by Enigma which, with a bang, turns from a huge, noisy, whirling machine into a silent and obedient servant, standing at attention and waiting for more orders. It IS a big machine too, affectionately named Christopher. It would take up half a garage. I'm glad they didn't go too deeply -- or at all, in fact -- into decoding. I never got past Sherlock Holmes and the Dancing Men.Cumberbatch does fine by the role of the eccentric Alan Turing. He's extremely amusing when he's trying to humanize himself by telling a joke that he doesn't really get. Keira Knightley is Keira Knightly, she of the exquisite iliac crests. Nobody in the supporting cast delivers a weak performance.The story switches without any jolts between 1928, 1941, and 1951, and it follows a familiar trajectory. Someone who is a genius at something, whether maths, the trumpet, or baseball, fights inner demons and is almost destroyed by them. Or sometimes, as here, is himself destroyed.",

I'd bet that many dramatic liberties were taken with deviations from the actual true story, but it is based on real people and real events.The focus is Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, Cambridge Maths prodigy of sorts who was one of the several hired in late 1930s England to try to break the coding, changed every 24 hours at midnight, of the German Enigma machines. Turing was particularly focused because he had written a paper \"The Imitation Game\" and had great faith that it took a very capable machine to match and break the Enigma.Turing is also given much credit as the father of the modern digital computer, because the concept he used for the mechanical computer he built, which was successful, is essentially the concept followed in the 1940s and beyond to make all-electronic digital computers. The invention of the transistor and integrated circuits were just a few years too late to let Turing himself take advantage of their benefits of reliability and computing speed.As the story in this movie goes, Turing and his team were stuck, the machine worked but it was too slow. It needed to do 20 million man-years of computation in just a few hours until the codes were reset and it never could get there. But one fateful evening at the PUB with his associates, a female clerk speaks of a certain German always first mentioning his girlfriend, and that combined with the daily coded weather report got Turning to realize the machine could make far fewer computations, looking for words they knew would be there, once they cracked those the rest were straightforward and quick. It worked, they broke Enigma, and knew of all the Nazi German messages.This brought about a new problem, to act on every message would soon tell the Germans the code had been broken and they would go silent. So they had to use statistics to predict how much information they could use to assure defeating the Nazis but not reveal their code- breaking, and part of that was to leak false information of how they learned of certain attacks they foiled. It is estimated the work of Turing and his group ended the war 2 years sooner and saved millions of lives.Cumberbatch really does give an award-worthy performance, as does Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, a young single lady who became part of the team. When she turned 25 and was still single her parents wanted her home. Always the problem-solver Turning instead proposed to her, so she could stay working with them. Turning as fate would have it was a homosexual, still illegal in England in that time, he didn't marry Joan and in fact was eventually arrested and made to receive hormone treatment, but ended his own life shortly after.Really a fine movie, it tells the story very interestingly.",

            "content": "All I really knew going into \"The Imitation Game\" was that the poster made it look good, that Benedict Cumberbatch was playing the lead and that the movie was about Alan Turing, which many people consider the father of the modern computer. When I left, I was pleased with my experience not only because I \"learned things\" (I always take \"based on a true story\" with a grain of salt), but mostly I was pleased because it's a movie that got me thinking. I like turning my brain off to a dumb action movie as much as the next guy, but when a movie gets you to re-examine the world around you, that's something special. The film shows us Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his team of code-breakers' efforts to crack the Enigma Machine, an encoding device used by the Nazis during World War II. Turing is convinced that the previous efforts, all done by hand were more than fruitless, they were foolish. The only chance they have of cracking the codes and winning the war is to create a machine, one the likes of no one (at least no one in the 40's) has ever seen. The film follows the team's efforts as well as Turing's life before, and after the war.This movie had me thinking a lot about the geniuses we've seen throughout history. Alan Turing (at least as portrayed in this movie) is a strange man, one that does not fit in particularly well with the rest of society at his time. He doesn't react to humour well, he is easily dismissive of others if they are doing things he doesn't agree with and he's not just dedicated to his work, he's obsessed with it. People don't like him instinctively because he's weird and that's a big hurdle he has to overcome because his code-breaking machine is a very expensive piece of equipment made to be in the service of military men, who are not particularly well known for their acceptance of wild ideas. I wondered, as the film progressed, how many geniuses throughout history were similarly ostracized or misunderstood. To make something new, something that no one else has ever thought of, you have to be a little bit off your mark, because you're thinking in a different way than everybody else is, right? Many visionaries must have felt profoundly lonely in their days because of the way society reacted to their eccentricities. What I really liked about the movie is that it put me right there, in Alan Turing's shoes as he struggled day in and day out to get his machine to work, desperately trying to make it to decipher code faster, to show to others that the machine he is putting together is not a waste of time and money. I'm not particularly computer literate, but even I could see that the machine he was working on was a dynamite idea. Every time someone came in and threatened to tear it apart, every time the machine failed to perform as it was supposed to, I was on the edge of my seat. I saw something that very few people in the movie could, that this guy was a genius and that you're not necessarily going to understand what someone that thinks outside the box is doing, but if you just give them time and space, you will get results.Another aspect of the movie that I really enjoyed comes later in the movie, in Turing's life after the war. Without revealing what happens, it's one of those scenarios where you look back at people who were doing what was considered socially acceptable at the time, and you hate them. I understand that some of the behaviour at the time wasn't \"wrong\" by their standards, but I still found myself outraged and the words \"barbarians\" came to mind more than once. It got me wondering how our customs of today will be looked at in the future. Just as the generals and peers of Alan Turing dismissed him as a fool or a degenerate and we now look back and them with anger, will we be looked at by future generations as savages? The portion of the movie that dealt with the building of Turing's machine had me excited to see what would happen next. The segments that dealt with his life before and after WWII had my heart wrenching. I found myself becoming very emotional and I will admit that I cried a little bit at the end of the movie.I wrote so much about what the movie meant to me emotionally that I almost didn't leave any room to talk about the technical aspects. Firstly, there are some dynamite performances here. Benedict Cumberbatch shines as he usually does, but I also thought that some of the secondary characters were very good. I hope that when people talk about what was good in this movie, they don't forget to mention Keira Knightley (who plays an underdog, just like Turing and had me equally captivated) and Mark Strong as Maj. Gen Stewart Menzies who brings in some harsh truths about war that devastated me. I can't think of anyone that was bad, so you'll have to forgive me if I don't list everyone here. I thought the ending of the film was particularly powerful, that the movie as a whole was very exciting (even if I kind of knew where the Enigma machine thing was going) and it actually had me thinking a lot about war as a whole, about how it affects people in the service of the army in so many different ways, and seldom in a positive fashion. I really think \"The Imitation Game\" is a movie you should seek out. It's powerful, it isn't just a neat little story about the first steps towards modern-day computers, it's a lot more important than that. (Theatrical version on the big screen, January 1, 2015)",

Benedict Cumberbatch gives a wonderfully nuanced display as the reclusive and tortured scientist. A very creditable showing by Keira Kinighley should be acknowledged and Charles Dance and Mark Strong are always spot on.Norwegian director Morten Tyldum and American writer Graham Moore eschew straight-line plotting, deploying three alternating time-lines: Turing's time as a desperately lonely child at boarding school, his wartime service in Hut 8 at the top secret Bletchley Park decoding centre, and his post-war arrest for an act of \"gross indecency\" with another man. It seems amazing now that the British state could have convicted, and arguably sent to his death, someone who made such a phenomenal contribution to the defeat of Hitler.This is a film which, important though it is for reviving the reputation of an unlikely war hero who for so long was forgotten or maligned, speaks to us today, both because of our (fortunately) very different attitude to homosexuality now and of contemporary developments in computing and artificial intelligence/",

Although Turing devoted himself completely to his cause, he was hounded by higher-ups convinced he was a Soviet spy. He wasn't. And, even after everything he had done for Britain and to help win the war, he was crushed under the judgmental hand of Britain because he was a homosexual. He was demonized, his war record burned, and he committed suicide soon after his conviction. Only a year ago, Queen Elizabeth II pardoned him. But, the way that Britain treated Turing is truly unforgivable. Thankfully, this film will very much help redeem Turing and restore him to the status he should have held all along.

            "content": "When you are watching a film that is based on a true story which you know nothing about it's a very different experience to watching one you know a lot about. I personally knew almost nothing about the work of Alan Turing and the effect he had on the second World War and from that stand-point I found it to be a fantastic film. I've been told by a reliable source (and also read a lot on IMDb message board threads) that a lot of facts/events in the film were falsified or altered for artistic purposes. While this is a bit of shame I think people need to keep in mind the difference between a movie and a documentary. As long as nothing major or character defining is changed I see no harm in changes that simply make the film more entertaining and enjoyable. This was the number one problem I had with fellow Best Picture nominee at the Academy Awards this year 'Selma'. Give me this over that any day.Benedict Cumberbatch has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Lead Role for his performance in 'The Imitation Game'. From what I'm told he absolutely perfected the character of Turing. Turing looks like he would have been a fun character to portray. He certainly seems to have been an unusual man. The saying, \"There's a fine line between genius and insanity\" comes immediately to mind when speaking of him. A very fine performance but I can't see him taking the award home sadly, it was a very strong category this year.Speaking of strong categories, Best Supporting Actress was quite the opposite. Patricia Arquette is almost certain to take the award home for 'Boyhood' without almost any competition at all. Every other performance in the category has been about as bland as you could imagine and Keira Knightly in 'The Imitation Game' is no exception. That's not to say she's bad or anything of the sort. She's just simply nothing memorable or even a stand-out in the film. I kept thinking she must have an amazing final scene coming up that's going to blow me away, but no, it just never came.I suspect the only thing holding this back from taking a real crack at winning Best Picture is the small controversy marring it over \"historical inaccuracies\". Those aside it really is a well put together and moving film that gives a great insight into the genius that Turing was. What happened to him and his treatment by the courts was nothing short of a travesty. I absolutely loved Cumberbatch's quote regarding Turing's recent Royal Pardon, \"The only person who should be pardoning anybody is him (Turing).\" Sums the whole thing up perfectly. A very fine film, about a very fine man.",

The machine he developed to crack Engima was revolutionary, resulting in him being regarded as the father of computing.However, it's not all about this feat. Turing was homosexual and we see how this affects his life, especially post-WW2.Overall, a decent examination of the impact of this gifted man on society, with sub-plot on intolerance and injustice.Good performance by Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role and by Keira Knightley. Both received Oscar nominations. Good support from Mark Strong, Charles Dance and Matthew Goode.Not a perfect movie though. Many of the details feel over- simplified and Hollywoodized. The military side, especially, is very simplistically told. This leaves the movie feeling a bit superficial and a bit too neat. Plus, for something that is one of the main plot points, his personal life seems to only get a passing mention, and only really comes to the fore towards the end.A longer movie, with a more detailed study of the man, was in order, I think.This said, what we have is very good, and surely enough to spark the curiosity of anyone with even a mild interest in history.",

            "content": "The Second World War is the single greatest phenomenon in the history of mankind. No other event comes even marginally close to the impact World War II had on global scale for it not only altered the political & social structure around the world but also ended up enriching the fields of art, literature, films & television with countless events, so many that even after 70 years we're still in the process of discovering entirely new things about it.Now The Imitation Game doesn't really bring anything new to the film canvas in that regard but it sheds more light on the unsung heroes whose wartime breakthroughs & contributions played a major role in changing the outcome of the last great war. The film tells the story of the legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing & his team of code-breakers racing against time to break the Nazi Germany's Enigma-encrypted codes in order to get ahead of their enemy.Brilliantly directed by Morten Tyldum, the entire story is narrated in 3 overlapping plot lines, each covering a different stage of Turing's life, and is quite gripping when those elements align to work as one but then it also stumbles with its non-linear narration whenever it shifts from one timeline to another, which feels abrupt & intrusive. Graham Moore's screenplay wonderfully glosses over Turing's life & plays out many events in a pretty authentic manner.Coming to technical aspects, Production Design team's most notable work is the electro- mechanical bombe itself which Turing designed to decipher the Enigma-generated ciphers. Filming locations are wisely chosen to keep it as authentic as possible. Cinematography makes fine use of camera, neatly balances the colour hues & retains the image sharpness till the end. Editing is a mixed bag, while Alexandre Desplat once again delivers with a very fitting score.As far as performances go, The Imitation Game features a reliable cast in Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Charles Dance & others, and the performances are definitely one of its stronger aspects. Leading from the front is Cumberbatch who is absolutely outstanding in the role of Alan Turing, Knightley is surprisingly good as Joan Clarke & the rest of the supporting cast also chip in with vital contributions to lift the story up by a great extent.On an overall scale, The Imitation Game is an interesting portrait of an eccentric individual whose works have been highly influential in the fields of computer science & artificial intelligence, is a heartbreaking story of a misfit who never publicly received the credit for his game-changing wartime efforts, and is a biting view of one of United Kingdom's most disgraceful acts that covers how badly he was treated in the post-war era. An engaging, entertaining & satisfying flick from start to finish, this historical drama is worth a shot.",

The film starts with events from after the war, where Alan Turing is arrested from homosexual activity, and flashes back to his time during the war and his time at school as a boy.The Imitation Game reminded me of Argo in terms of the type of film it is. They are both about an event from history that most people probably haven't read too much about. And they are great stories and translate to the screen very well. The Imitation Game had a great chance for Best Picture because it did everything just right. It did not win because there were a few more daring films in the mix.

            "content": "Quickie Review:In the midst of WWII Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant British mathematician, along with his colleagues attempt to break the Enigma code. As Turing tries to uncover Nazi secrets, he must keep his own secrets hidden in a world that does not accept his personal desires. The Imitation Game, is a deeply moving story about the people behind the scenes of a war. The great cast is vastly overshadowed by the performance given by Benedict Cumberbatch, possibly his best so far. This is a beautifully directed, written, scored, and acted film that should not be missed. It is worth all the awards buzz it has been getting.Full Review:Last time I heard of Alan Turing was a brief mention in a documentary about secret historic scientific research, which in this case is the Enigma machine decoder. I know of his contribution to the war effort and science, but as for the man himself I know very little. The fact that The Imitation Game concentrates on the man rather than the machine is what makes it all the more interesting.By far the greatest strength of the movie is Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing. At this point does it really come as surprise that his acting is good in a movie? No, probably not. But is he exceptional beyond his norm? Most definitely yes. Turing was not exactly a likable person, he had problems communicating, often being mistaken for being rude or insensitive. Cumberbatch captures these mannerisms of Turing perfectly. He gets us to figure out what he is trying to say or mean, much the same way he is figuring out the meaning of the Enigma code. This makes it more engaging for us to watch the conversations of the characters unfold. Of course a well written dialog doesn't hurt in that aspect as well. The rest of the cast were also a great addition, especially Keira Kightley who brought a lot heart to her character. The scenes with her and Cumberbatch were some of the more emotionally impactful scenes in the film.Many would think of the battles fought by soldiers with guns when talking about a WWII movie. Even just recently we had a release called Fury. However, in The Imitation Game it's refreshing to see the contributions made by the people behind desks, back in their homes, working daily to help stop the war early. We get to see the failures, the triumphs, the burden of responsibility they bear, and the moral issues they must confront. It's fair to say that these efforts mostly go unnoticed by the public. So I appreciate that the movie sheds some light on this side of WWII. More importantly, I appreciate that the movie does not shy away from exploring the hardships Turing had to go through to hide his homosexuality. The contrast between how the LGBT are viewed back then compared to now is striking. The way that part of the story was handled really added to one of the most poignant endings to a film in recent memory.Sure I didn't mention the problems of the movie, but ultimately the negatives are not prominent enough to detract you from a beautiful story. I highly recommend this movie to anyone really, because I suspect not many people in the mainstream know of Alan Turing. It's important to see how this one person affected the world. \"Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.\"Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",

The film starts after the war and has being investigated by the police and has presumably gives them a reaccount of the events. This isn't clearly defined and makes the film rather disjointed. Especially when it periodically jumps back to Alan's school days with some event that has a correlation to the present. There are many other films that have taken this approach of the film being told through flashbacks:Citizen Kane, The Usual Suspects and Chaplin to name a few. All of which did a much better job balancing out the past and present.\nBenedict Cumberbatch is a talented actor and his skill is well displayed through the film's keen,quick dialouge.The picture isn't really a historical film as much as it is a personal story. Many have pointed out the film's numerous inaccuracies which,I suppose, were surrendered for entertainment and drama. In those aspects the film doesn't fail completely.",

The story will be familiar to most but still manages to have a few twists and turns along the way as Turing's personality clashes with those above and below him. Benedict Cumberbatch presents Turing as someone who is just too intelligent for normal society. His obsession with cracking the code leads to tension within his team and a lack of support from those above him. His sexuality is touched upon at the end of the film and his post-war years viewed from 2014 seem to be from another different world of social acceptability. A must see film!",

So, with a story itself so exciting and humbling, the direction and acting are meticulous. Benedict Cumberbatch grows on you as a character as the movie wears on. He perfectly captures the emotion and behaviour of Alan Turing. The movie is well-paced and has its moments of humour. Keira Knightley too was effective in her role, as were the rest of the cast. The movie also effectively portrays another facet of the war- that of the mental and physical trials of the men and women who were the brains behind the counter- intelligence forces of Britain. The background score adds to the atmosphere of the movie. Ultimately, the movie succeeds in Cumberbatch's acting prowess and the sheer brilliance of the man he portrays. Had the story been fictional, the movie would not have been as impacting. The very fact that this an integral yet little known fact of world history, elevates the movie to another level. There are several other themes apart from war that are well explored and contemplated in this movie, which is a necessary inspection in this time and age.

            "content": "Morten Tyldum intercuts two Alan Turing stories, which play variations on the title, The Imitation Game. The first, in 1951, has a cop interviewing the suspected Commie or gay. Turing sets this up as a game, where the interrogator is the judge asking questions and inferring from the answers who/what Turing is. Man or machine? A machine can't think but can imitate the man who can. As Turing is human, unlike a machine he's unpredictable and full of quirks, some debilitating, some empowering. But Turing can't pull off his imitation of normalcy. When he's defined as homosexual he chooses chemical castration over jail so he can continue work with his ur-computer, Christopher. He commits suicide within a year. Having failed to play the game of \"normalcy\" Turing loses. But he wins the major game, from 1939, when he leads a small group of cryptographers to crack the Germans' Enigma machine and (spoiler alert) win WW II. This is a high-risk game but it's still imitation. He invents a machine that will imitate and thus subvert Enigma. When Joan at the end summarizes the magnificence of Turing's achievement\u2014 not just winning the war and saving millions of lives, but establishing the foundation of the electronic revolution \u2014 she is sadly bolstering the man already broken by the cruel state he so brilliantly served. By starting the later story first Tyldum introduces the tragic victim and then fills in the story of his heroic success \u2014 which renders his abuse all the more terrible.Young Turing discovers the larger resonance of Enigma. To him everything human is enigmatic, a mystery he can't understand. When his only school friend \u2014 and first love \u2014 introduces him to decrypting codes, Turing reflects on the everyday social codes he can never understand: \"When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean.They say something else and you're expected to just know what they mean.\" The young boy intuits this when he poignantly denies being close to his friend, who just died. This is the essence of all the misfit Turing comic scenes \u2014 e.g., the lads' ambiguous invitation to lunch, his lessons from \u2014 and relationship with \u2014 the brilliant Joan, his interviews with the antagonistic Intelligence director, when he's dragooned to abet a flirtation, etc. Having saved his nation he's shocked to discover the web of lies and hypocrisy that define British politics at the highest level. Honor is as fakable as normalcy \u2014 if you're unscrupulous enough. Of course Britain has a tradition of eccentricity and nonconformity \u2014 belied by its rigid social layering and prejudice. So Turing is the typical British hero, a stiff upper lip outcast chap whose solitude leads him to brilliant discovery. But he's equally the victim of a society that punishes the outsider, that until only recently hounded to death tens of thousands of men whose sole crime was being gay. Men compelled to walk on the Wilde side.The real Commie spy in the unit is played by Alan Leech, who is better known as the promoted socialist of Downton Abbey. Acting is the pervasive imitation game.",

Of course, the fact that governments kept his achievements secret for over 50 years has a lot to do with very few people knowing about his existence. This is why, even if posthumously, true justice was made by creating this film, and this great man can now receive the praise that he so rightfully deserves. The entire movie is created, as it should, with an non-ending set of tense situations and moments. Alan Turing is a brilliant man who is hired to end the war but he has no one to help him. In fact, the very people who hire him are the ones trying to get rid of him; in a world dominated by men, his greatest help comes from a girl; but her parents do not accept where she works, so to not see her go, Alan Turing gets engaged with her. But surprise surprise, he is homosexual. Everything, absolutely everything in the movie is done in such a way for you to be kept wondering. I guess the director probably added a lot of content to the actual facts and did not follow the original story to a tee.

Lives are being lost and there is no end in sight for the war. British secret intelligence hope to decrypt encoded communications from Nazi led Germany in order to gain leverage in the war. The code they use, the enigma code, is unbreakable. One needs to know the precise settings to read the encrypted messages and they change every day at 6am \u2013 with 159million-million-million potential enigma settings each morning.The Royal British Army decides to hire cryptographers, mathematicians and logicians straight from university in the hopes that their superior intellect could beat enigma. Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is among those and the prodigious mathematician leads the fervent effort against the unbreakable enigma.As a film, The Imitation Game is remarkable, beautiful and poignant. The plot is harmoniously multifaceted, simultaneously telling the story of young Turing, the war efforts against the Germans and enigma, and the tragic conclusion to Turing's tale. The inherent cohesion within The Imitation Game is solely thanks to director Morten Tyldum. It is only with a clear vision that so many unique vantage points of one man's life could converge into this miraculous narrative. Further, Tyldum's film progresses at a fast pace to capture the viewer's engagement and attention despite the dense intellectual subject material. This effect is facilitated by a captivating score by Alexandre Desplat.The character role of Turing we find in Cumberbatch is not a new portrayal for the actor but it is the most delicate of his career. Cumberbatch brings the potentially off-putting personality of a genius with a superior aptitude for his craft and couples it with the social awkwardness of an emotionally strained man and levels it off at a less antagonistic and more endearingly realistic man.The Weinstein Company's The Imitation Game is just what you would expect from an Academy Award nominated film. It is breathtaking to watch but there are some points of improvement. The narrative seems unnecessarily dramatized and historically inaccurate, especially in regard to the double agent espionage subplot involving Turing.Further, the conclusion as a whole seems a bit rushed. With the movie resorting to abrupt snapshot scenes to conclude Turing's story rather than the smooth progression the viewer is accustomed to with the rest of the film.Please check out our website for all the recent releases, reviewed in full.",

It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing and costars Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong and Charles Dance. It was directed by Morten Tyldum and written by first time feature film writer Graham Moore (based on the book 'Alan Turing: The Enigma', by Andrew Hodges). In addition to receiving mostly positive reviews from critics, the movie has also been nominated for several major awards (including five Golden Globes) and is an upcoming Oscar hopeful. The film is also yet another awards contender to be negatively criticized for it's historical inaccuracies (much like fellow critical darling 'SELMA'); most notably for exaggerating Turing's social awkwardness, downplaying his homosexuality, slandering his name in other ways (that I won't reveal here) and treating another historical figure like a villain (Commander Denniston). As with 'SELMA', I don't have a problem with the filmmakers taking many creative liberties, with their subject, but I still think it's a highly overrated movie.The film tells the story of British mathematician Alan Turing (Cumberbatch) and his special team of code-breakers; who were stationed at Hut 8 in Bletchley Park (the British code-breaking station during World War II). The group worked tirelessly to crack Germany's Enigma code and end the war. The movie centers on Turing and his odd relationships with everyone around him, as he obsessed over his important mission. It often cuts to flashbacks of him at boarding school and tells how he had to hide his homosexuality, from everyone around him (due to it being considered a great criminal offense, at the time).I've seen too many of these Oscar-bait movies lately (like this, 'SELMA', 'UNBROKEN', 'THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING', etc.), as they're all starting to feel pretty corny and overly melodramatic. 2014 is definitely not one of the better years for awards contenders and this film is no exception. I found parts of it to be pretty involving and somewhat intense but then other moments seemed really forced and disingenuous. I like Cumberbatch's performance, as a brilliant but extremely inclusive social outcast, but after hearing how different the real Alan Turing was from his interpretation, I have to admit, it does take some of the emotional involvement out of the viewing experience. The supporting cast is mostly good as well but I didn't care much for Knightley's role in the film (her part is mostly historically inaccurate too and she gave a much better performance, earlier this year, in 'BEGIN AGAIN'). The movie is definitely not without it's moments but it's still pretty disappointing, considering all of the critical acclaim and awards attention it's been getting.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/Wr8Cd6IYNLs",

            "content": "In The Imitation game Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing, the real life man responsible for cracking the Natzi Enigma machine. The Enigma machine was a code encrypting device that helped the Natzis communicate with what was then known as an unbreakable code. Alan is called upon by the British government's MI6 along with a crack team of brilliant minds. Alan is very quirky genius who rubs everyone the wrong way. Along with the way he brings on Joan Clark (Keira Knightly) to help, when he finds her in an open invitation puzzle contest he places in a paper. Alan and his team race against time to build a machine that will eventually crack the code and help allied forces triumph over the Natzis and end World War II. I have to admit this type of movie looked like something I would normally avoid. Something about British period pieces puts me to sleep. I am not a fan of Downton Abbey, can't bring myself to find it entertaining. I am also less than a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, I used to find him odd and off putting. How does that guy have droves of female fans? I just didn't get it. I must now go on record as saying Imitation Game is a game changer for me. This film had everything you want in a great film; brilliant insight into little know bits of history that as of recently were top secret, smart funny dialogue, heartbreaking personal drama and brilliant acting performances all around. There is a repeated quote throughout the film \"Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.\" I can't imagine a better performance in this role better than Cumberbatch. His social awkwardness and introverted portrayal of Alan Turing is transcendent. I am now sold on the brilliance of Cumberbatch. Together he and Keira Knightly make cinematic magic in transporting us to a very important and little know piece of world history. Without Alan Turing there would not be the modern computer we enjoy today. Plus we might all be speaking German. This movie at its roots is about communication. The coded, encrypted way we communicate as society. Most wars and disagreements stem from a lack of one side or another to communicating clearly. There is a lot to learn in the message of this film. The Imitation Game is nominated for best picture and acting nods for both Cumberbatch and Knightly, and rightfully so. This movie is a must see film of 2014.

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the early 1950s, in post war Manchester, Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) reports a robbery to the police, but the claim appears to lack any validity. However, he does have an interesting story to tell, regarding his theory on how machines will one day be able to think and work like man. A super machine of his own was behind his own contribution to the wartime effort, where he was the socially awkward maths genius who was the main driving force behind cracking the Nazis Enigma code. However, after the war, Turing found himself persecuted for his homosexuality, eventually being driven to suicide.Many years after the last effort, another film dramatising the events at Bletchley Park that played a, if not the, key role in Britain winning the war has come by, and much like the American offering U-571, there have been some frowning down comments from critics, especially those here on IMDb, about the historical accuracy and relation to truth. With a certain amount of creative license required to be an effective film in itself anyway, and not having that much knowledge about the ins and outs of it all myself, I choose to simply judge The Imitation Game on its aesthetic merits as a film on which there is much to recommend.Gradually building his profile over the recent years, in time this will come to be regarded as Cumberbatch's signature role, the part that really gave him his kudos as a mainstream, A list actor and performer. It is a performance that requires complete transformation, and that couldn't be done with any half measures, and so he becomes the distinctive Turing, with the dress, mannerisms and posture to really believe this awkward, unassuming, introverted nerd is really in front of you, and you are party to his dogged, seemingly insane determination to win the war he knows it will be won. If you think of the world we live in today, and how computers now really are controlling everything (probably more than humans), then depending on whether you think that's more of a benefit or a curse, the character will stir your emotions more either way. But aside from this, it's an unsettling reminder of a comparatively recent period of our time when unspeakable bigotry was law and simply inhuman methods to enforce it so destroyed some of our greatest minds.An impressive supporting cast, most notably Keira Knightley as Turing's insincere love interest, but also including Charles Dance, Matthew Goode and Mark Strong in other key roles, undoubtedly add to the overall mix in a positive way. It retells a story everyone was probably already aware of, but from a different angle and shining uncomfortable new light on grubbier aspects of it. ****",

I've already heard quite a bit about this movie so I was really eager to see it and I had the opportunity to attend a premiere of the film on Monday evening. A brilliant, brilliant, brilliant work by Benedict Cumberbatch. The man is a masterful actor, he's genuinely good in this movie; me writing those things about how amazing he is, it's almost a clich\u00e9 at this point. He just nailed it and 300% deserves his Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role. In addition to be well performed this film is also very well directed by Morten Tyldum, who is nominated for best director as well. The work he did with this film by portraying this time period in which people were actually fighting a war without ever touching any guns, it feels like their purpose is even more important than the physical combats that are going on. Moreover, Alan Turing is not the most likable person at first, a bit rude but really smart. It's complicated to understand him but through Benedict Cumberbatch performance, the script and the direction you just find yourself liking this man. This movie is not just about a man who is gay in a time period where it was literally illegal. It's largely about the struggle of hiding who you are and the difficulties that come with it. I think Cumberbatch got it right: the pain and torture it must be for someone to imitate something you're not.Overall this film looks terrific, the score and performances are excellent and the dialogue is so good that at one point you don't think at it like a dialogue anymore as you're so invested in the movie and the plot. It well deserves its Oscar nomination for Best picture.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game was hot-Oscar buzz when it was released in 2014. The story is about Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a mathematician assigned the task to break the unbreakable Nazi code called \"Enigma\". Cumberbatch gives an incredible performance as Turing which earned him an Academy nod. Upon further examination, it seems like an obvious choice to cast the Sherlock actor to play the part. The other stand-out performance I'd like to discuss is Keira Knightley as the spunky, humorous, and compassionate Joan Clarke, who is the lone woman working to break Enigma in secret who is an inspiration of social change.However inspirational, Turing's story is devastatingly sad. Instead of being praised and honored as a hero, he was arrested for indecency (being gay) and was subjected to chemically-induced castration. He committed suicide the year after. All that hard work, all those hours he spent, all the lives he saved amounted to nothing. He was given a posthumous royal pardon by the Queen in 2013, but that doesn't quite make up for what happened.I'm going to try and end this review on a high note, all of what he did do did amount to something. I wouldn't be here typing on this computer (also known as a \"Turing machine\") had it not been for him. And while unknown to many, he and his team took part in saving the war and do deserve to be honored for that. Remember kids, \"sometimes it's the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine\". I highly recommend this movie to teens, though it is not easy viewing it's a powerful and beautiful story about persistence and the hidden heroes of WWII.",

In order to make this a film suitable for everyone in the family,the director almost completely took off all the hard edges of the storyline which made the film look like a TV film. There are too many clich\u00e9d characters like the ones played by Charles Dance,Keira Knightley,etc. It reminded me of \"A Beautiful Mind\" although that was a much better film. It is just too melodramatic and abundant with Hollywood clich\u00e9s almost reminiscent of The King's Speech. It is still a good film, but I expected much more from a movie that has been lauded by so many critics. However, its sappy,sugarcoated nature will make it a contender at the Oscars.",

The cast are well cast and in fine form across the board. Headliners Cumberbatch and Knightley are reliably excellent but Matthew Goode and Mark Strong shone particularly brightly for me. Clever use of short war sequences amongst the studious battles on paper keep us grimly aware of what happens if they fail.Of course there are factual errors, artistic licence with some story lines and so on: entertainment has to, to be entertaining and not a security video.

            "content": "I haven't had much time for movies lately, being caught in tumultuous events in Greece and all they show about a broader game and narrative. I've had less time to write about them because I try not to write reviews about whether you should rent something or not. No one should care, least of all you. I'm primarily interested in a perception of how things come to be, the relationship between viewer and image, the mechanics of captivation of that viewer, the nature and role played in this by intuition, perception in general. And a key insight is that things must inspire their truth the way love inspires poetry and truth must be deeply felt otherwise we're only putting words together.This, it does not inspire me, it is not deeply felt in ways I'm attuned to (though it has deep feeling). It arrives at its tender insights with the canned sobriety of Oscar type films, indeed it is better than several winners of late, Argo and King's Speech come to mind, and this is almost entirely because its narrative gears align (and that Cumberbatch is great) and this is what I'd like to point out.So it begins with a narrator who capriciously muses that he's going to be in control of a narrative we're going to see and we'll have the responsibility of deciphering sense. Something has been stolen from him as the film begins, something he has kept secret for long that suspicious policemen set out to investigate. The spy narrative that follows is about the same man having to wrestle control of a narrative and decipher its sense; German communications during WWII.So when we get to the end and gears align during an interview (which incidentally is designed to align with the Turing Test) we get to note that what was stolen from him, after contributing spectacular work for the salvation of humanity (from Nazi peril), was nothing short of full expression of his work, his sexuality, his freedom. We also get to note a completely unevolved social machine that mangles difference in its cogs, the child prodigy in public school and the homosexual man in public office alike.We see how the the larger narrative is driven by illogical instinct - it's the same instinct that drives boys at school to force him under the floor, nations to senseless war and to laws that repress. And with a little discerning on our part, how it's this illogicality when it takes tangible shape around us that allows us to perfect notions and narratives, devise solutions - the ENIGMA work only possible because of rival German machines designed to confound sense, antiwar sentiment because of horrible war, acceptance because of senseless repression.And we see how the breaking of the German cipher was only possible because of human illogicality in the gears of the machine (sloppy operators, laziness of habit). And deeper yet how this illogicality extends to a game of flirting in the local pub that completely mystifies Turing; humor, love, poetry, emotion, all no less illogical than war.So as a biopic this is probably okay, though I question the decision to end it with a despondent Turing and a suicide. But I miss the more interesting kind of insight about a mind that tries to balance in a world where any attempt to force a clean narrative and logic only prevents us from skiing on the turbulence that lets us go places. This is too clean.",

Granted, some of my contentment may have been due to my viewing of this film being paired with the insufferable \"Birdman\", but what I found in \"The Imitation Game\" was a genuinely intriguing story with a well written script and a well produced film, the final product of which was a wonderful movie going experience. While \"Birdman\" makes one wonder how ingratiating a \"Best Picture\" nomination should really be these days, \"The Imitation Game\" reminds us that there are still good movies being made that feature original stories that the world desperately needs to hear.A cursory summary of the film is that Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of Alan Turing, a mathematical genius who conceives of the world's first computer during World War II. The movie then tells the story of Turing's struggle to build the machine that would help the allies decipher Nazi radio codes and thereby win the war.Cumberbatch turns out a strong performance, as does the rest of the cast. Keira Knightly is pleasing to the eye, as always, and her performance is deserving of her Best Supporting Actress nomination. Most importantly, though, is that this film conveys an important moral \u2014namely that societal norms sometimes (especially historically) impose themselves in terrible ways with horrific consequences. Turing's story is one that the world needs to hear now, more than ever, as it struggles with LGBT rights. \"The Imitation Game\" is cinema at its finest\u2014important narratives taking life on screen in a way that engages the audience while pleasing the viewer. 10/10 stars!",

            "content": "Rather recently I have read a periodical in a technical text, albeit outdated, it pointed out an interesting point. We do all believe that nature is surely most efficient and flawless system to be ever created- what a common misconception- even function such as photosynthesis wastes more than it produces. Similar thing happens with natural selection- inequalities forming mutations during the DNA synthesis are the only thing that drives the evolution- if not a copy mistake we would've barely moved further than a small microbe. On the other hand, such mutations, are not widely acceptable by the nature- nature eliminates everything that is different- be it a frog without a leg, or leopard with white socks- and here comes the inefficiency. If nature wants to improve by making mistakes, why does it want to erase them short while later?The Imitation Game doesn't address this process, but on borderline, you can see it. That is if you pay attention, which we are strongly advised in the opening minutes, same as information that in the end, after hearing the story, we're to make a decision- is our unlikely hero Alan Turing a human or a machie, a mistake in the system or its key note? To arrive to the conclusion (with clever use of non-chronological time lapses), we are to burrow into mind of Alan Turing, most acclaimed mathematician of recent century (albeit awarded for his doing in 2013), a professor at Cambridge, and an unique personality. This story is a biopic, it depicts on his life and his doings, most notable being a huge part of Enigma cracking. Of course disarming of the German Device goes to many names and countries- Poland for starting it, being the pioneers and inventors of the first machine; the governments keeping it a secret; soviets having a go- but, this being movie about Turing, his actions make for a highlight. I, being an introverted person, struggling to form a simple sentence or participate in any social activity- could understand the frustration of Alan. I know I speak different, I know that sometimes it looks like I don't feel things, it's not my fault, you take it for granted as you can do it, while I struggle keeping end with end and your giggling is not helping. Not all people are going to accept you, it is natural selection, some will praise you and cheer at your successes, some will just wait till you trip- it's life, it's natural some people are more primitive than other. Turing is a person hard to like- arrogant, autistic genius- that would surely sneer at your idiocies and confusingly gape at any remark. With a squeaky accent and intervals in speech he makes for a poor companion, if not Joan, a revolutionary only-woman on the team, played by Kiera Knightley, the entire film would've surely end up being an one-man show. And I know, either way, that the lead actor (Ben. C.) would've managed to hold it up, his performance is strong (maybe not worthy a win, but surely a nomination) but it trips at times, the accent sometimes feels inconsistent, and his role differs just slightly from pieces that made his milestones. The strongest thing about Ben, is that he can play clever (god bless, in real life he's all but smart), it has to be clear and fast voice going well with the Victorian triangular face. Greatest talent of this freshly-emerged A-list actor is that he can take arrogant and unlikable into a passable, charismatic pals. We don't get offended when he insults the public, we laugh and respect him. That's a rare thing. (Although, I really don't want him to get an Oscar, Sherlock production is slow as it is). There's no member of cast that doesn't do a good job. The movie is accompanied by a great score, fine script and cinematography. It's two hour run might drag, although this is due to compact location of story rather than the plot (which has no dull point and is tense from start to finish). The lack of context on Enigma can anger some, and I've heard that there are some historical inconsistencies (but I don't know the first thing about history, so cannot comment). Other notes:-I did not read the biography or watched too much source material to comment on their accuracy. I cannot say how accurate thing is without reading at least 3 different accounts; how can you judge without having strong points of evidence?-Felt little like A Beautiful Mind-The copper coil wire was funny, especially when you know what happened recently-It takes place in Manchester, at Manchester University with alumni of Lead Actor. Manchester should be chuffed. It is not really. -Cumberbatch has low chances of beating other Oscar candidates- he's not only genius this year- but then again, I cannot say without watching -People laughed, frequently. -Some people cried, I personally felt sad too. Watchability 8/10 (I would eagerly put it back on) Overall 76/90* 85%*(originality to the source is not being counted)",

            "content": "This film is based on the life of Alan Turing, the father of the modern computer. He is a truly remarkable character, responsible for the era of technology in which we live and one of the most brilliant people of the 20th century. This film focuses mainly on Turing's effort, during the Second World War, to decipher the secret codes of German military communications, hitherto undecipherable. The film, however, also addresses the issue surrounding Turing's homosexuality.As it was a period film based on a book, I was already expecting some mishaps to the true story, and it was unsurprisingly that I read some reviews where it was mentioned. But I am not the best person to evaluate this because I do not know the figure of Alan Turing in detail, nor did I dedicate myself to read that book to see if it shares the same flaws. But yes, I admit such possibilities and, given that it is a period film based on a true story, this is something that I personally penalize. I am one of those people who understand that, in these cases, freedom of creation must be well demarcated. Another thing I would like to understand better is whether the book, like the film, takes Turing's suicide for granted, since there were serious doubts about it at the time. Aside from these reservations, I had no major problems with the script that, without giving too much detail, sweeps the scientist's life very close to death, making use of the flashback to visit and present situations from the past.Morten Tyldum ensures effective and competent management. He is a director I didn't know yet and who has been circulating more on television, but he did a good job. Benedict Cumberbatch, whom I only remembered seeing play secondary roles and the villain of \"Star Trek Into Darkness\", had his opportunity to show value and did not disappoint. He was devastating in the main role, complex and psychologically challenging character. The work paid off well, and although I haven't seen many of the films he came in after this one, seeing his filmography here on the website is enough to see how much his career has benefited and grown. Next to her is Keira Knightley, a veteran of period films, with an already solid career. Rory Kinnear, Matthew Goode and Charles Dance also did a good job.Technically, there is little to say about this film. The filming and photography work was well done but the exquisite editing and post-production effort, with all those flashbacks, stands out particularly. The soundtrack, by Alexandre Desplat, is to be congratulated and remains a little in the ear after the film ends. The sets and costumes are excellent and I think they are faithful enough to the period portrayed.Oscar winner (Best Adapted Screenplay) was nominated for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Edition, Best Soundtrack and Best Production Design. Not being a perfect film, I think it was relatively close to that.",

But to my surprise i was wrong because this is a great movie. The story is based around a man named Alan Turing and what his part was in the war. Alan is kind of a outcast and is sort of the odd one out and is played brilliantly by Benedict Cumberbatch. I really bought him as this character and he definitely brought something to this movie. In Fact all the acting in this movie was fantastic. There was not a single bad performance. The movie revolves around turning and his team trying to crack the enigma code however also touches on other subjects in turnings life which i will not spoil but i will say that is was a pleasant surprise that this was in the movie. However i felt that they could of spent a little more time with certain things in turnings life and the ending did feel a bit quick. Overall i thought that this film was great and i say that you should check it out. 8/10",

Although the script has some glitches, what definitely sells this movie and makes it worth a multiple of view is the brilliant performance of Benedict Cumberbatch.

The emergence of Joan in the film is such a gift, because she cares for Alan unconditionally, without asking for any return. I was deeply touched by her selfless sacrifice she offered Alan when Alan told her the secret. The thriller aspect of the film is very good too. The film successfully shows how there's so much at stake to crack the code, which seems impossible. The ending is so sad and moving. It's so sad that Alan Turing had to face such a horrible fate.

Cumberbatch has easily given his best performance and definitely in my top three favorite performances this year (along with Michael Keaton and J.K. Simmons). There were times where I didn't like him cause he was an asshole. Then the more we get into the film and see his character react well with his colleagues, I really start liking him more and more. Eventually, I just felt heart broken with what has happened to him (I won't spoil it but it is truly is disgusting). Keira Knightley also did a fantastic job. I usually enjoy her performances but I don't see her that often so it is refreshing.The story overall is well done also. Morten Tyldum did a good job on its direction and kept me fascinated through the entire movie. My only gripe is that in the movie there are time jumps. There will be flashback, present, and future scenes. Eventually the movie does sort of get jumbled up, confusing where we are in the story. The future scenes were maybe 10 years later after dealing with Enigma but Cumberbatch really looked the same age, if the makeup crew did something to make him look older that could have helped, but it was hard to notice.This movie is definitely a well-made film. Cumberbatch's performance is definitely one of my favorite performances this year. The cast and dialogue is well done to where it seems so real and I forget that it's all scripted. It's just shocking to know what people would do to those if they find those people were homosexual. It's just that the time skips got jumbled; confusing what time frame we're in. Despite that, The Imitation Game is definitely a movie that is one of my favorites this year. I do plan on seeing this again and will buy it on Blu Ray.",

Of course the whole breaking the code is not that understandable unfortunately, and the presentation of it isn't helping.

These five people broke the code used by Hilter and as reported, probably ended the war 2 yrs. earlier than if the code was not broken. This is a story of the breaking of the code and more importantly the story of Alan Turing - a very interesting and brilliant man who struggled with who he was. The performance by Benedict Cumberbatch is so good - no wonder there is Oscar talk. You see the internal struggle and learn so much more about him. Kiera Knightly is excellent as the only woman in this group - in a time when women were only allowed to be secretaries. All of the characters are well portrayed. In a year of many films made on true life people this one stands out. I hope the past history of the Academy - to not honor biographical movies - changes this next award ceremony.

            "content": "Benedict Cumberbatch seems to be making a career out of playing troubled and flawed genius's, following his huge success as Sherlock Holmes in the TV series Sherlock and the upcoming - and hugely exciting - Dr. Strange in Marvel's upcoming film based on the sorcerer supreme. His finest work so far is in The Imitation Game as code-breaker Alan Turing, the unsung war hero who helped crack the apparently unbreakable Enigma machine used by the Germans during World War II, helping to save millions of lives in the process and shaving years off the war.Turing was recognised as a prodigy from an extremely young age, and his cerebral superiority isolated him from others. He travels to Beltchley Park, where Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) interviews him as part of a recruitment process to form a cryptology team headed by chess champion Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode), tasked to break the Enigma code. Turing gets the job through sheer intellectual brilliance, but not through his condescending personality, which instantly puts him at odds with the rigid and impatient Denniston. When he joins the team, which also consists of John Cairncross (Allen Leech) and Peter Hilton (Matthew Beard), he wastes no time in voicing his desire to work alone and dismisses the input of the others as simple time-wasting.Director Morten Tyldum and writer Graham Moore have not created a work of any great intelligence or subtlety here, and The Imitation Game plays very much by the standard biopic rule book. No great care goes into helping us understand the inner workings of the Enigma itself, or the work done by Turing and his fellow code-breakers, and the film very much relies on great acting and a fast pace. The scenes with Turing, Alexander et al hard at work has them with sleeves rolled-up and chewing pencils whilst staring at boards. We don't quite know what they're doing, but we are certainly urging them to achieve their goal, and, of course, this being a film about Turing, there's only so much of his work that can be squeezed into two hours.The Imitation Game also helps make the story relevant to the modern day. At the beginning of the film, set after the war, Turing is burgled and his flippant dismissal of the investigating Detective Nock (Rory Kinnear) puts him under suspicion. He is arrested for participating in lurid acts with a man, a crime punishable by up to two years in prison back then. It all ties in nicely with the recent official apology from Gordon Brown, then-prime minister in 2009, and his official pardon by the Queen in 2014. Flashbacks of Turing's early childhood at a boarding school and his relationship with close friend Christopher Morcom (Jack Bannon) are peppered throughout. They help gain an understanding of Turing's love of cryptology and his emerging sexuality, and these scenes are finely played by the young Alex Lawther and do in no way hinder the flow of the film.But the film's trump card is undoubtedly Cumberbatch. Although his delivery at times can border on stage-y, he has a great weight to his voice. His face exudes such intelligence and charisma that you just want to pick it apart to see what's under there. Keira Knightley too, who I haven't even mentioned yet, is a surprise revelation as Joan Clarke, a fellow prodigy puzzle-solver who, being a woman, had to be hidden away as regulations didn't permit women positions of worthy status. She is fierce and full of life, the polar opposite to the withdrawn and work-focused Turing. Yet the two develop an intriguing and entirely convincing platonic love affair, leading to their short-lived engagement in 1941. It's covered with a thin layer of gloss and a longer running time with more careful story development would have been beneficial, but The Imitation Game is consistently thrilling and engaging, bolstered by a great ensemble.",

Well produced exciting and dramatic and moving especially how they use the brain to defeat the enemy. However there are some faults. There are some things wrong with the screenplay. Most glaringly there are historical inaccuracies for dramatic storytelling purposes that are obvious even without reading up about them. The part about possibly saving the brother of a team member is too hard to believe. And how they had to decide how to use the information - it is ludicrous that they would be in charge of that. The main breakthrough is too sudden to be believable. The military person played by Charles Dance seems exaggerated to be a dramatic obstacle. The shifting back and forth in time was a bit too much. It would have been better to have had the arrest for homosexual behavior all at the end instead of interspersed throughout.The acting is good. Kiera is too beautiful for the role but it doesn't matter because it makes it watchable. Who would have wanted to see a plain Jane as the only main female character. Maybe someone plainer like Emily Blunt would have been more like the real person. Matthew Goode and Downton Abbey's Allen Leech provide support as other members of the team. Benedict Cumberbatch looks suitably vulnerable and plays it very Sheldon Cooper eccentric. Read that in real life Alan Turing he wasn't really so odd. Better not to read up on the fact vs fiction beforehand as it will spoil the experience, so just accept the inaccuracies as dramatic leeway to make a possibly rather dry story dramatic.

In Enigma the characters showed real stress, real hard work, and real pressure. All the characters in The Imitation Game do is talk about \"how hard it is\", hand to weary forehead, but it is all unbelievable pretendsies. The execs in charge of the focus groups then throw in a dash of feminism to cynically engage a female audience who they think might be turned off by a geeky plot.The twists and turns of supposed imminent sackings and simple minded explanations of the counter espionage tactics (supposedly worked out by Turing) is just absolute nonsense. It fails to realistically portray the real great love of Turings life, his schoolboy friend, and chooses to play up the misplaced proposal to Keira Knightly.This movie takes a great story of triumph, achievement followed by tragedy, and reduces it to a lame romance.",

            "content": "To preface this review, I should mention that prestige biopics, Oscar season dramas and other true-story films of this ilk are not exactly the kind of film I hold in highest regard. Not to sound too snobby, but I'd rather watch a David Lynch or Coen brothers movie over a period piece any day of the week. That being said, when a film like The Imitation Game actually does impress me, that means it must be doing something right. I think this film is very much worth seeing \u2014 and that there's a lot to admire here \u2014 even if it's not the most artistic or unique movie of the year.Benedict Cumberbatch is the standout element here. His performance, which is backed up strongly by costar's Keira Knightley, transcends the somewhat generic filmmaking and bland direction, and helps to give it more genuinely likable and interesting qualities overall. Cumberbatch gives this material his all, and his performance is nuanced and believable; he's even able to deliver some of the clunkier dialog gracefully.The Imitation Game is lucky in that it's a legitimately fascinating true story. It's a war story about a less glorified, less talked about aspect of warfare, and the portrayal of Alan Turing and the role he played in winning World War II makes for a compelling account. Yes, the movie does feel slightly Oscar-baity at times, and it goes through many of the motions that a film of its genre is expected to go through, but the history is rich and important enough that it does elevate the less impressive aspects of the piece.While it may owe the majority of its quality to Cumberbatch and the source true story, The Imitation Game is a well made and respectfully told tribute to Alan Turing, and an interesting, at times stirring, biopic that is worth the price of admission. The ending in particular is very emotional and hard-hitting, and because of the fact that Turing never received proper recognition, it's important to know this story \u2014 even if the film itself is little more than a vehicle for just that. It's worth a trip to the cinema this Oscar season.",

With the intertwining story lines of how the British mathematicians are going to break Germany's Enigma code and the challenges Turing faces as a gay man in the 1940s, it strikes a good balance as a gripping thriller that's not an action film and a moving drama that's not a depressing tragedy. The characters were very well thought through, each with unique qualities giving you an idea of what they are like without needing to give much information. No doubt this was helped by the excellent acting from the entire cast. Although Benedict Cumberbatch does a very good job in delivering the complex personality of Alan Turing, for me the more noteworthy performance was Keira Knightley's in what is probably her best one yet. In other films, her performances lack depth at times and it can feel like you're watching the same person again but with this one it is not the case. You actually forget that it is her playing this intelligent and captivating character. The brilliant performances of Alex Lawther as the young Turing and Mark Strong are also worth mentioning considering their smaller yet significant parts.The film is let down a little by the flow of the story and rapid movements from scene to scene. This may have been a conscious choice to give a mechanic feel to a film about a mathematical mind but it does make the story a bit hard to follow at times. This is not of much significance though as the film delivers in all other areas, not the least of which is the ending. It is hard to get endings right and is often the point at which films disappoint. That's not the case with this one, it's spot on. Don't miss this film.",

Fed to us in easily digestible bites. No unnecessary jargon about the technological workings of enigma or an overwrought explanation on the political climate of the time.

His sharp wit is countered by co-star Keira Knightley, who plays Joan Clarke the caring companion and fellow brain. The rest of them ain't all that bad either. Not a biography. One must acknowledge that there are major discrepancies between the actual events of Alan Turing's life and the film itself. Spoiler alert. The screenwriter has injected conflicts, relationships and hardships where none ever existed. Why? To deliver satisfying resolutions. For us, the viewing audience.

We as an audience are also treated to glimpses of his youth here and there, then briefly to a short period after the war. Benedict Cumberbatch is a perfect choice for this role, he really becomes Alan Turing in the process, he is incredible. Supporting cast is quite good too, especially Keira Knightley, who surprised me one more time with such an exquisite performance, which is full of subtlety and finesse. It is beyond words what this Turing's accomplishment meant for the future of humanity and there's also a moral message that movie provokes when questioning are we God, because Turing's discovery was used and to some abused, as a dice choosing who gets to live and who doesn't, all for higher purposes and having the end result in sight. This choice affected many, I believe even Turing in some way although he hadn't shown it. It is sad how his life ended, but we should all be forever grateful to him for what he has achieved. He really was an extraordinary man, ordinary only on the surface.",

If you want to go watch a movie that is specifically written to promote homosexuality, then go see this. If you want to watch something exciting and scientific, find something else, because you will not find it here. The summary should instead be something like, Alan Turing struggles to make sense of his life and cope with his secret homosexuality. Also, there may be something about some code somewhere in here...Other than that, I gave 5 stars because the actors did an excellent job in portraying their characters. That is the only upside (other than getting to see Benedict Cumberbatch).",

            "content": "The twenty-first century has seen a dominance in computer technology. We use these machines in our lives for work and play, yet we keep saying that were going to further push what they can do. They can already play video games for us and instruct us how to cook pasta. Maybe they'll be the ones doing the cooking for me (it would save me a ton of time until I can hire a chef)! Most textbooks will show people using computers at home as early as the mid eighties. If your were to turn to war history, then you'll be surprised to find that computer history goes back further.Turning to World War II, an early model for the processing system was built into order to crack the hardest code of all; the Nazi Enigma machine that changes patters daily to throw off code breakers. Though I'm not a programmer or even that proficient as a computer user, this is where a lot of pioneers like Tim Berners-Lee (Internet creator) and Larry page (founder of Google) found inspiration that pushed what computers can accomplish. Finally given justice for his accomplishments, the story of Alan Turing is expressed in The Imitation Game. The British Military has been trying to break the Enigma device that the Nazi's have been using for communication to no avail. The current code breakers simply can't keep up with the daily changes and deadlines. What results is the hiring of a mathematician Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) who claims that he can build a machine that will beat the Germans to the punch. His only insistence is that he gets to work alone, a demand that is denied. He struggles to work with a few scientists who never seem to understand Turing's attitude. The movie seems to hint Aspergers Syndrome.He eventually turns to hire another accomplish; a woman Joan Clarke (played by Kira Knightly) who was able to solve a crossword faster then anyone in the group, Turing included. He continues to build his Bombe machine with the goal of getting to be able to process millions of possible data in a matter of minutes. Clarke meanwhile helps Turing to become more sociable and even strike up a romance. She doesn't know that Turing is a homosexual, something that he's been struggling with since he had feeling for a friend as a teenager. Though Turing manages to build his machine, the British government is not so kind on his homosexuality. Compared to the recent Unknown, The Imitation Game is a different kind of war movie. This one is more behind the scenes and dialogue heavy then on explosions and artillery. What follows is a very chilling tale not of a man who help the British win the war, but about a country that was so unforgiving because of his lifestyle. What The Imitation Game really wants to emphasize is that the government's punishment on Turning was wrong then and it's wrong now. The good news is that rather then being a sexually fueled story, it's a genuine human story simply about this one guy doing his job.A part from the controversy that the movie is trying to address, The Imitation Game is one of the best of 2014. I think that this is one of the few movies that I had no problems with. Benedict Cumberbatch, Kira Knightly, and everyone is casted perfectly, the story and editing all play out like a wartime melody and the look of the era looks great. The Imitation Game is a movie that everyone, even is their not computer, World War II, or LBGT fans, should still see.I'll give this ten Bombe Machines out of ten. Riveting on all circuits, The Imitation Game remains one of my favorites and truly deserves the critical phrase it's receiving.",

            "content": "Morton Tyldum directed THE IMITATION GAME - a biopic of The \"Father of Computer Science\" - Alan Turing (1912-1954) in such a way that we are ricocheting back and forth in time beginning in 1926 and ending in 1954 focusing on \"\u0085British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing who was a key figure in cracking Nazi Germany's naval Enigma code which helped the Allies win the Second World War, only to later be criminally prosecuted for his homosexuality\u0085with a screenplay by Graham Moore based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges\u0085\" (Wikipedia)We at first do not see Mr. Turing (a wrenching performance by Benedict Cumberbatch)- instead we hear his imperious voice - a tone meting out strictures - like a professor high atop a mountain talking to a kindergarten child, and then we see an awkward, arrogant, and if the film is to be believed young man who seems to fit the Asperger's Syndrome profile - but that late 20th C. diagnosis is debatable. Benedict Cumberbatch with a quivering upper lip, wet steamy eyes, exhibits a fierce confidence in his own ability. He is a loner - a type of loner who does not give a damn about the opinion of others because his opinion of himself is so indomitable\u0085and true.THE IMITATION GAME revolves around the depiction of a person who is \"different\"- who was both an heroic and a tragic figure. It disturbingly reveals the disdain of those in authority to someone who once was indispensable to the British government's war effort and the ease with which they can be \"discarded\" once they are no longer of use\u0085even if you worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park England - having built a machine that was able to decipher daily Nazi messages which yielded German military intelligence - shortening the war by 2-4 years thereby saving millions of lives. After the war all the work decoding Enigma was wiped out of the official records as if his intense achievements had never happened. History evaporated.Turing talked about \"the imitation game\"- how does one know if communication is from a human or a machine so he devised the TURING TEST: \"\u0085The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. In the original illustrative example, a human judge engages in natural language conversations with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. The conversation is limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so that the result is not dependent on the machine's ability to render words into audio\u0085All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. The test does not check the ability to give the correct answer to questions; it checks how closely each answer resembles the answer a human would give\u0085\" (Wikipedia)The movie's drama revolves around an inventive person and how he negotiates the world outside of the mind. Not only is Alan Turing a brilliant mathematician but he is also gay in a country (Britain) that prosecuted and jailed \"homosexuals\" for \"gross indecency\" (The Sexual Offenses Act of Parliament did not decriminalize sexual activity between two men until 1967,) so keeping secrets became the core of his existence, from an early age when he was the smartest schoolboy in his class and formed a deep friendship with another young man who became his only friend rescuing him from the bullying behavior of fellow classmates; that special relationship becomes a fulcrum for THE IMITATION GAME. Benedict Cumberbatch performance as Alan Turing is heartbreaking giving us insight into a man with rare ingenuity and intelligence, but unpolished and artless in his negotiations with bureaucratic officials who condescendingly impose deadlines and place other restrictions on his inquiry. Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, the only female member of the elite circle of mathematicians; a humanizing bridge and \"social\" teacher as well as an intellectual ally of Turing and briefly his fianc\u00e9, becoming a critical member of the team and his emotional life. She is broadminded and excited by Turing's fulgent mind - their collaboration is essential to the success of decoding Enigma.Integral contributions to society can be accomplished without reward. Often those responsible for timeless scientific advances created during periods of war/crisis that impact us all to this very day are forgotten - some intentionally so. THE IMITATION GAME tries to resurrect an extraordinary person, Alan Turing - a being who is still considered by many in the tech world to be the founder of \"Artificial Intelligence\" and his machine the forerunner of the world's first personal computer. This film is a tale of a life well-lived but shockingly crippled by the ignorance and narrow-mindedness of bigotry.",

            "content": "Aside from the Nazis, according to this film, code breaking genius Alan Turing also had to fight his fellow Brits during World War II. Some of his colleagues and authorities not only persecuted him for being gay, but accused him of being a spy, were jealous of him, bullied him and had little faith in his admittedly outlandish plan to build a computer that would break the Nazis' crack, intricate mode of communications, the Enigma machine. As the actor playing Turing, Benedict Cumberbatch brings enormous compassion and empathy to his role: the gist is that Turing is a absolute genius and yet ironically he cannot communicate, or get on with his colleagues at the top secret Bletchley Park intelligence centre. It almost spells disaster for the Enigma project, and it adds a lot of tension to the film. It's very insightful for the scriptwriters to portray how Turing's good friend, fellow cryptographer Joan Clark, was a social code breaker for Turing. Clark, played by Keira Knightley, tells Turing that he won't achieve what he's aiming for in the project if the other team members don't like him, given how he often dismisses them as beneath him, and doesn't make an effort to socialise. The film is also brilliant at exploring themes such as how prejudice, for example against gays, is so brainless - think of the mind-blowing contributions Turing could have made to society, after the war, had he not been driven to severe depression and suicide by homophobic individuals and by a hostile community. The investigators who investigate Turing for homosexuality, which was then a crime, are like a cancer in threatening his existence. Though it may be grotesquely too late today, at least Turing is being recognised in this film for playing a big part in de-coding the messages that the Germans used to broadcast their military moves in WWII. An incredible feat. The excellent scenes of Alan as a boy being bullied at school for being a geek show how people who were shocking misfits can go on to be brilliant adults, because later in life their 'odd' interests and behaviour are an asset in their careers as entrepreneurs or inventors or intellectuals. This film obviously takes poetic licence and viewers have pointed out quite a few bendings of the facts. But overall it's a good hearted and entertaining film.",

            "content": "In different ways whether we are aware of it, computers have influenced a lot on the way how we live in this world. As a person who have been at some point interested with computers, I have come across a person named \"Turing\" alongside with \"von Neumann\", \"Pascal\", etc. He's one of the brilliant minds in the history of computers. Mix this person with the themes of war such as cryptography, the Nazis, and \"top-secret\" operations, will lead to an interesting topic to talk about; topic that is usually made into \"B\" movies. You can have it at the \"Imitation Game\", but then in one of the unusual cases, we encounter here a film that is more than a thrilling \"B\" movie with similar theme.We get to know \"Enigma\", a machine built by Germans to encrypt and decrypt secret codes. The codes when decrypted by the Allied forces will greatly increase their chance to win the war against the Nazis, who dominated Europe during the second World War. If you are thinking that war between humans and machines is something futuristic, this film shows us that it has already happened in the middle of the 20th century. It happened, as the way how the film put it, between the brilliant minds of Britain and a German machine; and this led to a question: how can humans beat a powerful machine? Turing's answer was simple: build another machine. Of course, realizing this adversary machine to beat Enigma is such a risky endeavor that will require a lot of brain resources. This is the struggle that the film tackled at its core together with the different dimensions that come alongside it.We might expect some mathematics, but then the treatment is almost the same as that of \"A Beautiful Mind\". However, this film has a more sophisticated and realistic take on telling the story of an unusual person. What is even more compelling is that it is a well-crafted mix of victory and tragedy. We get to see the impact of the war and the personal struggles of those who were tasked to solve the \"puzzle\" at Bletchley Park. Among those struggles, we get to realize that Alan Turing's life was far from the story of a victorious war hero. We get to see how harsh the society can be to those who are considered different and how somebody can lose his purpose despite the gift and achievements. We see all of this accompanied by the remarkable performances of Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley and the above average technical achievements. What can be easily recognized to be topnotch are the film's cinematography and music.It's not wholly entertaining though because it can be a bit slow at times and uninteresting. If you are looking for some engaging academic discourse about computers and war strategies, you might not get your fix because it tends to tackle the social dimension more and it can be inaccurate at times in historical details. And in the last part, it felt like there is some imbalance though since earlier we get to see its matter-of-fact and neutral treatment on the more sensitive matters.At the bottom-line, I think the film succeeds in its in-depth take on a person whose purpose in life was not fully realized amidst his/her gifts. Overall, it is a memorable film.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game, based on the true story of Mathematics Genius Alan Turing, is captivating and excels on all accounts, making it a totally enjoyable movie experience and conducive to reflect on our own lives. It is the story of a man, while covering his own secret, spending all his life unlocking national secrets to save the lives of others who eventually put him in torture. His own life is an enigma. How ironic life is! Alan Turing is such a genius in mathematics and founder of the computing machine but also very awkward in social situations. He is absorbed in his own world, cracking codes since he was a teenager. He is also a philosopher with his own sets of logic \u2013 aware from a young age that people do not say what they mean but hope others will understand their symbols/codes. Being bullied at school and at work because he is different, Turing has developed tremendous resilience to resist violence while standing up for what he believes \u2013 breaking German codes and winning the war, even if that means sacrificing some people's lives. With a tightly knit script, the movie touches on three time zones \u2013 when Turing studies at a boarding school, when he works at the Bletchley Radio Factory and after the war when he teaches at university. The three periods are seamlessly intertwined and flows beautifully to highlight certain aspects of Turing which last/haunt all his life and make him unique. In a nutshell, he is a complicated person and we as audience also feel a mixture of feelings while watching his endeavor, whether professionally or personally. One easily feel really sorry and despaired, but at the same time inspired and encouraged.Benedict Cumberbatch is superb in portraying different levels of complexity in Turing's character. While others consider him arrogant and eccentric, we also see him as a single-minded, focused and smart person who just wants to break the codes and end the war. Although others consider him weird, it is exactly this quality that helps him build the decoding machine and save millions of lives by cutting the war short. Throughout the movie, there is a strong sense of suffering endured by Turing since he was a child, despite his genius in various aspects. It becomes more complicated when his sexual orientation causes him more threat. To makes his life even more intrigue, he is involved in decoding war secrets where no traces are allowed after the war. All these mysterious elements makes the film fascinating to watch. The support cast and sound track, as well as art direction, are excellent in depicting this unusual person in this extraordinary time. Alex Lawther, who plays young Turing, is magnificent with his limited screen time. His timid, sweet and shy smile, appreciative blinks as well as sad, repressed and determined denials make one's heart break. However, Keira Knightley is perhaps too attractive to playing Joan Clark, another mathematics expert who also feels like an outsider. History is ironic in a sense that we have to depend on someone abnormal to bring our lives back to normal. And yet society in general, at least back then, does not tolerant people who are seemingly different from the majority and tries to convert the outliers. However, determined, patient and focused, Turing has tremendous confidence in himself which others easily consider as narcissistic and egoistic. Perhaps one needs to do that as defense when one is so different. He probably did not realize his contribution to England as well as mankind when he was absorbed in his work. All he did was work hard in his own territory. Coincidentally Mencius the ancient Chinese philosopher says that \"If I believe in what I am doing, I will go ahead even if tens of thousands of people are against me.\" I can see that in Turing. Although some people even consider Turing as a machine, judging from his deep affection for his childhood friend we can hardly call him a machine. From the real Mathematics prodigy Alan Turing to the award-winning screenwriter Graham Moore and Benedict Cumberbatch who acted out the character, we are blatantly told that it is OK to be weird and be different. All we need is to realize our potential and make good use of it. Someday, somehow, our efforts will be recognized. Perhaps if we keep it in mind, life is not that bad. Very inspirational and make you think outside the box. May we all be more open-minded coming out of this film.",

He was known to be eccentric, sometimes seen using a gas mask to avoid the hay fever, but also an athlete who could run more than 60km and almost got into the British Olympic team - far from the stereotype then. 2. They use the commander as an arbitrary plot device. What kind of commander hires a top mathematician to bust his balls constantly? And why the hell would he care so much about spending 100,000 pounds, not from his pocket, on something that can win the war? These people were desperate, there was research on *pigeon guided bombs*\u0085 This character was not believable at all. 2. They make it look like Turing was a loner working on this new machine nobody believed in - in reality a code breaking machine already existed (made by the Polish), so it was common sense an improved machine was a plausible line of research. 3. They used Joan Clarke as a plot device to talk about feminism. She wasn't hired via the crossword puzzle (so none of that dialogue about the guy not believing she could apply to the job), and she worked directly with the team (so none of that non-sense about it being inappropriate to work with men). The plot is so flawed here that later on she is depicted hanging around the team all the time, in the bar, etc. 4. They make the knowledge that certain words would be on the messages as a late \"Eureka\" moment, when in fact that was a known exploit. The problem was finding the key fast enough (in that 18 hour window), and that's where the machine, plus improved methods, comes in. The movie was total bull here, and misguided the viewer both on the real history and on how cryptanalysis works. 5. They make it look like the code breakers worked like lone wolves, making the call on what they would reveal to the army or not - cut for a dialogue about saving this kid's brother or not for 5 minutes of drama. More bull. 6. After the war, Turing did important work, building the first general purpose computers with Von Neumann architecture (Manchester computers). The movie fast forwards right past that as if it's nothing. 7. The official record says suicide, but his death is still highly speculated. There are other theories for the cyanide poisoning: Accidental (he was doing experiments at home that used cyanide and released toxic fumes - his record doesn't say anything about the poisoning being from inhalation or ingestion); Assassination by the secret service (it's possible they feared his knowledge would leak, either as revenge for his sexual behavior punishment, or by being manipulated by a spy. The knowledge of the flaws of Enigma were used by the Allies to build their own, stronger cipher, and by 1952 the Soviets were rising as a menace). The movie could've kept this suspense in the air, instead of just giving the official record death before the credits.Conclusion: Lazy writing. Lacked the sensibility for a biopic. Too much poetic license. Sprinkled some political criticism (feminism, gay prosecution) on top to win an Oscar, while at the same time these aspects lacked in breadth and depth.Still waiting for a movie that does Turing justice, an unappreciated and controversial character of our modern history.",

The British bombe was a development from a device that had been designed in Poland, the initial design being from Alan Turing but the engineering design and construction was undertaken by an entirely different company. It was an official project so the scene when the machine had been running for a day and he fights to keep it running is almost certainly fabrication.While speaking of fabrication, when the machine finally does work in the movie, they happen to decode a really significant message but Alan Turing supposedly decides that they have to keep the news to themselves in order to hide their new capabilities. Not taking action based on every intercept did indeed occur but in real life if he had done that he probably would have been executed for treason!

He really got a good handle on the homosexuality of the character as well as the Asperger's condition with the right amount of social awkwardness. A powerful movie on many levels. It makes you realize the outcome of the Second World War was determined quite differently to what the history books tell you. You got the real sense of frustration and anxiety by the crack team and their painstaking efforts to help the forces against Hitler. Turing's life after the war was a sad reflection of less enlightened times about homosexuality. I highly recommend this movie. I would like to see it win Best Picture at the Oscars.",

            "content": "\"The Imitation Game\" is an absorbing film, but different to what I expected.Although it tells how British mathematics genius Alan Turing developed a machine to break the Nazis Enigma Code during WW2, the film is as much about the turmoil and pain in his life brought about by his homosexuality \u2013 this in an era when to express it physically could destroy a man's reputation and land him in prison.This other aspect of Turing's life gives the film emotional depth as he comes to terms with his true nature; even the charms of Keira Knightly as his co-code breaker, Joan Clark, can't sway him from his natural instincts.The story of how the team at Bletchley Park broke the Nazi code is fascinating. Turing and his associates \u2013 the geeks of their day, boffins back then \u2013 were chosen because they possessed a variety of skills not least of which was the ability to solve complicated crossword puzzles. The tension in the film builds as they race against time to predict the movements of German U-Boats, which were strangling Britain's supply line.I remember the astonishment around the world when Frederick Winterbotham's book, \"The Ultra Secret\", came out in the mid-1970's, revealing that the British were able to read top secret German codes throughout most of the war. It was almost as big a surprise as if we had learned that Hitler had actually been a British double agent all along.The story has been covered before in films and documentaries. In fact, \"The Imitation Game\" is partly based on the book, \"Alan Turing: the Enigma\" by Andrew Hodges, which was filmed in 1996 starring Derek Jacobi as Turing. That film focused almost exclusively on the problems in his personal life, while \"The Imitation Game\" presents a bigger picture, with more of his involvement with Ultra.Benedict Cumberbatch obviously dug deep for his performance. Although Keira Knightly has been criticised as being too glamorous for the role of real-life Joan Clark, effort was made with costume and makeup to help her fit the part.You can't blame Cumberbatch for looking disappointed when he didn't win the Best Actor Oscar. Unfortunately for him it was a year of great performances, and he would have to curse his luck coming up against someone playing Stephen Hawking.\"The Imitation Game\" is an intriguing film about an intriguing man whose genius could not protect him from the cruel censure of society at the time.",

The society, though, benefits greatly from those very idiosyncrasies.The movie is meticulously well shot - taking us back to the war-era.

            "content": "In a field including The Theory of Everything's Eddie Redmayne and Birdman's Michael Keaton, Benedict Cumberbatch does not appear to be an Oscar favorite. On the other hand, the most-read movie critics are uncannily unanimous that his performance as Alan Turing is no less than perfection. Unfortunately, as I reflect on many of the Oscar prizes given out over the years, perfection in performance may not necessarily count as it deserved to. Also, to be fair, the two aforementioned competitions equally fit the description.In the support cast are two prominent character actors, in roles that in a way pitched one against another. Commander Denniston is played by Charles Dance who will always be identified by many as Tywin Lannister, a role that he seems to be have born for. Secret service agent Stewart Menzies is played by the omnipresent (on the big screen) Mark Strong who recently seems to be diversifying from his customary villain persona, and beginning to play good guys such as in \"Kingsman\" which I happened to have watched on the day before this movie. In \"The imitation game\", the former is bent on shutting down Turing's project while the latter is not unlike a guardian angel to Mr. Turing. Two other brilliant performances come from Keira Knightley playing an assistant and intellectual equal, and Matthew Goode as the initial team leader and rival later turning into a loyal supporter.The breaking of the German encryption code Enigma by a team of mathematics wiz lead by Turing has generally been considered to be an enormous help in helping the Allies win. Even more (much more) significant, the machine that Turing built to achieve this is considered to be the World's very first digital computer, earning him recognition as the father of computer science. This in-depth bio-pic tells us more. Turing had a form of autistic tendency which manifested itself as an inability to interpret verbal communications to him in anything other than in the literal sense. As shown in the movie, colleagues saying to him \"we are going out to lunch\" can in no way in his mind be equated to \"come and join us for lunch\". Perhaps that explains his brilliance in handling machine language.Following the Turing team through their struggle against impossible odds the audience is eventually rewarded with the \"bingo\" moment that comes with good dramatization. Taking in the yells of jubilation, hugs and all, the audience may also find joy in sharing this moment of triumph of the 5 brilliant MINDS (as opposed to people) that have been interacting at a level beyond the grasp of us mere mortals. That reminds me of Michael Frayn's superb play \"Copenhagen\" depicting two top nuclear physicists communicating in a language that we can only admire, but not comprehend.But then immediately after that moment of ecstasy comes the darkest hell. Deciphering the code enabled them to pinpoint an imminent attack on a convoy. Just as one young member urged sending word to the navy to prevent the attack (his brother was in the convoy), Turing stopped him, with cold, hard logic: there is no way the Germans would fail to understand that Enigma has been broken, and the team's hard work of two years would be all for naught. The way to make the most out of the now deciphered Enigma is to devise a complex, statistically based scheme to mislead, misguide and otherwise fool the Germans. The convoy in the immediate focus would just have to be collateral damage, as well as the team member's brother in it. Everybody else agreed with Turing.For the other element of the plot, Turing is in good company, Oscar Wilde, who was also persecuted for homosexuality. Turing did not go to jail but tried to endure \"chemical castration\" (through self-administered drugs) and wound up taking his own life.As mentioned above, this movie presents the solving of Enigma as instrumental to a grandiose scheme of strategies with immense impact on winning WWII. No one should have any problem with that as the movie is not a treatise on the history of the war. There is however an interesting alternative observation that surfaced recently. There is now a school of thinking that the breaking of Enigma may not have been as critical a factor to the Allies' victory as generally believed. As the theory goes, even many were destroyed, the German U-boats could have still prevailed by sheer numbers. The Allies' victory came from winning the battle of the factories and shipyards: they simply managed to build convoy ships at a rate faster than the U-boats could sink them.",

If you choose to make a film which focuses on one character, it should really be an in-depth and detailed character study but unfortunately, I found this to be a very superficial 'made for Oscars' type film.I didn't learn anything about the Turing machine itself, for example; the engineering aspects, the design, literally no information whatsoever about how it worked was given and this was something I was really interested in. There was only one aspect of Turing's childhood included and nothing more about his life at home or university. We don't see any of his (then) illegal 'interactions' and the historical detail was fairly sparse.In terms of detail, it felt like the script was written after a brief consultation of Wikipedia.I'm a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, I really am but he's not a strong actor and never has been. He's fantastic in Sherlock and Star Trek but I don't think he plays 'real' people very well. In fact, Turing, as depicted here, seems to have the exact same sense of humour as Sherlock...Keira Knightley was the biggest surprise here, she genuinely transformed herself into a completely different person yet I doubt she'll get the same recognition that Cumberbatch will. She once mentioned as her character in London Boulevard (2010), that women are often written into films purely so that the male lead actor has someone to discuss all of his problems with - for the audience to hear. That's something I now pay attention to in most films I watch and this one is no different. I think we see one scene related to her own personal life (at home with her parents) and then it's swiftly back to Cumberbatch.There's a lot of posturing, posh accents and generally interesting subject matter but unfortunately, I learned nothing about Alan Turing, nothing about the workings of the machine, and in terms of entertainment value, I would probably have got more enjoyment from reading about Turing on Wikipedia.6/10",

Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Alan Turing, a brilliant and influential mathematician and computer scientist who helped decode the Enigma machine that the Nazis were using to send encrypted messages (this saved countless lives) and was later prosecuted for being gay and forced to be chemically castrated. It's an appalling story that this movie does no justice.The first fatal flaw is its portrayal of Turing. Apparently getting all of its information about genius mathematicians from movies such as Rain Man and A Beautiful Mind, Turing is portrayed as a sort of savant like character who is incapable of social interaction (in real life Turing was not like this). Benedict Cumberbatch is solid, but you can't help feel like he's playing only a slightly altered version of Sherlock (socially inept, eccentric, brilliant). There are other numerous historical inaccuracies as well (it's a movie so full historical accuracy is not needed, but just don't expect to get a good history lesson here).The other main characters in this film are okay to forgettable. Kiera Knightly is fine as Joan Clarke, another brilliant codebreaker who struggles to gain acceptance because she is a woman. We unfortunately don't get enough time with her. Charles Dance is the tough military guy (he's got a good tough guy routine) and Mark Strong is the mysterious spy. Both completely forgettable.The script suffers too, mostly playing it by the book with cliches we have seen a thousand times before. There's a corny inspirational line that gets a call back not once, but twice! And there's a eureka scene in a bar that feels like a direct rip off of A Beautiful Mind.

The period is solidly evoked by the stand-up production design, and the script, while slightly too expositional, manages to straddle three time periods in Turing's life, noting how the imperative to conceal his homosexuality crippled him socially. Technically the film maintains a high standard, though there is nothing outstanding in the direction. The cracking of the Enigma Code is arguably the greatest achievement of the British war effort. The personal cost to the man we have to thank is a stunning tale, especially given the secrecy it has been cloaked in for most of the 20th century.

This is a beautifully made, heartfelt film, with an outstanding performance by the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch in particular deserves praise for his performance. If he doesn't get a BAFTA/Oscar for his wonderful portrayal of the tortured genius Alan Turing, then I'll be very surprised. Even the usually bland Keira Knightley does well, giving the first credible performance of her career.This is a film in which I hope will make more people aware of, and interested in, the Bletchley Park code breakers. The dreadful 'U571' tried to make out the Americans captured Enigma and not the British, which was a deliberate inaccuracy that should not have been allowed.(That is the kind of inaccuracy that DOES matter, as it was rewriting a vital piece of history.

It's far from clear that Turing really was an Aspie-he was noted for his sense of humor, apparently-but BC certainly plays him that way, like Sherlock (minus the ADD) channeling Max from \"Parenthood.\"Performances and production design (except for the sketchy CGI sequences) are great, but I don't think newbie screenwriter Graham Moore was really up to the task. As with the Hawking movie, there's a lot that's straight out of the Hollywood handbook-the \"eureka!\" moment in the pub, for example (isn't there a scene where one of Hawking's cronies draws a diagram of a black hole with beer suds?). The relationship between Turing and Cmdr Denniston (Charles Dance) faithfully reenacts the movie clich\u00e9 of the maverick cop and his by-the-book superior (cf. Monk, to mention another Aspie sleuth, and Captain Stottlemeyer). It's great to watch BC chew up the scenery (wearing his custom-fitted replicas of the real Turing's dentures), but how much of this really has to do with Turing? (For a knowledgeable and entertaining answer to that question, see Christian Caryl's review on nybooks.com.)Apart from that, there are plenty of plot points that just don't make sense: how likely is it that the boffins in Hut 8 would get to decide whether a U-boat attack on a convoy should be intercepted (thereby revealing that the Brits had broken the German code)?-nor would they have had a big map with a pushpin for every German sub. (How could they have known where they were before they'd broken the code?) And how likely is it that a detective investigating a burglary at Turing's house would start chatting with him about his theories on machine intelligence-seems like the screenwriter's handbook would recommend against cramming so much expository dialogue into a clearly invented scene.The subplot about the Soviet spy (who did exist, but prob'ly never met Turing) suggests that he was so terrified of being outed that he'd be willing to shield a traitor, so I was glad to learn that the real Turing had an adventurous sex life (including in the West Village while a grad student at Princeton) when he was out of England and wasn't all that discreet at home (that's how he managed to get caught after all). There's so much in this film that's fictionalized or invented that the things that actually did happen (the crossword-puzzle contest, AT's engagement to Joan Clarke) start to seem like Moore must have made them up too.Turing died, allegedly, after eating a poisoned apple... As one reviewer pointed out, you'd think a movie script-especially one that's at least half fairytale already, I might add-would have room for a detail like that. I guess it's a good thing that this film's going to acquaint a wider audience with the basic story of Turing's life and his immense contributions to the Allied war effort and computer science (and the barbarous way he was treated by the British legal system), but the tale as it's told in \"The Imitation Game\" felt so pumped up and contrived that we really didn't enjoy it all that much.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game is the kind of movie that could win Oscars, now whether or not the competition will be too stiff for it to do so is another matter. The most fascinating thing about The Imitation Game is that it is a stylish history lesson that manages to remain entertaining thanks to some intriguing visual ideas and stellar performances from its cast.The movie tells the true story of Alan Turing (played in this film by Benedict Cumberbatch in an Oscar worthy performance), who was a British mathematician who is considered one of the most influential men in computer sciences. Turing's biggest claim to fame was when he created a computer for England in World War II to break the seemingly unbreakable Nazi enigma code. It is the drama that occurred around the creation of the said computer that is the primary focus of the story, with majority of the movie playing like a war film without really ever seeing much war. In a way, you could say that this is a war film honoring the smart men and women who solved problems from the homefront, while often not being able to solve their own personal problems.What The Imitation Game tries and succeeds at illuminating is that the greatest tragedy of Turing's life truly isn't the fact that he was persecuted for his being different, but that he was a man who did so much for humanity but could never quite crack the code to his own humanity or that of others. The whole film sort of plays like a puzzle with the story being told in three concurrent timelines: when Turing was at boarding school as a child, when he was decoding Enigma, and when he was arrested in 1951 for homosexuality, with his time decoding Enigma making up about ninety percent of the story. However, by interspersing these other time periods into the story, you see the future for Turing and we have to often venture into the past to piece together all of the details of the man to understand why he was the way he was and how he eventually got to the point he was in. It is in constructing this movie like a puzzle that gives it an extra bit of pizazz that keeps this movie from being like a made-for-TV movie.Director Morten Tyldum works with his cinematographer, Oscar Faura, and editor, William Goldenberg, to create a visual language, at times similar to that of Christopher Nolan from The Prestige. There is some truly spectacular crosscutting between scenes in the past, present, and future, that really astounded me as a fellow filmmaker. One matchcut in particular, going from a Nazi u-boat firing a torpedo, to a sideways shot showing a cigarette being snuffed out in an ashtray, is perhaps the most powerful cut I have seen in a movie in a long time. The way that Tyldum and company work in conjunction with Graham Moore's taut script, makes every scene of the film another piece of the puzzle to the eventual outcome. Often you watch a movie and feel there are extraneous scenes, but each scene in The Imitation Game builds toward the tragedy of Turing in his final years. Then there is the music from Alexandre Desplat that is both simple in its themes and motifs, but exceptionally complex in how it uses a lot of moving parts to aurally illustrate Turing's always mobile mind. From a technical standpoint, this is about as well made a film you can find, but what gives the film its heart and soul is the actual way Turing is represented.The greatest feat that The Imitation Game accomplishes is in the way that it makes Turing a character you root for and pity. Turing was a very anti-social, slightly arrogant man, who did not know how to deal with people all that well and who struggled with his closeted homosexuality for his entire life (which was against the law at that time in Britain). The credit really goes to Cumberbatch (and those soulful eyes) for showing the heartbreaking humanity inside of Turing. There are few actors currently working who can play the calculating man with the heart that Cumberbatch brings to these roles. You genuinely feel that Cumberbatch's Turing is not a man who is ever intentionally being mean or offensive, he just does not know how to properly behave. He has been bullied and disliked for his entire life and had only a small handful of people who genuinely cared for him, one such person being Joan Clark, the only woman who worked on Turing's team of codebreakers. Keira Knightley does some of her best work ever here as Clark, managing to decode Turing even when he often didn't seem to be able to figure himself out.In short, The Imitation Game is for anyone who enjoys well made prestige fare with the Oscar sheen behind it. The movie isn't explicit and would play well to a high school history class. Alan Turing was a tragic, broken man who was isolated from an early age, with the only ones who ever took a vested interest in him always leaving in the end. Any man or woman who can never manage to solve the riddle of emotion and connect with other people is one that I pity. I think we all often struggle with how best to connect with people, and that to me is what The Imitation Game is all about.",

            "content": "Creating a screenplay based on the biography of Alan Turing, was by no means an easy feat. Had it only been about cracking Nazi Germany's 'Enigma' code, screenwriter Graham Moore, would probably be at a loss to make the whole thing work dramatically. But wisely Moore includes flashbacks to Turing's early days at an English boarding school as well as flash forwards over his tragic fall from grace regarding his then-banned homosexual lifestyle.Nonetheless, it's instructive to ask how accurate 'The Imitation Game' is as Slate Magazine asks in an article of the same name. Is it true, as Dana Stevens states in Slate, \"The Imitation Game doesn't do right by the complex and often unlovable man it purports to be about.\" Stevens read Andrew Hodges' biography of Turing and noted how Turing's true story differed in major ways from the way in which he was depicted in the film.Stevens \"discovered that The Imitation Game takes major liberties with its source material, injecting conflict where none existed, inventing entirely fictional characters, rearranging the chronology of events, and misrepresenting the very nature of Turing's work at Bletchley Park.\" Should we conclude that Turing's story was substantially compromised due to what Stevens terms, 'major liberties' taken? The question should be re-framed: if major liberties weren't taken, could the screenwriter have made it work at all?One of Stevens' big objections is that the Bombe, the big ticking machine Turing is supposed to have invented himself, actually was created by a Polish scientist. What's more, Turing collaborated with another scientist on the machine's design (which is not even mentioned in the film). This seems like a minor point as the film is about Turing and playing with the biographical facts in such a way, hardly seems like much of a sin. Of more concern is Stevens' charge that Cumberbatch's depiction of Turing as narcissistic and detached has \"more in common with the actor's title character in Sherlock than with the Turing of Hodges' biography.\" Stevens indicates that the real Turing was \"very approachable\" and the men at Bletchley Park, were very fond of him. Turing was eccentric to a certain degree and adding in a degree of narcissism, didn't detract from the drama, in my opinion, but may have added to it.Stevens concedes that were a good number of real incidents incorporated into the film (the young Turing being nailed under the floorboards by bullies, as well as a romantic interest in a boy at the boarding school). Stevens quibbles that there is no mention in Hodges' biography about Turing's obsession with separating the peas and the carrots.While Stevens takes issue with the depiction of Commander Deniston as a rigid naval officer who at one point attempts to fire Turing, he concedes that the made-up conflict between the two men is a \"stand in for a real-life power struggle between the military brass and the cryptologists.\" Stevens notes that, \"Turing's colleagues there recalled that Turing \"was always impatient of pompousness or officialdom of any kind,\" which made him ill-suited for work in a military context, and Hodges writes that he \"had little time for Denniston.\" Turing's note to Churchill which got the project additional funding and put him in a charge, never happened. But Hugh Alexander, one of the principals there, along with a few colleagues, did write to Churchill successfully requesting more staff and resources in 1941.As far as Hugh Alexander, Turing's rival in the film, Stevens notes that Alexander didn't work with Turing until a year went by and there was none of that conflict between them as depicted in the film. Alexander was a diplomat, which contrasted with Turing's lack of ability in that department. Still, creating a rivalry between the two, seems within the purview of standard dramatic license. The same goes for Turing's relationship with Joan Clarke, the only female mathematician who is part of the team. Clarke did accept Turing's homosexuality but of course the violent argument between them never happened. Still I would argue, creating an argument for dramatic purpose, does not detract from the narrative's overall effect.One point in the film which never took place and seems a bit forced is when one of the team's members, Peter, begs Turing to save his brother, who is on a supply ship, about to be torpedoed by the Germans. This is after Turing and the team have cracked Enigma but refuse to save the brother, as alerting the ship, may tip off the Germans. In a film like this, the narrative depends on invented dramatic moments, and again, this is another necessary, albeit forced, example.'The Imitation Game' still has been the subject of some legitimate criticism. Amy Nicholson finds the treatment of Turing's homosexuality to be sanitized: \"Despite its brusque lead, The Imitation Game is too mannerly to ask Cumberbatch to act on Turing's feelings. There's no flirtation, kissing, nothing that even hints that Turing ever felt the jolt of sexual electricity that would prod him to, at 39, sleep with the 19-year-old hustler who burgled his house and got him arrested. (That, too, happens off screen.) Turing is kept tweedy and neutered, as closeted in celluloid as he was in real life... The plotting goes for surprise over struggle. Tyldum has robbed his own film of emotional depth \u2014 this Turing is as simple as Morse code. Rather than a complex human portrait, this is an assemblage of triumphs, tragedies and tics.\"Gregory Ellwood also echos Nicholson's criticism: \"In effect, much of Turing's gay life is completely washed over. He says he had numerous affairs/lovers, but the film pushes the central relationship between his one-time fianc\u00e9 Clarke as the most prominent.\"Despite the historical liberties, screenwriter Moore has done a reasonably good job in telling Turing's heroic story. One only wishes Moore dealt with Turing's homosexuality in a more straightforward manner.",

            "content": "THE IMITATION GAME is the story of Alan Turing, a man who contributed to the Allied victory in World War II and was rewarded with eventual charges of \"gross indecency\" (for homosexuality). It's an engaging film that details his time served in Bletchley Park during the war where he worked with a team of linguists for the British military in attempting the decipher the German's Enigma code. The details certainly differ from their real life counterparts but, in the film, the Enigma code is a thorn in the side of the Allied forces that was proving unbreakable. Turing arrives at Bletchley Park and signs on to use his considerable intellect and love of puzzles to crack the code, and he's placed on a team that he immediately alienates with his intense focus on building a code-cracking machine. Throughout the film, we're flashing backward and forward in time to his childhood friendship with a young classmate (which develops into a school crush and establishes Turing's budding homosexuality) and his future discovery at the hands of the police for his alternate \"indecent\" lifestyle that would signal the beginning of the end to Turing's accomplished life. THE IMITATION GAME is at once both a celebration of Turing's (and his team's) unsung accomplishments that aided in bringing about an early end to the war and a reminder of how intolerance is blind and even a war hero such as Turing can fall victim to those hateful and afraid of people who might think differently.Alan Turing is one of Benedict Cumberbatch's best performances. Between Turing and Sherlock Holmes, it seems Cumberbatch is just incredibly talented at portraying socially awkward geniuses. But Turing is the more challenging role. Sure, personality-wise the two characters can certainly be said to have a lot in common, but the tragedy of Turing's life is just as much the focus of the film and Cumberbatch creates a sympathetic man suffering in silence. Being the time period that it was, Turing was unable to live openly without fear of repercussions and he poured all of his energy into creating his code-breaker (named \"Christopher\" after his beloved childhood friend). His team is built on an exceptional supporting cast containing Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke (the only woman on the team who quickly becomes Turing's closest friend) and Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander (an English chess champion and the team's alpha). Turing and Alexander butt heads immediately over the direction the team is taking in cracking the Enigma, and it's Joan who helps Turing earn the team's friendship and, more importantly, trust in the viability of the machine. Rounding out the impressive cast of supporting characters are Charles Dance as Commander Denniston, the man in charge of the project who happens to believe Turing is a problem and his machine a waste of national funds, and Mark Strong as Stewart Menzies, the head of MI-6 who sees the potential in Turing and his plan. Strong (who starred in another really good espionage thriller with Cumberbatch\u0085TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY) is always a welcome presence and perfect for the shady position as head of an intelligence agency that\u0085as far as anyone knew at the time\u0085didn't exist.THE IMITATION GAME is paced like an espionage thriller but spends the bulk of the film on the dynamics of Turing and his team. Turing, in the film, is not an easy man to get along with. He's vastly intelligent but he's unskilled at the nuances of social interactions. He often speaks his mind, regardless of consequences of the feelings of others, and his team isn't keen on him from the start. It doesn't help that early on he goes over Denniston's head (to Churchill, no less) to assume command of the project and immediately fires two less-helpful teammates. Joan is the key to his integration into the crew and helps him earn the respect he needs to coordinate them. But while the main plot in the film is the cracking of Enigma, the secondary story of Turing's later prosecution for his \"crime\" of homosexuality is always looming over us. Anyone familiar with Turing knew how this was bound to end and the movie gradually leads us there while first showing us the impressive individual he was, making his horrible treatment in the end that much more disgusting. THE IMITATION GAME is a solid World War II tale of spies and the men behind the scenes but it's also a timely reminder, at a point when finding widespread tolerance is still a challenge, that we're all human and something as innocent as sexual orientation is not enough to define (or\u0085worse\u0085persecute) a person.",

            "review_title": "Smart storytelling for a compelling story",
            "content": "It took me a couple days after watching the film to start writing this review. I didn't know why it took me so long but since I generally don't rush these things it didn't worry me. Writing a review I always try to be original, use my own words, share my own opinion, and try to make memorable with a couple of paragraphs. The Imitation Game is an interesting film with a great cast and brilliant performances but I'll get into that later. Watching the film the narrative jumped out at me and I couldn't pin point why. It starts off with the declaration of war and progressively goes back and forth from 1945 to the 1950s with little flashbacks on Alan Turing's boyhood peppering the narrative. No matter the time periods the constant in all this is Turing, it is his story after all. I guess, I didn't understand why the story was told that way. I mean it's a compelling story, so to me the flash- forwards to the 1950s - his post WWII life - are almost obsolete. The boyhood aspect of the flashbacks were important and interesting because they helped understand how complex Alan Turing was and gave him depth, as for the flash-forwards I had no clue. Of course, the movie would have felt a bit boring without the flash- forwards but it wouldn't have hurt it. Then it occurred to me that without them the British Government looks seriously bad. The man saved 14 Millions of lives - like they've reminded us in the film - but they still prosecuted him for consensual homosexual sex, sorry I meant \"public indecency\". I am baffled by this, I am no LGBT activist but injustice still rattles me. Maybe more so because if this war Hero's \"kink\" was little girls, I get the sense that he, somehow, would have eluded prosecution. And that investigator, who looks consumed by shame and guilt, once he realized what he's done, does not shake my belief that things would have gone differently for Turing if it was anything other than homosexuality. I may have gotten too far with this but you get my point.As for the movie, it has all the cultural aspects of this era, by which I mean misogyny and homophobia, no seriously it's also funny, riddled with humor like most British movies are and it is because of Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing. The loner, introverted, socially awkward genius makes for comedy gold. Turing's interactions with people around him and their reactions to his \"uniqueness\" made me laugh throughout the film. This might sound like Sherlock, also brilliantly portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch, but I did not once felt like he was playing the same character although, I'll admit that the two are alike. Which brings me to the immense talent that Cumberbatch showed in The Imitation Game, he not only portrayed a similar character to the one that internationally brought him to stardom but he did it with enough flair and finesse to give Alan Turing a voice and singularity. Unlike some biopic about great men, the supporting cast in The Imitation Game was strong and memorable, they all had their moments that gave them layers and also elevated the film. Among those people, is Keira Knightley, on who I had lost hope a long time ago, she showed skills and cunning in this movie for a character that easily could have felt flat and forgettable. She's borderline fag hag but with a good script and some acting skills she did well. The same skills - why do I feel like it's an insult to them? - are shown by the talented Charles Dance, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Allen Leech, Matthew Beard & of course Alex Lawther. Morten Tyldum delivered a culturally relevant, fun dramatic film. This man knows how to get you emotionally involved and takes you smoothly through one of the great injustice of our time.",

Nevertheless this movie isn't perfect, because although it's very solidly made, the feeling that i'm being a bit manipulated was over me during whole picture. Reasoons for that are a bit one note performance by Keira Knightley - she's just so good-natured person and best friend next door during whole movie - hard not to like her, this is a good performance, but not that good to earn Oscar nomination. Script, which won Oscar is great, involving and intriguing, but i also felt some minor manipulations here and there, because it's a bit formulaic / routine biopic. The scene in which we first meet Keira Knightley's character and the outcome of it was clear after the first seconds of this scene.Overall, there aren't many flaws in this movie and it's very good - you should definitely watch it - this is superbly paced movie about person who made some truly amazing and important works but wasn't recognized during his life.",

I guess I should have predicted that but it doesn't make it any the less true.Second, they couldn't get their history right. The way they wrote it, Turing single handed saved Britain during the war. Ah, that's not true. The Poles gave Britain the entire base for cracking Enigma and had cracked the predecessors of it repeatedly. Turing wasn't the only contributor. Turing's group didn't make the only computer during the war for code cracking, etc.Third, Turing wouldn't have just blabbed to some nobody cop about his war time record. He knew he could have been shot for it.Rating: 5. It could have been a solid seven but I have to knock off one point for the painful pro-homosexual message and one point for the historical inaccuracy.",

Turing is a mathematical genius. He gets recruited by the British government to lead a decoding team. However, he is terrible with people - preferring to be alone, yet needing help to work on the project.Enter Keira Knightly as Joan Collins (think that was her name). She demonstrates her math skills too, and Turing starts breaking out of his shell and interacts with people much better. There is a great cat-and-mouse game between various levels of the British govt, which was fascinating to learn about. There was also various games played within his team, and these add to the drama as they are revealed.In the end, I found it very sad to learn that the British govt was as stuffy as they were.

Whoever that person was for this film should be blacklisted! Just an annoyance of mine that simple errors are not picked up.In this film there were a few extremely obvious examples of continuity that were not picked up. It staggers me how this can happen during the editing process. In one shot where the main character is belted in the face and has blood streaming from his face he has an obvious blood stain just under his lip.In the next shot it is gone. There is another shot where he has a tear rolling down his cheek. In the next shot it isn't there (annoying!!).Apart from that gripe, this is quality cinema and enjoyable to say the least. I really love films based on true stories and when they come with slick directing and a stellar performance by Benedict Cumberbach (is that his real name??) it isn't hard to give the movie top marks.It is a fascinating story, one most people wouldn't know about.

            "review_title": "One of the best war/biopic dramas with two brilliant performances by Benedict and Keira",
            "content": "The Imitation Game isn't simply a biographic movie, it's rather complex, detail oriented story of morality, of heroism and of what really matters in life, on the example of one particular brilliant mind - British mathematician Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch). Because of its many layers, the film starts with voice over of Alan, urging someone (a policemen interrogating him? or the viewers? or both?) to listen carefully, to pay attention and if you decide to stay, than everything is your responsibility. I found the start very intrigue, as if it prepared for something very big, very deeply emotional and satisfactory. We meet Mr. Turing in his lab, at his house, which was just robbed, working with some chemicals and he is instantly introduced as a work dedicated person, who cares less about other's opinions and is extremely pragmatic. Then the scene switches to his interview with Commander Denniston (Charles Dance of Game of Thrones), who's looking for smart people to do some extremely confidential work. And here Alan becomes even more awkward and smarter the same time. Whole dialogue is a battle of two different minds and personalities, where Benedict's character is a determined, super intelligent person, who exactly knows what he capable of is. He gets the job with one word Enigma and joins a group of scientists working on decoding German messages. The team includes Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode of The Good Wife), John Cairncross (Allen Leech) and others. Basically, what they do is checking 159 million, million, million (18 zeros) code variations in exactly 18 hours, which sounds and is impossible. That's why, Alan decides to create a machine that reads every message, every day, instantly. It takes almost 2 years of mistrust, fights and number of speeches to convince everyone that the machine will work.Graham Moore's screenplay is smart enough to tell a story of Turing and the same time deliver a lot about the life in the Great Britain that time, stressing out some important problems and moral dilemmas. Much has been told how inaccurate the story of Alan is, that it almost forgets about his sexuality, or troubles. But I will never adjoin the complaints about homosexuality. Because whoever's life we talk about, their sexual life is not much relevant and especially if the movie is about one of the greatest scientist of XX century. The Imitation Game tells enough on Turing's troubles because of his orientation, but never defines his character as a result of it. In fact, the last scene is only about a \"gay Alan\" and his suffers. Basically, I found the screenplay very well written, with really smart and interesting lines and especially those of Cumberbatch's character. They are witty, somehow funny and very natural. Each dialogue precisely defines the true self of Alan. Even though he always behaves like a really bad guy, in heart, he is extremely caring and friendly, just in a different way.Though Joan Clarke - a young brilliant scientist - Moore's screenplay shows the struggles of women in the last century. The scene where she is not believed to solve the newspaper puzzle by herself is masterful and the way Joan reigns over everyone in the room almost made me applause. But true message, in my opinion, is the morality of war. When the group decode German messages, they have a choice - either make it public and save everyone under imminent threat, which means Germans change the communication system and Alan's work is useless, or let Germans continue killing and just prevent mathematically calculated maximum number of human losses. The latest is a smart decision, but it also means that these scientists should decide who lives and who dies, but it also guarantees to win the war. They choose winning the war. Director Morten Tyldum transforms the whole drama from words to the screen. He crafted story with cast of masters and threw us in the era of enigma, making the viewers emotionally attached to every decision or action of main characters. And you will feel that when Enigma machine decodes the first message. It just gave me goosebumps. Morten's work with camera is enough reason to praise him, the vision how he shows us things, the production design and some beautiful shots. He has made a movie that is both eye candy and smart.However, the reason most people will remember The Imitation Game is two outstanding performances by Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley. It's arguably Benedict's best performance so far, even better than Sherlock. There are some similarities between Turing and Holmes, both are bad at people, both are socially awkward, so it could not have been easier for him to portray Alan. But he does something extraordinary here, expressing his character in every his word, look and nerve. His brilliant performance made possible to feel the despair of character in the last scene, where Turing is already on medication. While Keira's character does not have such emotional scenes, she still is mind-blowing bringing Joan to the screen. There is one scene, where Knightley is exceptional and perfectly shows strength of Clarke - where Alan breaks up with her and she gives a speech how strong she is and that she will not give others chance to ruin her life.The rest of cast does equally good job, from Charles Dance to Mark Strong, who plays head of MI6 special unit, in between including Matthew Goode, Alex Lawther - young Alan Turing and Matthew Beard. Even though Goode was amazing here, I'm still waiting for his time to shine, because he's damn great actor.Movie is technically well done with great production design, cinematography, costumes and editing. Oscar winner editor William Goldenberg (Argo) cuts the scenes so that it feels well-paced and never gets boring. Cinematographer Oscar Faura (The Machinist) captures some beautiful shots of destroyed city, battle field and Bletchley Park.",

It was the case with e.g. A Beautiful Mind, and now with the film in question, where the \"conglomeration\" Tuldym/Moore/Cumberbatch has generated a real masterpiece. In spite of complex time and references to atypical sexuality, the scenes pass smoothly, delicately, without moralising or providing stringent assessments. And Benedict Cumberbatch has excelled again; well, I have watched most of the films with his presence and I can't say he is \"better\" here - he is always great, sometimes the material is weaker perhaps, but his Hawking or van Gogh or Assange or Holmes have been splendid as well. As regards other actors, I liked the performances of Mark Strong and Charles Dance more than that of Keira Knightley; yet, she performed well, but her looks differed a lot from the real Joan Clarke's. But The Imitation Game is still a film largely based on real personalities and events.All in all, a good film, hopefully paving the way for Oscar nominations at least.

            "content": "This is the first time for me to be so eager to write a review that I might have even sacrificed my nap time for it, just for the lolz. Anyhow, I have been blown away by some other masterpieces in biography before, from Becoming to those great works that I cannot even recall right away. In order to savor the moments before it miles away, I feel incumbent upon retaining the soul-touching elements presented throughout this film, followed by three specifications as follows.For starters, I do not want to repeat the signature lines that have been mentioned thousands of times already, but would like to state the shared marvel that have appeared and will still keep coming to us, not just in the times of war in Britain but also in many different times and regions of the world. Brilliant minds are often neglected or even deemed repugnant initially but somehow manage to rise above and stand the test of time, be it Alan Turing or Galileo Galilei. Regardless of beliefs, race and sexual orientation, these are the prophets of science who revolutionize the human society. In my humble opinion, it takes courage, persistence and most importantly, insights that come from intelligence running in one's blood, for them to stay the course till the victory arrives. They have to be confronted by the suspicion from the loved ones and even to be tortured by the ones who are not on their sides from the get-go, say the death threats from the la-di-da leaders or coworkers. I simply cannot imagine how much stressful they could be if I were in their shoes. Yet still, those who have survived all the adversity could certainly make a difference to whatever they are striving for. I wish I could be as tough as them on the inside and shoot for the what most people consider as mission impossible, such as mastering at least five foreign languages, achieving professional degrees in more then 3 domains and of course being a trillionaire as a woman.There is also something about comradeship between Alan and his work friends that has got me thinking. No matter how smart one can be, one can never be living as an isolated being but counting on any help one can have. I know it is nothing but a clique to see geniuses being edged out due to the lack of EQ but wound up being saved by those who used to find him insufferable, take Sheldon Cooper from the smash hit show The Big Bang Theory. But it is the truth of such comradeship that makes it possible to permeate every fictional and non-fictional creations where we are bound to drop a tear or two. Humans need this, so does every other living creature in the whole wide world. Sometimes it is exactly the connections between people that could turn the tide. One of many intricate evidence would be the time Alan cracked the code of the Enigma when Helen mentioned the incepted message sent by a German officer who was in love but she was only flirting with John. Likewise, it was also the bonding between Alan and his buddies that rescued his Christopher from the destruction by the ignorant commander, which also saved trillions of lives out there. I know it could be just an artistic touch to accent how harsh it was for Alan to carry on his work with no one actually understood back then, yet it still has revealed the importance of loyal companions.One last epiphany I have also derived from this work must be to think outside the box, even if sometimes one has to bend the rules a tad. Alan was unable to get the funding for his machine approved in the first place, but he managed to write to Churchill for understanding and authorization eventually. If he had caved in because of the myopic commander, none of the good things we have today would have ever happened. The only 5-minute plot has perfectly testified to the existence of immense possibility as long as one is brave enough to step out of their comfort zones. It might be a sudden failure but there is always a silver lining if one is willing to keep trying and tweaking the insufficiencies, say our AI as well as the medical research against the life-threatening pandemic today. Even for an ordinary people who are no scientists, we could still make breakthroughs in our own lives and take control of whatever we have our hearts in.I am genuinely delighted that I have written down the major bullet points with some elaboration above after watching the film, as someone who does not know too much movie production but has the desire to share with other viewers.Sybil.",

            "content": "Alan Turning, the man, the legend...he single handedly built the world's first computer and helped win WWII for the Allies due to his discoveries only to be sought out as a spy when in reality the only double life he was leading was that of a homosexual. The Imitation Game chronicles his discovery and his ultimate medical torture as British Parliament tries to \"rid him\" of his homosexuality. This is a heart wrenching biopic that really is a mere showcase of how good Benedict Cumberbatch is as an actor. Despite this very talented showcase, The Imitation Game achieves very little during its two hour runtime other than letting us know, sometimes a bit too heavily, that Cumberbatch is an amazing actor. Working from Graham Moore's impeccable BlackList script, Morten Tyldum tries to make this film more of an espionage thriller but it couldn't be further from that. The Imitation Game is a character study and straight biopic that falls into the well treaded clich\u00e9s that make up the genre. The story is slow moving, and extremely jumbled as it jumps from 1951 to 1939 a little too often, making it very hard to end up caring about each storyline in their own rights. While I commend Tyldum's work here with his actors, he misses the mark in telling this engaging story. Instead, he throws most of the load on Cumberbatch. Any other actor would have probably crumbled under such pressure but Cumberbatch rises to not only give the performance of his career but the performance of a decade. Cumberbatch as Turning isn't very likable, but he is articulate, shy and extremely intelligent and Cumberbatch uses that to his advantage. His performance as Turning is somber, articulate and intelligent, much like the man he is portraying. It is a marvelous performance that makes the film worth watching based solely on that. The supporting cast is decent here, Kiera Knightley is very good in this film as she plays Joan Clarke, a woman that tries desperately to get close to Turning throughout the course of the 1939 storyline. Other actors include Matthew Goode, Charles Dance and Mark Strong. Each of them are decent in their roles but pale in comparison to Cumberbatch. Overall, while The Imitation Game may have one of the best performances of the year in it, it doesn't make up for its jumbled narrative.",

The Imitation Game is an interesting story, especially relevant because it's based on intelligence information kept secret for decades post World War II. Adding to the intrigue, the history and the superb performances by Benedict Cumberbatch, who portrays the British mathematician Alan Turing and a brilliant cast, the movie also confronts the controversial issue of the cruel, archaic and now illegal practice of treating homosexuality. This movie will be studied and discussed for many years because of the social themes entwined in the plot. Highly recommended viewing.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game follows the true story of Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) a brilliant mathematician and expert in cryptonology who along with a small team of experts sets to work trying to crack the Enigma code.This is an utterly fascinating film and was totally compelling from start to finish; Moore's wonderful screenplay gives us 3 different aspects of Turing's life - the childhood strand is there for character development and to help the audience to understand Turing and to get a feel for him as a person, the main aspect obviously focuses on the 'code breaking' and the 3rd element focuses on Turing's life after World War 2. Although the screenplay does jump from one aspect of Turing's life to another it's never done in a needlessly confusing manner and Moore's screenplay never has any unnecessary filler.Turing is a socially awkward person, but he isn't knowingly obnoxious. For this reason it makes it easy to care for him as a character. Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) tells him that if he's nice to people then they will be more likely to help him - this leads Turing to try and be nice (resulting in him giving his co-workers an apple each and then attempting to get them on side by telling a joke which was clearly only funny to Turing). I really liked Turing as a character and that's ultimately one of the film's biggest selling points. Despite the fact that Turing and his co-workers squabbled a lot, I always felt that there was a strong dynamic between the men and this becomes evident in one key scene.The next big selling point with this film is clearly Cumberbatch's performance; he was really convincing in portraying Turing as a socially awkward mathematician, his mannerisms and general demeanour were first-rate. The supporting cast were all fine, but it's Benedict Cumberbatch who was definitely the stand-out performer. The film also benefits from some rather handsome visuals.The Imitation Game is a wonderful film which anyone who is a fan of biopics or modern history would be well-advised to check out.",

It can feel overly traditional in places - structurally it's a movie I've seen a thousand times before - but I really enjoyed the performances and the angular look given to its cast. Nobody's a complete saint or sinner, even Turing himself, and the film is at its best exploiting those hidden character motivations and personality quirks. Benedict Cumberbatch is the most visible performer, of course, engulfing the screen as the intensely-awkward codebreaker who possesses neither wit nor tact. A kind of autist savant, he's very good at one thing and that is not social interaction. I was more impressed with Keira Knightley, though, as his fianc\u00e9e-of-convenience, Joan Clarke. Her eyes dazzle with caged intellect, as much a victim of the era of misogyny as Turing was to a jealous, homophobic witch-hunt. Together the two positively vibrate, a beautiful partnership that was ultimately bound to self-destruct. Deeply interesting and quite often moving, it's an oddly cathartic experience despite the dark ending.",

            "content": "Unless you have been living in a dust bowl somewhere, you've probably heard more about British actor Benedict Cumberbatch with each passing day. He doesn't have your vintage, movie star looks and a 20 million dollar per-pic salary. He does however, give a sufficient, multilayered performance in The Imitation Game (my latest review). His real life character portrayal (mathematician Alan Turing) is the torn lovechild of Russell Crowe's John Nash from A Beautiful Mind and Jesse Eisenberg's Mark Zuckerberg from The Social Network. We're talking a tattered genius with a veritable secret shame to boot.With a script by virtual unknown Graham Moore and a true story adaptation that's been kept in a vault for I guess, fifty years (according to the closing credits), The Imitation Game skillfully focuses on code breaking during the Second World War. Alan Turing, a timid yet intelligent pawn who's homosexuality ultimately led to his suicide by way of unfair persecution, is the chief codebreaker who designs a machine that no one and I mean no one, has ever seen before. Said machine succeeds in solving the Enigma Code (a method used to decipher secret messages in combative lore). Turing's posthumous contributions from what I've picked up, might have been the evolution of computer usage as we know it today. Government cover up? Maybe. Something that went completely over my head but in a good way? Oh ya betcha.Right off the bat, The Imitation Game's look is glossy and it depicts the mid-1900's as anti-kitsch. With its perfected period detail, events are told in flashbacks over flashbacks with present day scenes occupying 10 percent of the flick's 114 minute running time. Although some of it is at times choppy, director Morten Tyldum gets away with Turing's disseminating journey anyway. In only his fourth effort behind the camera, Mort doesn't let his storytelling attributes fall into History Channel territory. He livens things up a bit with some solid, single edits. This keeps everything moving at a brisk pace. Basically, \"Imitation Game\" is to war what 2011's Moneyball is to sports. What we have here is fascinating, behind the scenes stuff. And like 1983's Wargames, this is a vehicle that doesn't need explosions, violent images, sexual innuendo, or harsh language to grab you.As for the acting, it never relinquishes a false note. Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander and Charles Dance as Commander Denniston are effective playing antagonists who butt heads with the Cumberbatch character. In regards to Keira Knightley, she holds her own in a supporting role as Turing's mild love interest (the lovely Joan Clarke). She underplays her role slightly until emoting with a damnable ultimatum in the last twenty minutes of the proceedings. It is an Oscar moment of glory and it's a beauty.In retrospect, The Academy Awards are coming in a few days and it looks like Boyhood might clean house. What blasphemy. This is not a mediocre film by any means but it rides by on its fainted novelty (actors aging in real time over a period of 12 years). The Imitation Game on the other hand, is the archetypal choice, a logical winner for best picture 2014. Like the aforementioned A Beautiful Mind, this is something about a protagonist who was socially inept, had few friends, and harbored a secret which ultimately interfered with his brilliance as a human being. \"Imitation Game\" captures Alan Turing's plight in a sophisticated and caring way. Its got that historical aspect which provokes critics to give four star ratings. It also has the ability to tickle Academy voters with the same tutorial. In essence, this coup d'etat of an exercise doesn't need to \"imitate\" greatness. It accomplishes that feat all on its own.",

From Joan Clarke's (a quite good Keira Knightley) late entrance to the examination that was to help you in choosing your team to Benedict Cumberbatch's interpretation of your person (also good, but you can't help but think that it is nothing more than a mild mannered and stuttering version of his Sherlock Holmes), this movie is good, but falls short of greatness.The story itself is one that everyone should know about. Turing was a genius, a difficult one (is there any who smiles and is nice?; maybe no interest in a biopic about them) who gets into the supermegasecret team (some action movie shortcomings here, with music and people running from one place to the other just to make the viewer feel all these characters always had traditional random comment-light-bulb-running back to the office moment) to crack the Nazi German Enigma code. The movie does a nice (albeit traditional) job of presenting the characters and their struggle against the code, while offering two more moments of Turing's life (back in school, when he was bullied and after the war, when it was discovered he was a homosexual). It is all very neatly done, nice interpretation and pace, etc etc.So why follow on all the steps of so many biopics from the past, as Turing was obviously a person who hadn't a conventional life?You won't regret watching the movie.

Overall it was a very good inspiring experience yet I must say it has quite many flaws. Maybe my expectations were too high. Anyways, have my utmost respect to Alan Turing whose work has been immensely influential in the field of computation and algorithms. Graham Moore's screenplay (adapted from 'Alan Turing : The Engima\") boosted by mesmerizing performance by Benedict Cumberbatch does great justice portraying the character of Alan Turing on the screen.The Imitation Game captures Alan Turing's life at three different stages. 1928-When Turing was in school, 1940-when he starts working at Bletchley park to crack the enigma and 1951-police investigation a robbery at Turing's place. While the part I was most excited about was the cracking of the enigma, which is an encryption device used by Germans for war-related communication during WWII. Turing with help of other mathematicians and experts at Bletchely Park like Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) and Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) build the \"Bombe\", the machine for decryption of German messages so that English would know location of German attacks and plan accordingly. The film though kind highlights Turing a bit too much as if he did it all single handed but he indeed was the mastermind behind the implementation. The childhood part shows Turing's relation with his only good friend Cristopher among gangs of bullies. While the house robbery part of 1951 is where Turing gives account of all the events through his life as narrated in the film when he his being interrogated by the police. There is lot switching back and forth in the timeline of events, which wasn't necessary feeling like a poor trying- to-be-smart effort. There was a lot of potential with the enigma- cracking in the script to genuinely render smartness, unfortunately they only scratch the surface of it. I wished there was more math and actual computational terminology involved.Despite the main core of the film being the actual cracking of the enigma, the back and forth switches kind of kill the intensity and thrill. Also it made the narration lack focus. Keeping those things aside, it does not fail to imprint the glorious achievements of Turing in our minds. Benedict Cumberbatch has given an award-worthy performance in the tough race of outstanding actors in 2014. Keira Knightley was also surprisingly great and delightful to watch. The production design is top notch encapsulating the WWII time ideally. Alexandre Desplat's score is beautiful as most of his works. I was slightly disappointing having too high expectations, overall The Imitation Game is a thrilling,inspiring,charismatic but over- dramatized biopic. RATING: [3/5]",

            "content": "Mathematician and cryptographer Alan Turing experiences both triumph and tragedy in Norwegian director Morton Tydlum's The Imitation Game, the true story of a man whose help in breaking the Nazi's Engima Code during World War II may have brought the war to an earlier end. Lauded by Winston Churchill as being the man who made the greatest single contribution to the war effort, the film is both a celebration of Turing's life and an infuriating look at the circumstances that turned him from a hero into a pariah. Based on the book Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges with a screenplay by Graham Moore and a haunting score by Alexandre Desplat's haunting score, the film unfolds as both a biography and an intriguing adventure story with key moments in his life depicted in flashbacks.Shown are Turing's troubling days in boarding school, his time working for the British government at Bletchley Park during World War II as part of a team of code breakers, and the post-war years when Turing, a gay man, was investigated for what was then the crime of \"gross indecency\" by the police. Most of the film deals, however, with Turing's uphill struggle to break the Engima Code with altering ups and downs of excitement and disappointment. As brilliantly portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch who brings richness and complexity to the role, Turing is a brilliant but highly eccentric individual whose aloof personality is off-putting to his superiors and his co-workers.These include chess champion Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode), John Cairncross (Allen Leech), and Peter Hilton (Matthew Beard) as the team members. Only Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), whom Turing chooses by placing an ad in the newspapers, and Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong), a high-level Intelligence operative, see Turing in a positive light with Knightley brightening up the film considerably with her warmth and general cheerfulness. Exasperated by the slowness of the effort to break the case, the military commander in charge of the operation (Charles Dance) is anxious to fire him. It is only when after Turing gets the go ahead from Churchill that he is provided funding for the machine he needs and is placed in charge of the project.We do not find out why he names the machine \"Christopher\" until the film, in one of its best and most affecting sequences, revisits his days at boarding school in the 1920s. Bullied by his peers, the teenage Turing (Alex Lawther) develops a supportive relationship with classmate Christopher (Jack Bannon), also a brilliant mathematics student. Their close friendship is handled with exquisite sensitivity by Tydlum and the depiction of its ending is truly heartbreaking. After months of frustration and disappointment, the exhilaration is palpable when a breakthrough is achieved, but the celebration is short-lived when it is realized that it is necessary to be very selective in how they use the information in order to prevent the Germans from switching to a different code.Sadly, in that process, they have to choose who lives and who dies, and the brother of Peter, the youngest member of the team, is one of those sacrificed. The final segment of the film returns to the police interrogation where Turing reveals to policeman (Rory Kinnear) his participation in the wartime effort which was classified for fifty years and asks him whether he is a war hero or a criminal. The response does not bring credit on the police, the law that was enforced, or the British government. Although Turing was awarded the Order of the British Empire for his services in 1945 and was officially pardoned by Queen Elizabeth in 2013, The Imitation Game convincingly makes clear that an unjust law not only destroyed one of the best minds of the century, but damaged all of us.",

Messages that anyone can see, but no one knows what they mean, unless you have the key. How is that different from talking? Talking? When people talk to each other they never say what they mean. They say something else. And you're supposed to just know what they mean. Only, I never do. So how is that different? Alan, I have a funny feeling that you're going to be very good at this.\"Looking back, the above-mentioned conversation between Alan Turing and his school friend Christopher Morcom, is for me the perfect summary of the fascinating life of the intellectual mathematician Turing. The phenomenon he faced throughout his whole life had to do with \"decoding\". From an early age, Alan had trouble dealing with his fellow men. It was for him in a way a kind of cryptogram how to act and react towards his fellow men. A brilliant mind who simply couldn't grasp simple human interactions. At a later stage he was the one who designed a forerunner of the current computer and who formed the basis of the principles of artificial intelligence, in order to crack the infamous Enigma cipher, which was used by the Germans during WWII and which combination changed every 24 hours. An almost impossible task to do for a human being. But thanks to the pioneering work of Polish scientists in this area it was made possible by him, by building one of the first self-correcting computers \"The Bombe\". Ultimately this would drastically change the course of WWII and shorten this dreadful period with 2 to 4 years. So millions of lives were spared in that way.This magnificent biopic highlights three important episodes in the life of Turing: his school period in Sherborne where he obviously was the center of harassment's because of his odd behavior, the war period which took place mainly at Bletchley Park where he and some staff members built the innovative machine and the postwar period. The result is a clever interwoven story that jumps effortlessly from period to period. I'm not a huge fan of these flashbacks normally but the Norwegian director Morten Tyldum succeeds wonderfully in making three parallel stories without too much confusion. Although most of the story takes place during the 2nd world war, it's not a typical war movie. So don't expect any heroic battle scenes. The emphasis is on the person Turing and his mental state that haunted him throughout his life. A hard, impatient, arrogant, narcissistic person who wasn't easy to work with. He had a profound distaste of explaining complicated theorems and he treated everyone in a derogatory way. Many of his traits appear autistic and point in the direction of Asperger syndrome.What really impressed me in this film was the interpretation of Benedict Cumberbatch who impersonates the person Turing in a brilliant way. A realistic portrait in which the viewer is trying to decipher the riddle Turing. He managed to change your feelings regarding this genius again and again. From sympathy to irritation and than changing it into pity. One moment you passionately hate this bastard. The next moment you deeply admire him and you are outraged about the treatment this \"war hero\" underwent. A lack of appreciation for his impossible feat and the fact that it was only in 2009 one pleaded for a posthumous rehabilitation and the British government eventually offered its apologies. Although I also had a mathematical education and am working daily with computers, I must admit that I'd never heard of Alan Turing. This year there was a scene in \"The Machine\" I enjoyed, where a certain Vincent, also an A.I. expert, subjected certain software systems to a Turing test. Also a known procedure described in an article by Turing while working at the University of Manchester.No doubt about it. This was one of the most interesting films of the last year with some masterful acting. Not only by Cumberbatch (and I put my money on him when it's about the Oscar), but also by Keira Knightley, who I usually dislike when she uses her exaggerated expressive smile again. Also the result of cracking the code and the taken subsequent actions, gave the story an extra dimension. There were some historical inaccuracies though : The machine never got the name \"Christopher\" (this was purely for increasing the drama content of the film), the impression one gets as if Turing was the initial designer and the fact that he wrote a letter to Churchill on his own.

Even Cumberbatch gives another \"Sherlockian\" performance. Truth to be told, he did well with the material he had to work with.A pleasant two hours of a movie you will forget very soon.

            "review_title": "An endearing biopic that strives for truth and humanity",
            "content": "When it comes to war, frequent successes have been documented in and out of the battlefield. Sure, the act of participating in war results in a much different human being when it's all over Vs doing everything else behind the lines but either or, they all played a part in the meat grinder that is the lethal conflict between countries. During the first number of years in World War II, Germany had several nations on the run or at least just barely holding their own against Adolf Hitler and his Nazi followers. One of the reasons why Germany was so on top of the game was due to their communication system known as Enigma. Enigma was a crafty setup of transmissions that had a certain code attached to it but had a time stamp of only a day. Once the time expired, the Nazis would then reset their code and start with a fresh slate. For the allied powers (at the time excluding the US), this was a real pain because deciphering the code was difficult enough, but then having to figure out a new set every day turned out being more than many could handle.Enter Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), the man who would discover how to crack the complex Nazi communication code. The story mainly follows the points in time of how Turing works towards figuring out a solution to understanding how Hitler and his crew were so untouchable. Along with that are a number of flash forwards and backwards to help develop Turing as the main lead. Headed by Norwegian director Morten Tyldum and written by Graham Moore in their first British film with a west coast release, this movie has a number of points throughout its run time that demonstrate the point of this film is not about the triumph of good over evil in World War II, but of something deeper. World War II and cracking Enigma is more of a backdrop than anything else to this highly character driven story. Throughout the film, viewers are introduced to various other individuals that influence Turing in several ways. Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, a tough female who also cares a lot for Turing. Matthew Goode plays a collaborative associate with Turing and although they both start off on the wrong foot, they end up mending their points of view for the better of others. Charles Dance plays the commander in charge of Turing and regrets ever giving him a chance after Winston Churchill put Turing in charge of the program. Mark Strong also has a role as 2nd in command and has further information given about him later. Last of importance is Rory Kinnear who plays a detective after the events of World War II who's looking to interview Turing. What's great about Kinnear's part is that he basically serves as the audience - asking certain questions in which the answers given can be interpreted by they themselves along with Kinnear's scripted reactions. The supporting cast is what truly helps give the story such a strong foundation. Without the right actors and a properly written script, the character development would not have been as strong. There are several moments that may even through the audience off guard.Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing gives a believable performance and as awkward as the main lead is portrayed, he still carries an enormous amount of charm. Much of this comes from the fact that Turing speaks his mind very bluntly. This is not because he's immature or does so just because. He does it because he knows he's right and the delivery at which it is given is deadpan. This in itself evokes the whole point and main theme behind the screenplay. The moral is to be yourself no matter what people say or think about you. Many viewers will be able understand and connect to Turing as time goes on. Turing was no Albert Einstein who is usually helmed as one of the greatest scientists of an older generation. Turing was a tragic hero, a person who faced failure and aggression everywhere he went all because of him trying to crack a Nazi code with radical ideas. Adding to that development is how Turing deals with discovering the solution and then running into more obstacles after that personally and professionally. It's not like once the solution was found everything was hunky dory, no sir.It is interesting to see the facts given in the epilogue to the story. Knowing and understanding the history behind it is an informative move. However once this happens, in some ways the film feels like it was trying to prove a conspiracy theory because of how top secret this operation was. This is stated because it will make the viewer wonder how things could've turned out if Alan Turing did not step up to the task of cracking the Enigma code. Outside of the written areas of the film, the other technical parts were adequate. Oscar Faura as the cinematographer produced well lit and clear shots for the film. No panning landscape shots were filmed but it was nice to see various clips of historical archive footage. The music composed by Alexandre Desplat was kind of a disappointment though. There are some effective tracks but not a whole lot of it stood out as memorable. Most of the score came across as largely generic with no reoccurring motif. Oh well, guess you can't have everything.It's music feels somewhat underdeveloped and it sometimes feels like it's trying to unveil a conspiracy theory but it isn't a huge issue. The cast all act very well, the script develops its characters effectively and the its overall message about accomplishing one's goals is an inspiring tale told through Alan Turing's life experiences.",

The eureka sequence is good, although the celebration of their success is uninspired. What follows is full of potential, as the deceptiveness of the state crushes the individual. I wish they'd tied this in with Turing's view on violence. How would that reflect on war, on the winners of the war? How does Turing's statistical approach affect our notions of good and evil? Serious stuff.But instead of an anti-war film they gave us a tragic tale of bigotry, and it peters out with his sad life.Not being too critical. It's just a difficult story to handle.Apart from that the two leads play really well together. There are a few bum notes. The joke he didn't get wasn't a joke. Knightley doesn't really seem to help with the code breaking. And the \"deep\" line about those we least expect is used like a sledgehammer. ps. His intro to cryptography is a nice observation on subtext. Careful talk costs lives - there's your irony.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game was a very good movie. I like UK films and UK actors. They hone their craft well. For drama nothing beats their abilities. Perhaps it comes from their extensive education, theater and TV background before moving on to film. However, when I think of the great movies and TV shows coming out of Hollywood today most of the actors seem to be of UK origin. I'm thinking David Oyelowo in Selma, Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage in the Hobbit, Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl, Rachel Weisz in Interstellar, Sam Heughan, Caitriona Balfe, Tobias Menzies and Graham McTavish from Outlander just to list a few this season that blew me away. In The Imitation Game, we get several great UK actors as well: Benedict Cumberbatch does a fabulous job as Alan Turing. He plays the introverted yet flawed genius of Alan Turning to perfection. I feel not enough credit is going to Keira Knightley who played Joan Clarke the only woman on the team, her character was a genius in her own right who would not have been taken seriously except for Turning. Keira has the ability to transform herself into whatever role she's asked to take on, and this one is no exception. She is what makes Turing's character understandable and likable. If not for his relationship with her, Benedict would not have a vehicle to show his vulnerable side in this movie, and it is that side which we come to relate to the terrible tragedy of his life. Other actors of note in The Imitation game were, Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander, Matthew plays the charming, handsome, likable man on the team who balances the performance by Cumberbatch and I thought Alex Lawther as the young Alan Turing turned in a great performance and gave you an understanding as to why Turning became like he was.The movie plot was well done, interesting story line. As a mathematician and computer scientist I knew of Turning's contribution to the field of computational mathematics and computer science. I, like many, probably knew little about his life, his involvement in the WWII, nor his homosexuality and what the government of the day did to him because of it. It was indeed an enlighten story from many aspects. We see how people of difference not only make amazing contributions to our society if allowed to, but also how governments make life and death choices every day some for the good of mankind, some bad because of the prejudices of the times. I think this story has many lessons for all of us. I strongly recommend this film. It's a must see for all this season.",

            "content": "I saw this film hoping for a full account of how the team at Bletchley Park broke Enigma. What I got instead was a bravura performance by Dominic Cumberbatch of Alan Turing as a man of unique mathematical skills but completely inept at almost everything else. Presumably he was on the Asperger's spectrum, although that condition was not identified until long after Turing's death. Of course, his life had to telescoped to fit into the format of single film leading to a number factual inaccuracies many of which are listed in the Message Board below, but beware of spoilers.In addition to these, I suspect the depiction of the Commanding Officer should be viewed as a depiction of the type of forces officer who was completely unable to come to terms with the behaviuor of the academics who made the whole thing work.To my surprise, Turning's relationship with Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightly) appears to be accurate and not an attempt to bring in a love interest. Clarke's sex limited her role in breaking Enigma. Remember, 1940 was a time when the RAF was desperate for experienced pilots, but women who'd been flying for years were not allowed a combat role and we and were limited to ferrying new, unarmed, planes from the factories to airfields role.One other thing that disappointed me was the failure to differentiate between the Bomb (that was partly mechanical and had lots of wheels) and Colossus, built by a Post Office engineer to Turing's design that used valves, was entirely electrical, programmable, and the ancestor of modern computers.But, as I indicated at the start, this is not a documentary, it is a superb depiction of a genius.",

The supporting actors are also good and there is some moment of British humor to lighten the atmosphere. The only thing I find objectionable is that the movie gives the idea that Turing was the only one who actually cracked the code. The solitary genius who did it all on his own and even against his own team - with the exception of the Knightley character.All this to put Turing on an even higher pedestal and to underline that he was such as genius AND gay. Basically gay = genius in this movie. Which seems rather far-fetched, because it surely is a fact that not all gay people are geniuses, just like not all straight people are\u0085 The again, the \"solitary\" hero is a concept a lot more fascinating than \"team work\".",

This film, about the accomplishments, trials and tribulations of gay mathematician and codebreaker Alan Turing, is utterly breathtaking and well crafted. Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing is not just the performance of the year, it's one of the best performances of all time. He breathes life, passion and extreme emotion into this role, more so than any other of his other performances.I had read the biography of Alan Turing, by Andrew Hodges, a year before the film's release. although it is a very loose adaptation of the book, it is an entertaining version of the story. The book was intensely complex and lengthy, and, just as the opening lines of the movie state, you have to pay attention. Personally, I can't think a better film adaptation of the intricate, enigmatic and beautiful story of Alan Turing. Seeing what all these men and women did during the war, and all of the achievements Alan did, such as making the first designs for a digital computer (sadly this is only alluded to in the film) and shortening the war by two years, is just extraordinary. The film truly does justice to a man so horribly wronged by a homophobic system at the time.

He may even have saved the life of my own beloved grandfather who worked in the Brooklyn (New York) Navel Yard all throughout World War 2! A military target that would have eventually been within reach of German submarines.If it wasn't for Alan Turing's genius, integrity and perseverance all of history would have been changed for the worse. Another minor footnote: He's also the father of the modern computer and one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived.Despite being one of the giants of the 20th century, few people outside those with a passion for history or computing have ever heard of the man until now. No universities or streets are named after him. No statues or portrait honor Turing anywhere in the world all because he is gay. In fact, it took the Queen of England to the year 2013 to issue him a pardon for having consensual sex - in the privacy of his home - with another man! In 2013! That's an abomination. The Queen of England is sitting on her throne in one piece because of this man! She should have laid a wreath on his grave decades ago!I'm not ashamed to admit it, but I sobbed at the end of this movie! This is a most profound story about love! YES! LOVE! Intense, passionate love is not limited to just heterosexuals!It's also a story about sex. I was born in the 1960's and consensual sex - in the privacy of one's home - between men was legal in the State I was living in when I turned 18. But the stigma of being a sexual minority remains in way too many places \u2013 and affects me greatly in my own personal life to this very day. The pain I \u2013 and others \u2013 have suffered for being \"different\" is indescribable. This story validates my experiences and the experiences of millions of other sexual minorities \u2013 from around the world - both living and deceased.The cruelty Alan Turing experienced from his classmate is similar to what I had to endure in high school. But I was lucky; I never had to worry about having consensual sex with another man in the privacy of my own home. But in Alan Turing's case you get to see a good man who gave so incredibly much to the world be ripped apart by pure evil that was 100% legal back in the 1950's! It's so ironic too! Watch closely. The police officer breaks the law and he is the one who should be legitimately imprisoned! It's not just in the United States that police officers feel they are above the law they supposedly serve! Memo to Hollywood: This shows you know how to make great movies. Sure, you won't make billions every time, but you're gonna make a tidy profit by doing a spectacular job. Wouldn't you rather make a film people will be watching 500 years from now on another planet in another solar system then making trash, like The Hobbit trilogy, that no will care about once it leaves the theaters? One more point to ponder: Michelangelo is considered by most people to be the greatest sculptor who ever lived. He was a gay man and he lived five centuries ago - in peace - till he died at 88 (Yes 8-8). Now fast-forward to the 1950's - in what was supposedly the country that birthed modern democracy - and look what the British did to one of the greatest mathematicians that ever lived only because he is gay!",

What a stupid way to start a movie.After WWII someone notifies some cop that there was a break-in at Turing's house. Cops arrive. Everything is in disarray. Turing tells them that nothing's missing and to get lost. He treats them like crap. One of them finds it suspicious and instead of being glad that there's no case here, he starts to look into Turing, apparently he has nothing else to do in life.Now we are taken to wartimes. Turing shows up in some commander's office to announce that he should be hired because only he can solve Enigma. That's the machine the Nazis use to code their military messages. Turing comes across as arrogant and full of himself, again, but the commander goes for it. He assembles a team to work on breaking the enigma code. Problem is there isn't just one code but that it changes every day. Turing demands 100000 pounds to build a machine that will work on the codes. The commanders laughs it off. So Turing sends a letter to Churchill himself who agrees. Now Turing is in charge of the whole operation. He fires some team members and recruits new ones via a public puzzle challenge.This gives him the opportunity to work on his pet project--a calculating machine. He keeps building it while everyone else works on code-breaking including presumably some little girl he recruited.Now for no good reason we go to Turing's youth at school. He was awkward with no social skills and obsessive-compulsive. The other boys bullied him. Except one who helped him, who gave him a code and cipher book to read. They developed a friendship and little Turing \"falls in love\" with him, whatever that may mean for a school boy.The cop in the meantime digs into Turing's life only to find--nothing. Everything is top secret. He forges papers to request his military file--it's an empty envelope. Somehow the cops find out that before the break-in Turing was with another younger man, so they call him in.Meanwhile the code-team makes no progress, until through good old-fashioned human intelligence, Turing a la Gregory House, realizes that there are some patterns in all Nazi communications, and now once they feed some of that into the machine, the manage to break the enigma code. But...Turing realizes they can't use the information because it would give away the secret to the Nazis that the Brits have succeeded. So instead he and his team provide MI6 with some probabilities so they can figure out how to use this information while keeping the Nazis in the dark.After the war it all has to be destroyed and kept a secret. And now we meet up with Turing as he's being interviewed by the cop, or rather, Turing is confessing it all to him--secrecy be damned. Turing is convicted and chooses to be chemically castrated instead of facing jail. In the end we learn his fate.The Imitation Game starts strong. The whole Enigma operation is fascinating. Turing's arrogance is entertaining. And while not very socially adept, he's a good authority figure when he's dealing with his area of expertise. His friendship with the girl is cute, but that whole story is pointless as it only aims to show that back then, there were different expectations for women--shocking news! Also pointless are the childhood scenes that tell us nothing about Turing's intelligence. Did he or didn't he stand out as a kid for his smarts? Was it evident back then that he had potential? The movie doesn't bother to tell us.Also missing are some details about the Turing machine. I assume that this thing was revolutionary at the time. Or maybe not? Another thing the movie doesn't care about. How did Turing come upon the idea of the machine? How it work? How did the input work? What does it do with it? Some more technical aspects would have made the movie much more fascinating. Instead the movie-makers focus on the homosexual aspect for some reason and try to imply that Turing's genius was because he was a homosexual, which is laughable.I was hoping the movie makers would treat the issue of homosexuality with some class and finesse, if they felt the need to address it all, instead they went completely bonkers. And ended up glorifying it, instead of the man and his genius.",

This film stars Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, a real life mathematician and graduate of Cambridge University, who works with a team of cryptographers to crack the seemingly impossible secret Nazi code. In attempt to go against all odds, Turing builds a complex machine that he believes his capable for cracking the code itself.This is one of the most brilliantly made films of 2014, but perhaps not the best film set during World War II. This takes some complex turns here and there. It does, however, manage to stay intriguing through most of it's time. The film also offers a great cast of actors and strong performances, along with Cumberbatch. Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, a woman who Alan Turing hires to assist in the breaking of the Nazi code, and seemingly falls in love with. Then there is Mark Strong, who plays Stewart Menzies, a British general and chief of the British Secret Service. These actors bring top-notch performances to the screen, and I enjoyed them. Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard, and Allen Leech also bring out some great acting.This film also tackles major issues dealing with sexuality. Benedict Cumberbatch's character, Alan Turing, is learned to be homosexual and is in violation of the law as a result. The film not only focuses on his attempt of breaking the Nazi code, but also on the dilemma of his sexuality into politics. In my opinion, I didn't find this to be an important factor to the film, especially as a subplot. While I did find it interesting, I felt that it was tampering with the film's focus a little bit. Overall, I was satisfied with the film, and I think the director and actors did a fantastic job.",

An absolutely brilliant mathematician who morphed into a juggernaut of a electrical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and a transcendent mind as to how best to use the troves of information only he, and his team, deciphered.Turing was deep in the shadows as the intel his team provided turned the war from the darkness of Hitler to victory for the Allies saving millions of lives in the process. He couldn't come out of that shadow as it was mandated his team's work must remain classified. The Imitation Game makes it poignantly clear Turing paid dearly for his crucial part never being celebrated. If his life wasn't difficult enough, being a closet homosexual professor, the laws of Britian made it infinitely more difficult by prosecuting what the law only saw as a common college professor with a lascivious and lewd predilection. The heartbreaking fact of some of the same intolerance Hitler practiced visited a man who should have been celebrated as a national treasure, likely propelling him to suicide, is finally revealed. A colossal irony to be sure. The Imitation Game brings some much needed justice to story of Alan Turing and does so with a very matter-of-fact telling of both the triumph and tragedy of his life.The Imitation Game is a movie that works on virtually all levels. It rights history and reveals much about how one man made a huge impact on winning the war for the Allies. It touches the inner humanity of the viewer as it quite eloquently shows the evil of intolerance toward our fellow human beings. Something many in the world still have not grasped; just today there was a terrible terrorist attack in France. This is a story that needed to be told and the whole of director, cast, cinematography, and production have brilliantly recreated so we can be immersed in, and, hopefully, learn from. A strong contender for academy awards for direction, actor, supporting actress, and best picture, you simply owe it to yourself to see this film.",

It's highly rated due to the alternative lifestyle of the main character, and the draconian laws that existed during that period. Fine. His lifestyle choice is of no concern to me.What I have an issue with is the fact that this was billed as a cryptography thriller. Well, the cryptography is scant, and the \"action\" is watered down for an audience that has a short attention span and zero interest in advanced concepts. I wouldn't call myself a nerd, but I did expect a little more in depth regarding the codes, methods, and trials it took to break them. This is glossed over completely. And then, you get to the biggest travesty....It takes some drunken banter in a bar from a minor character (who isn't even a mathematician) to solve the problems that plagued the team for years. From the very beginning, I kept yelling at the screen, \"look for repeating patterns! Like weather reports.\" And I am no genius mathematician. But this VERY SIMPLE concept seemed to elude the main characters for the better part of the movie, simply to move the plot along.Groan.And this won an Oscar? I hope for something like costumes, or score, and not something of any substance.Very disappointing.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game follows in a recent tradition of both British-based historical dramas intended to invoke sympathy and knowledge about incidents or individuals previously unknown or under-appreciated to the general public. Like The King's Speech, The Iron Lady or The Theory of Everything, it has gained much critical acclaim, but it also leaves one feeling rather empty at the end of it all; you sit there and ask \"Is that all they can invoke in us?\" In the case of Alan Turing, portrayed here as a most eccentric mathematical genius attempting to crack impossible German military codes during World War II, there seems to be more emphasis on him and his hang-ups rather than his work. Of course, there are scenes discussing his attempts to fund and build an enormous electromechanical device capable of searching through innumerable possibilities of coded words in order to deduce what was more likely being used and what could be discarded. Thus, the possible codes are highlighted, allowing the Allies to use such information against the enemy.If this sounds somewhat technical, that is because much of the dialogue here is filled with cryptological jargon, a language only understandable to those involved with such activities or otherwise interested in the usage of code-breaking as a tool to win the war. Such an idea is understandable and relatable, yet the film utilizes it only as a plot device, nothing more. Perhaps this is because the filmmakers felt too much technical language would turn audiences off, but it seems more likely they simply underestimate those interested in Turing's accomplishments. The man himself is reduced to another recent pattern of so many films: the antisocial yet brilliant genius capable of winning over adversaries through his work despite any effort to relate to others on a strictly human level. In some ways, this pattern exposes studios' belief in audiences wanting to see people who they believe are a type of ubermenschen, super-beings capable of thinking and acting beyond our middling, common understanding.This is certainly how Turing is portrayed here, despite Benedict Cumberbatch throwing himself completely into the role. As affable an actor as in work today, Cumberbatch nevertheless gets caught up in Turing's supposed speech handicaps and nervous ticks without using them to explore the darker aspects of Turing's personality. His homosexuality, made such an issue in the trailers and advertisement of the picture, was in fact simply another aspect of his life he attempted to privatize only for it to become his undoing. Any connection between his attraction to men and his attraction to complex puzzles seems rather stretching, although the film makes attempts to do so. In particular, the name of Turing's ground-breaking machine which is used to break German codes is 'Christopher,' who is shown in flashbacks to be a boyhood crush from school and died when Turing was still young. Such a fabrication only exposes the film's desire to create something that never was; this movie has its own impossible codes that remain just that.Despite all this, Cumberbatch is capable of creating enormous sympathy for this rather cold, unfeeling man who nevertheless somehow (through plot contrivance) manages to surround himself with die-hard supporters, including the brilliant Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) who Turing proposes to though it seems he may be attracted to her in some way. Again, this is merely used for plot extension, and despite there being no disrespect towards Clarke as a woman capable of holding her own against the male-dominated cryptography section at Bletchley Park, it causes one to question just what was the true nature of this peculiar yet symbiotic relationship. The movie never bothers to answer.Perhaps, the questions not answered cannot be. Much of Turing's work was hidden by the British government until a few years ago due to its highly-classified nature, which only underlines just how far-reaching his ideas became. The movie ends with several title cards telling us what became of Turing; the final one saying that 'Turing machines' are known better today as computers. Whatever truth this statement holds still allows us little access to understanding just what exactly motivated Turing in his work. In this film, he does it simply because he is good at it and he seems unqualified for any other work. Such a simplification is hardly ever the truth, and indeed there are many other aspects of the film which have come under fire for either emphasizing the unimportant or otherwise completely misappropriating various facts to the wrong individuals. Specifically, Turing was not as autistic or antisocial as this film leads us to believe, which only goes to show how certain aspects of one's life often become the true motivation to make a film about someone and their achievements. It's not enough that Turing accomplished so much; he has to have done it through personal shortcomings which otherwise would have caused one of us 'normal' people to falter. How can we, then, sympathize with an ubermensch?",

Both are historical true stories, with The Imitation Game being the good one.Benedict Cumberbatch may hold the ticket to an Academy Award win for Best Actor for his role as mathematician, Alan Turing. Cumberbatch plays Turing as evil genius-like, who creates machines to encrypt unbreakable codes during the Second World War, ultimately causing a win.I found The Imitation Game to be like 2002's Windtalkers, since both are about racing against time to keep top secret codes unbroken and winning war. While Windtalkers was clich\u00e9d and not well-liked, The Imitation Game had more layers to it and was more original. A subplot to this is the relationship he developed with coworker, Keira Knightly, despite being a homosexual. We get to see his love for codes as a youth as well as his struggles with homosexuality. The only thing that prevented me from really falling in love with this was how much war and political stuff was involved that was over my head. Brits talking about codes and politics was a little too much for me to swallow. It might just take me a few watches to fully comprehend and appreciate.I would not mind if this was the Oscar for Best Picture. I have a hunch that Benedict Cumberbatch will win for Best Actor.4/4",

            "content": "The enigma of course being Alan Turing. Did Alan Turing break the German Enigma code all by himself? Of course not. The movie does suggest without Turing it would never have been done. True or false? One of those questions rather difficult to answer, so let's just say Turing was a math genius (or maths genius) whose seminal work in artificial intelligence drastically changed the world and the course of World War II. And in the movie he comes across as the kind of guy who is completely wrapped up in his ideas on computing and breaking the Enigma code and concomitant with this is uncomfortable around other people and having to deal with them. From what I know of him, this is an accurate portrayal.The movie perfectly captures the state of Britain in the early years of the war (4 August 1939 through early 1942). Once France was knocked out of the war by the triumphant German Army (June 1940) and the Soviet Union still allied to Nazi Germany, Britain was completely isolated and facing a Europe either under direct Nazi control or allied with Germany. The Blitz, the strategic bombing campaign conducted by the Germans on Britain, ran from September 1940 through May 1941. The German Luftwaffe routinely bombed major cities in Britain, and because of Hitler's mania (the British dared to bomb Berlin the night of 25 August 1940), Hitler had the Luftwaffe specifically target London. The devastation was enormous. Add to this the unrelenting submarine warfare Germany was conducting on British shipping, and also US ships carrying aid (the US was not officially in WW II until 7 December 1941), Britain was suffering severely from the war. In truth it was losing it. And one of the chief means the Germans used for communications was the Enigma code. The British had to decipher it\u2015or face losing the war.Enter Bletchley Park and Alan Turing. Bletchley Park was the top-secret location where the British were desperately trying to break the Enigma code, and Turing greatly helped to facilitate this achievement. Turing was clearly a man who lived in his own world of ideas, ideas so out of the ordinary (at that time) that very few people could grasp them. And he often did a poor job of communicating effectively those then strange and bizarre, but brilliant, ideas to other people. All these things come across quite clearly in the movie.I've read several criticisms that claim the movie leaves much out. For example, Turing traveled to the US doing the time period that the movie covers. So what? To cover all these details would have made the movie inordinately long. Suitable for a book. Not for a movie.Is the movie entertaining? Most certainly yes. You feel you're right there in the midst of the action at all times. The acting is splendid. As I said, the movie captures the dangerous predicament that Britain was in at the time. Regarding casting, Turing wasn't a bad looking man, but he was no Benedict Cumberbatch. And Ms. Joan Clarke? Not exactly a Keira Knightley. Again, so what? They did a great job in acting in their portrayal of Turing and Clarke. The supporting cast is good too. And Cumberbatch's and Knightley's presence undoubtedly help sell the movie to the general public, many of whom probably never heard of Turing and might never have were it not for this movie.Regarding Turing's homosexuality, today we wonder what the fuss was all about. Although the movie doesn't downplay it, it doesn't make it the primary focus either. It was though what ultimately led him to take his own life. Turing's fate is a true shame. One wonders what he might have dreamed up if he had lived his full span of years.Highly recommended. 10/10",

This is coupled with a masterful performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as the enigmatic Turing. Though featuring little to no battle scenes in a film centered on WWII, 'The Imitation Game' rarely has any trouble depicting the high stakes facing its protagonist and his peers. Every second they toil away in their attempts to crack Nazi codes means more and more lives lost in the brutal conflict encompassing the globe. Cumberbatch portrays Turing as a brilliant if highly socially awkward innovator. He twitches and stutters constantly, with all of these seemingly insignificant physical traits and tics contributing to this depiction. As he struggles with external forces attempting to clamp down on his work, as well as his repressed homosexuality, Turing becomes, and behaves, more and more erratically. In recent years Cumberbatch has established himself as an acting powerhouse, and his role in 'The Imitation Game' will surely be added to the top of his portfolio. Many parallels are drawn between the revolutionary Nazi code-cracking computer Turing designs and Turing himself, an individual who at many points is deemed by his peers to be more machine than man. The supporting cast help strengthen this image, their unique, bubbly personalities contrasting with Turing's withdrawn nature. Like 'The Social Network, 'The Imitation Game' functions as both a terrific historical account of technological innovation, as well as a fascinating character study of the depths one will go to to ensure the survival of their work. However, unlike The Social Network's Mark Zuckerberg, who is presented largely as a Machiavellian antagonist, Alan Turing is presented as a tragic hero, a man who helped save possibly millions of lives, but was ultimately punished ruthlessly for his personal life.",

            "content": "There is a formulaic quality in the way the movie was done that overshadowed the good acting and the important story of Turing's life. Much of the situations that had Cumberbatch's character as a focal point in the film were rarely so in real life and many were completely fabricated. I understand how telling the story of an autistic gay mathematician in a manner that would make people want to see it was not an easy job, but as such much of the movie felt cheap.Turing is credited for inventing the modern concept of computers, although, as the movie itself shows, his design for the machine that broke the Enigma code was not only based on a Polish design, but was a collaborative work with a person that isn't even mentioned in the film. The situation of him being treated the way he was because he was gay and the ridiculous way the British government refused to acknowledge they did anything wrong for half a decade is only briefly mentioned in a screen text at the end.Bottom line: if you know nothing of Turing and wish to watch a populist retelling of his story, so watch The Imitation Game. It is not a bad movie at all. However, if you are interested in the actual person, search for other sources of information.Personally, I am tired of this style of film in which an arrogant but brilliant ass of a person gets vindicated only because at the end he is proved right in one situation or another.",

Many reviews and articles have been written about the screenwriter taking liberties with the actual facts. While this is true, the story that was put on the screen is exciting, humorous, thought-provoking, and, ultimately, sad. I think any movie recreating a true story or a person's life has to take some liberties with facts to make it understandable and enjoyable (and short ;-)). The Imitation Game in no way detracts from the accomplishments of all the real participants in the story, at least for me.There has also been discussion of the failure of the movie to more \"boldly\" address Alan Turing's homosexuality. I don't believe the film makers needed to emphasize it. His homosexuality was part of his personality, just as his apparent social awkwardness was. It was treated respectfully and made the closing scenes even more heartbreaking.The acting was wonderful, particularly Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, and the young man who portrayed young Alan Turing. Costumes, cinematography, production design, and music were first rate. The wartime special effects were not, however, entirely convincing. But on the whole, the movie is well worth seeking out.",

            "content": "'The Imitation Game (2014)' doesn't actually focus on the apparent focal code-breaking machine, or indeed its making, as much I'd have liked, instead choosing to spend much more time on a man who was severely wronged by the government he so strongly served. This might have been more down to expectation and preference, considering the machinations of the device are fascinating to say the least, than anything else, though, since the slight bait-and-switch is actually a welcome one. It allows for a much more personal stake in all of the action, though the balance could have perhaps been a little finer. What we have is, for the most part, a character study on a figure so often noted yet perhaps equally misunderstood. The flick is an interesting and tragic insight into his unfair and borderline inhumane treatment. It is engaging for its duration, even if it can be a tad slow and sometimes slightly strangely structured. 7/10",

            "review_title": "Benedict Cumberbatch Offers A Brilliant Portrayal Of A Troubled And Tormented Man",
            "content": "Benedict Cumberbatch was absolutely superb in this biopic as Alan Turing. Turing was a bona fide war hero - a status achieved not on the battle field, but at home. A mathematical genius, Turing was part of a team that managed to decrypt the coded messages the Germans sent using their \"Enigma\" machine, primarily through the use of his so-called \"Turing machine\" - which was basically an early, primitive computer. Some have referred to Turing as the father of modern computer science. His hero status aside, however, Turing was a troubled and tormented man. He was socially awkward, isolated, and largely friendless. Although the word is never used in the movie, it seems clear that by modern standards, he was probably autistic. Adding to his torment was the fact that he was also gay in a society that was actively hostile to homosexuals, and in which homosexuality was illegal. I thought Cumberbatch captured the complexities of the man brilliantly.Essentially the movie is presented as a flashback. Turing's homosexuality was discovered several years after the war's end, and the story of his past is told as he's interviewed by a detective. Most of the film is set in Bletchley Park, where the work on Enigma was conducted, and revolves around his troubled relationships with his co-workers on the project, including Joan (played by Keira Knightley) - the one true friend he made, and to whom he was briefly engaged. At times, the flashbacks go back further to his time as a student at a boarding school where he develops the other great friendship of his life - with fellow student Christopher Morcom, who tragically dies of tuberculosis, an event which surely traumatized Turing greatly.The movie follows Turing's life up until its end in 1954 at the tragically young age of 41. The film accepts the official determination that he committed suicide by cyanide poisoning. Having been discovered to be homosexual, he had been given the choice of prison or \"chemical castration\" - basically being forced to take estrogen in order to weaken his libido. The movie shows him being despondent and physically shattered by the treatments, leading to his suicide. That thesis isn't universally accepted, though. Some have pointed out that the hormone treatments had ended a year before his death, and that Turing had made some very definite plans for his future work, and he had been engaged in some experiments that could have led to accidental cyanide poisoning. There is even the inevitable conspiracy theory, suggesting that Turing was murdered by British security forces. However, the official verdict is suicide, and none of the other theories was explored or even mentioned. In the end, the film becomes a critique - and an appropriate one - of the decision of previous generations to criminalize homosexuality, noting the thousands of men who had been convicted under the old laws. Finally, in 2013, Turing was posthumously pardoned, and laws have allowed the pardons of several thousand other men similarly convicted.There are some historical points in the movie with which one can quibble, but to do so misses the point that the movie wasn't really about the history of the events (although they are reasonably if imperfectly portrayed) but was instead about Turing's complex and tragic life. Cumberbatch brought the man to life brilliantly, and the writers managed to give us a fascinating glimpse into his mind. It's not an especially exciting movie, but it is a good study of a man who deserves to be better known than he is, since Turing's work on Enigma was kept secret for many years after the end of the war.

There has been quite a lot of war movies where soldiers fight with weapons to win battles and such. So it's refreshing to see a group of nerds, using there brains to save lives. Now I really enjoy stories where a group of interesting people with special set of skills come together as a team to pursue the same goal. Except this time it's a group of code breakers trying to decyper the Nazis code of communication called Enigma during World War 2. The plot which is based on a true story is very well put together. And that includes Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) past and where he comes from. Now portraying a characters past can sometimes make the movie drag, but in this it actually adds to the movie and helps it lead to a more impactful ending. There is quite a bit of depth to this movie without it going all over the place or it being overly convoluted. Benedict Cumberbatch was just phenomenal playing Alan Turing. Which shows that you don't necessarily have to look like a real life person to make the character believable. Matthew Goode was sharp and sturdy as Hugh Alexander. And Keira Knightley fit her role really well as Joan Clarke and the chemistry between her and Alan really added a sense of humanity to the plot. This sort of reminded me of \"Valkyrie\" which is another film based on a true story about heroic people that did there best to try and stop Hitler and his plans. Except I felt more emotion with this one because of the way it was executed. Overall, this is a film that I would highly recommend to anyone. I say full price.9/10",

            "content": "It is hard to play a role of a famous person. This Oscar season, two biographic films came out. \"The Theory of Everything\" and this \"the Imitation game\". It is natural that people tend to place these two together and make a comparison, and with so many awards given to \"the theory of everything\", though well deserved, one may gets the sense that it may have over shadowed this film which is equally brilliant, and to some extent, even more so. Within 120 minutes,it tackles many issues which still remain contradictory even today. Homosexuality, war and science, morally correct versus logically correct and the feeling of being alone. Everybody gets lonely, from time to time, that's in our nature, which is why human beings are gregarious species. We constantly feel the need of companions, someone who are close to us, who can resonate with our minds. But for a genius like Allen Turing, it is incredibly hard to find a mind which is as equally smart, therefore leads to his endless feeling of loneliness which eventually, became one of the reasons of his death. This world is mean and simply committed to destroy any being that refuses to fall into conformity. People are afraid of being different because the world will attack the divergent. There is a potential within each human being to become something great, but most of them just cut off their way to it because they are afraid of taking the different path. There are at least two qualities which any great man holds: one is talent which surprisingly, almost each one of us has, sometimes it's just been hided or brutally ignored just for the sake of being \"practical\"; and the other is having the courage to stand out, to utter a different voice and to carry on ones own belief no matter what anyone else says. One sentence was repeated spoken about in the film - \"Sometimes, it is the people that nobody imagines anything of who can do the things that nobody can imagine.\" It is the voice of every wandering soul, every lost teenagers who think they don't belong. It sends out a message to everyone who's ever doubted themselves of whether he or she is good enough for the things they want that stay who you are. We are all difference, each one of us, and if each one of us is different, then what is the point of being conformed? Isn't it only natural for everyone so stay unique? A hero is the man who can stay true to himself even when facing a thousand accusing fingers.",

With so many of these period dramas coming and going throughout the years you really have to stand out to be remembered and taken seriously. The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch is one of those films that I feel has a good fighters chance at being one of the remembered ones.The always stellar Cumberbatch stars as Alan Turing, one of history's greatest mathematicians and the man who, in his mission to unlock the key to encrypted German messages being sent between Nazi forces during the war, accidentally created what we know today as the computer. The Imitation Game tells his story which, it turns out, is one of great strife, tragedy, and deserves to be recognized and memorialized forever in our history. If nothing else this film is an incredibly important one, that tells a story that was sadly lost and unrecognized for over 50 years due to controversy surrounding Turing's life, and a dark ages political system that failed to recognize the staggeringly vital impact Turing was imprinting on history.The Imitation Game's greatest contribution is absolutely its immortalizing of such an important historical figure. It highlights one of the most beautiful things about the art form of filmmaking, which is its ability to preserve these key moments in history in an accessibly dramatized way. The Imitation Game is fascinating, gripping, and powerfully motivating, revealing new sides and new perspectives on a war we thought we already knew everything about. In some ways its the great plot twist of one of history's most notable, significant, and discussed periods. If you thought you were an expert on the Second World War, watch The Imitation Game and find out for yourself what other secrets are still yet to be discovered.Obviously this film is a huge success on the side of historical importance, but what makes it even better is that its a success on the side of filmmaking as well. It boasts some great performances, especially from the magnificent Cumberbatch, but also from the slew of fantastic supporting players like Keira Knightly, Matthew Goode, Charles Dance, Mark Strong, and plenty others. It gives us a mostly great script, with only a handful of moments where character motivation feels scripted and forced. It also gives us a compelling structure that starts out slow, but really becomes enthralling once the gap between the story taking place during the war and after the war is bridged and the ultimate purpose of this film starts to glean.I went into this movie with expectations that leaned neither high or low, and was pleasantly surprised by the end. Given its slow pace and non-risk taking atmosphere where subject matter is played close to the chest I thought I would come out of this movie with a satisfied yet unenthused attitude, but by the end and after giving it some thought I found myself so thankful that this movie exists, and only found myself thinking back on it fondly and proudly. It is a solidly compelling film, but moreso, and vitally important one.",

The real shame is that the historically accurate story is very compelling.

Britain's survival during WWII---especially during the bombing of London---was a miraculous feat of will. The film provides a view of an important part of that effort.\n2. Alan Turing is an iconic figure in the history of digital computing; his singular contribution to the war effort is a fascinating story.\n3. Anti-homosexual prejudices, codified in English law, yielded many tragic consequences.Viewers of the film can refer to Wikipedia's entry for the \"Enigma Machine\" if they want to gain a basic understanding of how the film strays from the truth. And trivia entries in IMDb elucidate further.Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing is wonderful to watch. If only it stuck to the facts. The film, as a whole is moving. If it were totally veracious, it would deserve a \"10\". If only it stuck to the facts.Every attempt should be made to inform viewers of actual facts, especially when those facts are altered in a filmic representation of actual people and/or actual events.

He was so... technical in everything he was doing. He was technically good, delivering his lines, his expressions, everything in exactly the way you'd expect, but that was the problem. You could see everything coming, all I saw was an actor acting without making me feel anything and it was really distracting. After the first half hour, though, he became a real character and I grew to care about him, to the point that I really wish the film around him was better. Knightley is fine, if at times a little uneven, but awards nominations for this? Just no way... other actresses could've done a lot more with that role. This is kind of exactly the same as The Theory of Everything, both are among the most forgettable but still decent films up for awards, and neither should be getting anywhere near the mentions and nominations they've been getting.

This film had me enthralled, and by the end in tears and shaking with anger. I weep too much in movies, it's true, but this one cuts straight to the heart. A modern tragedy. A few years ago Alan Turing was honoured at Manchester Pride, and it moves me deeply now to think about it. Too late to help him, even if he hadn't committed suicide. Kudos to the British government for trying at least to undo some of the damage and right a terrible wrong. We need more movies like this. People don't understand. How many millions of human beings have been crushed by ignorance. Such a waste! So much shame, frustration and suffering. Even now many of us still live in dysfunction, especially in the Third World, and don't lead the full lives we were meant to lead.This movie's message and impact are profound. Thank you Morten Tyldum, Andrew Hodges, Graham Moore and Benedict Cumberbatch. I suppose I should point out that this is another movie that could be called a gay tragedy. Yes, there are too many of those. However, this a story begging to be told.I can only leave a short review now, but I'll say more after I've seen the movie again.",

The direction which was made by Morten Tyldum was very good and he presented his main characters very well, something that made us relate to them and follow their story. The interpretations of Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Alan Turing, Keira Knightley who played as Joan Clarke and Matthew Goode who played as Hugh Alexander were very good and they made the difference.

A biographical of a genius man deserves to be told in intelligent manners and that's what The Imitation Game does perfectly. It is highly intriguing film well supported by intelligently written screenplay. The Imitation Game is based on a life of Alan Turing, a mathematician, computer scientist and logician who worked for the British government during world war 2. He invented a machine to decode 'Enigma' which helped British to win the war but he didn't enjoy fame and was sentenced for his homosexuality. From the starting point to the end i couldn't find a single loophole or loo break in the film. Yes, it is that much gripping. What i like the most about it is, it didn't lose the intelligence and subtle elements from the facts. All those scenes when Turing and his team try cracking the code are well written and very well presented. Now here many people have been unhappy for the historical accuracy on how to crack the code or how to build a machine but i am not one of them untill and unless it doesn't look dull on screen. I haven't seen much of Benedict Cumberbatch apart from MCEU series so this one is his best performance i have seen till date. His expression, accent, stammering and attitude yes i liked everything. Knightley, Goode and Kinnear supported him well. Morten Tyldum's direction is a thing to watch out for. In the begining scene he asks us to leave the room if we are not interested to listen to whatever he's gonna say and once we decide to stay we just don't even remember that thing until we finish film. May be this is something i liked the most, i just couldn't move away for moment and couldn't just disagree with anything happened in the film. Such a hold it had. Overall, a Classic that deserves more views.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

Even when Turing is breaking down because of his persecution for his sexuality, even with the excellent acting from Benedict Cumberbatch, I still felt next to no real emotion for the character. You can't just plop down a character, say he's gay, say he's persecuted, and make him cry and expect me to feel for him, no matter how good the acting is. You need to flesh out the character and make the audience connect with him. Same thing goes for the scene where they are forced to let one of the team's brother die. I knew nothing about the character or the fact that he had a brother up to then, and I had no reason to care.I usually don't care to much about a movies accuracy to reality. If it's a good story and an entertaining movie then who cares if it's accurate? But this movie seriously annoyed me for a few reasons. Turing's character is unbelievably exaggerated and it ultimately hurts the movie. He's shown as a genius asshole who doesn't understand how to act human. This does not make him likable in any way and it does not make the story more interesting. The story itself is very inaccurate as well, skipping some parts, overemphasizing some parts, and straight up inventing other parts. The real story many not be as \"audience friendly\" but it is much more interesting. There was no reason to warp the plot so hard.At the end of the day, it has flat unlikeable characters, a meh plot, and creates no emotional investment. I am physically incapable of comprehending the fact that this got nominated for best picture, especially with so many other great movies out this year.",

            "content": "It took me a while to get around to watching this one, especially since our Computing Theory lecturer did encourage us to watch it. Well, I finally decided to do so and I have to admit that it was really annoying, and quite painful, to watch. Sure, there is a tragic aspect to Alan Turing's life, especially considering the fact that he was instrumental in helping shorten the war in Europe, but was still condemned because of the fact that he was a homosexual. However, there were aspects of the film that didn't quite sit well with me, and a little research revealed why - namely Turing wasn't borderline autistic, and he didn't get into conflict with a bulk of the people that he was working with. In fact, Turing apparently had a pretty good relationship with Commander Dennison, something that is completely ignored in the film.A part of me also felt that Turing was treated somewhat unfairly, especially since it wasn't until 2014 that he was pardoned for his crime (posthumously mind you), but I did notice that he did receive an OBE, and that was shortly after the war as well. So, I guess he was commended for his work, though ironically he still doesn't receive the accolades that he deserves, and we have to remind people that the people at Bletchly Park were just as important, if not more important, than the soldiers fighting on the ground, namely because without their work, many, many more would have died.While the film is predominantly about the work that Turing performed during the war, it does jump to other parts of his life, such as his time in school, and his arrest and eventual death, due to the fact that he was a homosexual in a world that basically shunned them. In a way the film is more about Turing than it is about cracking the enigma code, and the title of the film actually refers to the Turing test, namely a test that is used to determine whether a machine has reached intelligence.The interesting thing is that the story of computer science really seems to the a story of mathematicians looking for faster ways of solving mathematical problems, though of course in this instance it is basically cracking codes, and of course to try every single combination will no doubt take years, and the problem was that the code changed every 24 hours (and how the Germans knew what the new code was is sort of beyond me, though I suspect it might have something to do with code books). Mind you, Turing isn't my favourite computer scientists, that honour belongs to Ada Lovelace, though that had a lot to do with her being the first computer programmer long before computers even existed, though her concepts were based on Charles Babbage's conceptual design (which wasn't ever built, due to his untimely death).Yeah, I really wasn't a particularly big fan of this film, only because of the way that Turing was portrayed. In fact, I started questioning it within minutes of the film starting, and of course my research revealed the complete opposite. Sure, movies really don't work all that well without conflict, but portraying Turing as being Autistic when, in reality, he wasn't, just put me off the entire narrative.",

            "content": "The recipient of 8 Academy Award nominations at this year's ceremony and the winner of the Best Adapted Screenplay category, Norway born director Morten Tyldum, who finds himself about as far away from his breakout thriller Headhunters as you could imagine, tells the true life story of mathematical genius and one of World War 2's key players Alan Turing in an assured manner that is however, to by the numbers to breakout into classic territory.With a typically strong and charismatic performance from everyone's favourite Sherlock Benedict Cumberbatch and with a real life story that is almost stranger than fiction, The Imitation Game is a film that is eminently watchable from its first frame to the last but once all is said and done there is worryingly little to bring your mind back to what you've just seen, which with a story like this shouldn't be the case.Tyldum directs in a visually impressive manner but with little true originality and even though his surrounded himself with ever wonderful composer Alexandre Desplat and solid D.O.P Oscar Faura, he can't make the Imitation Game break the shackles that tie it to the unshakeable feeling that this is a glorified TV movie, not a standout big production event. Tyldum and screenwriter Graham Moore try to shun these TV like qualities with a narrative that flashes forward and flashes back and never allows things to get to stagnant but it's not enough to elevate the film completely, with Cumberbatch coming to the rescue in this matter.In an ensemble that never gets to really shine, wasted Matthew Goode and I don't know how Oscar nominated Keira Knightly try their hardest but don't make much of an impression, Cumberbatch shines in one of his first truly lead big screen roles. His Turing is not likable in the normal sense but the man was far from normal himself. Cumberbatch plays the line between neurosis and humanity perfectly and it's a deservedly lauded turn by him.It would've been nice to get more of a feel for the greater ramifications of what Turing's invention meant to the overall picture of World War 2 and while Turing is an intriguing figure, the Imitation Game could've benefited from a more rounded supporting cast, but the Imitation Game never outstays its welcome and is a sufficiently produced snapshot of one of the Wars most important events and also one of the most important technological advancements of the last 100 years.3 and a half apple treats out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "An entertaining narrative and amazing performances by actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, combined with fleshed out characters and old-fashioned epic styled cinematography, cover up minor moments of typical biopic cheesiness, making this movie highly worthwhile.I must confess that I knew very little about Alan Turing before going into this film. An incredibly fleeting preview look at who he was showed him to be a highly influential figure in the British victory in World War II, and as somebody later in life prosecuted for the then-crime of homosexual acts. Although Turing himself seemed like an interesting man to read about, I was initially slightly hesitant. Biography pictures have never been my cup of tea, and even the presence of talented actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightly and Mark Strong were not enough to convince me of this film's potential quality. In the end what convinced me to see it was the mix of a good trailer, solid early reviews on the movie's quality, and the fact that the director Morten Tyldum's last movie was the very exciting, and very good, \"Headhunters\", which showed a lot of potential in him as a director. The movie does a lot well straight off the bat. It's a highly entertaining film which moves at a fast pace, as it focuses mainly on Turing and his team of code-breakers as they try to break Enigma, the Nazi military code machine. Along with the main plot the story cuts back to Turing's childhood, when he was an outcast who was picked on at school before a boy named Christopher befriended him and introduced him to the codes which would play such a large role in his life. Also featured is Turing after the war, where police are investigating a break in at his house, which ultimately leads to him being targeted as a potential homosexual. By changing the time-frames that the story is being told in, and slightly messing with chronological order, the story is made infinitely more interesting, and we get to learn far more about the man Alan Turing. Unlike failed biographical films, this movie has characters that feel genuine, and don't just feel like actors saying famous lines that the person was famous for saying. Of course, there are scenes where that does happen, but for the most part it is not a problem. The direction is top-notch throughout this whole work, and Tyldum gives the film the look of an old-school spy thriller, giving each shot an air of importance and, along with the work of the script by Graham Moore (and adapted from the book by Andrew Hodges), keeps what could be a slow and plodding story moving at a brisk pace. Although the movie gets a lot right, it does have some moments that bring it down from a potentially great movie, and keep it at just being very good. For most of the movie, the soundtrack is superb, and atmosphere building, however on some occasions it is overbearing and creates some cheesy moments. In general, melodrama proves to be the film's main problem, with a few cringe-worthy scenes that are quite typically found in the biopic genre. In these scenes, characters act far more earnestly then they most likely would in real life so as to build the tension of dramatic moments. That being said, this dramatic flair is also what makes the movie interesting, so I suppose moments like this are easily forgiven. Another small problem I had with the film is that some historical moments just feel like they were added for the sake of it, almost like they had a check-list of things to cross-off that had to be in the film so as not to bother history buffs. In a movie that already flirts dangerously with what is fact and what is fiction, some of these definitely don't feel necessary. Overall, despite some flaws, the movie works as it is incredibly entertaining with a clever narrative that shows the effect that Alan Turing had on the war. From what I hear the facts are exaggerated, but that feels understandable, and the movie still results in a smartly directed and worthwhile movie that has potential to be a genuine crowd-pleaser, in the old-fashioned meaning of the word. The lame and more clich\u00e9 moments in the script perhaps keep the movie from being great, and the no-risk approach to maintaining the likability of Turing perhaps is why it just misses out on taking the movie to the next level. That in mind, I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a movie to go and see in cinemas. Cumberbatch and Knightley are brilliant, and I will definitely be eager to see Tyldum's next feature film. Score: 7/10",

Far from a traditional biopic, the film transitions between Turing's childhood, his World War II days and the 1950s in which he was investigated on charges of homosexuality (a crime in the UK at the time). Some of the transitions are a little jarring, but in general, the film flows well, giving quite an insight into the way Turing's arguably autistic mind worked. One of the best elements of the film is how Turing's code cracking days help the socially awkward man learn how to function in the world, discovering that if he is nice to others, they will want to assist him and so forth. There is something quite sad to his tale; not just because he was persecuted for being gay and never recognised as a war hero, but because his social awkwardness was never properly treated. This is, however, ultimately an inspiring and uplifting tale, with Cumberbatch's boyish excitement when he realises that he has finally figured how to crack the code coming off just as intense as his sadder moments. Alexandre Desplat's score with sounds similar to computer dings is a nice touch too, and while the script may take some historical liberties, it nevertheless provides a fascinating look at the success of a social misfit and the society that refused to accept him.",

Turing is in love with a woman even though he's a homosexual (yeah...what?). In the trailer you see a tank run over a helmet and the helmet isn't crushed, but is moved by an obvious spring mechanism...the rest of the effects weren't much better than this example. I think the movie has received so many good reviews because the British are comparing this British movie to their other British quality movies. If you're an American, beware that this movie would receive about 4 out of 10 stars here. Oh, and the thing that bothered me the most was that true geniuses are not socially inept morons. This movie still plays on the stereotype that geniuses appear to be social morons, which just isn't true. And if you look up the bio for Turing you'll find that people thought of him as \"unconceited,\" yet this movie portrays him as a completely conceited moron. Turing would probably be very disappointed in the way he was portrayed.

Movies can be trite, eager to make money, and annoyingly fantastical, but films like The Imitation Game prove why movies are such an influential art form to begin with. With enough power and enough spark, they can transcend the mistakes of our past and bring much deserved celebration towards groundbreakers who were misunderstood during their prime.In this film's case, the misunderstood groundbreaker is Alan Turing, the cryptanalyst who cracked Germany's Enigma cipher during WWII. Portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch with supreme idiosyncrasy, Turing is the kind of genius that, well, all geniuses are: socially awkward, quick-witted, and more willing to finish an experiment than solve a personal conflict. We first meet him in 1952, following a burglary that took place in his home; but instead of arresting the prime suspect, authorities direct their attention towards Turing. The thief, as it turns out, was not at Turing's home just to partake in robbery; he was also there to perform a sexual act on the homosexual war hero. The Imitation Game then spends the rest of its duration traveling back and forth between three periods in Turing's life: his despair in 1952, his sexual awakening in 1928, and his solving of the Enigma Code during the '40s. Exploring his relationship with a classmate during his teenage years and his unconventional friendship with one of his colleagues, the plucky Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), the film not only brands him as an unlikely hero but also as a man who was never quite understood and had to pay for it. Instead of being glorified for his war efforts, Turing was effectively blacklisted for his homosexuality, eventually committing suicide not long after his prosecution.The film is largely unadventurous with its cinematic instincts, preferring to use a warm string score to outline its emotions and eye- catching costumes to capture the deceiving comeliness of the time period. But in a film like The Imitation Game, technicalities don't matter; what matters is how it grabs you as a human being. And as a human being, I was moved. Cumberbatch's performance is never less than stellar, and Knightley is, as usual, a lightning strike of unbridled energy. Tyldum's handling of it all is by turns handsome and bleak, never clashing but never overwhelming. There are moments of humor and there are moments of devastating adversity, but yet again, so is life. Turing had a brutally unfair one, and the film doesn't throw rose-colored glasses onto its outlook.Somehow, The Imitation Game feels too short, but that could only be because Turing's time on Earth was much too brief itself. It's strange how one of the most rousing, dramatic movies of 2014 is simultaneously so somber and maddening. So many of the hardships Turing faced never would have occurred if WWII took place during the 2010s instead of the 1940s; maybe that's why his legacy and the film are so hard to shake off.

The glowing reviews must have been posted by relatives and close friends of the actors because there is no way this rates 8.1. Add to that, the editing is sloppy, with quick breaks to flashbacks and even quicker breaks returning to the central story. All this with a lack of continuity of the four segments, present 1951, childhood at school, prewar, wartime, then no resolution to any of these parts. Then as to the ending - was there a reason for the assumed reconciliation? Benedict must be replaying Sherlock in this role, using the same facial expressions and quizzical looks. I watched intently to the bitter end and wondered why had I done so?",

And not to forget it is emotional at times which makes the movie even more likable. The real-life lessons: One lesson that can be identified and is quite important is that you need friends to achieve what you want to. You need other helps, team work not matter how smart you are. Alan Turing only really had a chance to build the machine and crack the code when he received the support and help of his colleagues. It pays off to be nice. Secondly, being sociable and talking to people is crucial even for the workplace work. Alan Turing only got the idea of how to solve the code during a random conversation with a stranger that he met a bar that he otherwise wouldn't be in if it wasn't for him having made friends.",

It is the story of how an English mathematician was instrumental in shortening WW2 and also inventing our modern day computers. Benedict plays Alan Turing, the brilliant but quirky genius that was enlisted with a few others to crack the German's enigma code. The Germans used what they called the enigma machine-about the size of a typewriter-to communicate their battle plans with each other and the codes were changed every day at midnight. So if the code was not broken by midnight, they would have to start all over the next day. The enigma code had about 159 trillion-that is 159 followed by 18 zeros-different possible combinations and with the time limit, it was pretty well impossible to do. That is, until Benedict decided that he needed a machine to calculate the different possibilities at light speed, and bam, the computer is born-a lot bigger than what you could hold in your hand but it worked. Keira and Matthew were other members on the crack team of code breakers and Mark is the head of the British Secret Service organization called MI6. Alan Turing was not a very likable person; he was brilliant, which made him egotistical but he did not understand how to interact with people-for instance, he did not understand the basics of a joke. He was also a closeted homosexual, which was a big taboo at that time-1950's-in England. In fact, homosexuals were arrested for gross indecency.The movie also jumps back and forth through 3 different time periods, the 1930's, the 1940's and the 1950's, covering his earlier childhood-1930's-the war years-1940's-and his later days-1950's. It's rated \"PG-13\" for sexual references and smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. I thought it was an interesting story and I would buy it on DVD.",

            "content": "I have deeply conflicted feelings about this film. It is one of the least stuffy, stagey biopics I have seen. The screenplay very cleverly splits Turing's life into 3 sections and inter-splice them to give a general impression of the Turing's state of being. Unlike most biopics it does not feel like a encyclopedia entry of first guy did x, then guy did y. ETc. It feels like a story.Best of all the film uses something like a Turing test as the central image of the film. (spoilers?) Turing was arrested for gross indecency because he was gay and the film builds the flashback structures around a (fictional) account of him being interviewed by a cop. It is only at the last moment the confession is presented as Turing asking the cop to judge his humanity based on what he says. (This notion of the ethical implications of a machine passing the Turing test is not at the forefront of Turing's idea but an obvious consequence of them). It is striking how this structure demonstrates Turing's idea.The film's technical aspects are wonderful. I especially like Cumberbatch's performance. And Knightly gives a very good performance as well. The directions finds a nice balance between being thrillerish and drama.But for all that it really, really bothers me that Turing's work on cracking Enigma is presented as almost a single handed achievement. The work by the Polish intelligence service and Polish mathematicians is completely ignored. (This is not trivial, through statistical analysis they were able to decode about 60% of messages). The movie makes it seem like only one decoding machine was built, and by Turing himself. In fact over 200 machines were built and a whole slew of engineers were involved. Etc. The film even got the order of cribs (i.e. working from known words to crack the code) wrong. The Victory (aka Christopher) machine was built starting from a crib and it wasn't an idea that occurred to Turing at the least second. This really beefed up the social isolation of Turing to a degree that was unwarranted.Likewise, the film does not shy away from Turing's gayness as a fact. And more importantly it does not whitewash his suicide. To the film's credit it presents the societal oppression quite correctly. But Turing is weirdly de-sexed. His gayness is presented as an academic aspect of his life. There is no scene that shows him being intimate with another guy. The love story in his youth is weirdly chase.In the end I think I really like this movie but I don't know. I guess 10 today will work.",

Truly inspiring film that speaks for the different and the determined.Benedict Cumberpatch is absolutely perfect for this role. He plays is perfectly as an awkward fellow who's different personality doesn't stop him from achieving greatness. He acts it so well so we always feel what he's feeling, and the phenomenal writing makes him even more likable. Keira Knightly is charming, supportive, and sympathetic toward Alan's different personality, and becomes his only glimmer of light in his life. The film does a good job on staying focused, not touching too much on homosexual themes, except when necessary. It's so well written, every line of dialog sounds poetic. From the science behind the enigma to the thought process of the human brain, this film has got its facts down.The music is also to be addressed. Very well composed score that intensifies each scene, and never overstays its welcome. By the end, the message is clear without hammering it in, and it's very informal.

The same goes for Keira Knightly, she is a a very talented actress, anyone who has seen her movies knows that for damn sure. The sets, the costume design, and how everything is constructed makes for a near perfect representation of WWII times in Britain. The script is also very well written and it showcases both the historical events that occurred and the backgrounds and personal horror the individual people go through. The main one I'm of course talking about is Cumberbatch's character Alan Turing. Turing endured many many down right atrocities and horrific treatment in his lifetime. He was gay and had to keep it a secret since it was illegal and you'd get in very big trouble if you were found out to be LGBTQ. They made him undergo cruel physical treatment to \"change\" him, which is extremely sad and tragic to see.

They both tell astonishing tales of genius scientists, their monumental achievements and equally monumental hardships. They both feature excellent lead actors who give career-defining, Oscar-worthy performances. However, in almost every aspect, \"The Imitation Game\" is just slightly better. Cumberbatch completely disappears into the role of Alan Turing, a genius mathematician who shortened World War II by two years by cracking the Germans' Enigma code along with a team of scientists. It would have been easy, and clich\u00e9, to spend a large amount of time on Turing's struggle with homosexuality, for which he was convicted in the early 1950s. But one of the biggest virtues of \"The Imitation Game\" is that it portrays Turing's attitude to his sexuality exactly as it was: he never struggled with it, he simply accepted it for what it was. He was wholly devoted to his cause, and anything which stood in his way he would remove, to the point of marrying his team's only female member despite his homosexuality, because her parents would otherwise have ordered her to return to them.Because the movie is a biopic, it is inherently flawed. The reasons for this are that biopics tend to focus so much on the acting and the story that they neglect such things as soundtrack, cinematography, and script. These things are usually rushed and therefore imperfect. However, as biopics go, this is a good one.8/10",

While there are many outstanding people that took his work to create the computer, tablets and phones we use today, he started with the blank sheet of paper knowing \"a smart machine\" could be possible. His name needs to be included in our conversations about technology.If you are an Apple geek, you may already know the (rumored) connection between Turning / Apple's logo / Steve Jobs. Just google \"Steve Jobs Alan Turning\" and you'll see the pages upon pages of articles over the years suggesting that Apple's 'bitten apple' logo was honoring the death of Alan Turning. Jobs said \"God we wish it was\" in response. A CNN article from 2011 (http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/06/opinion/apple-logo/) goes through some of the rumors and reactions from what Jobs called an urban legend. No one but Steve (and Woz perhaps?) really know.I'd like to believe Jobs & Turning are smiling down on all of us as we silence our iPhones to learn about this great strategy of WWII history through the eyes of The Imitation Game. If you enjoy your computer, your smart phone, your tablet \u2014 do yourself a favor and learn more about the man who set the foundation for these life-changing machines \u0085 and a significant contributor to ending a World War.

            "content": "Okay, let's get this out of the way up front. A lot of people seem to be harping on the fact that the film contains historical inaccuracies. Of course it does, it's a movie. When was the last time a movie that was based on a true story or event was completely accurate? Never, that's when. Now that that's behind us, we can focus on the good aspects of the movie - so, everything aside from the inaccuracies that people can't seem to look past. Benedict Cumberbatch proves once again his ability to truly become the character he is playing. His performance is splendid, right down to stutters and other little mannerisms of the character. The supporting cast is incredible as well. The cinematography is enthralling. They capture the time period very well. Some of the war footage looks a little hokey, but the way they wove it into the narrative truly made me empathize with people who experienced this firsthand.It is truly a joy to get to know each character. It is charming to watch the crew of code breakers and linguists go from being unable to relate to Alan (Cumberbatch) to forming strong bonds as they come to understand Alan's offbeat nature. It is so endearing to watch Joan (Knightly) and Alan develop their uncharacteristic relationship and affection for one another. This story is definitely character driven, and by the end of the movie I felt privileged to have witnessed the lives of these characters unfolding.Here comes the spoiler: Alan Turing was a homosexual, which was illegal in Britain at the time. This aspect of the story is what touched me the most, honestly. I felt such deep compassion for Alan and the struggles he experienced because of his sexual orientation. I won't give away any more, but to say he was treated unjustly and horrifically is the understatement of the century. I saw this movie in theaters three times, and I cried every time. The treatment of gay people throughout history, as well as in the present, is unacceptable and it truly broke my heart to watch this part of the story play out.This movie just pulls on the heartstrings in every way. It keeps you on your toes. The pacing is perfect. I was never bored nor did I ever feel rushed or lost. There were no loose ends. I loved this movie and will absolutely be purchasing it on DVD when it comes out. I highly recommend that everyone at least give this movie a chance. This is one of the best movies I've seen in quite some time.",

It is a chapter of WWII of which I was unaware. The German code breakers and their brilliant analysis of what was prudent to strike and what was not was simply amazing.It shows one why fascism political, religious or otherwise cannot be allowed to win the day. In WWII the time in which the film takes place, western civilization and true democracy hung by a thread.The British code breaker mathematical genius Alan Turing saved our proverbial necks from fascism's tyranny! Suggested reading: \"It Can Happen Here\" by Sinclair Lewis. Alan Turning got a raw deal and his maltreatment was in no small part because of who he was -- gay at a time when not only was it criminal but your body could be medically attacked for it. Thank you Alan Turning for showing us why our treatment of gays had to change and thank you for doing nothing more than saving western civilization! We owe you a huge apology.It CAN happen here and we have the extremists to prove it.",

Alan Turing is now a loner and independent nobody who must work against the odds,NAZI's and allies to solve the unbreakable Enigma code that posed a threat to the Allies. A drift from true WW2 events surrounding the characters particularly Turing himself adds to the story and making it feel more \"up against the odds\" but some of the changes were unnecessary some which were a little cheesy to be honest but had a minimal affect on the film.The Imitation Game is paced incredibly well and shows a good portion of his homosexual lifestyle and his fight to keep it his secret so that he may be accepted as part of a homophobic society where punishment could include chemical castration.The opening sequence one of my personal favourites since The Shawshank Redemption sets up a thrilling WW2 masterpiece but this is more than just a war flick its a story of family, hope, struggle, struggle and acceptance that will ensure tearing up to many.Ratng: A+ Comment: A masterpiece for the ages.

            "content": "\"The Imitation Game\" is based on the true story of a mathematician and genius, Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch). This story catches your attention from the very start, in intriguing circumstances we meet Turing. We are led to the past to the start of the war, Turing is brought before Commander Dennison (Charles Dance) for an interview for a secret group of intelligence. Intelligence being the most important thing, they are to solve Enigma; the Germans unique encryption device with 159 million million possibilities of settings that changes daily. Throughout this superb thriller we see the struggle against the clock, one day to crack it before it resets all while people die at the hands of the enemy. This movie is gripping and will have your attention from the off. There is a reason why Benedict Cumberbatch is constantly on demand and is one of the best actors in Britain and perhaps the business. He is brilliant, he captures Turing so magnificently. Turing intelligence and social dispositions as well as his calculating and cold character. Benedict is very good, but one actor alone does not make a good movie, his role is well supported by Keira Knightly, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong and Allen Leech (Downton Abbey), who all put in great performances to compliment and emphasise the main messages in this movie.For me this movie heavily shows people breaking the moulds to which they are supposedly bound and we see a true insight into the social workings of mid 20th century Britain, and in particular Alan Turing who was in fact a homosexual. This movie leads to an emotional end but with lessons for us all. The Imitation Game is a great movie and if you like movies to think about, then this is one for you.Check out my other reviews here -http://russellviews.blogspot.co.uk",

            "review_title": "An entertainment, a history lesson, and a lesson in moral contradictions",
            "content": "Professor Alan Turing is the man who broke the supposedly unbreakable Nazi encryption Enigma. He started very awkwardly at an MI6 sanctioned team based in Manchester. As his fellows uses various methods to decipher Enigma, Alan instead designs a machine to do that. When his team leader denies his request for his machine's spare parts, Alan wrote to Churchill himself, who then makes him the new team leader. Alan fires disagreeing members and re-recruits through selecting with a crosswords puzzle. They get Joan Clarke through this. In and out the movie also shows Alan's school days, a time when he only has one friend Christopher, gets bullied by others and his anti-social manners starts to grow in him. Alan and the former team leader Hugh fights due to Alan not helping the rest of the team in decipher work while he only tinkers with his machine. Joan helps him to reconnect with them, who then defend Alan when the MI6 is firing him due to his completed machine is not working as fast as it should. When Joan states she's returning home due to traditional culture reasons of having to marry at twenty five but not having any candidate yet, Alan proposes to her as the most logical thing to do.One night, the team go to the pub for drinks with Joan and her friend Helen. The anti-social Alan gets confused when Alan and Helen flirts at each other. But a hint from Helen's intuition of partially breaking the cipher sends the team and Joan rushing back to the base. Alan finds that there are repeated words that makes the cipher predictable thus the machine doesn't have check on all possible setting. With that they manage to break the Enigma. But immediately after, the team has to fight against moral values to let a convoy be attacked less the Nazis will find out that Enigma has been broken and they'll change the cipher design. Alan and Joan goes to see MI6 head Menzies to arrange cover ups so the Germans don't get suspicious about the broken enigma. Alan finds out one of his teammates John is actually the double agent their commander has been suspicious of. But Peter threatens to open Alan's own secret of being gay. The suspicious Menzies forces on Alan by threatening to convict Joan as the spy. Alan reveals John is the spy but Menzies says he already knows that and insists Alan to decide what to leak and what not to leak to John. Alan opens up to Joan about his being gay and Joan says she can accept that. The war is then won and Menzies tells the team to keep it a secret. In 1953 Alan Turing is sentenced to a hormonal therapy and killed himself a year later.The story is a great one due to being a depiction of many moral contradictions on varied fields. We see conservative traditions hinder so many things, including the efforts to win the greatest war ever fought to date. Things such as binding women to social values as to marry at most on her twenty fifth age, A gay is legally punished just for being gay, and that someone is doubted due to being anti-social are just some of those things. It's good that eventually persistence and a little bit luck, as in chance meets preparation, helps a great deal to overcome those things and win the war.Its's quite the shame since the person gets to be humiliated by punishment and considered fair whereas his achievements of saving many lives is kept silent for the past fifty years or so. It's nice to see that characters like Hugh Alexander and Joan Clarke exists in the real world. They embody the good things about tolerance and willingness to work together and adapt, instead of dismissing people based on their obvious flaw but neglecting their other potentials.Back to this movie, the drama is nicely set around the aforementioned base conflicts. The characters built strong in their own share of significance. But even the least significant character, like Peter who only has a big impact on that one convoy thing, is designed nicely to make the story's drama strong. The movie centers itself mostly on Turing, having the other characters appear in and out and even putting Turing's character as the narrator. But the screenplay nicely share the liveness of the scenes at all the other characters every time they are involved.The acting feels very nice in overall. I really like how Benedict Cumberbatch does all those confident stutters and manages to reduce a little bit of his deep voice to reach the level of perceived insecurity of Turing. Kiera Knightley also acted nice in recreating the more authentic feel of the woman of that particular era in England, and at the same time still looking smart and confident. Matthew Goode and Mark Strong also give their characters great work that they have nice impacts to the movie.My say for this The Imitation Game (2014) is that it deserves a score of 7 out of 10 and a recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. Besides being a great lesson in history and a nice entertainment, this movie also serves us a great lesson in those moral values contradictions that hinder progress.",

            "content": "Expectations were high. From the first trailer to the end credits it was obvious that a perfect movie was made. From the opening sequence to the final scene Cumberbatch gave a breathtaking performance and British cinematography yet again showed us how grand it can be. This movie will surely be nominated for more than one Academy Award, and the front man will be Benedict. His performance was as staggering as it has never been. Although, those who have seen Sherlock might notice a pattern in the act but lets face it, both characters are quite alike. His performance was so powerful it leaves the audience breathless. Though more powerful was his transformation from the first sequence where he is so stuck up and intolerable to the final scenes where the audience weeps and hates the system and the laws that have been enforced at the time. His vocal change/range from the powerful Smaug in the Hobbit movies to the high pitched voice of Turing shows that his abilities of transforming himself into a character are as high as Day-Lewis'. With this role he shows that he truly is the best actor at this moment in Hollywood. Keira Knightley gave a high valued performance. The British in her was shown so perfectly, she hid nothing of her personality and positive energy. The idea of contrasting her as a charming and joyful person to Benedict who acted an autistic Sheldon-Cooper-like persona was a really good idea. It is nice to see her in roles that move away form her usual roles. Still, Mark Strong was a nice surprise. His small but effective role lingered on in my brain even after the movie ended was a great surprise. His George-Smiley-like persona gave a whole new dimension to the movie and his power that dripped form the screen gave the third part of the movie a layer of spy thriller movies. The one that was shoved out the movie far before it was needed was Dance. His classic British style and posture was as brilliant as the above mentioned. Still, he was a bit underused in the movie, but the switch between him and Strong are wisely done and it shifts the movies pace and composure. The direction reminded of the one in \"Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy.\" The movie runs in three different time tables, Turing's childhood, the Enigma breaking, the aftermath. A less skillful director would have screwed up, but the change from one time to the other was a bit difficult in the beginning but it was more than smoothly done after about 20 min into the movie. The runtime was perfectly timed, everything was said that needed to be said and a powerful message was sent. This movie is the first of many to be in the Academy Award winners. I fear that other movies could outrun this one just because of how they were shot or made or because of the subjects they deal with, but I still have a little faith in the Academy to make a good choice. I find nothing more important that a historic lesson about how the war was won, and how the same country that he saved condemned the ones who won it. Fingers crossed.",

I hadn't realized he'd been so abhorrently treated by a backwards society. I am perhaps more saddened due to the shame I feel because I too thought gay = bad as an ignorant youngster.

Another great addition to the cast are Charles dance aka Tywin Lannister from game of thrones; one of the few television dramatic series ever made that is worth watching. icing on the cake was that moment when Mathew Goode graced the screen. the first time I've seen him in since he portrayed Adrien Veight in the best movie of all time \"watchmen\".the main story is the nerds at study but there are some bitching ww2 war scenes thrown in so we don't doze. I was hoping for no annoying romantic interest to ruin the movie then in walks Keira Knightly, shes hotter than a microwave so we let her stay. the scenes with Tywin and Kahn are the best they really play off each other well. mark strong was great too. the code breaking theme, the cold war music and the drab 40s clothing really remind me of \"a beautiful mind\" but in a good way.maybe not a film you will watch over and over but its cute and worth a go.good game",

            "content": "Benedict Cumberbatch has made his niche as that actor that you like, yet never quite warm up to. There's a standoffish quality about his screen presence that pushes you away and, although you're not turned off, you watch him with great curiosity. For a good while during The Imitation Game, I watched him doing the same thing he's done in almost every other role he's played \u2013 being arrogant and standoffish while his brilliant mind clicks and turns at a rate of speed that is almost completely foreign to those around him. We saw it in Star Trek; we saw it in his role as Julian Asage; we saw it as Smaug; and, of course, we saw it as Sherlock. Yet, in The Imitation Game something else peers through that distant exterior \u2013 a measure of admiration and pity. It's the same role, to be sure, but in playing Alan Turing, the genius mind who cracked the Nazi's enigma machine and then was crucified by his own government because of his sexual orientation, he earns our sympathy without ever really asking for it.As The Imitation Game opens, we meet Turing in 1951, after being arrested for sexual misconduct. A sympathetic police officer wants to hear his story, and from there he tells him a tale that he was sworn to take to his grave. Early in the war he was offered a position with a group of other brilliant minds to help crack the Nazi's best kept secret. They've been communicating precise plans that, if deciphered, could bring Hitler's dream of a thousand year Reich to a premature end. This Enima machine, to the 21st century mind, is really quite simple \u2013 Hitler and his Nazi regime have created a crude early form of e-mail. Yet, it is written in code, and Winston Churchill has gathered the best minds in the country for a sort-of Manhattan Project tasked with cracking codes rather than building the bomb.Turing's gift for mathematics and codes are essential to the project. His genius is in coming up with a machine that could break the code rather than have a room full of eggheads pouring over code books day and night. He saw the problem in ways that others did not, but that doesn't mean he was a joy to work with. Turing is not a lovable man. He has been fitted by nature with a genius mind, yet has a social anxiety so severe that when he is hired to work with a team he suggests that they all be fired because he can work faster without them. He's difficult, arrogant, stand-offish, self-satisfied and kind of jerk. In that way he's sort of a cross between John Forbes Nash and Sheldon Cooper, a man satisfied with his own abilities who dismisses those beneath him. Yet, underneath his rough exterior nurses the fragments of a broken heart.Turing was a homosexual at a time when such a thing was illegal in England and carried severe consequences (when prosecuted he chose chemical castration as an alternative to two years in prison). The film is told in flashback as we meet Turing after the war, arrested and questioned about a dalliance with a male prostitute. He tells his story at the risk of his own future beginning when he was a boy who fell in love with a classmate named Christopher. It was a union that ended in tragedy, yet Turing held it in his heart forever after \u2013 even giving his former love's name to his machine. Although I didn't immediately catch on, what Turing created was the crude beginnings of computer technology.The Imitation Game is a tricky story to tell. Director Morten Tyldum has to juggle both the Enigma story and Turing own personal story as well. He meshes the two beautifully into a story that ends in both triumph and tragedy. Cumberbatch gains our sympathy but he never loses sight of Turing's personal shortcomings. He's a difficult man, but in the end you come around to appreciating his minor breaks in opening up his personality. That comes mainly through his association with the group's sole female contributor, Jane Cooke (Keira Knightly) who had an gift for code-breaking that rivaled Turing's, but was sidelined because of her gender. It is with Cooke, that Turing's rough exterior begins to break.The Imitation Game is one of those miracle films that could have gone wrong in a dozen different ways. Yet with good writing, and a brilliantly layered performance by Benedict Cumberbatch who gives the year's best performance, the movie finds its heart as well as its historical urgency. This is one of the best films of the year.",

Reading the reviews on IMDb turned me even more off and some movies I may consider seeing are still not in the theaters where I live. But I felt like going to the movies again so I decided to give the Imitation Game a try, mainly because I grew up in an environment of scientists. My father was about the age of the mathematicians in this movie and he worked during and after WWII in an institute of research in Europe for the defense department. Everything the physicists, engineers and mathematicians did was top secret and only many years later did I learn what they were working on, so the movie was familiar to me in many ways.. Movie scripts which are based on true stories and then decide to change the facts in order to appeal to their more simple minded viewers, have never been my favorites. I could not get myself to go and see the movie the Theory of Everything about Stephen Hawking because I read that it is mainly a relationship story and I was more interested in his work. And I am a woman and not a scientist. I felt a little bit the same in this movie because too much emphasis was put on the fact that Turing was gay. Of course I thought it was very important to point out that at that time in history homosexuals were prosecuted no matter where they lived. So there is no need to feel superior there over the Nazis. Afterwards I read that the only female mathematician in the film was wrongly represented because she was obviously already working as a mathematician at Bletchley Park before Turing even got there, which was quite rare at that time and should not have been muddied by acting like she was just some girl doing cross words.. I sometimes watch the TV series the Big Bang Theory and am amused about their portrayal of scientists. Well, that is supposed to be a comedy and while they got some traits of scientists right, they are over exaggerating like crazy by portraying them all as bumbling idiots when it comes to social graces. In the many years I have known scientists in the circle of friends of my parents, I have met no bumbling idiots. Most of them were extremely sophisticated and well informed people, who were able to hold their own in any social setting. I just cannot imagine any of them having temper tantrums like was shown in the Imitation Game . It looked to me like a continuation of the school years,which i also found exaggerated and I would have been happy without the whole school segment. I cannot remember any bullying at school when I grew up , it looks to me that this is a more modern thingI also cannot imagine that a bunch of scientists can make any military decisions like it was implied in this movie. When they showed the scene where supposedly the brother of one of the scientists was on a convoy which was going to be bombed in twenty minutes, and they were debating if they should save his life, they lost me. They also lost me when they never showed any male love interest of Turing. If there was so much emphasis put on the fact that he was a homosexual why not show him having a homosexual affair? I can understand that homosexuals at that time would enter pretend marriages, but after what I read now about Turing he had homosexual affairs quite openly.. As I learned after watching the movie it was also not true that they were the only ones to break the code. Iam getting so tired of this endless portrayal of the Germans as Uebermenschen, though of course it was amazing how such a small country could win so many battles in WWII. Compare that to the huge military force of the US losing one war after the other, it is quite impressive. I am not saying that it was a bad film, but I did not find it so spellbinding and fascinating as many other reviewers did. I would have preferred if they would have concentrated more on the process of finding the solution and the excitement of making new discoveries in science. We need more scientists and I do not think that portraying them as social outcasts helps. The most fascinating thing I read browsing through the other reviews was that Steve Job used the bitten apple symbol because of the cyanide laced apple Turing used for suicide. If that is true, that would be quite something.",

I didn't find any liberties to details to be offensive. I think the story was more about the injustice in the treatment of a gay man that helped end the war more than who or what got the ball rolling on inventing the code breaking machine.

The direction was spot on in telling this story, capturing the gravity of the situation and the highlighting the incredible feat of Turing and his fellow codebreakers. I was so fully involved and engrossed. It's a hard line to tread to create both a thrilling spy tale and an emotional biopic, but this film nailed that balance.What also really highlighted the emotion and drama of this film was the non-linear story telling, which was perfect. I wasn't convinced at first but it really grew on me, and was a fantastic contribution to the story telling.Benedict Cumberbatch's performance was exceptional. He managed to portray such a complex character in a deep and thoughtful way, and I couldn't have wished for a better actor to play the part. The whole cast were exquisite in fact. Kiera Knightley opposite Cumberbatch was fantastic, and Charles Dance and Mark Strong had very solid performances in more minor roles.What I also loved about the Imitation Game was how well they recreated the period. From the costumes, to the hairstyles, to the score, the film just felt right and it all fitted together perfectly.I was also left floored by the emotion of this film. The story of Turing and his treatment after the war because of his sexuality is heartbreaking, and was captured so powerfully.Do not hesitate to watch this film. It is powerful, gripping and thrilling. A must watch!",

This man went through his life of being scared he was going to be persecuted and chemically castrated. The film has a very good pace and Cumberbatch is so mesmerizing, his emotional power works, making this film more effective. The story is so powerful, heartbreaking and moving along with the Oscar nominated script for adapted screenplay. Very deserving of the nominations it has gotten because of how impactive it is to a person and everyone can understand the complex, but incredible story of Alan Turing.",

In the trailer it makes it appear that this a romance movie between him and her, but it wasn't, essentially he was a horrible person to her. And this won an oscar for best writing? How can it depict him as a horrible human being for hurting her so much with no remorse whatsover and then it wins an Oscar? It only received an Oscar because of the homosexual agenda, had it not had anything about homosexuality it would not have won an Oscar I guarantee it. HORRIBLE MOVIE - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME",

            "content": "THE IMITATION GAME tells the story of how Alan Turing helped to break the Nazi Enigma code during WWII, turning the tide in favor of the Allies. It also provides some insight into his troubled personal life. I suppose the biggest theme in the film is that of secrets, be they government/military or personal. While I thought that the parallels drawn between Turing's work and life were a bit broad and obvious, it still made for a compelling story, and certainly one that needed to be told. Far and away, Benedict Cumberbatch is the best reason (among many) to see this film. His performance was extraordinary, and certainly his best work outside of SHERLOCK. Even though Turing was probably somewhere on the autism spectrum, there was considerable emotional weight to this portrayal, particularly in the final scenes which go into the terrible thing which happens to him as a consequence of his homosexuality. As far as prestige biopics go, nothing in the film's content or construction goes out of its way to stand out. The plot structure, which hops back and forth to different periods in Turing's life was a bit pass\u00e9, although nothing felt superfluous or out of place. And of course, the main part of the story which focuses on Turing's work breaking the Enigma code was fascinating to watch, not just for the dramatic tension that came from trying to win the war, but also through the personal relationships that formed as Turing and his team spend more and more time together. And for once, I didn't dislike Keira Knightley in her native accent. From a technical standpoint, the film is well put-together with good, if unspectacular, cinematography and editing. The score by Alexandre Desplat was also well-done and noninvasive. The only issue I feel detracts from the film in the slightest is the on-the-nose screenplay by Graham Moore, which almost oversells Alan Turing's importance and draws some rather obvious parallels between his secret government work and secret life. Still, the story told here is a very important one nonetheless and allows an enigmatic historical figure some due respect. While this isn't a revolutionary step forward as far as biopics go, it sheds some light on recently declassified history that will prove interesting to most.",

            "content": "Based on the code-cracking exploits of genius Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) during WWII, this time-hopping period drama is calculating, meticulous and slow burning, resulting in an emotionally and narratively tense ride. Graham Moore's script is a delicate blend of thrills and kitchen-sink drama, delving into Turing's struggle with his unparalleled brilliance and social awkwardness, all while trying to decipher Germany's Enigma encryption. But Moore stumbles in the final 10 minutes with a strange coda that seems to focus on Turing's homosexuality, rather than the world-changing impact he seemingly had with his mechanical creations. Calling the shots on his debut English-language film, Norwegian director Morten Tyldum (Headhunters) generates a hard-to-place peculiarity with his shooting style, which emphasises the claustrophobia that was Turing's life. He is also assisted by Oscar Faura's superbly saturated cinematography and Maria Djurkovic's outstanding production design, however Alexandre Desplat's dull score is a notable weakness that adds very little. Led by another strong performance from Cumberbatch \u2013 who I'm certain will win an Oscar or two throughout his career, but not for this \u2013 the acting is first rate across the board; Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode and Mark Strong all bringing their A games. It has already received multiple Golden Globes noms (with Oscar recognition sure to follow) and unsurprisingly so. This is the sort of carefully executed motion picture about a complex real-life figure that is adored by critics and audiences alike.",

            "content": "When it comes to The Imitation Game I think that in the future I will remember this movie as a great vehicle for Benedict Cumberbatch to score an Oscar nomination (his first). There is no doubt that Cumberbatch is one of the most talented actors of his generation and in this film he finally gets the role that writes his name in movie history. Assuming he keeps up the great work he's done so far, I believe this is only the start for him.The story is of Alan Turing, a brilliant English mathematician who, along with a team of equally brilliant minds, cracked the Nazi code Enigma and ultimately played an instrumental part in winning the war for the allies. What makes him the idealized subject for a biographical film, however, is his troubled sexual orientation. Given the mentality that was a part of the world at that time, Turing's homosexuality led to him being very secretive. In the movie we get side plot lines that explore the past heartbreak that this genius man endured and also the aftermath of the war and how it took it's toll on our him.As I said before, Benedict Cumberbatch is simply brilliant in the representation of Alan Turing. The man sells insecurity, meticulousness and emotion like no other. There may, in fact, be no part that the he can't play in nothing other than astounding fashion. In his shadow, I would say that all the supporting players are on par with each other. I personally enjoyed seeing Matthew Goode and Mark Strong respectively offering different types of character in a strong manner. As far as Knightley's nominated performance goes, I feel she was solid and was a fresh female presence in an otherwise men's show.The directing and writing are mostly just above average unfortunately. And I say this because the movie was captivating enough to hold my attention, yet it was the great acting by the cast, with special consideration for the leading man, that elevated the movie . Nonetheless, The Imitation Game is a somewhat valid choice if you want to reach the surface of Turing's contributions to the world and his turbulent private life. As far as I'm concerned, I will look back and appreciate Cumberbatch's enigmatic performance in future viewings.Rating: 7,5-8/10",

            "content": "This film is based on the life of Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), an Englishman who headed a team that decrypted the Nazis' Enigma code during World War II. Through flashback and flash-forward, three time periods are exposed: Turing's childhood in a boarding school in the 1920s, the war period, and his post-war life beginning in 1951 after he had been convicted for being sexually involved with another man.\"The Imitation Game\" is successful in recreating time periods long gone. The middle war-time section is the one that is given the most time and it is rightfully filled with excitement. After reading Wikipedia's comments on the film, however, it seems that many liberties were taken to embellish the historical truth for dramatic purposes. While this works most of the time in film, it is questionable in this case - not only for the large number of changes but also because at least one posthumous reputation has been harmed.I believe the film would have been more effective with a different time structure. The rare early flashbacks were perfect and complete. Young actor Alex Lawther (young Turing) is very powerful in a scene in which he is given bad news while his face shows how well trained he already is in upholding a stiff upper lip.I believe that the other two sections should have been linear and included the time period between them. It would have been intriguing to see the transition from post-war glory to adjusting to regular life as well as the terrible times during and after Turing's conviction. This last section included a very moving scene that was well acted between Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley who played Joan Clarke, the lone female on the team of cryptanalysts (whose story might also make a fine film).Sadly, this last period of the film had such a limited time, it felt more like an extended footnote. It deserved more emphasis. There might have been more genuine drama if the middle section had less embellishments and the later section exposed more of the real drama - the heartbreaking irony that a national (and international) hero was prosecuted by a cruel law unfairly relating to private conduct.Cumberbatch's best acting is in this last section. In the middle portion, he does a fine job as someone who is work-obsessed and emotionally withdrawn but this later section clearly shows a man who is broken and heavily medicated. There is also little evidence in the movie that show's Turing's homosexuality aside from various comments. In exposing more of the post-war period, Cumberbatch's performance would have been elevated from one that is very good to one that would have been outstanding.",

He blurs the line between acting and the real Turing in a virtuoso sfumatto which only a Sherlockian protagonist can pull out.That is the real imitation game.I mean heck if homosexual is a stigma, he makes being gay sexy.A svengali voice draws you in, in the theater, with Cumberbatch exuding a brilliant genius with gossamer narcissism not to mention deeply tortured and troubled as well forcing you to pay attention.This is perhaps the best opening monologue I have seen till Godfather and The Dark Knight.He breaks the fourth wall.

So, I'm always avoid those kinds of films.I only watched this film because it went into Oscar nominations. When I was checking out the Oscar nominations that year, I've found this film was one of the nominated and I was surprised when I read the plot. Moreover, Benedict Cumberbatch was in it, so, I decided to watch.I always find that whichever films Benedict Cumberbatch is in, they are kind of great films like Sherlock produced by BBC. I love his performance. The way he talks, the way he performs, I love all. That's why I watched this film and I was amazed because of it's quality. The film is so great. Even though the film is based on the second world war, but it's still doing great and I totally love the film.What I love of this film is the proposal scene. It's so funny and cute in some way. Too bad for Joan is that Alan is homosexual. Otherwise, I want Alan to end up with her.Another scene I love is how Alan find his members. That scene is kind of funny and I love those words which one of his members said after Alan solved the Enigma \"you just solved Enigma.....\". When I saw that scene, I smiled.Although those scenes are great ones, the final scene is so sad. Alan is a great guy. He doesn't deserve all that happened to him, especially, his homosexuality. I guess at that time, homosexuality was banned, so, Alan has to go though hell.The final scene makes me angry. All they tried is just to see how strong/secure their code is? When I saw that scene, I really want to hit them.All in all, this film is so great and so enjoyable. Although it is a biography film and I thought it would make me bored, but it didn't. Moreover, it is the best of best biography films I've seen. I would recommend you all to watch because you won't regret watching it since it's a great film.",

            "content": "At the peak of Germany's dominance over Europe during the second World War, Britain was desperate to gain a strategic advantage against the enemy while being constantly bombarded through air-raids. MI-6 had learnt of the Nazi Code machine, Enigma, but was unable to decipher it's cryptic messages that had millions of variables that changed on a daily basis. Enter, Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant mathematician who severely lacked social skills but was committed to cracking the codes and helping the UK win the war. The unsung hero who rather than being glorified for saving thousands of lives during the war, was punished to the point that ended up with him committing suicide. Norwegian film-maker Morten Tyldum brings a biopic of triumph and tragedy right in time to please the academy. The genius of Alan Turing was promptly recognized by Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) and MI6's Menzies (Mark Strong) but being a part of a team that would potentially slow him down wasn't quite the idea of breaking Enigma's codes for Turing himself. Arrogant he is, foolhardy certainly not because his next plan was to build a machine that would defeat a machine rather than spending thousands of man hours in vain. With a smaller team that included the likes of Downton Abbey's Allen Leech, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode and Matthew Beard, a building in Bletchley Park was thus dedicated to a one time solution that would end the war sooner. There are challenges with the machine's development and performance, with short timelines that cost lives everyday and with Turing's own idiosyncrasies that make him a difficult team leader. Yet, we ride along till the eventual breakthrough as we simultaneously discover the unfortunate circumstances of Turing's childhood. The stakes at war are so high that every moment in front of the Turing machine represents a nervous gamble but for the determined mathematician, it had to work. He goes to great lengths to ensure the availability of his best resources and in order to ensure Joan's presence in the factory, he marries her even though he can't fake fancying her. Alan Turing was gay and though today's society wouldn't quite undermine his contribution to science on that background, the times back then were completely different. Ignorance and prejudice in Britain meant that homosexuality was deemed illegal and Turing would suffer the consequence of it when his secret would be out. From the very onset, as the voice in the background says \"Are you paying attention? Good. If you are not listening carefully, you will miss things. Important things...\", that is Benedict Cumberbatch absorbing you into the life of Alan Turing that he has embodied so brilliantly. Just like Sherlock lacking social traits, Cumberbatch portrays the awkward genius almost naturally. He also adds a layer underneath that shields his homosexuality from his colleagues. Add to it, his arrogance that he somehow manages to support with his intellect and determination. The same condescending genius will not mind sharing a drink at a bar with his friends and celebrating their limited successes. But then there are those extended moments of silence when Turing is simply staring at his machine, hoping, deliberating. Just witnessing Cumberbatch get so immersed into the character is like witnessing the articulation of performing arts. He comes off being so matter-of-fact like when Joan enquires about the job and he very simply states, \"We're gonna break an unbreakable Nazi code and win the war\" or when he proposes marriage to her. Such interactions bring a lot of credibility and add to the natural depiction of Turing. Cumberbatch is undoubtedly worthy of the Academy award for an astounding performance and a most sincere portrayal of an enigmatic character. This must also be Keira Knightley's most meaningful role and strongest performance. Her relationship with Turing is out of love for cryptanalysis and helping mankind. They share enough in intellect to disregard any other expectation and Keira embraces these characteristics of Joan Clarke. Allen Leech and Matthew Goode play the sensible contributors to Turing's success and while they are initially weary of his methods, they develop a stronger bond as they witness his unshaken dedication to the mission. Mark Strong and Charles Dance play out their authorities with finesse while Rory Kinnear as the detective seems apt for the role.Screenwriter Graham Moore has based much of the story on the biography 'Alan Turing: The Enigma' but has suitably dramatized parts to make such a complex subject more engaging. He also had to compress 600 pages into less than 2 hours on film. Morten Tyldum doesn't indulge into technical details too much nor does he over-expose the subject of homosexuality. He always keeps it as Turing's personal secret, just as Cumberbatch manages to. Together with some great performances, this director manages to steer the engagement of the viewer through different phases of Turing's life and also, the great War. It isn't just about the thrill of achieving a breakthrough but also the determination of a complicated genius whose disparity from others was perhaps the reason why he made such a difference to the world. The Turing machine was the genesis of the modern day computer and while Tyldum tells us the story about how Alan Turing changed the world, he also tells us about that very world that destroyed the man. 8.887 on a scale of 1-10.",

            "content": "Admittedly, I knew nothing of this story prior to viewing The Imitation Game. Having now watched the movie I feel a little embarrassed that I had no knowledge of this true and quite remarkable story. The story follows Alan Turing, a mathematician during WW2. He approaches the government applying for a 'top secret' job which is to help England de-code a German communications system known as Enigma. Each day the communications system is reset and scrambled, this gives Turing and his team only 18 hours every day before the code is changed and all their hard work is worthless. There are 159,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible codes each day which would of course be impossible; this is when Turing sets out to create a machine, a machine to beat the German machine. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a truly incredible performance; he is rapidly becoming one of the best actors of today's movie scene and certainly one of my favourite actors to date. He opens up beautifully is this movie and lets you in, he allows you to connect with his character and puts in a flawlessly emotion driven performance. He is playing a character based on a real person but doesn't allow this is stop him making the role his own. His character is socially awkward, arrogant to people around him and very witty. The supporting cast are all impressive and fit believably into the settings and story lines.Based in the South of England during the Second World War is a setting that is not new to cinema, it has been done plenty of times before. The Imitation Game stays true to the times and produces fantastic sets and perfect costumes. The language used, mannerisms of the characters and the image of the working class v the upper class is portrayed as you would expect.The story is of course a well-known one but it does branch off several times and takes the viewer into a different period. The Imitation Game flicks between three different time periods: The man story is in the 1940's but it jumps back ten years to when Alan was a child and also forwards ten years to a time after the WW2 events. This is done superbly and it made in such a way that it flows well and doesn't once leave you confused. The feature is also complemented with real life news snippets of the war, television recording and radio samples; this is not overdone and is used quite subtlety - a fantastic addition in my eyes.Unlike me, many of you will more than likely know this touching story but I will not say too much in case there are a few of you who do not! The Imitation Game is a story of courage, dedication and cruelty. It makes you laugh one minute and cry the next but overall it gave me a very emotional experience. It really does open your eyes to a world with respect and views which seem a million years in the past but shamefully existed less than a century ago.8/10",

That is what this film did the best, it really captured all of the best and worst things about Alan and portrayed him as something of an unlikely hero. The film would not have been able to capture Alan the way it did without a brilliant and even Oscar worthy performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. He did an amazing job portraying all of the things that made Alan so likable but also so difficult and he really stole the entire film, and made me see Alan and not Benedict. As well as him, the supporting cast also had some pretty solid performances, most notably Keira Knightley who was better than i had initially expected. The overall film was very interesting and gave some insight into a side of WWII that more people should know of and research. The film is very interesting, and dramatic with very good performances making it that much better. - 9",

I think maybe the Hollywood treatment didn't jive with the meek, uncomfortable, genius of Turing (expertly portrayed by Cumberbatch).I'd seen an earlier, much lower budget movie about Turing called Codebreaker over a year ago. Plus I had heard a little about Turing, the Enigma code and had been carrying a story of my own relating to the consequences of the code breaking for many years.How important was Turing ? Some have claimed his part in the real story is overstated. But to me, I feel he could be very important. My education, my career and now my centre of expertise directly relate to his work. But, also perhaps my life, my family and my homeland.I don't feel people still quite understand what Turing and others managed to do, how creative he/they were and what we take for granted today in many facets of life, we potentially owe to him and his contemporaries.But I'm still bothered by the fact the he never enjoyed the attention, praise and love he deserved. It is shocking how recent this inhumane law existed. What joy would he have today to see the power of what is at our fingertips. My reaction wasn't one of inspiration, but one more of sadness. I felt rather lonely walking home.I did read a number of reviews on IMDb and adjusted this review slightly to take into consideration that the code breaking was in reality not just the creation of Alan Turing, but a number of brilliant men and women who worked behind the scenes.",

The reason is that it ultimately situates itself in a third, less hackneyed genre.The obvious genres are biopic and British \"heritage\" drama. Turing's homosexuality and career arc protect against the biopic's endemic pitfalls of sentimental sexuality (hero saved/inspired by the love of a good woman) and ultimate apotheosis of the hero, while discreet writing minimizes the cringe-inducing historical data dumps that mar otherwise good films such as \"The King's Speech\" and \"Belle\". The genre to which the film ultimately finds its way is that of the Sympathetic Monster drama (\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\", \"Elephant Man\").Credit is due to the writing and direction, but above all to Cumberbatch's heartfelt and intelligent performance, which brings Charles Laughton and John Hurt to mind. The supporting actors are uniformly excellent (Charles Dance's villain is a treat as usual). But it is Cumberbatch's rendering of the hero that will make the film a classic.",

While The Imitation Game cannot be considered a factual account of the life of Alan Turing and his remarkable wartime code work - it takes historical accuracy and basically throws it out the window - the movie is still a fantastic piece of work. The writer himself defended the lack of historical accuracy with the words \"You don't test mark Monet's Waterlillies\", An apt defence if ever there was one, though I'm usually on the side of historical accuracy myself. Better this than the Forrest Gump right-wing redo of history any day.Benedict Cumberbatch is quite wonderful as Turing; giving one of the best acting displays I've seen in recent years. While Turing was not the virtual borderline Asperger's case depicted here, it's all in the spirit of empathising with the character. And you really do empathise.I'm not a big fan of Keira Knightley but she was extremely good here, giving a layered and intelligent performance. Even Matthew Goode, who stuck out like a sore thumb in Watchmen, gives a relaxed and realistic display this time out. All the cast were fine, really.The script was excellent; but again a caveat must apply that those looking for historical accuracy about the events at Bletchley Park, and the cracking of the Enigma code, had best look elsewhere. But I found this film to be humane and warm, and it's nice to know that Turing was at least pardoned and his work recognised so long after his appalling mistreatment. The film serves as a grim reminder of what intolerance can do to its victims. In short this movie is a gem.",

Not that it has no flaws, because there definitely are a few but those are more on a subjective point of view. But I'm still glad to say that i got my money's worth and that the film was pretty much what i expected it to be. I, mainly wanted to see the movie because, of course, Benedict Cumberbatch, but After watching a few trailers i thought that the story was kind of interesting too. I found it important to inform myself about the events and persons this movie's story is based on. So i read a bit about Alan Turing to know what this man was like and i'm glad to say that Cumberbatch plays this character brilliantly. He did a very good job of convincing me, that the man that i see on the screen is Alan Turing and not some guy playing Alan Turing. The other performances were also really good but Cumberbatch shined the most. The majority of the film was also very well directed and there weren't many scenes where i found something that bothered me. However, every time i noticed a flaw, it immediately took me out of the experience and i was reminded that i'm just watching a movie.In the few scenes where the viewer sees the actual war happen, you don't need to pay extra attention to notice that the computer generated effects are really crappy and it took me out immediately. I know that the movie is not about that but it could have made for a better experience if i wasn't suddenly reminded of the fact that what i'm looking at is not real. I found it also distracting that in the scene where Turings machine finally works, that the music was intrusively loud. The score in this movie is for the most part really quiet and subtle and i really loved that, but in this one scene it gets distractingly loud as if it wants to spoil you what's going to happen, and it does exactly that. It's probably pretty obvious that the machine was going to work in this scene but the movie found it was necessary to tell me that i should feel excited now because the machine is going to work. Also, as someone who informed himself about Alan Turing before watching the movie, i had the feeling that the creators of this picture tried to rub it into my face that Alan Turing created one of the first things known to mankind that we can call a Computer by telling me that at the end through a faded in text. And even if you don't inform yourself about that before the movie, i still think that the audience this film is targeting should be able to realize that by themselves.But overall i still think this is a great movie because the few flaws that bothered me do not make it necessarily worse. I just think i could enjoy it more If those weren't present. If you're interested in movies or just like Benedict Cumberbatch, i would say go and see it.",

The film is well paced; there's plenty of suspense, incident and emotional turmoil. On the other hand, historical accuracy goes out of the window, if that's a problem for you when handing over your spondulicks.The inaccuracy that bothers me is the drama-class portrayal of emotional turmoil, the tearful confessions and crises, the repetition of encouraging catchphrases, and the billboard-sized depiction of what we have to assume is Turing's Asperger's syndrome. It's difficult to distinguish between Turing's struggle with having no friends, illegal sexuality (in the 40's) and his struggle to build an Enigma decoder, which makes him a joyless hero. And in the end, the government stitches him up royally - if only he'd known.What with the school bullying flashbacks, Benedict Cumberbatch has a tough time of it, and Turing's only happy moment seems to have been in finally getting 'Christopher', his computer, to work. I'm not asking for John Gregson or Kenneth More but it's all a bit wimpy and weepy. Gays, huh? What can you do? (Ironic).There's a lot of exposition of the fundamental problem of daily trying to find one out of 159,000,000,000,000 Enigma setting variations within 18 hours, which it's essential to appreciate to get the whole maguffin of the film, but this is well done, and on the whole the film is immersive and atmospheric.More exciting than, but easily as cheesy as you'd expect.",

It is too bad, I suppose, that the filmmakers took excessive liberties in order to make a better film about a real historical figure. That said, The Imitation Game does manage to convey the difficulties faced by intelligent and marginalized people (in this case, homosexuals back when it was considered pathological) in coping with government bureaucracies.I recommend this film as a work unto itself.

I usually do not like films which are not historically inaccurate.I would also like to concentrate on the story behind the story and that is the homosexuality of Turing. During those times they prosecuted homosexuals and today we have legal gay marriages in many countries. It is inevitable to draw a parallel with prosecution of pedophiles today. It does make you think, doesn*t it? In British society today, it is probably worst crime of them all.I also noticed that a lot of people from the former Yugoslavia worked on the film, a lot of i\u0107 ending last names, that is a mark they are from these necks of the woods.All in all I recommend that you see this film, you might like it more then I did.",

No. Were the amazing exploits of Turing and others at Bletchley Park explained in any meaningful way? No.I really like Benedikt Cumberbatch and he played his part well, but his talents were wasted. Another film came to my mind while watching this. A Beautfilu Mind. Now there was a movie. A brilliant mathematician who is socially unacceptable. Check. And it didn't even have a grand World War II setting upon which it could rely for drama. Just the main protagonist's mind. It was fantastically gripping. Not so here. I found I didn't really care about anyone - even Turing. All this jumping around in time was so distracting and made sure that no tension could build on the off chance that it was in danger of doing so.Do yourself a favour and watch, or re-watch, A Beautfilu Mind.

It also felt as they were really trying to hammer through that terrible acts have been committed against gay people, in the past.

In order to win World War 2, Turing and his team face many struggles and hard decisions whenever to act once they discover an attack is about to accur. They all know that if they go too far, the Germans will discover the Enigma code has been cracked and they'll change it.So throughout the story, Turing faces struggles in his work and even in his personal life due to his homosexuality. Eventually being charged in 1951 for his \"crimes\" and forced to go Chemical Castration.The script is written perfectly, great dialogue amongst the characters, it really feels like the characters are in a race against time to Crack the Enigma while time is running out.Benedict Cumberbatch is marvelous, great acting and in general he's a wonderful actor. Portrays so well.Keira Knightley is gorgeous, she Portrays Joan Clark, a Mathematician in Turing's team and later a close friend. Her embodiment of a caring person is shown perfectly in this film.Along Cumberbatch and Knightley we also see Charles Dance, Mark Strong and Matthew Goode.Apparently, there were some conflicts with the movie itself when it came out. Critics saying the movie lacks true details and incuded wrong ones. Over this statement, the writers of the film said they wanted to embody more emotion and have a emotional story then try and read a \"Wikipedia page\".Only this is my problem with the movie, I didn't feel any emotion towards it. Many some will disagree and say otherwise. But as for me I didn't feel much compassion towards any of the characters, leading me to believe that maybe this effort of rewriting the story was wrong.Overall, I do believe the script and idea were great, with well written characters and story line. But as for emotion, I felt a little conflicted. Sure it may be sad everything Turing went through. But what does it take to show and create more emotion to emphasize with?",

            "content": "British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing was highly influential in the Second World War, arguably shortening the conflict by as much as two years and consequently saving millions of lives. He also pioneered modern computer technology by designing two pivotal machines. The Turing machine was developed in 1936 and described by the Stanford Encyclopaedia as \"a device intended to investigate the extent and limitations of what can be computed\". The second major invention was called the Bombe which Turing invented in 1939. The Bombe was a larger device which reversed the encryption of the German's Enigma machine, allowing messages to be intercepted and attacks against the Allies to be prevented, consequently helping end the war. As the gears and cranks of the machinery would churn, so do parts of The Imitation Game, a fictional account of Turing's efforts to utilise the Bombe, along with his relationships to his peers like Joan Clarke and his isolation in Britain during the 1950s for being ostracised as a homosexual. Marking the English language feature debut of Norwegian filmmaker Morten Tyldum, the film's central idea is whether a machine can think for itself, a deliberately self-reflective question. While The Imitation Game is a slick piece of engineering, designed to extract such impulses as \"laughs\" and \"pain\" from its audience, it does not escape the imprint of previous models of this story. Nor should its components be considered original but refined parts welded together to form a reliable filmic mould. While I enjoyed much of the film, from its central performance to its dry wit, the concessions made sometimes feel overly calculated with the film's phases set towards the box- office. Sherlock's Benedict Cumberbatch is cast as Turing and successfully projects a showcase of violent shakes, downward stares and internalised thoughts as his mind spins like the cogs of the Bombe. His version of Turing engages but it's strictly an interpretation of the man, comparable to how he plays the World's Greatest Detective or The Big Bang Theory's Sheldon Cooper. In the first feature script by Graham Moore, writer of the novel 'The Sherlockian', the characterisation of Turing represents him as a brilliant mechanical and scientific mind but also socially daft and borderline Asperger's. The deadpan humour is especially funny when Turing takes everything literally like when he is invited by his frustrated colleagues including Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) for lunch. But the robotic impression is at odds with novelist Alan Garner's recollections, who met Turing while jogging in the 1950s. He described him as having a great sense of humour and being stocky with a barrel chest, a stark contrast to Cumberbatch who is lean and tall. Adding character traits evokes strong comedy but steers the story towards a predictable end goal for the character arc. It is inevitable this robotic man will connect emotionally with others. The \"other\" is primarily Christopher, Turing's real life crush. The character is present in flashbacks where we see his companionship to Turing, who was indefensible to the torments of the other school children. Though commendable for not forgoing from the story, a step-up from the John Nash biopic A Beautiful Mind which this film resembles in content and structure, Turing's sexuality is still kept at arm's length. It is addressed verbally and treated as a plot twist in the present day scenes where a policeman investigates a break-in into Turing's home. The relationship is also expressed through a pivotal visual motif of the Bombe, which Turing calls Christopher, making the machine an early prototype of Spike Jonze's \"Samantha\". The film's second non-romance features Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, whom Turing proposed to, but the part is underwritten, with the only details of the character being her intelligence and still living with her parents. Moore's script, summarised as a broad period comedy, relies on old formulaic structures to house potentially richer and substantial ideas. The conflict of utilising the Bombe at Bletchley Park mirrors a college movie and underdog story, with Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) acting as a cantankerous dean figure, believing Turing is wasting time and money with the machine. He outlines a standard movie protocol where the group have a month to show results or they'll be removed. The underdog premise is also underscored by dialogue written like a cheesy political bumper sticker. \"It's the people no one thinks anything of that do things people can only imagine\" is one repeated line instilling creaking themes about the willpower of individuals and outcasts. The script's best idea is the contradictions between Turing inner and outer life. While unlocking the secrets of the Enigma he withholds information about himself, most proficiently dramatised when the subplots filter into each other from different time periods, changing the meaning of scenes. Further, a powerful choice briefly enriches the plot's complexity when Turing strategically conceals information regarding the attacks, a dilemma which alone could have sustained an uncharacteristically plodding final quarter. The Imitation Game is an American-British coproduction, financed partly by Black Bear Pictures, a New York- based film company, accounting for the compromises with the stylisation. Morten Tyldum settles for a breezy, comedic tone, without reaching the emotional heights of The King's Speech, despite sharing its penchant for juxtaposing comedy with the formal historical backdrop. There are no war casualties shown in the film and the only signs of physical conflict are intercuts to brief scenes of fighter bombers, stock footage and the occasional ruined building in Britain. Further illustrating the lack of grit is the glossy look the film possesses and Alexandre Desplat's overly chipper score. More danger could have enhanced the film's tension levels. But Tyldum's strengths are in the deadpan comedic tone, supplied by a solid lead performance, and keeping the pace brisk until a late drop in energy. The film is rarely anything but entertaining and humorous but its approaches are visibly commercial, meaning some of the authenticity and seriousness of an incredible story has been lowered.",

            "content": "The story of the breaking of the German Engima code during the Second World War is one of those incredible real-life stories filmmakers seem drawn to, like moths to a flame. That seems due, in part, to some of the remarkable figures involved with the effort. One of them was Alan Turing, a young Cambridge mathematician whose work not only helped crack the code but give birth to the modern computer age. Helping tell Turing's story to a broader audience is 2014's The Imitation Game, with Benedict Cumberbatch as the man himself.Let's be honest: If you were going to cast someone to play Turing, you could a lot worse than go with Cumberbatch. The man who had brought to life a modern-day Sherlock Holmes and, before that, Stephen Hawking in a BBC TV movie, clearly had a pedigree for bringing to life those blessed with genius and eccentricity. Even so, his performance as Turing stands as something of a triumph. All the facets of this incredible, if at times distant, man is there on display with Cumberbatch finding ways to play them with both subtlety and, at times, explosiveness. The shift from vain to vulnerable can happen in the blink of an eye, the raising of an eyebrow, and Cumberbatch presents all of that wonderfully. It's a remarkable performance, and it is no surprise there was an Oscar nomination in store for his work.Elsewhere, Cumberbatch is given ample support by the supporting cast. Keira Knightley's Joan Clarke is a prime example of this, a little known figure in her own right, whom Knightley brings to life with a performance that hits all the right notes. Turing's fellow codebreakers are likewise well-cast, from Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander to Allen Leech as John Cairncross. One good bit of casting is Alex Lawther as the young Turing, offering the viewer an elegant depiction of the up and coming mathematician. Elsewhere, the film features a procession of the UK's leading character actors from the likes of Charles Dance as Commander Denniston to Mark Strong as MI6 chief Stewart Menzies and the ever-reliable Rory Kinnear as the policeman looking into Turing in the 1950s. It's a choice cast and one that brings out the best in their roles and, ultimately, Cumberbatch as Turing.The Imitation Game is also a handsomely made film. From the cinematography of Oscar Faura to the sets of Maria Djurkovic and the costuming of Sammy Sheldon Differ recreating Britain of the forties and fifties, it's a gorgeous film to look at, rich in detail. It also sounds impressive, thanks to the score from Alexandre Desplat which is every bit as idiosyncratic and remarkable as the performance of the film's lead, capturing the intricacies of the moods and racing mind of Turing, as if musical quicksilver. Brought together under the direction of Morten Tyldum, it's an impressive combination that elevates the film that much more.And then there's the script from Graham Moore, an Oscar-winning one at that. Working from Andrew Hodges' biography of Turing, Moore crafted an immensely compelling piece of work, one that highlights so many aspects of Turing's life and works. Yet, Moore frames his story around what, ultimately, became Turing's downfall, meaning he would never be known for his work during his lifetime. It's a remarkable story, without a doubt, and Moore finds ways to turn an often complex narrative into something understandable for those who aren't either mathematicians or experts on the Second World War. It also means, at times to the detriment of both script and the film, that there's the invoking of cliches, not to mention stretching of historical facts to their breaking point. That isn't to take away from Moore's achievement or what the film does, but perhaps suggest why such a remarkable piece of work has the occasional air of being formulaic at times.Even with sometimes playing to a formula and stretching historical truth, The Imitation Game does a fine job. From Cumberbatch's performance to the work of its cast and crew and even the finer moments of Moore's script, it succeeds beautifully in bringing to life again one of the remarkable minds of the 20th century. For that reason alone, it stands out as a piece of filmmaking worth seeing.",

I went into this one not knowing what to expect, I was more than happy to find that this was a competently made entertainer, firmly in the commercial realm though (bummer), that showcases of the more closely-held secrets of the 2nd world war, the breaking of the so- called 'Enigma' code by British academia, and holding on to that for a long time, before using it, subversively, to herald the end of the war, without (apparently) letting the Germans know that they'd broken the code.The process though, and the machine itself, doesn't get technical, and that's a pity (with 'Interstellar' kinda doing that successfully for the LCDs among us, me included), since having a 10-minute exposition, even seemingly going over our collective heads, could've been a great value-add to this tale, and perhaps that's nit-picking, since most of the other aspects of film-making are bang-on, including the soundtrack, the CGI and the gorgeous cinematography. This, in turn, is augmented by quite a few fantastic performances (surprise!), from Cumberbatch, Knightley, Goode, Strong (esp. so) and Dance (ordinary, but not his fault - more the screenplay's, which makes him one-note). There are some 'gotcha' moments interspersed within, and that should not be a surprise, since it has become a commercial trope nowadays. It's the quality of the gotcha that's interestingly inconsistent, and doesn't do Tyldum's behind-the-scenes talent any justice (his own doing?). MAJOR SPOILER ALERT for those yet to watch this:The angst behind how many of their decisions actually make them mass-murderers, each and every one of them, was also treated, not quite refreshingly IMO, in a matter-of-fact manner, and I do not know if it was intended to showcase the monstrosity that is inherent in us all, or just the aspect that the makers could not showcase that further and risk alienating the leads further from their audience/s. However, that makes the comeuppance to the lead all the more seem like poetic justice, and the point the makers may have been trying to make against an existing intolerant society go dilute. Therefore, while I have to applaud their including that aspect, it doesn't make for strong story-telling in hindsight.One of the best sequences in the movie? The one between Cumberbatch and Rory Kinnear. Kinda makes us understand why the title was chosen (no spoiler there). It reminded me of the back-and-forth between Gollum and Bilbo (perhaps the highest point in the Hobbit movie- verse), though the intent and execution are markedly different.All in all, worth your time, effort and money in making that trek to the local multiplex, on, preferably, their largest screen possible.",

Overall, the film is very enjoyable and has, a priori, everything to succeed -- great actors, an interesting story, and a fascinating historical period. However, the production, direction, and script ruined it for me. I find surprising that the script won an Oscar, really unbelievable. The main flaw of the movie is the lack of focus. The historical episode and Turin himself are fascinating subjects. If you want to produce a two-hour movie, you have to choose what you focus on; otherwise, you'll get a movie that is flawed because is all over the place, like a scattered brain. That is, you focus on Turin the man and the scientist and tell his story from childhood to death and all his scientific breakthroughs, or you focus solely on the cracking of the Enigma code. The movie tries to do both things and fails, produces a clich\u00e9d and somewhat contrived version of Turin, and the cracking-the-code episode lacks dramatic tempo because the time to build it was used to tell general facts about Turin. I found the double flashback in the movie, really interesting narratively, but it doesn't help much to create an image of Turin that honors the multifaceted person and scientist he was. As a viewer, the film failed to move me and to engage me fully. The second flaw of the movie is the acting. Don't take me wrong, I think most of the actors do a good job with the material they are given, but only one of them fully shines: Alex Lawther as the young Turin, who is truly superb and believable 100% and he wasn't nominated for any Oscar! Having Cumberbatch and Knightly together in a movie is a real treat, but is their acting in this movie really great? The answer is No. Is their acting better than other performances of theirs in movies for which they weren't nominated to an Oscar? The answer is No!The third flaw of the film is the atmosphere. Not bad at all, but not good either, and full of cinematic clich\u00e9s and scenes that were deja vu.It felt more for a TV mini-series than for a film.

It's a rather little-known but decisive episode in the history of World War II. The acting is top notch: Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly are both great, and there's a real chemistry between them. Much care has been put in reconstructing the way the war era looked, and the cinematography is well done. The problem is that is was all a bit too perfect for my taste. I know it sounds silly, but all those well-designed sets, clever conversations and carefully constructed plot developments didn't really grip me. Some scenes seemed too good to be true: did Turing really get the idea of how to break the code because of a flirtatious conversation between his colleagues? Was Joan Clarke really the only one to finish the puzzle test in less than 6 seconds, something that even Turing himself considered impossible? Did a member of Turings team really learn from the very first decoded message that his brother was about to be bombed? I couldn't help thinking that the script writers had included these scenes to spice up the story and to please a large audience. 'The Imitation Game' is a good film about an important story that needs to be told. I'm glad I've seen it. It was just that I didn't come out of the cinema saying: 'wow'.",

            "content": "Like most films about gays, The Imitation Game is a nod to loneliness. I found Cumberbatch quite capable in the role of Alan Turing. I think, replacing an alternate end, where we see Turing commit suicide instead of seeing him elated, with soaring music, stole the film's thunder. I would have said that this is typical Hollywood. It's not an American film. But its imprint is there.Cumberbatch, a favorite actor of mine, sensibly reigned in his deep voice. I have the suspicion that he did many things for the first time. He used muscles in his face that he never used. This film, regrettably is not the work of a master. The director did everything well, but didn't excel in any of the scenes. His cinematography is questionable, with the same dull colors indoors or outdoors, in offices, or pubs. He cuts away when the camera should be on Alan Turing. He overused Desplat's adequate music for the first act. Young Alan Turing was a good cast. I will remember his stint in this movie. Charles Dance, horribly directed in the anonymous Robin Hood and Last Action Hero, finally shines through(I didn't watch him in Game Of Thrones). Kiera Knightley as Joan Clarke lost an opportunity to impress. I hope she will stop turning up in movies by the time she loses her looks. She has nothing else to hold on to. All in all, this is the best movie that I've seen recently. Let's hope for the better. I'm glad if this review was useful.",

            "content": "Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent young British actor, who hits a home run in his latest film, The Imitation Game. Unfortunately, the film itself only makes it to second base. Morten Tyldum's The Imitation Game tells the fascinating story of British mathematician Alan Turing, who was hired by the British government to crack the Nazi code known as Enigma. Turing was later prosecuted for being a homosexual, and committed suicide in 1954. That's a lot of material to cover in one motion picture, and I wish Tyldum had stuck with the Enigma project.Originally, Turing is hired as part of a team of crack mathematicians and code breakers, but it doesn't take long for the others to turn against him. Brilliant yet socially awkward (reminding me of young Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything, which is a superior film), Turing has a habit of belittling those with whom he is assigned to work. He's simply not \"one of the guys.\" Furthermore, he takes all conversation literally. Thus, not only can he not tell a joke, but he's not aware when others are joking with him. Colloquialisms are lost on Turing. This mental and social tug-of-war between Turing and his colleagues is one of the most interesting aspects of The Imitation Game.When Winston Churchill himself puts Turing in charge of the project, he promptly fires those he considers inferior, then holds a contest to find someone to replace them. That person is Joan Clarke, remarkably played by fellow Oscar nominee Kiera Knightley. Although her hairstyle is too modern for a World War II story, her character breathes fresh air into a story just beginning to wear thin when she arrives on the scene. Clarke develops a crush on Turing, and this is where we first learn of the homosexuality that would eventually lead to his personal downfall.Unfortunately, this takes place over halfway through the picture. Tyldum then spends so much time examining the homosexuality issue, the focus of the film abruptly changes. I believe The Imitation Game would have worked better had it either (a) made a statement about Britian's lack of respect for and understanding of homosexuals in the 1940s and '50s, or (b) given us an insider's look at how Alan Turing essentially invented the computer to break the Nazi radio code during the war. It has a hard time doing both. Personally, I found the codebreaking story more fascinating, and I wish more of an attempt had been made to help us understand some of the mathematics behind Turing's construction of the first computer. Then there's a side story about a possible Soviet spy working for Turing, but that plot strand is never developed.Another complaint I have with the script is that it moves too frequently among three time periods \u2013 Turing's boarding school youth, the Enigma project itself, and the 1951 investigation into a break-in at Turing's home, which is used to bookend the story, albeit unnecessarily \u2013 which adds to the confusion. I would have like to have seen all the boarding school scenes (which actually introduce us to Turing's homosexuality) first, then the Enigma project scenes. This structure worked great in The Godfather Part II. It would have worked great here.But all objections aside, Benedict Cumberbatch is exceptional as Alan Turing, fully capturing his genius and his social ineptitude. He's earned a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar, and probably should win it (but won't) over Michael Keaton's has-been actor in Birdman. Kiera Knightley also scores as Turing's sympathetic colleague.As I continue to compare The Imitation Game to The Theory Of Everything, I can't help but wonder if a similar approach would have helped The Imitation Game. In other words, what if the story were told from Joan Clarke's point of view, the way The Theory Of Everything was told from the viewpoint of Stephen Hawking's wife? I can't say for sure whether that story construction would have succeeded here, but if I were the director I'd be willing to give it a try.",

What 'Imitation' does so well is it tells the story of a complex man who is seemingly at odds with society and constantly feels pressure to fit in. Despite the general tragedy that surrounds Turing, Cumberbatch does a good job showcasing him for his brilliance and failures, his persistence and cerebralness, while the supporting cast of Keira Knightley and Matthew Goode complement him well.'The Imitation Game' may not be the most riveting story, but there's no denying its uniqueness compared to many similar films that have since overshadowed it.",

The code-cracking team was not who decided when/where to use the info against the Germans- that was done by higher-up admins. Turing never named his machine after his school chum. And Clarke's family commented about the casting of Knightley as their family member- describing her as \"rather plain\". LOL THEIR words..

            "content": "IMITATION GAME In 1940 in the dark days following the fall of France and facing the Germans alone Britain was on the verge of collapse. The massive Luftwaffe bombardments from the air and deadly U-boat attacks at sea were coordinated by a secret military code called \"Enigma\" which was considered to be of undecipherable diabolical complexity. With their fading hopes hanging on the cracking of the code an enigmatic (aloof, arrogant and homosexual) mathematician from Cambridge, Prof. Alan Turing, regarded as a very touchy eccentric genius, was recruited in desperation as a last resort to head a team of experts assembled for the top secret operation but totally stymied until then.The film deals with Turing's tenterhook relations with the high command and the conflicts with colleagues he regards as simpletons, one of whom is a a pert young women (Keira Knightley, drably dressed in wartime austerity duds, but still looking great) who steadfastly defends him and supplies moral support in moments of doubt. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch (37) is letter perfect as the irascible genius saddled with the extreme responsibility of being his country's only hope, working with people he disdains, but above all because he is basically an egomaniac, seeing the problem as the greatest intellectual challenge of his life. Director Morten Tyldum, born in Oslo, 1967, is a leading director of tight Noreegian dramas (UNO, 2008, but this is his first film in English and by the result you'd never know he isn't even an Englishman. The wartime decor, costumes, and atmosphere is so spot on it gives you the feeling of being there, not looking back, especially with the subdues low key photography and authentic English accents. Most important, even if we know what the outcome will be in the end, Tyldum skillfully maintains mounting tension every step of the way playing off of the antagonism of the others against Turing and his own frustration at failing to find the answer before it's too late.In a brilliant flash of insight Turing cracks it -- partly by realizing that the formula \"Heil Hitler\" will be repeated in all messages in what looks like meaningless strings of jumbled letters. This is the high point of the desperate quest for a solution, but a second high point comes in the final act, when exposed as a homosexual, a crime in England at the time, Turing is disowned by the establishment he has just saved, and rewarded for his efforts by being offered \"chemical castration\" (a new one on me!) in lieu of being sent to prison. His towering ego can only take so much of that insanity before he commits suicide, which he in fact did, in 1954 at the tragically early age of 42. A series of inscriptions at the end inform us that Turing was later retroactively rehabilitated and honored. Largely as a tribute to his memory and his key contribution to victory over Nazi Germany, thousands of homosexuals who were prosecuted during England's peak homophobic years, living and dead, have now been officially pardoned by Prime Minister Gordon Brown (2009) and Queen Elizabeth, Royal Pardon, in 2011. ( But, please Note: she was the sitting queen when Turing was royally screwed in 1954!) In a sense then, \"Imitation Game\" is as much a plea against official homophobia as it is a tantalizing gripping World War II back story. Above all, Cumberbatch's performance is low key Awesome!The title stems from the fact, graphically shown throughout, that Turing had to emulate, or attempt to imitate the code, on a captured Enigma typewriter salvaged from a destroyed German U-boat. Without that simple device the task would have been impossibleComparison with 'The Theory of Everything' the story of wheelchair bound Physicist Stephen Hawking, another Cambridge genius, is all but inevitable. Both pictures came out in late 2014, both are about English geniuses from Cambridge University, both were directed by relatively unknown directors, both starred hitherto little known actors in the leading roles and had outstanding female roles in support. Both were showered with all kinds of awards in a variety of ceremonies from the British BAFTA awards to the Hollywood Oscars. Finally, both are intelligent off-mainstream productions that performed well at the world box-office anyway because of their inherent quality as entertainment. James Marsh's THEORY is over-the-top Baroque razzle-dazzle and Eddie Redmayne, as fully expected, walked off with an undisputed Oscar. In Sober contrast Tydlum's GAME is more restrained and Classic in style, but even Cumberbatch's fine-tuned Turing could not top Redmayne's gaggling Hawking. Yet I think Tydlum's sober classic is the superior film. Felicity Jones, incidentally, was terrific as Hawking's wife but Keira Knightley was not far behind as Turing's female safety blanket. In every other way Tydlum's film feels less commercial and more authentic. Theory appeals to the emotions and pulls out all the stops ~~ Game, more to the mind, but also the emotions in a more subtle way. Different strokes for different folks. Marsh had one success previously, Man on a Wire, 2008, Oscar for Best documentary feature. Redmayne figured prominently in \"My Week with Marilyn\" an excellent English Film that that came and went with little notice in 2011.",

Although the movie is a little older now and the age does show, this movie is how you tell an Alan Turing story.Starting at what I believe is the most impressive aspect of the movie, the acting. I believe Benedict Cumberbatch's acting of portraying a socially undeveloped and neurodivergent Alan Turing as beautiful. From the physical twitches to the fringe and tense voice, it doesn't sell short.The supporting cast around Benedict Cumberbatch wasn't awful either. The co-stars, Matthew Goode and Keira Knightley do their job and really bring out the performance in each other. Matthew Goode has the natural swagger of Hugh Alexander, while Keira Knightley portrays a sense of non-belonging as a woman of science in the 40s.The narrative set at hand is rather dull at first glance. It's a story about scientists - and the movie doesn't sell anything more than that. They aren't in an active war zone, and you won't see fighting as other movies may portray. But they build their own suspense worthy of even the best action movies. The race against time, multiple personalities and great minds clashing in pursuit of a common goal. That's what makes this movie so suspenseful at every waking moment.The Imitation Game captures every aspect of what makes a movie like this good. They overlap multiple engaging characters with complex and trivial storylines that even at some times, don't make sense to the watcher until further explained. That's a common theme in this movie. I've never watched a movie that I've felt so emotionally attached to until I watched this movie.All in all, the movie is worth a watch. While the history genre remains niche and may not be for everyone, I've personally always been a sucker for \"based on true stories\" movies. It's a movie that even if you don't enjoy, will leave you with a feeling of empathy for Alan Turing.",

I rated Turner as a 9 out of 10 because it was, as a film, a masterpiece. It was not though a \"crowd pleaser\" i.e. full of romance, humour etc. Imitation Games by contrast is a \"crowd pleaser\" - and more on the humour in a moment. It is not a masterpiece partly because of this but mainly because it singularly failed to convey the atmosphere of those times without descending into farce. You only had to listen to the constant laughter in the cinema to realise that the director's attempts to make a dumbed-down crowd-pleaser had worked, but to the great detriment of the film. I guess he was concerned that cryptography would be dull, whereas in fact the way he explained all of that was very good and the farce elements were thus unnecessary. I have to admit that I have studied the Enigma machine and been to Bletchley as well as studying the history and current uses of cryptography so I come at this with a fair knowledge of what the film was about and of Turing himself. The story itself was reasonably accurately told and the audience have not been misled. Turing's team were sadly misrepresented by abysmal miscasting. To use Allen Leech from Downton Abbey was a bizarre decision particularly (crown-pleasing again perhaps) because he acted and spoke exactly the same is he does in that popular TV show which causes great confusion - why is Tom in this film you brain asks you! Matthew Goode was also totally out of place in every respect. In absolute contrast, that fine actor Rory Kinnear was totally believable as the detective - if he can use a Manchester accent, why cannot Leech use a different accent? Inexcuseable. But, in contrast to these failings, Cumberbatch made the part his own. Extrordinary acting of the highest calibre. There was no confusion between Turing and Sherlock. Without Cumberbatch, this film would sink but with him, it becomes a very good film indeed despite it's other problems. Other actors that turned-in fine performances included Charles Dance and surprisingly Keira Knightley. Oscar Faura's normally excellent photography was something of a disappointment - nothing wrong with it, but lacking in any sort of commitment (a real contrast to Dick Pope's in Turner). There was quite a bit of CGI used to represent scenes of devastation caused by bombing, and these were simple dreadful, lacking any realism at all - presumably they ran out of budget. Using digital instead of film might have helped here! Faura should see Pope's work on Turner to see how much better digital can be and at much less cost.Now, I said I would come on to humour. We used to laugh at stammering, at people with deformities, at people of short stature. They were set-up by directors for laughs. Thank goodness, we have all moved on from that. I say all, because Morten Tyldum has clearly not done so and believes that making laughs from people's conditions is just fine. Alan Turing's tendency to be severely logical - beyond the point of social survival - may in the end be what killed him. This can appear as a symptom of Asperger's Syndrome - a form of autism claimed to be associated with mathematicians and computer scientists. Henry O'Connell and Michael Fitzgerald suggest this might be the diagnosis warranted for Turing, in a paper published in the 'Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine'. So, Tyldum thinks it is fine to mock and encourage his audience to laugh at someone who had a condition - one that probably caused him to take his own life. Unfortunately Tyldum's lack of thought and lack of sensitivity runs right through this film from the casting, the cinematography, the dreadful CGI and ultimately the cheap crowd-pleasing. A shame that Cumberbatch could not have influenced Tyldum but clearly he did not not. All this aside, it's a good film to see - especially if you are one of the diminishing number who don't know about Turing already. If you see Cumberbatch you will have seen Turing. I hope you understand him, value his genius and that you don't laugh at him.",

The casting of Cumberbatch was perfect, as he manages to portray both the genius with social difficulties and the emotional, misunderstood outcast. The conflicting emotions in some of the scenes feels genuine, and he especially nails some of the more challenging scenes near the end.My problem with this film, however, is the (oscar winning) story. The people above Turing in the chain of command, like the character played by Charles Dance, are so one dimensional and villain-like that they completely pull you out of the movie's realism. There are other moments too (they are running of time! the police are circling in on him!) that feels exaggerated, due to this being a movie and all. And while I am not saying that a movie ought to be 100% accurate, I wish that it would try to be a bit more realistic.",

Now I realise that a certain echelon of society in these days prized the stiff upper lip but mr cumberpatch plays the buttoned down mathematical genius so devoid of anything approaching emotion that the interest drains from chunks of the film like water down a plughole. Unfortunately it's a style of performance that he is beginning to produce time and again and I begin to wonder whether he actually has much range. Three quarters of the way through I began thinking about the performance produced by 'I, Claudius' star, Derek Jacobi and wishing it was him I was watching.

The movie is drawing three groups of viewers with their own agenda: WWII enthusiasts, computer nerds and the pro gay rights crowd. Towards the end of the movie, Turing asks, \"Am I a machine? Am I a human? Am I a war hero? Or am I a criminal?\" As the movie answer is \"yes\", we have many facets to view the movie on. We are entrenched with the homeland and the WWII wartime results are quickly reviewed to layer the results of the groups work, Check, The secrecy of Turings' sexuality and the world (puzzle) he places conceals himself in are also layered well physically and emotionally, check. The machine question is forced, as is the movie title, made to honor a paper he wrote, but was not brought into the story as plot, but for reference. If we are lured in by \"The Turing Test\" as I was from Ex Machina, I felt the story could be stronger if the connection was made between cryptology, the birth of computer thought and Turings' personal challenges. I have no problem with the bio aspect of flashback for story line here, much like La Vie En Rose and thought it quite succinct and appropriate. Our hero never gets recognition in his lifetime and are shown how we can honor people through the repeated line about people outside of our purview being capable of doing unimaginable things. Quite inspirational on that end.",

Unfortunately, there is almost no mention of Polish mathematicians who provided French and British Intelligence with all their documentation on cracking Enigma, plus \"home-made\" enigma machines. Let's see what really happened...German military texts enciphered on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932. This success was a result of efforts by three Polish cryptologists, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki and Henryk Zygalski, working for Polish military intelligence. Rejewski \"reverse-engineered\" the device, using theoretical mathematics and material supplied by French military intelligence. Subsequently the three mathematicians designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma ciphers, including the cryptologic bomb. From 1938 onwards, additional complexity was repeatedly added to the Enigma machines, making decryption more difficult and necessitating larger numbers of equipment and personnel\u2014more than the Poles could readily produce.On 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Poles initiated French and British military intelligence representatives into their Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment, including Zygalski sheets and the cryptologic bomb, and promised each delegation a Polish- reconstructed Enigma. The demonstration represented a vital basis for the later British continuation and effort.During the war, British cryptologists decrypted a vast number of messages enciphered on Enigma. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed \"Ultra\" by the British, was a substantial aid to the Allied war effort. So for purely entertaining value 9/10 but historical accuracy 3/10",

This is a very inspiring and touching piece of art that cover a wide array of themes without ever feeling, not for even one second, as it is banging you on the head with self importance.Even if is a given by now and I can't really say anything that has not been said before by others, I have to address the brilliance of Benedict Cumberbatch. This is a fantastic performance by an actor of majestycal brilliance. He takes on a role of immense complexity and covers every aspect brilliantly, he brings to the table so many little things that successfully manage to make the character grounded, flawed and believable, while in the grand scale he is perfectly balanced and never goes for an exaggeration of emotions that could have made the performance collapse tonally. Furthermore he is not doing that thing that many do of \"look-at-me-I'm-an-actor\", which elevates the whole drama even more. Besides him we have a very solid cast that does the best with the space it is given. The movie also shines for its great screenplay, which brings together this amazing story in a very tight way. It is incredible how the film manages to cover all of the themes it has, all of the drama involved, the character study, the look at life during war and the moral discussion all without ever feeling its pushing something on you. All of it is so absorbing and touching exactly because it is so fluently calm. I really had a great emotional response to every element and actually shed some tears. Bravo to the director and all of his collaborators, specifically the DP and the editor for never doing things in an eccentric way, it really contributed in bringing a great experience where I forgot at times I was in a theater watching a movie, I felt in the room with Alan Turing and his colleagues.Yet \"The Imitation Game\" has a couple of stumbles that aren't very big, but were very frustrating because with its undeniable charm the movie managed to suck you in incredibly easily, five minutes in I knew I was going to really like the movie and it made me want to like it, but these missteps it made, even if small were bothering. Firstly it has a very uneven first act, that continues to shift around and doesn't make you follow the movie as you wish you were. Moreover the whole concept of Enigma is never explained clearly, and whilst this is clearly not the focus of the story and you can guess a good part of it, I never understood what was going on 100% and I wish i could have totally understood what the characters were talking about at times.My suggestion?

The story, hidden for almost 30 years, is by now familiar\u2014Alan Turing, the brilliant but eccentric Oxford student admitted to Bletchley Park's code-breaking team, figures out how to decrypt messages generated by the Nazis' super-secret Enigma machine, shortening WWII by two years, and, oh, by the way, inventing computers in the process. Last month Andrew Hodges, author of the book the movie's based on, was appeared locally for a talk\u2014a bit dazed about this great success 30 years post-publication\u2014and his insights (summarized at vweisfeld.com/?p=3781) were, frankly, helpful. He powerfully described the homophobia that pervaded the British intelligence services (and society in general) in the 1950's that made Turing a target. Also the greater significance of the apples, alluded to only glancingly in the movie and without context. Turing was fascinated with the Snow White story, and saying more drifts into spoiler territory. I earnestly hope someone said to him what Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) says near the end of this film. Clarke responds to Turing's lifelong struggle with being different from other boys and men, and says how he \"saved millions of lives by never fitting in,\" as Tom Long put it in The Detroit News. Or, \"Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine,\" says the movie's tagline. There's a little too much standing in front of the marvelous prop constructed for the movie, which the producer says is like the original Turing machine, just not in a box, so you can see the works. The secondary characters are thinly developed and no doubt worthy of greater interest. However, the scenes of Turing as a young boy (Alex Lawther), trying to come to terms with his differentness, are heartbreaking. I agree with the other reviewers who've commented on the unnecessary departures from real life, but, this is the movies. They cannot help themselves. Add a dubious romance? a phony betrayal?

Turing is portrayed as an autistic person, unable to work with a team and unable to have social relations. So of course a big part of the story is how he creates a relation with his team and future (ex) wife. Needless to say there are elements of betrayal. Such as Turing ending his relationship because he is gay. Sarcificing soldiers in order to protect their decoding success. And of course the spy who leaks to the Russians. All these parts are rushed and don't add to the story, partially because of historical inaccuracies.The reason why that doesn't bother the movie, and why I still rate it an 8 is for the simple fact that Benedict Cumberbatch is nothing short of brilliant. Rarely have I seen anyone playing such complex emotion in a person who is unable to emotionally connect. Cumberbatch acts with his body language, words, voice, eyes, stutter, and with compelling silences.

Although the three time and space switch back and forth, but the plots do not contradict each other, but instead take care of each other, the connection is very perfect. The movie begins with a mysterious monologue in the interrogation room, \"Are you paying attention to listening\" \"If you don't listen carefully, it's easy to miss something\" \"I won't say the second time\" plus Juan Fu gloomy 'S voice, the soundtrack full of suspense colors, gave the audience a strong sense of anticipation, and this mysterious beginning certainly has a perfect correspondence with the ending.The characterization of the characters is also quite in place. Turing's game with the general during the interview for the secret position allowed us to see that although Turing spoke a little strangely, he was clever and courageous, and then gradually told the audience that Turing was a bit through the scene of the car accident between him and his partner. The out-and-out \"weird man\", his own way, no one in his eyes, confusing words and deeds ... In short, in the eyes of others, it is a nasty ghost who is difficult to get along with. The story slowly reversed, gradually telling us why Turing is Turing. This process also caused people to have compassion for him. Later, the appearance of the heroine helped him get along with his partners, and it made people discover that Turing was not an annoying person, but he also liked some places. The setting of the heroine made the character characterize And the development of the plot is more reasonable. All in all, when portraying the image and character of a character, it is not only vivid, but also the reasons for the character.There are many profound topics in the film, the theme is divided into two, one is to reveal the cruelty of the war bit by bit through the process of a group of geniuses to crack the German intelligence, and trigger the audience to think about the war. When the password is deciphered, the brother of a partner will be sacrificed and the whole movie will be sublimated there, which has a profound philosophical significance. Another theme is the autobiographical narration of geniuses. \"The greater the power, the greater the responsibility.\" Although this is said, but the glorious surface you see is easy to make you take for granted, but you don't know the cruelty behind the characters. Growth process. These two themes also lead to branch topics such as campus bullying, sexism, and injustice suffered by homosexuals.

            "content": "A stunning recreation of undoubtedly the most crucial secret the British kept during, and for 50 years after, the 2nd World War, that of the breaking of the German's highly technical Enigma code machine. Whilst this film lacks some historical accuracy, nonetheless it recreates the flavour of the massive contribution Cambridge University mathematician Alan Turing made to the code breaking efforts centred at Bletchley Park just north of London. It also handles sensitively the matter of his homosexuality, portraying the injustice meted out to him under then current British law.Understandably it garnered a swag of Oscar nominations winning the Best Screenplay award. The movie is scaffolded by a string of fantastic performances first off, by all reports from Turing's family, the most accurate depiction of Turing from Benedict Cumberpatch matched by Keira Knightly playing his fianc\u00e9 Joan Clarke. Turing's most prominent assistant, with whom there had been much initial tension, Hugh Alexander is superbly played by Matthew Goode and Turing's boss at MI6 Stewart Menzies is played by a flamboyant and sinister Mark Strong.The genesis of Turing's personality and predilection is fantastically covered in a series of flashbacks to critical events during his high school education at noted English elite boarding school Sherborne School with a very quietly intense performance by then 16 year old Alex Lawther.The movie creates such a gradual crescendo of drama as the team and the code breaking machine close in on the ultimate prize, that 2 hours flies by. The movie seamlessly weaves in the moral dilemmas inherent in how to best use the intelligence, the unprecedented secrecy enacted to protect what was code named Ultra, the story of Turing's homosexuality and the supremely vital role Ultra played in winning WW2. One of my all time favourite movies!",

The Imitation Game was vibrant and lively, engaging its audiences on three levels: The fascinating way the Nazis managed to outsmart the rest of the world until Turing came along, how his giant computer worked, and what happened to him in the end, when the truth about him was finally revealed. However, the movie had been criticized for inaccuracy, and historians claimed that Turing wasn't a socially awkward, fragile man as depicted in the movie, but rather a brave and courageous man. But still, I enjoyed the movie because it held the interest of the audience through several dramatic qualities. The lead actor and actress Benedict Cumberbatch, and Keira Knightley, did a fine job, even though he was perhaps too well fixed in the minds of the audience now as another peculiar genius, Sherlock Holmes. 87/100",

Having said that the side artists could have brought further colors to the film, which they just about achieved. The script seemed a bit into digression once or twice, but those are nominal flaw, not even worth a mention.The selective recollection adds to the artistry, but somewhere down the lane, the film seems to miss out on two counts: the detailing on the war, its effect on Britain in a little more explicit manner and the technicalities of Turing's work, when you make a film on the father of artificial intelligence, it better show his work and life a bit more.Having said that to compress a life as that of Alan Turing within two hours would obviously leave some stuffs outThe timely episodes of comic relief were delicate and poised. What also struck me was the usage of language, the precision and accuracy was overwhelming.The movie is has elements a bit too mainstream to bag an Oscar but nevertheless a brave and worthy attempt on refined entertainment.",

            "content": "My wife and I really enjoyed the movie. Unfortunately, too many people including most of the reviewers here forget that it is normal for movies about historical events to be stylized and distorted.The good is that it shines light on an important historical figure and pioneer in computer technology. Alan Turing made important contributions to the allied effort in WWII. According to Winston Churchill the efforts of Turing and his associates at Bletchley Park shortened the war by years. Although in the United States most people are not that familiar with Mr. Turing's efforts, he is a well known figure in Great Britain and several portrayals of him have been made on British television. The accolades and positive attention have been well deserved.The bad is that much of the movie is based on events that never happened and portrays individuals in ways that are not accurate. Just a few examples: Mr. Turing is portrayed as some sort of arrogant reclusive introvert who had a lot of difficulties with his interpersonal relationships. In fact those who knew him best say was a sociable person who although he was not flamboyant got along with just about everyone. He was also very close to his family and nieces which is not portrayed in the movie at all.A dramatic scene in the movie claims Mr. Turing decided how to use the information decoded at Bletchley Park and that he was responsible for deciding who lived and died. This is almost laughable. In fact Mr. Turing and his associates had no known input as to how the information that they provided was used.The movie portrays a break-in at his apartment as being reported by a neighbor, when in real life Mr. Turing was the one who contacted the authorities. It also has him telling a police officer that he just met all sorts of details about his top secret work... which is also very unrealistic.Then they imply that the drugs he was required to take to reduce his testosterone levels made it impossible for him to continue his work and caused him to commit suicide. In fact at the time of his death he had been off of the drugs for over a year. His friends, family, and secretary all claim that he had little if any perceived difficulties with the drugs and that at the time of his death he did not appear to be depressed and unable to work and his social and professional calendar was full.In real life his death came as a shock to his family, friends and co-workers. Many questioned that his death by cyanide poisoning was a suicide. His mother, who he was very close to thought that it might have been accidental through his poor laboratory hygiene. At the time many thought that there may have been some sort of malevolence involved.There are numerous other inaccuracies... but my wife and I really did enjoy the movie and highly recommend it. Just remember that movies based on actual historical events generally take a lot of artistic license. Go see it and then read up on the actual historical events and about the real Alan Turing... to us the real story is every bit as inspiring as the Movie version.",

What makes it an even better movie is that it is based on a true story, the story of Alan Turing. He was a mathematician/scientist who studied the enigma code during the second world war. The actor who played Alan Turing was Benedict Cumberbatch, and I think that he played Alan Turing great, he really made the impression of watching Alan Turing. The combination of drama and war always works out in these kinds of movies. Almost all of the war movies, especially world war ll movies, have some kind of drama in them to make it more interesting to look at. The movie had a really good beginning and ending. Why this movie made it special to me was that the movie didn't have a lot of action (which I like) but the movie was more fitting and better without action even though it was a story about the World War ll. The ending of the movie was really special. And the same thing happened in the real life of Alan Turing. The movie had a lot of details and feelings, which made the movie really good. I would rate this movie a 7 out of 10 because of all the details and how good the acting and the plot was.",

The period detail is convincing and tech aspects of the film are top notch - all very well done by director Morten Tyldum, making his first English language film. There are some dramatic liberties of course, most of which work fine on screen - a major exception being a scene involving a member of Turing's team dramatically pleading for his brother's life on-board a naval vessel. Cumberbatch does a decent enough job as Turing and while he is committed to the role, when the man is stressed - Cumberbatch does some phony tics and speech mannerisms that come across as acting with a capital A. Knightley and Goode make the most of their roles and Dance does what he can with his one note and mostly antagonist role. The film can detour into drivel occasionally, especially when Turing's colleagues threaten to quit over his dismissal - but more often than not, The Imitation Game is serviceable entertainment and does enough justice to a great story and a great man.",

One thing I did not like was how the whole story turned so quickly on the subject that Alan was gay. They did it so abruptly. They could have started the story with us knowing, because in the end the whole story is about how he was gay and how he changed the world even though people hated gays.

Alan Turing found a chemistry with her, being able to talk to her the most than the other interns, but not in a romantic way. To make long story short, The British finally won the war because of the help of \"Christopher\" and in the end, they were asked to destroy it.Indeed Benedict Cumberbatch did a stunning performance playing an anti- social and odd prodigy in the film. Keira Knightley's appearance as a supporting artist was also quite well. The Imitation Game is a biography film that is able to capture its audience in such a perfect pace. It has the capability to make audience to feel it is just a mere movie, rather than a history-biography movie.Although there are some conversations I didn't agree to be very interesting, but overall it is a story that changes your perspective to see the \"odd\" ones.

It is intriguing, but it is simultaneously pretty formulaic - I am not sure it really deserved its win for Best Adapted Screenplay, but I didn't hate the film.At the soul of the movie we have a great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch, though at first he seems to borrow from his Sherlock persona in order to come across as a jerk or misunderstood man whom nobody likes. We also learn through flashbacks that he is weak- willed since he was bullied as a child, he doesn't believe in violence due to this, and that he is gay, and was fond of a childhood friend of his. Some of these flashbacks really depict Turin's back story, but some seem unnecessary to be honest.Back to Cumberbatch's performance, he depicts being misunderstood and weak-willed very well, but towards the conclusion of this film when he is struggling with hormonal therapy it seems like a bit of a stretch. In fact, he seems to be at his best and his worst when he shows an obsessive attachment to Christopher (an obvious metaphor) before the last minutes of the movie.The film is filled with cheesy situations/moments which brings its Oscar potential down and makes it much less of an adult film than it could have been. The scene where Mark Strong says he has known about the spy all along, the scene with one of Turin's crew saying his brother was on a ship, the caption at the end that reads \"today they are called computers...\"This film still intrigued me though it was formulaic. I am fine with cinema depicting homosexuality as a struggle in films like Brokeback Mountain or Milk, but even though it was a main point in this film the scenes reflecting on Turin's homosexuality (minus some good flashbacks) seemed to be over-dramatized.",

            "content": "First off, let me address the elephant in the room, for the people who scored this movie based on its absolute historical accuracy. shame on you. Yes, there is some artistic license involved, but if movies are scored on how closely they followed a story, and/or historical event, well, The last Hobbit movie would get 2/10, and \"Where Eagles Dare\", would get 0/10. You're here to remark on, and review the movie, not score it for accuracy. This is a story based around Alan Turing, who headed up the team during the war, to decode the German enigma machine. It follows the story \"loosely\", and has some events changed, to make the story fit into the time frame, and to change the pace of the story for the silver screen. The palette of emotions delivered by the actors involved, is nothing short of stunning, Cumberbatch as the quirky, almost autistic genius is fantastic, and manages to portray a character with a complete lack of social skills, that strangely enough, is extremely easy to warm to, and to empathise with, The other cast members, namely Keira Knightley, Mark Strong, and Charles dance carry off some great performances with a wonderful stoicism and British \"stiff upper lip\", that makes their sometimes cold characters, absolutely compelling to watch. The script is marvelous, and hand in hand with some great editing, the movie hits the ground running, with a frenetic pace, that's akin to a big budget action movie. The soundtrack and locations are also well above par, and just adds to the other great components, to make a great story. Cumberbatch steals the show, with the script/movie twisting around his genius, and his moral dilemmas, and social attitudes of the time, which woven into the story by some of the UK's best talent, means that you really cant take your eyes of the screen.Do yourself a favour, and go see this, its one of the rare gems in cinema nowadays, a story that is gripping, compelling, emotional, and doesn't rely on eye candy and CGI to blow your mind.If this doesn't win an academy award, then there really is no justice.",

Based on the life of genius British mathematician Alan Turing, and the best-selling book of the same name, \"The Imitation Game\" is for me the best movie of the year. Even though it would've been fully justified to do so, it doesn't pretend to be a movie that gives you an inferiority complex for not having a Physics or a Maths degree, and that's where it beats Interstellar. The director managed to pull off a story that deals with solving arguably the most complex mathematical problem of the 20th century without giving you a headache. Hats off to Benedict Cumberbatch for his outstanding portrayal of Turing as a tormented genius, hiding what used to be a shameful secret in that era - homosexuality, introvert, bullied and terribly unsocial but uncharacteristically defiant and arrogant when it came to his work. The supporting cast also never let him down. On the flip side, it does get a little clich\u00e9 at times - not all geeks have to have the same mannerisms like Sheldon Cooper, not understanding colloquial language and not looking at people when talking, but that doesn't take much away from the movie. There're also historical goofs but then, if you care so much about facts, you probably should stick with the History channel.Go see how a man sacrificed everything to save 14 million lives and the World didn't know it for 50 years! What he created, the \"Turing Machine\" is better known by another name today; we call them computers!",

However, The Imitation Game blows everything else out of the water. I am even inclined to say that it comes close to IMDb's all-time favourite, \"The Shawshank Redemption\".Benedict Cumberbatch is fast becoming a world-class actor. He plays Alan Turing, the computer scientist who broke the German code during WW2 with his invention of what was essentially the world's first computer. The nuances, the way he speaks and behaves are just so impeccably done, one has to watch the film to believe it. It tells the amazing yet tragic story of Alan Turing who made the most important contribution that won Britain and her allies the war but was persecuted for being homosexual which was a crime at the time. Kiera Knightley I thought was excellent as Joan Clarke, one of her best performances to date. She was eccentric in a very endearing way and you could see how much Alan enjoyed her company. The scene at the end where she visited Alan in his home was very poignant and brought a tear to my eye. It is a very \"British\" film, has been very thoroughly researched and shot beautifully.If there is one film this year that you decide to watch, go and see The Imitation Game. It will leave a lasting impression on you and should be on everyone's to-watch list in their lifetime.Simply magnificent.",

            "content": "Based on a true story, \"The Imitation Game\" tells the story of Alan Turing. A man bent on decrypting a secret Nazi code known only as \"The Enigma Machine\". He would eventually become the man responsible for fathering Turing Machines, or today, we call them computers. \"The Imitation Game\" ends up being one of the most emotionally drawing and best told stories of any movie I've seen.\"The Imitation Game\" is one of the few films that I can call absolutely flawless. I constantly try to observe movies for what they do right and what they do wrong. Sometimes it improves the experience, sometimes it hurts it. I tend to try to immerse myself in the world to get a better feeling of what I am watching. During this movie, my immersion brought me one of the most emotional experiences that I have witnessed from a movie. I found myself interested 100% of the time, and could get a taste of the emotion that truly went into this film. I was laughing, I was feeling remorse, and there were moments where I was actually tearing up. The only other movie I have watched that made my physically shed tears was \"Marley and Me\", meaning that this film tries it's best to make your heart wrench. And it's one of the greatest feelings for a critic such as myself to experience. To feel actually emotion towards a film, to sit there in your seat and say to yourself \"Oh my god.\" It goes to show that the movie was made with care, and that it was done perfectly.Now if you are a fan of comedy, then this movie also has its fair share of laughs. Ranging from intriguing and creative humor, to moments where a character is standing there awkwardly while others stare at him like \"What the hell did he just say?\" The movie has a great balance between \"Oh, man! Drama!\" and \"LOL!\" Which is always a wonderful thing to have. Trying to balance multiple emotions in a film can be a tough thing to do, and this movie did it perfectly.One did get an interesting feeling throughout this movie though. I felt like this movie took a lot of what the BBC can throw at you. Benedict Cumberbatch (as Alan Turing) had a very similar personality to Sherlock Holmes (also Benedict Cumberbatch) in the BBC series \"Sherlock\". But the depiction of Alan Turing also felt similar to the depiction of Vincent Van Gogh in series 5 of the popular BBC series \"Doctor Who\". As well as other series' from the BBC. It felt like a strongly created experience with content that I'm very familiar with, and I loved that. And even if I wasn't familiar with that sort of content, I still would have loved it!\"The Imitation Game\" is no doubt one of the greatest movies I have seen. It's the most emotionally jerking film I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The entire time I was watching, I was completely absorbed in the experience. \"The Imitation Game\", honestly, had nothing wrong with it. The plot was great, the characters were PERFECTLY casted, it never ceased to keep me intrigued and amazed. It is easily one of the best film experiences I have had in my entire life. This movie is not something to miss. And if you do miss it, I pity you.Final Review Score: 10/10",

It is a compelling story, as not only did Turing attain outstanding achievements during times of great tumult, but on a personal level, his life illustrates how the bigotry of a nation can rob it of its national treasures.On the cinematic front, THE IMITATION GAME delivers a flawless experience. Everything hangs together as well as it possibly could: the cinematography, the narrative structure, the acting, and so on. There is really not much more to say other than as a dramatic movie, it completely succeeds.On the biographical front, however, the film is a huge disappointment. One may grant artistic license to cinematic retellings of the life stories of real people, but I feel the film-makers went way beyond what is reasonable here.First, there are numerous misrepresentations of his work: the contributions of the Polish codebreakers to breaking Enigma is ignored; he did his most important codebreaking work in 1939, when World War 2 was just getting started, and, most egregiously (in my view), even though the very title of the film refers to his greatest scientific contribution, it is treated in the film almost as an afterthought, a framing device for his \"real\" achievement, basically espionage work.Second, the man is misrepresented in the service of perpetuating the stereotype of the standoffish a-hole genius who is concerned with nothing but his work. My understanding is that Alan Turing as a person was nothing like the character portrayed in the film, and if that is really true, then there is really not much more to say that, as a biographical account of his life, it completely fails.I still gave the movie a high rating because it is undeniable that it tells a good story exceptionally well.Too bad the story is fake.",

Other than that the story manged to be touching the way it was told, although it included the theme of homosexuality with which I'm not completely comfortable. In addition, it managed to be exciting, without any action. Definitely Benedict Cumberbatch performed greatly in the role of Alan Turing.I might confront this movie's magnitude with \"The king's speech\". It's so similar in themes that it almost feels a sequel to said movie. To sum up, The Imitation Game isn't a really bad movie, but not a so-excellent movie. It's averagely good.",

A movie that anyone interested in war-time-history ought to see. And ought to see not only once, but twice and maybe even three times.When that is stated, it does have serious flaw. Alan Turing's creation of \"Christopher\" - the machine that was used to break the Enigma Code, did so because he was an incredibly good mathematician, a sincere genius with mental connections that most of will never have.He didn't however, manage to create this machine because he was a homosexual. And that is the explicit message I get, after watching this film. When that is said, I don't think that homosexuals are in any way worse that any other of us, nor are they less worth. But their sexual preferences doesn't produce intelligence or genius. Their sexual choices merely makes them different.I've had several friends through the years that have chosen a homosexual life-style. One of them committed suicide, sorry to say. He was an overtly creative human being. And as said above, neither less or more worth than any of us. Just a human being - like us, struggling with his demons.When will people start raising homosexuals to something it is not? Don't they realize that they by this makes more problem for those that suffer from it, just as The Imitation Game actually will cause problems for an unknown number of homosexuals.Because of this, I cannot give more than 7. The movie was destroyed by its own propaganda. That's sad.",

It kept the viewers' attention from beginning to end always wondering what's going to happen next in his life. This also wouldn't be possible without a cast of actors to portray the real-life people. All of the actors in this movie did amazing jobs portraying these real-life people and making you feel like a fly on the wall throughout this story. Benedict Cumberbatch plays this guy with so much passion and honesty that you easily can relate to this guy and feel for him. Alan Turing's story is a sad and tragic one and Benedict helps bring the audience into this man's struggles and will have you at least misty-eyed by the end. All of the side actors as well were great especially Keira Knightly, who plays Joan Clarke. Graham Moore had the hard job of taking Andrew Hodges's book and turning it into a screenplay and he did a great job. The dialogue in this movie is so natural and comes across as conversations people would actually have. Especially, with his writing for Alan and his anxiety and bringing authenticity to it. Benedict gives a great monologue that if I were still in theatre I would love to perform. The cinematography in this movie is gorgeous just like the score in this movie.

The writing, the writing is extremely well done and keeps you engaged and wondering throughout. This writing evel works well in the form of narration which most films tend to stay away from because they fear they will do it poorly (unlike this one). This leads into the other thing being the man himself Benedict Cumberbatch. The cast is good and well acted; Benedict steals the show (as he should). He absolutely accels at playing an anti-social awkward super genius, similar to his role of Sherlock in the hit show 'Sherlock'. However what is different from his role in Sherlock is how he portrays himself here. He has crafted the perfect character here that feels very far off from Benedict himself. Beautiful acting and writing overall (and the cinematography is pretty good too).",

So why is there a film being made about him and given that there has been so many war films this year, what makes this one different? I suppose the reel question is, will this be an Enigma we can't break? The Second World War, the period in history where we look back and always feel both pride and regret. Pride that ordinary people stood up to an evil tyrant and regret because so many had to give their lives for our freedom. That's how Imitation Game makes you feel, both proud and hurt. The film has a 3 way split in narrative structure, all revolving around its main character Alan Turning. We are given the Past, present and future almost, with one strand being told as Alan when he was still in boarding school and he is first developing a love for cryptography (the past), the second is picking up with him at the point when he is entering into the war effort employed to decrypt the enigma coding (the present), and then via an interview and subsequent investigation on Turning for indecency after his service was terminated (the future). This kind of blending could have been a catastrophe for the movie and completely ripped the rhythm out of the film itself, it could have taken away any level of mood or tension put in the wrong hands, but the hands that The Imitation Game is placed in is Morten Tyldum, and he is a master of suspense. I implore you if you enjoyed The Imitation Game please watch his previous work Headhunters.I think that there is a twist in the film (which I am going to reveal now as to what I can piece together it's common knowledge anyway), Alan Turning was gay. Now, for me that isn't where the impact of the movie stood, nor was it in the moment when he finally cracks the enigma code (that's not a spoiler, it's a true story, and we won the war, mostly because we cracked the enigma code), no the true power of this film is in it's 3rd act in \"the present\" when Turning reveals what he has to do to keep the fact that he had broken the code a secret.Alan Turning the man is presented as a broken and lonely human, who has no social skills at all and can barely function without a riddle to solve (So really a lot like Sherlock Holmes then). But it seems the film unfortunately has a hidden agenda, The Imitation Game is a strong work it's true, but it seems to be more concerned that Alan was gay than any other aspect of his life, this is a terrible shame because I think it ultimately sits awkwardly along side the rest of the film, which for the majority of the time is outstanding.The Imitation Games is an exceptional portrayal of a different side to the Great War. It is focused and concise, this is how a film with a message should be made.",

Benedict Cumberbatch definitely deserves an Oscar nod for lead actor and he did great! Keira Knightly should probably get a supporting actress nod too.

I'm going to give a little away, but it's not like it's a big spoiler. There are some homosexual themes in the film I was not a fan of. Simply put. Nothing content-wise, just themes.-Speaking of content The Imitation Game is rated PG-13 for its themes, some mild-medium language, and a sexual reference.-The Imitation Game is technically great.

It was nothing of the sort! This was the type of film where you had to actually pay attention, as Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) explains as he narrates in the beginning of the film. I'm not going to say it's one of those films where you have to do a ton thinking, some of the kind I like, but it would help a bit. Like \"A Beautiful Mind\" this film was dealing with mathematicians, who in this case was trying to break the German Enigma Code. Now of course films dealing with things like that is going to have some suspense and drama but this film was perfect with it. Not only did Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) have to deal with breaking the Enigma Code he had to deal with other issues in his personal life which made things even more complicated. This film did bring on some memories of other films I've seen. If you liked \"A Beautiful Mind\" and \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" you would probably like this film too because it was like a mixture of the two. In fact, it was like Mark Strong, who played Stewart Menzies in this film, was almost playing the same character he played in \"Kingsman\". When Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) appeared in this film I thought it was going to be one of those clich\u00e9 things in films where the girl \"surprisingly\" out smarts everyone and saves the day, but it wasn't like that. Her role in this film played a huge part in the relationship between her and Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch). This was definitely a great film.

The movie certainly demands the viewer's attention, starting off with a scene of Benedict Cumberbatch subtly breaking the fourth wall by asking the police investigator for his attention, which can also be seen as asking the viewer for his/her attention.I am fully aware that the movie is not historically accurate \u2013 it wasn't made to be. Therefore, I review this movie as if it were never based on a true story.The movie jumps between flashbacks and the present (1950s) to portray Alan Turing's life, instead of telling it all in a linear fashion. To have three different time periods running together in one movie was very effective and coupled with the pace of the film, it was much more so. Kudos to the art department for making the scenes from each time period convincing and different enough from the others to let the viewer differentiate between time periods. I liked how things slowly but surely clicked between the flashbacks as the movie went on, like the reason why Turing had named his machine \"Christopher\".Benedict Cumberbatch pulls off his role as Turing extremely well. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised since he acts as a super-intelligent sociopath in Sherlock as well, which is basically what the movie portrays Turing to be (without the badassery). I must also commend Alex Lawther's acting as Young Turing, especially the scene where he is told of Christopher's death \u2013 a very convincing act. I'll say the same for Keira Knightley's performance as Joan Clarke \u2013 she acts her part like a natural. Yet I must say all the actors did their roles well, and their acting felt human.The tension and suspense created in the film is amazing as well. The few seconds of deafening silence after the machine finally cracks its first code after the build-up was beautiful. The realisation that they cannot save a ship full of civilians though they have the means capable of doing so and the uneasiness of having to make such a decision were both effectively accompanied by silence in the background. The soundtrack in the movie was excellent and supported the film well.I loved the scope of the film's coverage. The scenes of the war going on and the television footage of the war amidst the solving of the Enigma kept the film engaging, instead of leaving the viewer to imagine the scenes of death and destruction by themselves. This was one of the factors that had me squealing in delight on the inside, as I watched submarines launch torpedoes at unsuspecting Allied ships above and German planes bomb cities below. Granted, the special effects in the movie were not fantastic in these scenes, but they were not the focus of the movie.The plot twists were appropriate and unexpected \u2013 I was constantly filled with tension and suspense. Yes, you may say that plot twists are meant to be such, but that is only when they are done right. For instance, Taken 3 didn't even try. Though the final \"plot twist\" in that movie was rather unexpected, it was ridiculous. The Imitation Game does it right. The one main plot of Turing helping to solve the Enigma was accompanied well by many sub-plots. The joy-filled moment when they had finally solved the Enigma does not last and leads to a difficult decision on whether to allow the destruction of a convoy ship; everything ultimately leading to a dark end for Turing.Yes, though based on a true story, the movie does not accurately reflect the true story and is made to be far more dramatic. Indeed, the special effects are rather primitive compared to other movies to date. Yet, The Imitation Game does not fail to impress. It is one of the best spy thrillers I have ever seen to date and leaves viewers with much to think about after leaving the theatre, including a variety of memorable quotes. Go and watch it \u2013 it's worth your money.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game is a good old drama movie so I liked it, not much you get these days for your drama-craving so glad it came out. There is not much to talk about the movie, it's pretty straight forward and of course a good watch, so go for it definitely. The movie has three parallels: pre world war II, world war II and post the same. The scientist's role in, and his discovery during the world war is the main plot, pre world war scenes certainly adds beauty to it whereas post world war story feels rather intrusive. Even the world war footages, most of them come across a little difficult to blend with the main story and you know it is to fill time and for the feel of world war II, well probably because the fine performance by Benedict Cumberbatch makes you feel disturbed by everything else. What a fine performance by Benedict, the actor knows his character and plays it well throughout the movie. He smiles/angers/cries/walks/runs the way his character should. So yeah everything is good. Keira looked pretty with some flesh on her cheeks which she always needed. A good movie, go and watch!But there is one more thing which makes it a more than just a movie, it's a story of a great scientist, a mathematician and how he falls towards the end of his life. The singularity of his passion and his euphoria towards his work which holds true for any scientist, these movies always get to me. The last 20 minutes of the movie fill you with this immense sorrow you feel for Late Mr Alan Turing, his great mind and work, and for what he got in return. It all becomes just too sad. So yeah watch it :)",

            "content": "Brilliant soundtrack, well edited, well written, well acted, and good pacing to maintain a good level of emotional engagement. Its very watchable and exciting. But there's something deeply frustrating about the decisions behind the screenplay. It clearly focuses on Turing's unfair persecution for being gay - this is the tragic element that we're left with as an audience. Which is absolutely worth a story, for sure. But if that's your angle, then why did they focus on enigma/bombe and miss out so much of his contribution to modern computing? They make out he pretty much worked alone on designing/building/running the bombe (called Christopher in the film) which is just unnecessarily false. I'm still waiting on a decent film or mini-series to portray the incredible events of what happened at Bletchley during the war: it was truly a collaborative effort. Gordon Welchman has just as much input as Turing on the bombe machine, which was first invented by the Poles anyhow, and built by engineers at Letchworth. There were eventually many bombe machines - not just one that Turing seemingly built with his own hands in a hangar-sized 'hut' (the huts were a lot smaller). The whole design/point of the bombe was to exploit a flaw in the enigma, requiring a 'crib' - a known phrase like 'heil hitler' used in the film, which they could match up alongside the cypher to extract patterns. The film delivers this discovery as a eureka moment at the bar, well after Turing has built the bombe! Which makes no sense and is confusing to the viewer as to what the original intentions of the machine actually were. The film implies there was a spy in Turing's team. Really - is this kind of cinematic device really necessary to keep audiences engaged? Was the REAL story not interesting and exciting enough?! When told properly at least. There are far more angles to the story - how so many misfits/outliers were brought together to collaborate on genius ideas, with huge determination and drive. The idea that the seemingly impossible can be achieved. Its a really inspiring moment of history that should surely be pushed more in today's world. Its a great film ciematically, but its annoying how the personal agenda of the book's author and film's screenwriters biased the film away from truth towards one aspect of Turing's life, and in doing so failed to really do either angle as much justice as was deserved. It might have also been fitting to have shown how much sexual abuse happened at Sherborne school when/where Turing attended, which continued well through the 20th century according to well researched documentaries and reports, but I guess that's not quite as pleasing for sunday afternoon cinema audiences.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game is the best attempt yet to tell the story of the WWII code breakers at Bletchley Park but it's not perfect.Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role of Alan Turing, the antisocial but brilliant professor. The story of how he approached the methodical task of code breaking by building a machine (a computer?) from scratch is well-told in this movie, with all the accompanying frustrations, half-successes and eventual euphoria.But elsewhere there are weaknesses. The Imitation Game tries to be a much broader biography of Turing and for instance document the impact his homosexuality had on his life. But while the flashbacks to his boyhood work well, there are virtually no scenes showing the adult Turing's relationship with other men. Instead, the focus is on his relationship with a woman, Joan Clarke, played by Keira Knightley. She is misplaced in this movie. The relationship isn't a very interesting one and there is no chemistry (perhaps deliberately so). Surely there were men in Turing's life that we should have heard more about?The Imitation Game could also have better illustrated the terrible consequences of the actions of the men at Bletchley. There is a fascinating moral tale told here - that in order not to let the Germans find out their code had been broken, the British deliberately failed to act on some of the intelligence received. This made them complicit in the deaths of their own civilians (for 'the greater good') and yet all we see of the consequences of this is a quick clip of a smoking transporter ship. It could have been much grittier.I did enjoy watching The Imitation Game and I still think the Bletchley Park story is quite incredible, but this movie didn't hit all the high notes I'd hoped it would.",

            "content": "I went to see The Imitation Game last week in the most beautiful local film theater, called Tuschinski. This is one of those theaters where every movie comes to it's rights, and so did this film. I will drop some quick things first: Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome, but I believe everyone expected that already. Before I went to see it, I had heard some people saying that his acting was good, but very mechanical. In a way I have to agree with this a little. Here and there, especially in the first half of the film, he is doing quite some things we've seen before in other movies. Nonetheless, he certainly surprised me in the second part, doubtlessly delivering an emotional performance that goes beyond ''mechanics''.Then there is of course Keira Knightley, who received her first Academy Award nomination for her performance in this film. I'd say she deserves it, but honestly I don't see her winning it. At least there is some progress in the career of the actress that was mainly known for English costume dramas and the Pirates films. Having said all this, I have actually dealt with the mayor elements of this film. Meaning that the rest wasn't really that surprising or ''refreshing'' to me. Is that a bad thing? No. Besides, who am I? I'm only trying to emphasize that this film, apart from the performances, wasn't a scratch more or less than I had expected.. and my expectations were normal. Of course I have to mention that biography-typed films are very difficult, especially about characters such as these, resulting in a big pile of movies of which the style looks like that of for example ''A Beautiful Mind'' or ''The King's Speech''. In fact, I have seen many films in the past few years that looked like this one does. The cinematography is normal, so is the overall look of the film. I don't really see why this film got a Oscar\u00ae nomination for screenplay, since many of it seemed very predictable.Before this starts looking like a burn-down, I have to say that this film was clearly made with a lot of love and passion for the story, which is certainly one of the most unbelievable stories of WOII known to us. In order to end this review I would say the following: it will entertain you, it will move you at some points and you will probably remember it as a very good film. Not exceptional, but still very good. 7.5 - 8.0",

And I confess, I'm a Cumberbabe, so I expected to be seduced by Benedict Cumberbatch's heart-warming performance. He brought all his intelligence, dedication and charm to this movie, and didn't disappoint. Keira Knightley was passable too. Critics complain that she was too \"cute\" to play Joan Clarke, who in real life was rather plain, but I could forgive that. She did a good job of shining a sympathetic light on Turing and portraying a brilliant woman, capable of social graces AND advanced mathematics, while struggling with the chauvinist conventions of the time. It wasn't a major theme, but it was a nice nod to feminism and how far we've come today.Charles Dance's Tywin Lannister-esque portrayal of Commander Denniston was enjoyable. Critics complain that his character was too 1-dimensional and not historically accurate, but it was fun to watch. Dance is a master of the withering look! Apparently, Denniston's impatience and ignorance of Turing's genius, was exaggerated to show how MOST military generals of the time would have treated him.Alex Lawther was impressive as the young Alan Turing, especially during the tragic scene where he learns of his friend's death. He played the tortured, bullied, genius boy heart-breakingly well.As for historical inaccuracies and the \"gay rights\" issue? Opinions on this film vary greatly depending on your agenda and expectations. If you're hoping for a truly historically accurate biopic, you'll be disappointed; you'll find anachronisms and gaffes. If you're hoping for a gay-rights campaign movie you'll be disappointed with the lack of focus on Turing's barbaric arrest and punishment after the war. I personally think it handled the \"gay rights\" subject very well, with enough to show how far we've come today, in a relatively short time, and how uncomfortably true it is that homophobia still abounds, even if more undercover these days.Critics seems to have overlooked some of the main, humanist themes of the movie.1. Artificial Intelligence. How do we feel about computers and artificial intelligence? The movie explores some of our conflicting ideas about machines - how they work and how they possibly \"think\" - are they like or not like humans? This is what Turing's life work was about. He created the \"Imitation Game\"- a way of testing the difference between artificial and human intelligence. Computers can calculate, predict and solve problems faster than human brains, but they cannot *be* like humans because they cannot feel love, hatred, etc. Turing, being a brilliant mind himself, and being so tortured in his social life, loved his computer because, unlike his human \"friends\", it did not judge him for being \"different\", it did not bully or betray him. Computers can be controlled and programmed; we can trust them to work for us, without using violence or betrayal.2. Violence. The movie explores this human phenomenon, through the global setting of World War 2 and the personal setting of Turing's life. It delves into why we humans enjoy violence so much. Turing learns (from his childhood bullying) that humans enjoy violence because the reaction to it is satisfying. If there is no reaction to it, it becomes boring: - hence his decision to stop shouting and fighting back during one of the bullying scenes. Turing suffered his own private \"war\" on a personal level, while the world around him waged war and engaged in large-scale violence, over similar aspects of human nature: - the intolerance of \"difference\".3. Intolerance of \"difference\". I love the parallel between Turing's life: - society's intolerance of his homosexuality (and the resulting violence) and the cause behind World War 2: - Hitler's intolerance of Jews and any humans with \"different\" traits to his insane ideals (and the resulting violence on a huge scale). Intolerance of difference was not only aimed at Turing's homosexuality, but also his \"autistic spectrum-like\" characteristics, e.g. social awkwardness, inability to \"get\" jokes or sarcasm, literal-mindedness, unabashed arrogance, etc. Critics complained that his \"spectrumy\" traits were over-exaggerated; that in fact Turing had many friends in real life, and was quite humorous and charming. But, the idea was to emphasize the human intolerance of \"difference\" and how it becomes a real problem of survival, especially in life and death situations and war. Those who can \"fit in\" are more likely to survive attacks, while those who can't, are more likely to be ostracized or even killed.4. Intelligence versus mindlessness. Above all, this movie sings the praises of human intelligence. Turing was a true war hero. Not because he strode forth on the battlefield and wielded physical weapons, but because he defeated the \"Enigma\" machine, with his intelligence, creativity, mathematical genius and his immense dedication and passion. Ironically, he cracked the seemingly unbreakable code, by eventually finding a weakness in it: - a HUMAN weakness. Apparently, he discovered that a German soldier, entering the coded messages, let down his guard a little, by using the name of his girlfriend as a precursor to all his coded messages, rendering his code predictable enough to be cracked. Whether this piece of historical fact is actually true or not, it is a GREAT representation of how human weakness (i.e. sentimentality) becomes humanity's downfall against the totally emotionless intelligence of the computer. AND YET, the movie reminds us that it is *human* intelligence which conquers evil, because it involves creativity, love, passion and DEDICATION. Human intelligence will eventually overcome anything - even the mindless violence of a mass murderer like Hitler and the mindless violence of weapons of war.Some critics have said, \"how can you make intellectual, mathematical work exciting or dramatic on film?\" Well, I think this movie did a fantastic job. While not pleasing everyone, of course, it managed to be a satisfying psychological drama, combined with action, mystery, thriller and human charm.",

            "content": "Disliking a movie due to historical inaccuracies is one thing. If this is your only issue, the movie in question may be fine as a work of fiction, just not as a record of history. But here's the thing. I don't know anything about Turing's personal life, nor about the details of how encryption played into WW2. And yet, based mostly on having a degree Computer Science, I can immediately tell that this isn't how it works. This isn't how any of this works. It's not that the movie fails to tell the true story; it fails to tell a *plausible* story.Here's an example. Turing tries to crack the encryption machine Enigma and builds his own machine to do so. Once started, the machine just keeps running until it cracks the code, without providing intermediate results. If this takes too long, all you can do is stop it manually.But that is just not how it works. No-one does engineering that way. If you write a big piece of code, it's going to have bugs. You have run parts of it and get intermediate results to find the bugs. Even if it's bug-free, there just is no reason not to add something indicating progress. That's not hard to do, and moreover, we see in the movie that Turing didn't know how long his machine would take, so intermediate results would be extremely helpful.\"Alright,\" you say, \"but that's just a detail, and it's not even important to the story.\" Fair enough. Here's a more important case. After the team fails to crack Enigma for a while, some random person in a bar mentions that messages encrypted with Enigma often start the same way because people use recurring phrases to open letters. This provides them with a way to restrict the search space, and they crack Enigma on the same day.Again, this isn't how it works. To elaborate: it certainly is true that knowing things about the plaintext could be extremely helpful, so good job on that. But the fact that no-one in the team figured this out after months of working on the problem is completely asinine. This is basic stuff. Of course the plaintext distribution isn't uniform; messages aren't a random sample of letters, and any capable cryptographer would consider that immediately. This is the kind of the first things you would think about, and I mean that literally. If you made a list of what properties to exploit, that would be one on the top of the list.I've singled out these two points because they're fairly objective, but they're really just a symptom of a bigger problem, which is that the movie evidently doesn't understand cryptography, computability theory, or even basic engineering -- and as a consequence, Turing is not a plausible depiction of a highly intelligent mathematician. He often says that things are too complicated for others to understand, but when he does talk about technical stuff, it's usually pretty basic, and what's worse, it's often off-topic. The ugly truth here is that neither the Turing Machine nor the Turing Test have much of a connection to cryptograhy. The Turing Machine is theoretical model that is capable to perform arbitrary computations given unlimited time, which makes it useful in formal proofs about what is and isn't computable -- where 'computable' always means 'solvable with definite, explicit rules in a finite number of steps'. However, its runtime is comically awful (it requiers thousands of steps to multiply two 2-digit numbers), so it's utterly useless on any practical problem. It's pretty telling if you watch the scene where Turing is asked about his paper; he doesn't say that the machine is the Turing Machine (presumably because that would just be too blatantly false), but he also doesn't make it clear that it's a different things, so you're sort of left with the impression that the two things are connected. They're not. I don't know what the machine did (the movie doesn't tell me), but I can promise you that it has no meaningful relationship to the Turing Machine. It's honestly just really bizarre that the movie hedges so much on that point.And the Turing Test? Well, the Turing Test is a philosophical thought experiment about when AI reaches human-level. (It's probably something that Turing got wrong, too, but that's beside the point.) How is that related to cryptography? Unfortunately, not at all. My guess is that the script writer just wanted to have the Turing Test in there because it's the most famous idea associated with Turing, so they just did it even though it really doesn't make sense. It gets away with it by being very vague, so that all you remember is a bunch of buzz words without anything too concrete to be wrong.On the other hand, the movie doesn't tell you how the Enigma Machine actually works, and that's kind of a shame. I've once had to implement it for my cryptography class as just one exercise on the biweekly exercise sheet -- point being, it's not that complicated. Take three minutes and a nice visualization, and you can explain to normal people what the machine does. Wouldn't that be better than hinting at unrelated topics without ever saying anything concrete? (I notice myself getting more annoyed with this the more I think about it. The only reason not to tell you how Enigma works in a movie about Enigma is that the movie thinks you're too stupid to understand how it works, which is kind of insulting.)Then, there's Turing's personality. Here is where I'm speculating; maybe he was like this. But I honestly doubt it. A lot of people have this streotype in their heads that the smartest mathematicians are the worst about communicating their insights, but I think the opposite is true in most cases. If you understand a subject unusually well, you're also better at explaining it in simple terms. There are exceptions to this, but given how unreliable this movie is, it seems more likely that Turing was nothing like this and the script just wrote him as the stereotype because that's what lazy writers do. Also, just keep in mind that he's a professor, which means he's working at a University. Teaching basic material is part of his job.Watching this for the second time made me think about the Queen's Gambit. Both shows (I'll just refer to this movie as a 'show' to have a common name) are about a person with an extreme genius; in one case it's math, in the other it's chess. Furthermore, both shows have pretty positive reception. However, the Queen's Gambit is great both in terms of depicting what a genius is like and in terms of the chess it shows. Here is what it gets wrong: In episode 2, people talk during tournaments, which is not allowed, and (also in episode 2), there is a part where Beth says \"I don't have to move the Queen\", when that makes no sense in the position. (Very likely someone messed up \"Queen\" and \"King\" there, because \"I don't have to move the King\" would have made sense.) As far as I know, that's it. Everything else in the entire show is spot on; the games are all based on real games played by extremely strong players, the commentary all makes sense, and the players can do the things that real chess geniuses can really do, like playing entire games in their heads and playing several games simultaneously.But here's my point -- looking at the two shows side by side suggests that most people don't notice these things. They don't see the difference between a supposed genius who doesn't build a progress report into his machine on the one hand, and a realistic chess-prodigy on the other. They don't see the difference between a show that would get an A and one that would get an F in terms of technical accuracy. People probably just like the Queen's Gambit for other reasons, and its hidden qualities are incidental. Similarly, people like this movie without realizing that it's all empty talk and no substance. Even the people who give it flag for historical inaccuracies mostly criticize that it *didn't* happen that way, not that it *couldn't have happened* this way because it's just not how any of this works.So yeah. In conclusion, I'd say this movie sucks and also watch the Queen's Gambit.",

            "content": "What kind of person is Alan Turing? He was born in public school and graduated from King 's College of Cambridge. He received the education of the elite intellectuals in the tradition of corruption. From one aspect, he has always been in a well-protected, as long as there are scientific research problems, he can be happy Live in the environment. Turing was shy and sensitive when he was young, and he was not good at expressing his feelings in words. After he opened it, he did not understand the human world and did not know how to use political means to achieve his goals. The Turing of Guan Fu presents such an image to people. He worked hard and could not understand the intention of his colleagues to order him to eat; he insisted on his deciphering method and hurriedly explained to the army leaders who came to inspect (this super cute paragraph). He did n't even know how to talk to his sister ...\nBut on the other hand, Alan Turing in reality, and the two skills of dumb and poisonous tongue ... he probably belongs to the kind of person who never understands the air and always speaks straight. Instead, it won him the love of his peers and juniors. When he was at Bletchley Manor, there was always a group of brains around him.\nContrary to the doubts and entanglements about homosexuality in the movie, Turing actually ... never concealed his orientation. When chatting, he simply came out with his colleagues when he found an opportunity. Of course, the techies did not agree with his orientation, but they finally accepted him.\nTuring usually likes to wear pajamas with a sports jacket instead of a suit that highlights his body in the movie (Fortunately, the movie chose a suit and can lick and lick). On a formal occasion, he would wear ... a formal jacket.\nTuring likes to ride bicycles and long-distance running, and almost represents the United Kingdom in the Olympic Games. Therefore, Juan Fu will run around in the movie. The reason why he likes long-distance running is to relieve the pressure (serious face) that no one asked him.\nTuring also has a somewhat cute attribute of pollen allergy, so that people around him are not surprised that he wears a gas mask to work. Saying that I really look forward to Juan Fu's tears and allergies, or a gas mask face! It is a pity that this stalk is not used in the movie. Only in the last question and answer from Turing with the detective did the line \"I am allergic to pollen\".\nTuring can also drink a pint of beer in one go. Seeing here, did you think of Professor X in the first love of Cha Nan! That's right. At first, my brain supplement to Turing was like him!\nTuring is still a big hand writing little yellow text, which is true. When he was investigated by the police because of his gay identity, the police asked him to write a statement. He ... wrote five pages of paper with beautiful words and fluent sentences, describing the relationship between him and his lover in detail and vividly. The police I was shocked. I didn't expect this person to be so straightforward.\nHaving said so much, if I want to evaluate this movie objectively, I can only say that it only depicts a short period of Turing's undulating life; it also shows only one aspect of Turing's personality. It will allow more people who have not even heard the name \"Turing\" to understand this great scientist, knowing that it is his job that ended World War II for several years in advance. On the other hand, Turing's other scientific achievements, the bold and forthright aspect of his character, and his bloody love life can only be found in the original biography. So everyone is going to read the biography! It's really burning and rotten!",

            "content": "I was bitterly disappointed at the BAFTA's and Oscars that this film didn't receive as many awards as it deserved, although The Theory of Everything is just as good a film. Personally, it's difficult to choose between the two because both are emotional stories about two real people who have done extraordinary things in the face of adversity.What's the cake? The story follows Alan Turing, who due to his incredible knowledge in the field of cryptography and mathematics, is assigned to the Top Secret facility at Bletchley Park to work with a team of experts in cracking the German Enigma machine during World War II. At the same time the film follows his life after the end of the War, where he is persecuted for his homosexuality in a world where acts of same-sex relationships and romances are punishable by a prison sentence or social shame, even though the outcome of the War can largely be owed to his actions and genius.The film is just amazing in every way, with a line up of fantastic actors and actresses who perform their parts brilliantly. Each and every moment of this movie you can take seriously because it is treated as such. The story, although I know very little about it myself, appears to follow the life of Turing to a Tee, and is filled with many emotional moments, both detrimental and uplifting. The film strongly follows his personal struggle, both in perfecting his machine, but also at hiding his true romantic feelings.Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of an obsessed genius perfectly, his emotions wavering with each new thought without a word being said, which keeps the film's pace fast and exciting whilst still maintaining a sense of subtly. Keira Knightley was a bit of an odd choice, although she plays her part well she does seem rather out of place, perhaps looking a bit too 90's rather than 40's to my mind. The other characters hold up strongly too, with particular praise from myself to Charles Dance, a sadly underrated actor who carries off the performance of the stern Commander Alastair Denniston absolutely perfectly!Overall, this isn't a film, it's an experience, you get a true feeling for the world they're in, the struggles they face and genuinely feel happy when they do overcome their obstacles. Indeed the story of Alan Turing is not a happy one due to his eventual suicide in 1954, but the film has no illusion as to there being a happy ending. I won't spoil too much but I will say that the ending is both rather tragic and at the same time satisfying. Personally, I have no complaints with this magnificent film, a true masterpiece if ever there was one, and I'd recommend it absolutely!",

Alan Turing has been one of my heroes since I started studying computing, and the way he was treated by the same society he contributed to save a huge lesson. His memory deserved a memorable movie: Royal Pardons by the Queen of England do not reach as much social attention nowadays as they did in 1560. And what do I find? The caricature of the socially unskilled genius, feeling less in the outside, tortured in the inside, some sort of individual with Asperger Syndrome unable to catch a hint. I expected to find inaccuracies in the plot, of course, it is a movie, and to be entertaining, one has to give Joan Clarke a character way more central in her relation with Turing than she had in the real story in order to give Keira Knightley some interesting scenes, and they have to dramatize to a Disney level Turing's friendship with his childhood friend Christian. But this...who is this person? It is not Alan Turing. Alan Turing was one of the most privileged minds of our time, and he was no nun Maria from \"Sound of Music\" when treating with people, especially with people pretending to be sharper than they were, but he was not an asocial person at all: at contrary, he could be extremely charming when he wanted to, he was quite funny when he wanted to, and he got hints better than anybody: he was gay in a world where that could get you in jail: his love life was built on hints, there was no other option.And he was passionate, and he laughed, and he was not a stiff English gentleman (in fact, as many geniuses with too much stuff to do and going on in his mind, he was notably scruffy), and he was particularly good treating with children (which even nowadays, as he was gay, leads always to the worst suspicions in many \"righteous minds\"). Why have them distorted the character of Turing to this point?Where they afraid that if they showed Turing in love with another guy public would not like it?Did they find that the pathologically asocial genius stereotype would make a more interesting role for Cumberbatch to be given more chances to be nominated to an Oscar?The sad truth is, Alan Turin, genius, good person, average social guy, who loved his friends and was loved by them as anybody else, was rewarded by The British Empire, for his contribution to avoid their destruction, to shame, castration, humiliation, segregation which ended in suicide, because he happened to be gay.That is the movie that would have led me to tears, this one irritates me: \"Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.\". They should compose a song for the movie with that title, again worth of 1960's Disney. Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines that would who take the worthiest story to be told, the story of your hero, and then they chew it like a gum till it is marketable enough and spit it in your face.",

            "content": "The role that the cryptologists at Bletchley Park played during WW II is well known - as is their contribution to the victory over Germany. What is less known is the \"back story\" of how it happened and who did it. \"The Imitation Game\" is the story of the code breakers and the interpersonal and bureaucratic struggles they had to overcome to break the Enigma code. It also gives a very poignant snapshot of intolerance and ignorance which was typical of England (and America) at that time. Homophobia was the order of the day - actually being illegal in England. Alan Turing was a homosexual whose work and life were threatened, and then ruined by the prevailing attitudes of the day. I was afraid that this would be the main point of the movie, but it was properly handled within the context of the greater story - the breaking of the Enigma code - and the ushering in of the computer age.The movie is a marvel - weaving in the eccentricities of Alan Turing - his arrogance - and peculiarities with the task he was called to accomplish. His homosexuality is tastefully handled as it is unveiled during his school boy days. His lack of social graces is humorous, while showing how detrimental it was to his performance as part of a the team. He was extremely literal - as evidenced by his being responses to being invited to lunch one day. NOTE: he shares this literalness with Stonewall Jackson - ref Rebel Yell by S.C. Gwynne.The casting is brilliant - the performances are brilliant - especially Benedict Cumberbatch who plays Turing. He does not overplay his eccentricities - watching him makes you think you are really encountering this very strange genius. From a team building perspective it is interesting how he learned how to reach out to his team - and not alienate them. One of the most frustrating things about the movie was seeing the close-mindedness of the establishment as exemplified by Charkles Dance who plays Commander Denniston - who is in charge of the Bletchley project. He clearly is dealing with non linear people and processes using a \"military like\" linear thought process and expectations. I am reminded of Salieri trying to keep up with Mozart in Amadeus. Fortunately, Turing and his associates had MI6, the British spy agency, on their side. Spooks do not think along standard lines either.The development of the machine which eventually breaks the Enigma code is very tense, especially when they discover the (typically German) method of signing on and off in their coded messages. The \"Heil Hitler\" at the end of each code was symptomatic of how damaging mindless obedience to Hitler and the tenants of Nazism was to Germany itself. Finally the conundrum which the breaking of the code placed the Bletchley team in was very intriguing. Recognizing that the fact that the German messages were being decrypted was a crucial secret. Knowing when to use the knowledge of where and when the Germans were going to attack was the result of a ratio of the importance of the military action against the probability that the action would tip the Germans off that the code had been compromised. This sets up one of the greatest ethical dilemmas in the war. As a result, Churchill let Coventry be bombed - with the loss of many lives. Yet the information from Enigma was used to great effect at Stalingrad (THE turning point of the war); in D-Day; and in the Mediterranean.As you can see- there is much to recommend this film. Great story, great performances, great insight into the era it took place. If you have not seen it, you should.",

They still are deluded into thinking the 50's was all a \"Leave It To Beaver\" paradise for all in society as they forget the atrocities to blacks, Italian's, gays, women, Jew's, disabled, Latinos (sure I missed many more who were abused by such mindsets they espouse then and even this day). As well the poverty and the openly embracing of hate and many more ignorance's that they clinch still to this day to. If they were not so dangerous and holding society back I would pity them, alas they are as big a threat as any fanatic is regardless of who or what they believe. So one star people keep your bigoted hate in your place of worship and in your petty party politics of control devising ways to abuse others you so endeavor so hard; we are moving forward with or without you in the USA.Movie has a solid cast of characters with great cinematography and well balanced story that keeps you interested in the film and its characters as it takes back to the WWII era in England and see the underlying efforts to win the war and unlikely people behind the scenes that made such happen.The movie was excellent in showing the bravery of unsung hero's and how the war was won through brains and how many went unnoted and even suffered scorn by those ignorant to their true selfless actions for the war effort. How our ignorance could of and likely cost us more death than was necessary because we judged by superficial bigoted means and not by character and persons abilities. Movie pointed out indirectly how even then, women were still seen as property with little say in their lives if they were to be of virtue and have any hope of social status. How that even in adulthood that they must blindly obey thy parents or have a husband to answer to and permiss them their very activities. How pre and during WWII women were limited career wise; regardless of talents and education. That is unless they were able to lie and deceive the gatekeepers of who could and could not succeed and prosper on their own merits; regardless of gender, skin color and sexual orientation.We also see how allowing society to sub-come to ignorant views and bigoted perceptions not only can destroy innocent people; but how such leaves upon society so many potential needless loss of life because such ignorance cost them the talent and skills another had to offer humanity. I wonder how much we have lost unknowingly do to the ignorant and bigoted people who demand and self proclaim they know what is best for everyone including others they know not and who preach freedom as long as the freedom is their liking and under their control.Movie has a great direct story and many underlying life lessons some to this day still refuse to accept and wish to drag society back into there 1st century thinking's!

The music is very good written and added to the value of the scenes. However the direction was average and the story really didn't present that historical incident well and focused more in Alan's sexuality. Also it was predictable and had no worries watching it knowing that it will happen and they will break the Enigma code and that was the challenge to make you doubt that it will happen and present the suffering and work done to achieve it and focusing on it's result and on the war too and it's effect on it. The characters were very full of stories and feelings that could have been used instead of having unnecessary scenes and focusing on how to present the smartness of Alan's mind not telling us he is a smart and has a different attitude than others and you know that it will work in the end. Also small Alan was different than the big one that I felt the small one was performing another Alan with a mental disorder.Also Keira's character wasn't powerful or had any difficult scenes to present her well. However the movie is full of good scenes with performance and music and irresistible to watch.",

He was an Olympic-level runner well in movie you can see how he run very fast maybe in evening walk 2. He embodied some values of the Hippie movement 3. The father of the computer also dabbled in physics, biology, chemistry and neurology 4. He stuttered when talking you can see this too in movie 5. He didn't keep his sexuality a secret among friends yes in movie he told to friends and not only friends he also told a girl who was going to marry her but in last they didn't marry so overall a movie about a Brilliant Men and they presented in a great way i just loved it",

            "content": "Despite all of this greatness jostling for screen time at your local cinema and art house theatre, The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch has managed to make a strong case for your precious $14.50. The film is based on British mathematician and cryptanalyst Alan Turing's quest to crack Nazi Germany's Enigma code and bring an end to World War II. By way of flashback and flashforward, director Morten Tyldum and screenwriter Graham Moore trace three crucial timelines in Turing's storied life: his awkward coming of age at boarding school; his top-secret work for the British government in the 1940's during which he developed the automated electromechanical machine known as the bombe, the device that cracked the Enigma code and is widely regarded as the predecessor to the modern computer; and his tragic and deplorable conviction for gross indecency (read: homosexuality) which led to compulsory chemical castration in lieu of jail time, and ultimately, his suicide. Remarkably, this is the first time Turing's story has been dramatized on the big screen, though for U.S. distributor The Weinstein Company, it has been well worth the wait. After topping the prestigious Black List in 2011, the script was picked up by Warner Brothers for a seven figure sum, subsequently dropped when certain casting talks disintegrated, eventually produced by Black Bear Pictures, and sold to the Weinstein Brothers' shop for a cool $7 million (the most ever paid for U.S. distribution rights at The European Film Market). The end result is a well-crafted, vindicating exploration of one of the twentieth centuries most impressive and perplexing minds.Based on Andrew Hodges book Alan Turing: The Enigma, the adaptation first and foremost accomplishes what it set out to do by telling a story that needed to be told. Turing's contributions to the Allied war effort, artificial intelligence, and theoretical computer science (not to mention his world class marathon running talent) transformed the way intelligence and data are gathered and implemented on and off the battlefield. That Benedict Cumberbatch was able to so beautifully embody the arrogant, antisocial genius who seemed more at home tinkering with aluminium and copper and dissecting Nazi ciphers than attempting the insurmountable task of engaging with other people makes The Imitation Game an inspiring watch. The actor's self-assurance and wit that audiences have grown accustomed to through his BBC role as a modern day Sherlock Holmes prove useful as he tackles Turing, but it is the added layer of chronic angst and heartbreak that truly breath life into the character. It's hard to walk away from the movie's final scenes unaffected. Despite Cumberbatch's ability to build real empathy for his subject, the film at times regrettably falls into clich\u00e9. An oft repeated, audience-pleasing one-liner and a handful of generic biopic moments cast a delicate haze of predictability over the story. Tyldum and Moore also seemed to shy away from the scientifically fascinating nuts and bolts of Turing's work and instead dwell in shallower waters, namely the man's social ineptitude and his complicated engagement to co-codebreaker Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). It was as if every time a stretch of dialogue (and the film is nearly all dialogue) veered too far off course into discussions of cryptanalysis, bombe rotor settings and logical deduction, you could feel the filmmakers reeling it back in to safer territory. To be fair, The Imitation Game is a narrative about the life of Alan Turing and not an episode of How It's Made. Nevertheless, engrossing speech doesn't always have to be grandiose; the best part about Apollo 13 is getting lost in the complicated details of physics and spacecraft engineering. Letting people figure out for themselves that something is incredible is always better than telling them yourself. However, the conceit of Turing as an enigma in and of himself is a powerful one that distinguishes the film from predecessors in its genre. In a pivotal interrogation scene, Turing invites his interviewer to play the logician's famous imitation game\u2014or Turing Test\u2014where through a series of questions one tries to discern if their counterparty is a human or a machine. Following the interrogation, Turing challenges the questioner to define him: is he a man or a machine? Or is he a monster? A homosexual? All of the above? To judge a person on just one of their marginal attributes without recognizing all the others, much like the British government did in its shameful conviction and sentencing of Turing in 1952, is to neglect the imperfect dynamism that makes a human a human. While posthumous awards, royal pardons and cultural media can't right the wrong that was done to one of Britain's greatest minds, The Imitation Game at the very least shares Turing's greatness with anyone willing to seek it out.",

Cumberbatch plays Alan's suffering and his personality that is poor to express his emotion and communicate with others successfully. He achieves amazing things for his short life in accompanies with his secret, homosexual. His life is strongly impressive for me. Especially, the ending is moving and made me cry. I think little people know about him and I suppose that there are a lot of people who is not known though they contributed to the world.

He comes into conversations about science, mathematics, history and civil rights. I had seen the 1996 BBC drama 'Breaking the Code' starring Derek Jacobi, as had Benedict Cumberbatch, who has said in interviews that Jacobi's performance of the role influenced his own. For this version though, the focus is more on the effects of Turing's autism on his life than of his speech impediment.This is Cumberbatch's forte: characters who are right all the time, about everything, but communicate poorly. He's got the charisma to be likable even while behaving (on the face of it) badly toward people. In fact, he heads a cast featuring Mark Strong, Keira Knightley and Charles Dance, all doing the exact types of performances at which they excel.Turning this kind of story into a drama faces an obstacle that doing maths and breaking codes in rooms is not inherently cinematic, but the screenplay does a good job of getting around this by various means. Graham Moore's script is excellent in many regards. Also, I would like to point out some great location scouting and set dressing.My only hesitation is that... Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think The Imitation Game adds much to the knowledge of even a fairly educated layman. There's very little new information here, and some questions I had remained unanswered. It covers the basics in an engaging, dramatic, insightful way, but if you are coming to this to expand your knowledge of Turing, you might want to look elsewhere instead.",

The invention of the world's first super computer should not go down like this. I also cringe to think of people discussing the war with what they learned in this film. I don't think it's even a stand alone good romance / historical fiction either. The boiled down plot is very childish, makes little sense as it dawdles emotionally along. Ahem - there was a wee war on? Where's the flight / fight that would be in effect...***************************SPOILER ALERT******************************If you want to know anything about the real story please watch the English documentary Codebreakers, containing actual mathematical techniques used in cracking codes.The movie lacks any actual maths or cryptography at all. And the docu also shares more info about Turin and Flower's futures after the war which I found fascinating. I won't spoil that for you! Seriously cool men did all this, not just one guy.Cumberpatch is one of my fave actors too. Very disappointed he got involved in such a ruination of two of the most important historical stories of the 20th C. It's not often that real life is so much more interesting that a film! The acting is solid, although hugely similar to most of his other stock performances, so no new angle except for his sad eye moments... bit of an eek addition to his portfolio. Victimy without having much charisma. From what I understand in real life, Turin was really quite dapper, they weren't having a popularity contest down at Bletchley park because, ...there was a WAR going on! Being gay / bullied / unpopular not as important as saving your country! Of course IRL he got in trouble after people found out he was gay. It was the 40s. And there was no mention in real life of fully incompetent superiors, this is just thrown in for extra bullying effect I guess!Also he words that they say in the movie helped them to crack enigma are fully bogus and never appeared in the real transmissions. Not in code. It wasn't even enigma !?! it was a machine Hitler called TULLY. Enigma was broken 10 years prior by the Polish! There were no woman on the crack team of maths heads who of course had no say in what info was later shared. So much unimaginative fantasy. Really could be the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. I quite like Keira also.NOTE TO CREW: don't go making movies about something super important that the allies can be so proud of and then mix it up with Alice in Wonderland and a 12 year old's expose on bullying please.Also there is also a heavy touch of... ''straights won't be able to sympathise with gay people unless they've been bullied severely'' in it. Very unnecessary.Please believe I'm not a continuity geek really, this was just so bad as well as historically inaccurate. I was so looking forwards to it too. I left it playing in the sitting room I walked out before the last 15 minutes, after thinking how stoopid it was that the main (imaginary) woman in the story married a homosexual that had never kissed her, and 6 months later with some kind of straight face managed to look mildly surprised that he was not straight after he confessed to her. It would have made more sense if she had burst out laughing or cried. But no - I guess as an actor she had lost interest in the floundering plot at that point also. I did end up going back to and check what facts they shared with the audience at the end of the movie, just seemed to be the tragic gay only based facts really.Come on. I mean doesn't it even seem too ridiculous, the story line? A socially awkward mathematician with no military training being allowed to judge what info to share with his immediate superiors? Being made an honorary spy? If Britain had been this crap at intelligence the war would never have been won, honestly. This movie had the chance to put the yanks straight, that the British codebreaking won the war more for the allies than the American input at the end of the war. Hmm... these producers are American...Please watch Codebreakers the documentary, especially if you have an interest in problem solving. I didn't enjoy having to bring back the word Bogus. Pros: close ups of the machine (and woolly vests) were interesting. But the starring computer was not called what the movie called it : Christopher (too gay lol), but was really known as Colossus. I think the story of the invention of the world's first super computer / computer deserved a much more valiant effort, what lazy film making.I will be blacklisting this group of directors / screen writers from my future viewings as I really don't respect how they think, feel, or handle facts.

Following the life of Alan Turing, one of the leading players in decoding the Enigma code. We follow his childhood in school, his struggle working for the military, and the tragic last years of his life. Where he lost his life after the energy when it was revealed he was a homosexual and received not much help cause his military record was purged. To keep the enigma secret until it was revealed 50 years later. The story is strong and has a motif of respecting our hidden heroes. Before praising the movie, I have to discuss the film's biggest issue. It is historically inaccurate in a lot of ways.A historical film can be not so authentic but must maintain respect for those before. But this is all subjective, but Imitation Game's most significant issue is sudden character changes in almost everyone in the story. As the movie shows, nearly everyone is mean to Alan Turing. But in reality, they had mutual respect for one another. And Alan Turing was a pretty sociable person, but the film makes him a character we must pity cause he's awkward and even autistic. The movie also wants to portray that Alan Turing solely built Christopher and decoded the enigma. But there were hundreds of factors and people that led to the enigma being solved, but Alan Turing is a main one. So because of that, it lowers the standards of the film a bit.The best part of this film though it keeps you invested. Every scene has tension and suspense. And no scene is useless to the story or character. The movie takes a lot of creative liberty from historical accuracy to emphasize more drama. But the drama is well impactful for the audience. Either it shows the dramatic aftermath of a battle, from seeing the masses solve a crossword puzzle. The climaxes stand out thanks to the film's cast, including Benedict Cumberbatch. He plays the awkward version of Alan Turing to perfection, to Kiera Knightly always plays the more heartfelt character excellently. Matthew Goode plays the person who first misjudges Alan, then becomes one of his strongest allies. And Mark Strong plays Menzies, focusing on the job of winning the war fellow. And many more, Rory Kinnear isn't a film highlight but represents the audience on our reaction to Alan being neglected even though he is a hero. Rory, as Detective Nock, shows us the absolute shock and disappointment of Alan's downfall by society.Overall the film excellently emphasizes the unsung heroes of WW2. Whether they were a prominent general on the battlefield or a simple foot soldier, these unnamed men will never know the sacrifice they made. Where we cannot verbally commend them for their actions, so we must take care of the lives and opportunities they provided for us. They may not be perfect, and they may not be likable or different. But the fact they were involved in the mission to win wars and save lives is enough to be honored. An overall great film, even though it did some little injustice to history, the film was able to pay respect to Alan Turing.",

The atmosphere of the movie felt a bit unbalanced - some parts were dense (e.g. Turing's dialogue with Menzies), other parts not as much.Historical accuracy is not worth a dime - Turing's persona is simply portrayed as Aspie, breaking Enigma also happened in a little different way but for the sake of the drama I'm able to accept those simplifications.

I did find that the pervading Americanisation (if that's a word) of our English language more than a tad irritating, is it ruining the English language and in due course British film-making in the process? Use of certain words, that alas seem commonplace in England in 2015, were not used (in the context portrayed in the film) in the 1940's and 50's Words such as \"firing\" in place of say, dismissing and \"hiring\" in place of recruiting are a sad reflection that British films and more pertinently, prominent British actors are either pandering to USA vocabulary or so ignorant in the use of the English language they are lazily picking up USA slang for proper English words and being allowed to utilize this lack of talent on film.I did find that the acting, or over-acting from the two lead actors was embarrassing. The Oh so British accent of the elite class is all very well if one lives in Buckingham Palace but to imagine a perceived \"ordinary\" young lady (Joan Clarke) whose parents show such working class values and attitudes talking in such a manner highly ridiculous.The two leads would be better placed in a theatre where such hammy acting and OTT British accents are more attuned with the audience.The male lead overplayed the clich\u00e9d stuttering and stammering English eccentric mathematic genius to stereotypical perfection. A perfection that unfortunately all too quickly reminded me that I was watching a theatrical performance, not for long could I be engrossed in the plot, the acting was over the top. Ironically, the usually OTT Charles Dance played a very believable character and his performance was very good.Whilst Alan Turing's sexuality was pertinent to the story, I feel that the film-makers have placed far too much emphasis on it. This, I feel is bourne out in the words at the conclusion of the film quoting how many men have been charged with homosexual criminal activity since the 1800's seemed a cheap political shot and an effort at propaganda.The film-makers seem to be inferring that Alan Turing ended his life because of his prosecution for homosexual activity or his forced hormone therapy treatment. This is taking a liberty and a more fitting and balanced conclusion would have been to say, \"Mr Turing took his own life\u0085\" This would leave the viewer free to follow up the demise of Alan Turing if they felt so inclined, hopefully by using more factual accounts.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch is based on the life of Alan Turing. Alan Turing is the famous mathematician and cryptanalyst who helped the Allies break Nazi communication codes and end the war early. He is also considered the father of Artificial Intelligence and very early founders of computer science. He was convicted for homosexuality leading him to commit suicide at the age of 41. This is a great story to make a career defining movie, but Morten Tyldum disappoints in some aspects. The movie is very superficially made dealing only with the subject that Turing was a legend and was mistreated by British Government, it fails to capture his brilliance and the depth in his life. A good comparison would be with A Beautiful Mind on the life of John Nash, which presents an entertaining and holistic description of the protagonist's life. In The Imitation Game, the machine that Turing creates to break Nazi codes is like a black box! Cumberbatch delivers a very strong performance and the production design is also noteworthy. The Imitation Game comes across like an Oscar enticing stuff that makes us sympathetic towards Turing and not respectful.",

False 'facts', twisted interpretations, manipulated history... have all served to make me very suspicious of \"Based on a true story\" movies. Although they're described as such, but only transiently at the beginning, they are invariably passed off and accepted as literal fact.I don't know for sure, but I very much doubt that one of the team was a woman... and I'm not being sexist by saying that. It's just that my suspicion is that it would not have been the case in that day and age. I suspect it's yet another film industry appeasement to political correctness.Similarly, although Cumberbatch is a very good actor, I just get the feeling that the real Turing was not the insecure, inadequate, socially inept eccentric he's portrayed as.However, the film is extremely well made, excellent production values with great attention to contemporary styles/fashion, and is directed well.Although I'm never particularly keen on Rory Kinnear, he was adequate in his portrayal of the detective snooping into Turing/Cumberbatch's background.In all, I wonder how much of this movie is actually true to historical fact. This is what upsets me and puts me on edge. Films to do with real historical events should *stick to* precisely the fact... they should not be twisted for any reason, and the least reason for political correctness.Regardless, although I personally feel this film deserves a rating of approximately 7.7, I shall round up to an 8.",

            "content": "The 2014 film 'The Imitation Game' and the story of ultra-brilliant 'outsider' Alan Turing is important and fascinating in a number of ways. On the large-scale it presents the positively incredible concept that sheer 'brainpower' could in effect undermine/defeat the fiercest of armies (i.e. Nazi Germany) = by breaking/decoding the unbreakable 'enigma' code-transmissions, providing the Allies with vital information on movements of enemy warships, bombers, etc.The decoding-effort was thought by many to be virtually impossible, but Alan Turing made the intellectual 'jump' head-long towards the direction of designing one of the first 'thinking-machines' (soon to be know as computers), to tackle the seemingly insurmountable feat! The artificially-intelligent Turing-machine came through with flying-colors and made the world safe for people that just wanted to live in peace, freedom and civility (or did it?!)That's the great irony of Alan Turing's authentically tragic story, His unprecedented brilliance and ultra-creative logical successes, probably won the War for our free-World (or at least shortened it considerably), and saved millions of innocent Lives - but unfortunately the still archaically-unsympathetic (irrationally-cruel) Laws of his own British-Isles homeland (as of the early 1950's) essentially sealed his dire fate, facilitating the taking his own life thru cyanide poisoning (by not allowing him to be judged solely on the 'content of his own character' - subjecting him to a brutally-inhuman 'chemical-castration' which probably hindered/ interfered with his previously astonishing powers of concentration - and also not giving him full credit (at the time) for his astoundingly crucial code-breaking achievements during WWII (partly because his achievements were highly classified in the midst of a burgeoning 'Cold-War').It seems doubly ironic now, in the age of I-Pad/I-phone, where even the 'common-person' places essential reliance on these 'thinking machines' = that might never have come into existence if not for Alan Turing (and other key artificial-intelligence 'founding fathers' like John Von Neumann and Marvin Minsky).Actor Benedict Cumberbatch gives a positively uncanny performance as Turing = fully-transmitting Turing's other-Worldly 'outsider's' brilliance (as well as his palpable social awkwardness).If I had a slight critique, its in the pacing and 'focus' of this film = I think the drama builds well in the second-half, with some extremely powerfully moving scenes towards the end) - but some of the early scenes seem a bit unfocused (and unfortunately the earlier scenes between Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly seem to lack sufficient 'chemistry' and seem a bit 'forced' although I have to say that their final scenes together are quite emotionally-resonant!Overall, I enjoyed this movie and found much of it quite insightful - just wish Alan Turing himself could have been cognizant of how much his ground-breakingly original ideas about artificial-intelligence have genuinely shaped/influenced our 21st Century, and beyond!note: Charles Dance gives a brilliantly intense & intimidating portrayal as 'Commander Denniston' = Alan Turing's bureaucratic superior and foil thru much of this film!",

Or things you never learned in school. When I was in high School my science Teacher's idol was Alan Turing. He kept talking about the Turing machines and we learned about Alan Turing briefly. 30 years later I've forgotten about Alan Turing. Which is a shame because his life story really is a fascinating one. Alan Turing was a unequaled genius at codes and machines built to think . When he went to Bletchely park to get a job breaking the enigma code. Turing did not think too highly of the War. What he wanted was the challenge of smashing enigma. Turing was too great of a genius to let that code remain unbroken for long. the film details how hard life was for him. alone and with few friends.It details greatly how Turing was . And when the war ended and the team dissolved Turing turned his attentions to more machines that would work miracles. Until a break in accidentally leads to Turing's greatest secret revealed. his homosexuality. In a era where that was a Crime Alan Turing was arrested and charged with indecency. And this led to his suicide at the age of 41. The movie is powerful. subtle in ways you do not see coming. and truthful. Cumberbatch gives the performance of a lifetime and bring Alan Turing back to life . This isn't a war movie by any means . Its a movie about a lonely man struggling to find his way in the world. In a age where Autistic people where dismissed as retarded and homosexuals arrested. Alan Turing overcame all of that to become a hero and a icon for all the lonely people out there who do not fit in. Bravo to all involved with the making of this film.

            "content": "With the excellent Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role, The Imitation Game is a movie that aspires to movie greatness, but I'm sorry to say, that in my humble opinion, it falls a bit short on a number of counts.It is the story of the brilliant scientist/mathematician, Alan Turing who was the man who almost single-handedly cracked the enigma code machine in the Second World War. This remarkable feat is generally acknowledged to have shortened the war by at least two years and saved thousands upon thousands of lives.It is also the story of a man who has been credited with the invention of the modern day computer.It is also the story of the man who was a homosexual, and who was prosecuted for committing (what were then considered to be) 'illegal' acts, and who subjected himself to state administered chemical castration rather than spend time in jail.It is also the story of a man who was treated so shabbily by the country who owed him so much that at the age of 39, he killed himself.It is a difficult story to tell in a couple of hours \u2013 especially when we know nothing about the really exciting part \u2013 the details of what exactly led up to Turing breaking of the enigma code during the war. We know he was hired to lead a team and he built and used a very primitive form of computer to break the code. More than that is still secret, or the records have long since been destroyed.The film writers decided to write what they thought was a clever piece of fiction in which Turing was continually fighting his bully- boy bosses; that his resentful, fellow workers all thought he was an idiot; that he was wasting valuable funds, and was probably a Russian spy. According to the film, he was at constant at risk of being fired.All the above is fiction. Indeed, they would have us believe that that it was only after Turing wrote directly to Churchill that he was put in charge and granted the funds to build his computer. (Fiction again.)It really is a load of tosh, and Charles Dance's role as Turing's ignorant, malevolent commanding Officer is so full of 'cartoon- evil', that for all the world, he comes across as a male manifestation of Creuella Deville. One of the most outrageous fictitious story lines concerns Turing's failure to report a Soviet spy to avoid being outed as gay. It is pure Hollywood invention, as are so many of the dramatic machinations that allegedly took place at Bletchley Park.It is a pity, as although I really don't like biopics unless they are very good \u2013 this might have been an exception, but sadly it isn't. The film didn't seem to know what it wanted to do \u2013 celebrate the genius of a man who shortened the war by two years and invented the computer, or show us how gays, even war heroes, were so appallingly treated by the authorities in Britain back in the early 50's. I think it tries to do both and falls a bit flat on both countsIt is still a very watchable, entertaining movie, and Cumberbatch and Dance are always worth seeing \u2013 whatever films they are in, as is the gorgeous Keira Knightley. But I don't think Benedict quite nailed the role \u2013 maybe he tried a little too hard. It just isn't that good. Honestly \u2013 I've seen a couple of documentaries on Turing that are much better. Incidentally, it is a fact that Churchill later acknowledged Turing's massive contribution to the war effort, which shortened the war by at least two years, but no mention was made of the disgraceful way he was treated in the early 1950's because he was gay.Turing was recently pardoned by the then PM Gordon Brown for his 'crime' of being a practicing homosexual, but isn't it about time he was posthumously awarded a knighthood? After all, he is one of Britain's greatest ever heroes. If the likes of Cliff Richard, Mick Jagger and Bruce Forsyth and Angelina Jolie can become Knights and Dames of the Realm, then surely Alan Turing is equally deserving of the honour.",

The actor manages to reflect in each scene, in a very genuine way, the complex mind of this character beyond his intelligence.\nThe film shows us the mind of a genius in a very simple way, a job that is not easy at all.

            "review_title": "A film that fails to make a statement and lacks depth",
            "content": "first warn you: This review contains spoilers, but I try to keep them short.When you go to see this film and already know a little about Alan Turing, his life and work, you will not learn much new. I've seen the film a few days after it received the academy award for the best writing (adapted screenplay). But I don't know why it received this.(Spoiler) The film is telling the story of Alan Turing, mathematical genius, who had a huge influence on the development of computer and an important role in the second world war. Also, it is a story about a homosexual man, who is forced to hide this part of his life and in the end will commit suicide because of a society and laws that call him a pervert.The film tells this story (or stories) about three different times in Turing's life. The main story is about Turing cracking the German encryption system during WW2. He builds a machine (computer) and has to deal with some obstacles (military chain of command, colleagues with different approaches and secret service agents). The other setting is Turing as a kid in a private school where he had only one friend. The kid is different from all the others, smarter but also homosexual. And the third is the time after the war when Turing is a professor. Someone breaks into his house and a police officer starts to investigate not only the crime but Turing's past. I think that's as much detail as necessary for this review.The problem is, the film lacks depth. And one reason is the structure.Turing's childhood, the root of his problems in society and his personally, is told in such short pieces, that it is hard to connect. There are no parents, only Turing, his friend and math. All this short flashbacks into the childhood were not given the time to unfold the deepness of a child's personality. (The fact that Turing was a very shy character doesn't help the film either.)The major part of the story is about Turing and his team cracking the enigma. This is a technical and scientific process and no one can expect much action. But again, a lack of depth. It is shown that this process is time and money consuming. But the viewer gets hardly any details. The work done by Polish experts? Mentioned in one sentence. What Turing is developing? Kept as simple as possible. (Maybe because the audience wouldn't understand it like the British military didn't understand technical details back in the days. / just to mention it: Turing was not the only pioneer in computer science.) The problem is, the film tries to avoid any conflict. Even when moral questions come up, they are handled with logic. Conflicts are solved (or ignored) within a few moments and that's it. Not that there isn't any potential for conflicts (plenty). Personal consequences? We better ignore them. But that's history. If it was like that, I can't argue with it. (Many reviewer pointed out that the historic facts were different.)The biggest fail of the film is how it handles the problems Turing has because of his homosexuality. First, it never gets physical. It does not have to get sexual. But (spoiler alert), if the burglar is a homosexual prostitute, why is not even the burglary or any other situation when Turing meets this man shown? Homosexuality is talked about a lot, but it is never part of the film. And I don't mean sex. Moreover, important parts are left out of the film. The trial is only some news in the paper. Chemical castration is handled within a few minutes. Turing's final struggle and his suicide is not even part of the film.With a script that leaves the important parts free or avoids depth, a structure that makes it hard to connect to the characters. I can't blame the actors. I expected more from a film that received several award nominations and even won some.There is a lot of potential left in this story. The opportunity of indictment and condemnation against an intolerant time and society was not taken. There were attempts to show the viewers the impact of everything, original footage from WW2 or the stats at the end, but it was hardly connected to the story. It wouldn't have been important to make a statement against homophobia or for feminism (what some are criticising). It would've been important to take up the position against the old and glory Empire and for all the victims of that time. To do them justice.It is like the film makers didn't really know how to make this statement and tell this story properly. So they took it, they took all the injustice and were not able to care. They took it like Turing would have taken it, because it is personal and we're not good at being personal. I was not touched and the film did not gave me a good or a bad feeling. It did not provoke me either. It informed me, not more and not very accurate.Alan Turing a pioneer in science, a war hero and a victim of an intolerant society and intolerant laws would have deserved more. All I learned: Nobody stood up for this man when it mattered. And that did not change.The story of Turing's life is a big tragedy. But the film is not able to keep up to it.",

And his struggles to build it.\nBut it goes downhill fast when it tries to claim that it helped the Soviets to win the war, as well as the Western Allies. The Soviets didn't need BP. they had their own espionage network right inside the 3rd Reich, inside its military-industrial complex. Where even BP couldn't penetrate.\nIt was called 'The Red Orchestra', and they knew every detail of German plans for Barbarossa from the beginning of the invasion to the Battle of Kursk.But as with everything else, the West tries to steal all the glory for 'winning the war' and seeks to ignore that the Red Army defeated 80% of the Wehrmacht on the Russian front. They have done this indirectly with The imitation Game.\nThis is never acknowledged or recognised in Western official historiography of WW2.\nI regard The Imitation Game. as thinly veiled revisionist telling of WW2 with the centre at BP apparently giving the Soviets information they would not otherwise have had.

            "content": "Summary: One of the biggest, 'best' kept secrets of British history, if not the world's history.... A tragic, heart felt true story of one mans struggle for acceptance, an acceptance that to this day has never been entirely granted. For without this man, we would not be living in the world we know. Without this man, history would be entirely different. We as people owe all we have to this man, a true hero. The Imitation Game is the story of Alan Turing a mathematical genius who had a passion and obsession for solving puzzles, riddles, clues and was a proud Cryptanalyst. In 2013 Britain formally under the royal family apologised and pardoned Alan Turing for the inhumane, and horrific way he was treated. Alan Turing was, due to his sexuality chemically castrated, and forced in to loneliness, sorrow, depression and segregation. In short, he committed suicide under a sentence given to him of 'Gross Indecency'. As tragic as this was, worse then all of this, he was never credited for the hero that he was. Although a film based on the horrific real life account of one mans struggle, need and desire for a life of acceptance and peace, this film is not entirely Tragedy, but more a story of appreciation that should have been given every day. We first are introduced to Alan Turing during his last remaining years alive, where he was broken into by the police in his home in Manchester, and harassed regarding a noise disturbance from the neighbours. Following an investigation Turing was brought in for questioning due to a number of accusations and clues that didn't collate. Turing was, due to no record accused of War Crimes, and being a Soviet spy. However, it is not this that is the crime, Turing is found to be a Homosexual and arrested. During questioning, our film and story really begins, as it is here where the police want to know why there is no record of his service during the war, and what he really did.. \"Are you listening closely?\" Alan Turing was brought to Bletchley Park under MI6, and sworn secrecy to embark on the seemingly impossible task of solving the \"unsolvable\" Enigma, a machine that was being used by the Nazi's to send combat instructions across radio waves, and orchestrate attacks in the ocean and sky's.. If decoded and broken thousands would be saved. But there was the small task of breaking this code, a code which is changed daily. Apart from his shear genius It is Alan's shy, awkward and social inability to deal with people that allowed him to succeed the way he did, as through an ignorance and belief of his ability we see Turing take over a team of some of the best mathematicians, code breakers in the country and with one swoop fire two of them, take control and demand \u00a3100,000 worth of materials to build a machine, to defeat the Enigma machine. Morten Tyldum tells a life story of Alan through three time periods during his life, when he was at boarding school, during Bletchley park and a short time before his death. During Alan's time at boarding school we learn about how one child's seemingly loneliest time, was one of his happiest times, it is where we meet his friend and first love Christopher. A love that was so strong, and important to Alan it created a Frankenstein esque relationship with his Enigma machine, which in turn stems back to his first love, he names the machine Christopher.. This became Alan's obsession and drove his genius to question the power of technology, and where in the future will the 'computer' and man be? Furthermore, Alan went on to write his thesis \"The Imitation Game\" (hence the title)Benedict Cumberbatch has been nominated for a Golden Globe, Oscar and Britt award for his portrayal in this film of the genius that was Alan Turing. And may I add, it is completely clear, and obvious as to why he has been nominated for all these prestigious awards. Although beaten by Eddie Redmayne for 'best actor' (which is a fair defeat as Eddie's portrayal of Steven Hawkins on \"The Theory of Everything\" is perfect) his performance is breath taking, and a its as if we are watching what we would imagine Alan to be like. Cumberbatch catches this man's inability to relate to people, to admit to defeat and to show a need for help. Furthermore, Cumberbatch who is assisted by a cast of fantastic actors really shows a struggle and 'need' for love to be real. One actress in particular is Keira Knightley portraying the character and genius 'Joan Clarke' , who was Alan's rock, support and real friend throughout his time at Bletchley, but more importantly was Alan's fianc\u00e9e (who helped disguise his homosexuality).Without ruining the entire film for my readers, I would say that this film is an incite, like those films before (Enigma, 2001) into the life of one man who was forgotten, and never remembered for how he changed the course of history forever, and rid the world of tyranny. I found this film to be a story you as a viewer struggle to forget, and really feel that some things in life are unjust and humanity fails to prevail. They say that due to Alan and his team solving the Enigma and the horrendous choices that followed for them, they shortened the war by at least two years, saving thousands. Morten Tyldum has really focused on the story, and the choices made by a small group of people, who were normal like you or I. It is however, the later years after the war that really hit home in this film. Due to Alan's sexuality he was forced into Chemical Castration, exile and a life without Christopher. In turn, forcing suicide upon a hero.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game is an extremely watered down and edited version of events made for a middle of the road, mainstream 2010s audience.Given that it has Benedict Cumberbatch in it, I avoided it like the plague when it came out. By the time I came to watch it on TV I had kind of forgotten about how dull the overhyped \"Sherlock\" was and I have always been fascinated by both the legend of Turing, and the war itself obviously, I was open minded about it.The simple fact is, he may have been \"odd\" but by the time Alan Turing had reached Bletchley Park he was a confident young man. He was not half way to being Rain Man like this movie wants you to think. And what's more, even though his sexuality was still outlawed and oppressed in Britain, he was open to his colleagues at the code-breaking facility. He was not awkward about his sexuality and he didn't hate himself or seek a woman to both act as a beard and take \"pity\" on him or something.The early 40s was a time of total war, many people in Britain, especially those smart enough to be doing this kind of job, were afraid that the country was finished. Hitler had spent most of the last decade arming Germany to take on the world while Britain had slept and engaged in futile appeasement. The underdogs weren't stupid enough to take one of their best players off the field just because he liked other dudes.And given his talents, he probably would have been more like a god to his colleagues, not an outcast.If it's not really doable to make a big-grossing, \"marketable\" mainstream movie about a nerdy gay number genius that's fine but what the hell is the point of churning out a movie where WW2 was nearly lost by the Allies because Turing didn't know how to accept a lunch invite from his fellow math-nerds (who, by the way, all swagger around like jocks.).... and where one of the greatest technical minds of the 20th century had to justify his war-winning project to some goon from the Ministry of Kicking Down Barn Doors.If that's an \"amazing\" film to you, well I'm afraid my words to you will have to be um... watered down too.The only vaguely compelling part was when they realised that they couldn't use the cracked German code to stop or foil every attack, or the Germans would soon realise what had happened and change the code. This meant they had to give up the lives of their countrymen, out there in battlefields, for strategical purposes.It seems to me to be part of a pattern of recent British films that, intentionally or not, trivialise some of Britain's most remarkable people, whether historical or recent. 2017 saw the release of \"Darkest Hour\" in which the famously determined, \"bulldog\"-like Winston Churchill (who was the posh son of an aristocrat) was depicted asking random yahoos on the tube whether the country should surrender to Hitler or not. Also Eddie Redmayne, who makes Cumberbatch look like the most versatile actor ever, \"played\" Stephen Hawking as though he was a wide-eyed simpleton who just accidentally managed to figure out all the universe's secrets by finding them in a Christmas cracker or something.As a Turing fan site helpfully pointed out, this movie is more like an extended episode of Downton Abbey, than a tribute to a genius, but with a fresh new look into Britain's awkward and disturbing relationship with \"intelligent\" people, as well as its awkward relationship with its past.",

I knew nothing of this man's contribution to the war effort and his time at Bletchly Park. But I can understand the Official Secrets Act shrouded lots of involvement during this time, and is now only being released for the public domain. Not all though.What was interesting though was when they first realized that a convoy of ships was going to attacked and did nothing, so their secret would not be revealed to the enemy, i.e., that they'd cracked the German code. It opens debate also about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The British warned the Americans that the Japanese Fleet was heading their way. The Americans did nothing or seemed not to take precautions against this intelligence. Churchill was relieved when they attacked knowing that America would now join the war. Strange that some of the carriers were out at sea at the time, and spared destruction. Unfortunately as with most intelligence and wars, the public only know half the story, and only what the government of the day want them to know.However, it was a great movie and it did admit some of the events depicted were dramatized etc., based or inspired by a true story, that's entertainment folks, it was NOT a documentary.",

A strong five stars for the entire cast and crew as well as the script. Kudos to the author of the book bearing the same name on which this movie is based.In this particular movie, the closing scene shows what a significant contribution Alan Turing had made, which now has become an inseparable part of our lives - Computers. The sheer fact that he imagined a computing machine when people had no idea about something of that sort (that too during World War II) - to solve a problem (decoding Hitler's Enigma machine codes) that other highly talented people attempted to solve and failed and then considered unsolvable, which he claimed could be made to think as well, that now inspires All, shows that people like him can \"see\" far further than anyone can even vaguely imagine at the time. He seemed to have understood very early on that to beat a machine that generated random codes with millions of possible settings every single day, with the entire set of codes changing every day at midnight, they would need to build a machine to work fast enough to decode the codes and assist the huge number of cryptographers who were working at the time. He proposed a machine into which they could feed the codes taken from Enigma intercepts and out would come the decoded message like magic. He was also intelligent enough to advise the government not to act on every decoded message so as to keep the German soldiers from suspecting that their secret regarding the Enigma machine has been discovered as that would have rendered all their efforts worthless. That obviously did not go down well with some people as shown in the movie, but it did serve its ultimate purpose - Help Britain win what people thought was a lost war. I believe that all of this is not possible without God's grace. Its only possible with God's grace that he also had the immense patience and intelligence required to bring about such a revolution and turn his imagination into a reality.I don't know how many people have watched the movie \"The Man Who Knew Infinity\", but that movie, just like this one points to the fact that geniuses in most cases are born not into a rich family with a luxurious lifestyle and under peaceful circumstances but in circumstances when geniuses are least expected. In most cases they are also different from other people in their abilities and the way they think and live. They are people with imagination which people of their time considered madness to a certain degree. In many cases they have serious shortcomings too. Take Thomas Alva Edison for example, who is believed to have suffered from dyslexia yet he invented something which said goodbye to darkness forever, in addition to more than a thousand other useful things.",

There wasn't a single wasteful moment as all of the focus and attention was constantly on Alan and his incessant and obsessive quest to decipher the enigma and it's messages. I didn't really know anything about him before watching so I did wonder as the movie progressed whether it was his exceptionally high intelligence that presented a barrier for his personality that saw him come across as cold and a 'monster'. When we learn of his hidden homosexuality during a time where it was legally punishable we then see underneath the surface and realise that he has been bearing a burden for a number of years. We see how his work saved potentially millions of lives and are compelled to feel utterly helpless and disgusted at the way he was treated thereafter on account of his sexuality. Fortunately for us we live in a better world than he did. Such a man did not deserve persecution and a tragic, inglorious end but I cherish the fact that this fantastically acted portrayal has shed some light on Alan's story and acts as a form of gratitude to his incalculable achievements. Cumberbatch is utterly compelling in his role as Alan, and the supporting roles are to a man magnificent. Very worthy watching.",

            "content": "The problem for a present day viewer of the Alan Turing story is that we may be inclined to say that the world has moved on and that nobody today would have to face what he faced. The bias, the bigotry, the inhumanity. If only. If only. Because when one predilection becomes less \"shameful\" another soon replaces it. We are more understanding of sexual differences - though far from everywhere. We perhaps can tolerate personality differences in pursuit of a valued goal - though not always. But the human species can always find a new cruelty to inflict on those who are not as we are. And can rejig it's norms as often to exclude as it does to include.Turing was a loner not just intolerant of those who could not think as he did (which was pretty much everybody) but puzzled as to why things he saw with clarity they didn't see at all. Breaking Enigma was easy for Turing at an intellectual level. But the actual practical implementation required him to take the commonplace - mechanical objects and machines - and assemble them so that his intellect could use them. It also required him to work with people who were just one rung, or slightly more, below him at the very top of the intelligence chain.At the end of the movie we are told an estimate of what the breaking of Enigma did in saving lives (countless millions ) and shortening the War. Two years at least. But Turing was less a hero than a casualty of all this. He was far from the only person whose post war life (tragically short in his case) was an anticlimax. But you simply cannot judge Turing as a man or as a genius by present day standards. Indeed why judge him at all?\"The Imitation Game\" is not judgemental nor is it hagiography. There is something of a guilt-driven retrospective about the Turing story with a pardon and his appearance as a worshipped British icon, but not here. I suspect that he would find all this as preposterous as it is too much too late. In stopping the story shortly after his death we are spared the hand-wringing.The movie takes a few minor liberties with the true story for dramatic effect - the Keira Knightly character is rather more glamorous than the person on whom she was based. So this isn't a biography with meticulous attention to detail, but near enough for most of us. Bletchley Park is an available memorial for those who want to know the story of Enigma and once, fifty years on, the full story could be told it was.Benedict Cumberbatch gives a superb performance as Turing and Knightly is also good. The production values are high. For me the challenge was to see if the game of imitation also meant that we have emerged more from darkness into light by channelling genius to help improve our tolerance and understanding in the post war years. I'm not really sure that we have.",

Ordinary things is boring and wont bring any changes. Benedict did a fine job as Alan, from being a curious over the head thinker (like he always does in Sherlock) to an insecure man. Oh! The young Alan did a great job especially that scene where he tries to hide his tears upon receiving the sad news about Christopher form the headmaster. All the characters were well played and the scenery of the movie is spot on specifically for the WW period.What's more striking about the movie is the indication of the way homosexuals are being treated back then.

Alan Turing had to kill himself at the age of 41, while the world moves on without knowing anything of his contribution and even the existence of the man. I congratulate both the book writer and all the filmmakers, particularly the director and the screenwriter, for adding to our humanity this story of a forgotten but highly significant man. This story also shows that the necessary evil of politics and some social judgments like the then illegality of homosexuality have deprived so many good sides of human progress. It is a tragedy that most people are not as smart as a few special ones, and they tend to attack those few violently and stupidly. This film's script is awarded an Oscar, and it deserves the honour every inch of the way. Concise and sharp language.

I find the film and eye opening journey as it reveals how the greatest war was won by Five people , the best code breakers in the world .At the same time it shows how Turing had a rough childhood and lost his only friends , the person he loved the most and how being a homosexual leads to a very difficult life both before and even worse after the war which ultimately leads to his suicide. From the day they met to the Alan's working on the machine and finally when it's working that moment is heart pounding when they decide that who will live and who will not so as not to make the Germans suspicion. From Turing's marriage to his being isolated is also a very sad story of a homosexual man in Britain as then it was banned in Britain then. Now when in 2013 he was awarded a royal pardon by her majesty and today even more men who were accused of indecency are also pardoned is so better today. How turing machines turned to computers today is fascinating. I am typing here because of Turing only. Although his death is sad at the end but his love towards his machine Christopher and the idea behind 'The Imitation Game' that separates machines from humans is really well executed.

The film was downright amazing, and it's really hard for me to say that for many. The story was intriguing and meaningful. Turing was a mathematician, cryptanalyst and genius. Drawn to solving puzzles, of which the hardest was the Enigma which the Germans used to cipher their messages, he applied to the government department which aimed to crack the impossible Enigma. Being what was viewed as odd and even off- putting, he and his work in building the universal deciphering machine - what we now call the computer- is targeted by everybody. But what i expected to be tense and suspenseful as the biography of a man who struggled to decipher the Enigma code and win the war against Germany (which it was), also became something deep and personal. The character of Alan Turing was truly the heart of the movie; i began to care for the raw, sensitive character which Benedict Cumberbatch brought to life. Seemingly narcissistic but at the core a complex and lonely man (who also brought little instances of humour), he is truly one to fall for. Some characters were portrayed very shallowly - but that might ironically represent their personalities. The directing of the film was astounding. The interweaving of time periods in the life of Turing was surprisingly clean and intelligent. I always love woven narratives because i think that you gain a good sense of the character and their story; what has created them and shaped them, and this is a prime example. Having recently read up on a brief biography of Alan Turing, i am aware that the movie was in many ways factually inaccurate. However, as a great movie alone i still believe it deserves its high rating. If you are looking for a thought-provoking movie with the ability to resound with you, don't miss this one. Really. I have already decided to see it again in the cinema next week. There are so many things to love, and of course i cannot skip this quote: \"Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.\"",

The movie in general is about a machine developed by Turing to break Germany's Enigma machine. This machine was later developed by scientists to create the Turing Machines which is now known as computers. The Imitation Game is more than the invention of a machine. It's about acceptance. It questions the degree of acceptance that we as a society have in regard to the uniqueness in each one of us. Alan Turing is known as the father of computer science and he was homosexual. As the movie's creators say, 'It took a man with secrets to break the biggest one.' I believe if I say anything further, there is high chance that I might spoil the story for some of you. In all, it was totally worth the wait (around 1 and a half years for me), and Benedict Cumberbatch being a great actor as he always is, has done an excellent job.",

That's very impressive.Trying to cover several stages in the life of Alan Turing doesn't leave enough time to tell everything that needed to be told, but since it had to fit in a commercial, cinema-friendly 114 min package, I'd say that's quite understandable.

It's about evaluating the algorithm and evaluating all the algorithms that can solve the problem, which is the science of analyzing the complexity of algorithms. It's a huge breakthrough on ideas, thoughts, and minds, rather than methods. It's a little pity that there is no apple at the end of the movie, which is quite an symbol of him and Apple Inc., and the whole IT industry. Respect his outstanding mind, and his remarkable work. He is a genius, and genius is different. It's still hard to believe that all hi-tech things are based on Turing Theory for hundreds of years. How can a man with 41 years of short life have that much power to impact the whole world for that long? That is the true wisdom. Great music, BTW. Just like world war II style. Like it.",

            "content": "This is a splendidly executed re-creation of the epic events that eventually led to Britain's almost continuous cracking of the top-secret daily machine settings of Germany's \"Enigma\" code throughout most of WWII, so that they could read and act upon the Wehrmacht's encrypted military messages. Determining those daily settings demanded the manipulation of massive amounts of mathematical data... an overwhelming task for the teams of mathematicians and cryptanalysts at the government's top-secret cypher center at Bletchley Park, north of London. The British had obtained a working copy of the German 'Enigma' machine... but it was a useless boat anchor without knowing the Germans' top-secret daily machine settings.The protagonist is Cambridge mathematician Alan Turing (brilliantly portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch), who quickly determined that a computing device must be created to deal with the massive amounts of data that had to be manipulated daily to determine that day's machine settings. The film correctly focuses upon Turing's personal contributions to create the electromechanical computing machine (the \"Bombe\") that accomplished that task, how it helped to both win and significantly shorten the war, and on the unfortunate events that led eventually to his code breaking and life-saving achievements being disregarded by the British government.IMHO, the film should've perhaps devoted more time to depict some of the fascinating wartime secrets revealed in advance by Turing's machine: such breathtaking top secrets as the locations throughout the Atlantic of Germany's U-boat wolfpacks, the German Wehrmacht's surprise invasion of The Soviet Union (22 June, 1941)... even the radio traffic of Luftwaffe fighters as they approached and shot down (actor/secret British envoy) Leslie Howard's aircraft on 1 June, 1943. It's a MUST-SEE flick--and one that you must follow attentively: missing a single line of dialogue can lead to your missing out on an important plot nuance or a gem of tongue-in-cheek humour.",

And some of the things in the movie seem historically inaccurate and to be just blunt too Hollywood. But I'll let the viewers watch that without pointing it out. And who knows maybe they will miss it. Cause the acting is phenomenal. And that is saying a lot. Cause in this generation I haven't seen anything of the sort. I took off one point cause still to this day we can't really get females part correctly. While every one else suffers some kind of loss embarrassment or some form of struggle the movie just goes right along the lines with saying \"men should bend over backwards for women\". The girl in the movie wasn't even going to sign up. And he went to chase her down. Typical script in Hollywood. And if she wasn't a good actor and the movie was world war based it would have crashed the whole movie. Thank goodness the movie wasn't a love story. In real life the lady had a very important role as a code breaker. In the movie she seems like she was along for the ride and offered moral support. I love the fact that characters in the movie are dark. The detective, the Mi 6 individual even the colonel (who by the way played in a bad guy in an old eddie murphy movie Golden child) who played an excellent role were all dark characters and very good actors.Like other viewers said things flowed very well. And I like they didn't take the route of explaining the war to people. I myself love watching the history channel and world war two. But I can see that anytime, show me about the egnima machine. This is a must see movie. And one of the few movies I could watch over and definitely learn something.",

Mostly the little things that were historically inaccurate are there only to further along the plot in a cinema-friendly way for audiences who will be largely unfamiliar with the story. From the start, a viewer might think that they were watching another episode of Sherlock, since Mr. Cumberbatch is essentially just playing another socially awkward genius. But very quickly his performance separates itself from Sherlock entirely, and you see a very different sort of man, full of tragedy and longing as much as intelligence. His performance was exceptional and this film is vastly underrated. Keira Knightley demonstrated beautifully that she has grown as an actress since her Pirates days, and she was a great compliment to Cumberbatch's character. Some of the scenes that depict bomb dropping were created in a way that seemed out of place with the film, they were strangely animated. The last 20 minutes of the film will have anyone with a soul weeping. Written and directed wonderfully,what someone might have considered a boring premise (a war movie about math, or a math movie about war?) takes on a life as though the viewer were living it. This deserves a place among any classic.",

            "content": "\"Sometimes it's the people no one imagines anything of that do the things no one can imagine.\"These words. They're at the heart of this film, and echo so profoundly, indicative of the indomitable human spirit. What can I say about The Imitation Game? What can I say to even do this phenomenal film justice? However can I capture the ways that this film has affected me so profoundly, inspired my heart and then shattered it to pieces in the same two hours. Even with all my prowess of description, and my talent with turn of phrase, this film is beyond words, beyond film even as it is so much more than a movie. I feel like John Keats when it comes to this eager attempt at review. I want a fairer word than fair, a brighter word than bright. The first word that rushed to my mind on impulse was, \"Sparkling.\"The Imitation Game is a masterpiece, a true cinematic achievement in both acting and storytelling. For me it was a fine symphony, intricately crafted, and masterfully brought to life. Benedict Cumberbatch has OUTDONE himself in the defining performance of his career, and without a doubt, the best ever brought to screen. He dazzles, delights, and astounds, effortlessly slipping on Alan Turing's shy, quirky shoes, and seems to feel so comfortable in them, giving us a performance for the ages. He plays Alan Turing with such conviction, such beautiful fragility, endearing him to our hearts. The audience can't help but feel drawn to this sweet, shy, oddly intriguing genius, affable and awkward, and we're ready to follow him on this incredible journey, completely unaware of the horrors that await our charming code breaker. Mr. Cumberbatch's prowess to shapeshift and express emotion is like Alan's exceptional mind for arithmetic, preternatural to the point of seeming BEYOND all human ability. I must stand and applaud for my mind has been dazzled by an effortlessly exquisite performance, and in the same two hours dismayed by a great and appalling injustice. He dons Alan's persona so aptly, so sensitively, with such reverence that even Alan's own nieces have said it was like having their uncle back again, a statement that is not surprising to me in the least. The care, the painstaking devotion, the relentless attention to detail, and the overwhelming admiration and compassion, Benedict has for this man is exuberantly evident throughout his performance, making this film a stunning tribute to Mr. Turing's life and legacy. I think Alan, if he were still alive today, would have been deeply honoured and incredulously proud of the extraordinary man that told his story with such talent, humour, intellect, wit and heart. Benedict gave Alan a voice, both literally and figuratively, and now at last everyone will finally recognize him as the War Hero and unrivaled Mathematics Genius he truly was.The Imitation Game excels at every turn, flourishes in every aspect of film making. Benedict is matched perfectly with the beautiful Miss Keira Knightly who shines as Joan Clarke, and holds her own next to the effervescent acting powerhouse, Benedict presents. She's so sweet and lovely and full of grace and wit, playing the brilliant Miss Clarke, an intelligent bright-eyed young woman who far exceeds the men in their own profession. She's got such a quiet strength, such charm and a formidable presence, those quick dark eyes, seeing Alan as few people can, a friend, and a man who will one day change the world. Her chemistry with Benedict's Turing is instant, platonic of course, but still intimate in a way that she understands him like no one else can. The scene where Alan lies in order to protect her, but still hurts her so deeply, inciting a swift backhand, still stings........... Their friendship is so beautiful, and is the heart of the film, proving them to be a fascinating team, that I hope will find themselves in many more movies together. Matthew Goode also adds his own delicious talent and foil as Alan's enemy turned friend, Hugh Alexander, and up and coming Alex Lawther is so sweet and unbelievably perfect as the young Alan Turing, mirroring Ben's talent and adding his own signature to the role in a way that is almost uncanny. It's no wonder to me that this exceptional cast of beautifully talented young actors have been called, The Dream Team. The eclectic and cohesive blend of talent makes for an ensemble that is unrivaled.One scene in particular, is deserving of an Oscar all on its own. The final scene. Joan goes to visit Alan after he's been sentenced for gross indecency, and undergoing rigorously erosive estrogen injections. He's so pale, and frail, unlike we've ever seen him. It's so hard to watch. This beautiful, kind, brilliant man has been betrayed by the country he so selflessly championed and triumphed, and now its infliction eats away and decays the genius mind that once proved its salvation. Alan's hands shake, the pain glints in his eyes so full of quiet desperation. Tears welling in those traumatized eyes, he turns away from Keira, completely breaking down, giving way to the heart wrenching sobs and cries out, \"I don't want to be alone! Please don't leave me alone!\" I absolutely lost it, and still sob so painfully no matter how many times I see it. There's something so poignant about that moment, something so raw, and unnervingly real, that strikes to the heart. It's not just Alan crying out those words, but Benedict himself, channeling his own heartbreak and anguish, making this performance all the more gripping and powerful. My whole life long, I will never forget those words, and the quiet, desperate way he said them.Decades from now they'll still be talking about Benedict Cumberbatch's Alan Turing, and how it set the precedent for excellence in future film performance. So the question is............\"Are you paying attention?\"",

            "content": "The Imitation Game is by far and large the Benedict Cumberbatch show. Credit where credit is due, he does actually sell the role for the most part. It is just a shame that the plot seems so eager to please his character progression at every turn. Knightley marries him and declares she wants to spend the rest of his life with him despite the fact that they do not romantically love each other. The fate of the war relies on him, because it is he who gets to decide what to do with sensitive intelligence information. Matthew Goode alternatively despises him and stands up for him when the plot needs him to so that we can identify with Cumberbatch's struggles. It is one thing to make a biopic center on a character and another to make to world revolve around him.That is not to say that the movie doesn't work. The Imitation game centers around Alan Turing and his struggle to figure out a mathematical code and at once his place around others. And there really are good parts to be enjoyed here. The fight against figuring out how the Enigma can be deciphered is a compelling one. Seeing Turing trying to figure out how to balance his feelings for his wife, his moral sense and his obligations to his friends is equally enticing. It is in these segments that we actually get a feel about the struggles Turing must have endured as a homosexual man scoring on the spectrum.In the end, the biggest fault in the whole movie is that it tries to please too hard. It goes through lengths to portray Turing's autistic and homosexual side, all the while assuring us how good the people are who accepted these sides of him and how evil the persons were that condemned them. It's an easy way to pat ourselves and our 21st century beliefs on the shoulder, without giving much nuance to true environment Turing must have found himself to be in. The movie can tell Turing all it wants that it's a good thing to be such a lateral thinking genius deviant, but in the end I don't think he particularly bought it, and neither did I.",

I don't mind creative license in movies, but in this case it was unnecessary and way too much.",

Once in a while, a true gem of film hits the screen and really does earn the right to be a 'really must see'. The Imitation Game is one of those films.Many of my prior reviews concentrate on big budget, big action, big blockbuster which is fine. Here in this film, is an example of pure balance. From the beautiful tranquil scenes in the countryside to the bleak cold waters of the Atlantic, this film captures many life stories. Some of them are never shown, yet by the virtue of one man and his drive, they are there.The Imitation Game tells the story of Alan Turing and his fellow mathematicians as they attempt to break the torturous enigma code during World War II. The film has a time-travel feel to it, as it shows how Turing became interested in codes from an early age. The film is based on the book by Andrew Hodges - 'Alan Turing:The Enigma'. I have not read the book myself, however after watching the film I may well have to read it.The story is well constructed, showing just how easy a good film can be made. The pace is perfect, the 'time-travelling' does not distract from the story telling. Despite some reviews, I could not find fault with anyone's performance. Cumberbatch throws off the Holmes character and makes you believe in the torture of the genius. The rest of the main cast can't be considered as anything other than equal in how they portrayed their respective characters. I am aware there are some short cuts in the movie, but then to tell anything of length you might as well make it a television soap. At that point you would lose the grandeur of the film.It did have me griped from the start. The movie told a difficult story of spying and code breaking wonderfully without the need to be abrasive. It also gave the background to the major character Alan Turing. What makes a film work for me, is believable people. There was the hint of more that just kept you watching. Building of the code breaker itself was unique, it was in effect one of the first computers. Others will tell you that the Poles did have some success cracking some of the code. However, as with many break through's there is that element of luck. That luck was very simple but it made the difference.What made this film have an added touch, was with the discovery of the code, the responsibility that came with it. I won't give that part away. This secret was kept for over 50 years and that had its own destructive consequences. There was a sad element to the film, yet it never saddened the film until the end. For those of you who did not know, this was a film based on true events and true people. Thos people were kept hidden from many and this is a part of their story. As a rating, I would give this 5/5.http://drawnonwords.co.uk/the-imitation-game-review/",

Benedict Cumberbatch played Alan Turing incredibly well as well as Alex Lawther and you could see how their presentation of the character were very similar to one another.

Rarely do I enjoy a movie so much to be compelled to write a review about it, but evidently this one was an exception. I'm no film expert, so I won't try to critique the screenplay and cinematography and stuff because firstly I won't know how and secondly, everything just looked absolutely amazing so I have nothing bad to say. The writing was brilliant, the movie was intense and exciting the whole way through, and I was disappointed that it had to come to an end. I'm very interested in cryptography and computers, but I saw it with my family, who aren't interested in computers at all, but they all loved the movie too and were as excited as I was.The one 'complaint' that I have, which isn't really a complaint and won't bother anyone besides picky math nerds, is that since this was a story that involved mathematical genius, the name \"Euler\" shouldn't have been mispronounced. Keira Knightley mispronounced \"Euler\" midway through. This doesn't affect how amazing the movie was, I almost forgot about it, and certainly most people won't even notice.I rate this one a 9.5/10, and strongly recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game is a striking film, a masterfully made film, and a film that was cowardly in its promotion.We need films about the horrific way gay individuals, especially men, were treated in times not all that long ago. We need these films more than another burly combat film, or another edge-of-your- seat action flick, or another battle focused tall tale. I am confused by critics who say this film did not portray Turing's homosexuality enough, it is prevalent, the more steadfast theme than any other. I am left to assume many have only watched the trailers and not the entire film.This movie, represented as a war/spy/thriller type foray, is a film primarily about a genius of a man, comprised of so much more than what he was attracted to, who's life is mangled bit by bit, and finally ended, by his homosexuality. It could be seen as dancing around this point for the first third (though not a light dance, more a loud and aggressively obvious lindy hop) and then showcases it. I respect the film for its open exploration in the life of an individual who was torn down by disgusting bigotry and fear others had for those out of the \"norm\", and while I cannot help but feel the film ranked Turing's sexuality above his genius, an occasionally irksome decision, it is an understandable path on a social level, and one I deem necessary.The acting is superb, Cumberbatch is occasionally accused of playing the same role over and over and I have seen such said in relation to this film, but Alan is not a role. He was a living, breathing, fascinating individual that Cumberbatch captures with as much subtle but spot on accuracy as he could muster. Every actor in this film was well chosen, there is an easy chemistry between all involved, a refreshing change from many films.You do not have any excess of love for any of the individuals represented, Turing included, but they are profoundly human in their sufferings and their victories. This film is not one dimensional and it does not bow down to the humans that inspired it, nor does it need to. There are even surprising, if somewhat brief, moments of humour throughout, saving it from becoming droll, preachy, or alienating.There's always the big question: Does this movie have, as so many are calling it, an \"agenda\"?Yes, it does. This isn't the film many people were hoping it would be, it is not action packed, it is rarely tense, but it is deeply affecting. I know without a doubt that a good percentage of individuals that went to see this film were hoping for something polar opposite from what they got, but I like to think that those individuals had their eyes opened to something arguably, at this point, more important than another film about \"taking d0wn HitLer!!11/1!\" or battlefield glory. This film is not about the war, it is about the man that strayed outside of any socially acceptable life and changed the world. It is undeniable that the focus on him could be considered cloying, but it can be forgiven in the overall picture.I recommend this movie wholeheartedly, be you a mere fan of Cumberbatch, a Turing aficionado, or just looking for a film to immerse yourself in when you have little else to do. It is not perfect, I will make no claim to that, but it grabs you. It is not overwhelmingly sad nor is it falsely happy, it is human, it will make you think, it will open your mind to a variety of things, and maybe, just maybe, in one way or another, it can help better you. 8/10",

Benedict Cumberbatch is outstanding in his portrayal of Turing, whose life story has two major facets: the development of the machine and later in his life being charged for the crime of being gay. The fault in The Imitation Game is director Morten Tyldum's attempts to tell both stories. Ultimately, the story of Turig's inhumane sentence \u2014 forced to undergo painful hormonal treatment to reverse his libido \u2014 was seemingly crammed into the movie, not giving it enough justice. His story would've been better served as a 90-minute movie, focusing on the machine, or a 3-hour epic, covering his life.",

            "content": "\"What am I? Machine, human? A war hero or a criminal?\"Human. War hero.Alan Turing, pioneer in computer science, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, marathon and ultra distance runner. A brilliant man with many extraordinary talents.The Imitation Game follows Turing from his early years attending boarding school, his work during WWII, to the investigation, interrogation and ultimately his sentencing during the early 1950s.Benedict Cumberbatch beautifully plays Alan Turing; bringing him to life and showcasing what an incredible mind this strange but undeniably lovable man had. Cumberbatch has built up an impressive resume throughout his career. Just in the last few years he's been in Oscar nominated films August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, The Hobbit Trilogy, Star Trek Into Darkness, and has given superb performance in television series Parade's End and BBC's Sherlock. However, Cumberbatch gives his best performance to date. He brings something to Turing that dissociates him from any other character he's played, raising the bar higher once again. It's the little things that Cumberbatch executes which make this performance resonate. His elongated breathes, his fixating distant eyes, his light-hearted giggles, and even just twitching his facial muscles, heightens his imitation of Turning.Cumberbatch wasn't the only one that played his part remarkably. Keira Knightley's sweet, eager and increasingly independent, Joan Clarke, delivers an outstanding counterpart and companion for Turing. Knightley has a subtlety to her acting that doesn't leave her outshone by her fellow actors; it only pushes her further into the limelight, making her performance believable and relatable on many different levels.However, Matthew Goode, Allen Leech, Matthew Beard and Rory Kinnear all give amazing performances that should not be forgotten or taken lightly. And with the recent Ensemble Performance Award win at Palm Springs International Film Festival, it may be harder to do so, especially if the awards keep coming.Another aspect that stands out is the writing. First time feature film writer, Graham Moore, has developed a lyrical and yet mechanical story that ebbs and flows through four decades. It's beautifully haunting from start to finish and takes the audience on an emotional journey. The writing never felt rushed and everything shown felt connected and conclusive. It almost felt like a ticking clock, counting down the decades, years and moments of importance in Turing's life. The timeline and its portrayal is a favourite element of mine.Moretn Tyldum's directing approach was perfect for this story. It comments on everything in a subtle way while pulling you into the complex emotion of the piece that both engrosses and disgusts you. It explores the horrors of war, the dilemmas and the ultimate sacrifices in a visually cinematic crowd pleaser. Tyldum allowed his actors the freedom of expression by using medium to close up shots in dialogue driven scenes. He singles out the emotion and strain in characters during pivotal scenes without taking focus away from what's being said.Oscar Faura's cinematography allows light, darkness, pain and hope to incandesce through the audience. Every single shot is dealt with such care and attention to detail. He creates an atheistically compelling semblance for the audience.The editing of this film is another excellent example of The Imitation Game's charm. William Goldenberg won an Oscar for his work in Argo. He demonstrates time after time the importance of storytelling. He allows emotion to seep through in suspense building scenes, and can find it no matter how small or big the scene appears. He slows and quickens the pace when needed to build tension, suspense, drama and joy. Goldenberg knows how to make an audience scream with joy, ache with pain and cry in anguish. Oscar nominated Alexandre Desplat composed an eerily beautiful score that's full of rich and raw emotion. What sets apart Desplat's score is the instrumentation of three pianos. Drama scores are usually orchestrated to rely heavily on the string section with piano in the background. Even though Desplat uses strings to push our emotions and forge movement, the clear star is his melodic piano phrases.By using three pianos that intertwine, he creates melodic and rhythmic complexity that mirrors chaos and Turing's quick, fast paced brilliant mind. He composes a sense of mechanics turning and clicking away, heavily alluding to how Turing himself is a machine. Some of my favourite tracks are: The Imitation Game, U-Boats, Alone With Numbers, The Machine Christopher, Decrypting, A Different Equation and Alan Turing's Legacy. What is also remarkable about The Imitation Game is how it underlines the view of homosexuality and femininity in today's society. It comments on many relevant assumptions, opinions and beliefs that surround being gay or trying to prove yourself. But what it distinguishes best is the prejudices against anyone who is different.Cumberbatch has stated in interviews that he hopes this film acts as a celebration of Turing's life. Since I was unaware of whom this man was I believe it will not only act as a celebration, but also an education for many generations to come.",

The title,is derived from Turing's proposal that a so-called imitation game be employed as a means of investigating whether or not machines might one day be said to imitate humans and \"think.\"It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the British crypt-analyst Alan Turing.Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Turing as arrogant and condescending and anything but sociable or likable, but eccentric in an admirable way that is oddly endearing.The narrative revolves around the device that this code-breaking mathematician created that cracked the notoriously difficult, perhaps even unbreakable Enigma code that the Nazis used for virtually all their military communication \u2013- from mundane weather reports to crucial tactical maneuvers \u2014 during World War II.And what was it that he conjured up? A little thing we call the computer.Prime minister Winston Churchill once described it as the single biggest contribution to the Allied victory.Turing's efforts essentially stopped the Nazis' path through Europe, helping to win the war and save millions upon millions of lives.Ironically, though, after their game-changing breakthrough, Turing's team must keep their accomplishment hidden lest the Germans find out that their secret transmissions are being intercepted. So it would obviously be a very long time until the record would be set straight, although no one would have guessed that it would take quite this many years.But not only was his part in the cessation of the war more or less taken for granted during the conflict \u2014 with much of his work remaining classified for decades thereafter \u2013- but in 1952 he was convicted of \"gross indecency\" for the crime of being homosexual.",

I was already familiar with Turing from having seen an excellent play called \"Breaking The Code\" about 18 years ago. Alan Turing should by all rights be a commonly known figure due to his pioneering work on early computer technology which aided the allies in breaking the \"unbreakable\" enigma code. This code was a method of encryption used by the Germans to communicate battle plans to their military during the war. Turing was successful in creating a computer which was able to break this code and as a result millions of lives were saved and the war was shortened by about two years . Quite an amazing achievement for which he was awarded the OBE (British equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor). All of the work he was involved in on that project was kept top secret for about 50 years after WWII ended. Additionally, Turing was gay, and at the time Britain had virulently homophobic laws, and though he should have been touted as a national hero, he was persecuted under this oppressive law and forced to take female hormones in an attempt to suppress his (natural) sexual tendencies.\u00a0 As a result, he committed suicide within a couple years of this, and his name was effectively erased from the public record. This film shines a light on this brilliant man who was a true hero. A fantastic film. Benidict Cumberbach is outstanding as Turing, and should win many awards for this performance.",

And it came as no surprise when I'd found out that Hollywood had turned his work for the Allies in WWII and the subsequent years of his life into a biopic. It is quite an amazing story which deserves to be told, and The Imitation Game tells it quite entertainingly.It also came as no surprise that they picked Benedict Cumberbatch, popular for his role as a genius detective, to play the role of Turing, a genius computer engineer. In fact, the parallels between the roles are so striking that it felt like the credits should read, \"Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes, playing Alan Turing.\" There's even one of those Sherlockian \"Eureka!\" moments thrown into the movie. A moment which was worked in for dramatic effect, but also came across as a bit forced and lazy.In fact, my only big criticism of The Imitation Game is that a lot of this movie comes across as being dramatized rather than true. It seems like a lot of extra narrative was thrown into the mix, adding a lot of extra heavy-handed messages about the morality of war, women's rights, bullying, autism, etc. I'd have been nice to see a more straight-forward telling of the story.In spite of these criticisms, there is a lot to like about The Imitation Game: Keira Knightley had a great character. The scenes of Turing's childhood hit all the right emotional notes, and Alex Lawther - an actor who'd I'd never heard of before - did a great job as Young Alan Turing. And overall it was an engaging movie with only a few slow spots here and there. And fans of the BBC's Sherlock (with Cumberbatch) will definitely enjoy it.",

If an actor can portray a part in a fictitious manner to create sympathy and compassion for a specific group without regard to actual facts, is this good acting? I liked the movie itself, however, I am the type that goes home and does research on the actual facts surrounding the movie and characters themselves. This movie is very loosely based on the life of Alan Toring, and contains many historical inaccuracies. Historical inaccuracies not only in facts about the Enigma Machine, historical inaccuracies about the main characters themselves. The actual history of the matter shows that the Enigma Code was broken in 1932, by Marian Rejewski. One can look at the Wiki article on, \"The Imitation Game,\" to see the many historical inaccuracies. So, why did Cumberbatch and Knightley portray this type of great acting jobs for these characters? The acting seems great, but when one looks at the facts they are not like the characters of history. They are both trying to create the type of compassion and sympathy for Gay Rights, (end of the film), the very type of compassion that Britain has demonstrated recently towards the historical Alan Toring. My problem, and this is not gay bashing, rather to point out that Cumberbatch is portraying a stereotypical acting job of what a gay person is like. If you are gay and reading this, see the movie, (and it is a well done movie), review the history, step back and say to yourself, \"Is that the stereotype I want a portrayed for a gay person?\" * An almost autistic person that has social problems. In fact, he got along with his co-workers. * The machine was named the \"Bombe,\" not after Christopher, his real friend that died when he was 18. * The fictitious scenes of Christopher and the way Turing finds out about his death. * The exaggerated relationship between Turing and Clarke, showing Touring as somewhat a monster for his reason to get engaged. * There is historical evidence that Clarke never visited Toring near his death. * There is historical evidence that his treatment inspired Toring to work more in Mathematical Biology due to the treatment. * The treatment ended 14 months before Touring's death. * There is a possibility that the death was not suicide.

This is partially to do with engaging presentation and direction, though the flashbacks also aid in this tremendously.There is not really any way to criticise this movie other than to say that it is a tad predictable in both its character development and plot line, however if you consider that it is meant to be historically accurate it can be forgiven for the latter.To summarise, it is a very good movie with an engaging plot line and developed characters with interesting interactions between them, though it is somewhat predictable.",

I think not being British did help. Putting a fresh perspective on one the most horrific times in history.I feel, the main problem I have with the film is, that it can't decide what to kind of message it wants to give to the audience. The unorthodox bond between Alan and Joan, Sexism in the 1940s and 50s, Homosexuality during the War, Paranoia during the War. I felt it was trying to do too much in 1 Film. An another fault is the showing of Alan Turing, depicted as a socially awkward,snobby Mathematician. I know you need creative writing. But Alan Turing had good relationship with his co-workers, and actually had a sense of humor.One thing annoyed me sadly in the film. As the team cracks enigma, they find what kind of dilemma they are in. This part was given to as the brother of Peter Hilton having to die. This is just forced dramatic effect, but Hilton did have such a brother and Alan would not have had the Authority to decide.But all the little things aside. I felt it was a very solid film, part of that is thanks to Cumberbatch and Knightley. The writers really got to the audience to connect with the characters and immerse themselves in the story, and the score was so good at times, that I didn't notice it and it melted into the scene perfectly.We will have to see, how well it does at the Oscars because the Compition is so good in the categories it is in.",

You need a good compelling story, the Production ability to make the story, a good Director, the ability of the actors to make the scenes believable; from the cinematography, to the soundtrack, etc.One of the things that I left out, is writing.The writing in this movie is what I found to be lacking. The acting by Benedict Cumberbatch was superb, the story matter in itself was enough to make a great movie. All the makings of a good story. You have one of the original Fathers of the computer, whose machine he designed helped win the war for the Allies, coupled with his tragic death due to the fact he was a homosexual, its a story to tell.However, this movie is not written well. I would rather the story had been written linearly, with no flashbacks. Even the flashback at the beginning would have been fine, if they had told the story linearly from there on out, but they didn'tThe flashback to his teen years and his first crush went nowhere and added nothing to the movie. Neither were the flashbacks to the police officer trying to \"solve a mystery\" that in real life wasn't a mystery. (Turing called the police in real life to report the robbery and then he naively admitted to the police his homosexual affair) The whole police matter could have waited till the end of the movie. I can understand wanting that to be significant in explaining Turings eventual suicide, but it wasn't. They also never explained(unless I missed it) all the scenes of him running. Turns out Alan Turing was quite the marathon runner, but that is never explained.I know that 2 hours of people sitting around doing math and trying to solve enigmas would be a boring movie, so they added drama and took some artistic liberties to fill around the specter of war and the race against time.I really liked the material, thought it was sad, yet very interesting movie, but it could have had a much better script",

            "content": "Perhaps this is one of the most surprising films of 2014, because it has left me a great disappointment. I heard of the name of AlanTuring the first time around 5 years ago when reading a book named The Code Book by Simon Singh. This book dedicates a whole chapter to a encrypting machine called Enigma, including some of achievements of breaking down it done by Polish decryption experts in the period just prior to WWII, and achievements from the legendary Bletchley Park in Britain during WWII. Alan Turing is the most prominent figure at that time, no doubt. I also learnt about Turing afterward, and has taken some liking to him since then, a short-lived genius.And Turing in The Imitation Game is quite different. It's a Turing who is dramatized terribly in a movie which is dramatized even more. To the extent of phoniness. Turing (the character in the movie) is described as a super-hero who engages in the most intellectually quintessential place of Britain at that time. Ignore the fact that the movie depicts Turing mistakenly and exaggeratedly, just mention the logic behind the plot. The story of Turing (the character) and his partners' achievements is similar to a tale of being hinted by some god in a summer night. So right in the beginning Turing (the character) rushes into sketching a machine which would be used to break down the Enigma, while during the movie progress there are no suggestions for us to know what is based upon or who he is inherited from in order to create that machine. There is only a mention of Polish in an early scene in the movie as smugglers who slipped the Enigma machine into Britain. And afterward, Turing (the character) and his partners act as God, just do it and achieve it.The movie is overstated and inflated dramatically from the plot to dialogs, which easily arouse viewers' emotion, as a line in the movie spoken by Turing (the character), \"it's because it feels good\". But for me, also copying another line right after (spoken by Turing the character too): sometimes I can't enjoy what supposedly feels good, I have to think what is logical, which really and truly feels good.About a mathematics genius, an alleged father of computer science and artificial intelligence, the movie just delivers some hollow feelings. Alan Turing, I would meet you only through words and books.",

And while I don't necessarily disagree with those reviewers, it did not bother me or take away from the brilliant story that is being told here.It's a good film.

In fact, this movie was inspiring. The whole subject on matter was one man with the last obsession in life, who didn't give a single crap about ''normal'' life or whatever it means. It was simply about one man doing the last act of his life. Did he know this was the last act? Maybe, maybe not. This movie was an instant classic and the years will be kind to it. The performances given by the actors made this movie even better.But the biggest thing about this movie that satisfied me the most, was the fact that it was very VERY dark. It is alongside Raging Bull the darkest biographical movie I have watched so far. The simple dialogue, it feels like I am right there standing. I mean you talk about Alan's prosecution of homosexuality (wich I OBVIOUSLY like most people think is absurd) and the deep tone of this film.... Wow, it was so good.

            "content": "There's a certain inspired irony in the fact that I had to complete a CAPTCHA image to log into this site in order to leave this review, because without Turing and his famous Turing Test (for distinguishing between computer and human via responses), the concept of the CAPTCHA might not exist now.It truly is impossible to overstate the man's importance to the world as we know it, and his death at age 41 was a tragic blow to progress the world over. One can not even fathom what our lives would be like right now had he lived longer and developed into his twilight years.That being said, it is absolutely possible to overstate his accomplishments, as this movie readily shows. My only actual hope is that this movie (this FANTASTICALLY well-made and well-acted movie, mind you) will compel the viewer to at least go to Wikipedia and research the life of the man depicted. Let's count off the major historical problems with this dramatization:Turing was an oddball,there is no doubt. He would chain his coffee mug to a radiator so no one could steal it, if that gives you any clues. He was hard to understand, but not a misanthrope. He was not a sociopath. He did not alienate every one of his colleagues only to win them back with two minutes of screen time in which he gives his co-workers an apple and an awkwardly bad joke (seriously, movie? THAT's your idea of conflict resolution?)Turing did not invent the bombe (the electro-mechanical proto-computer used to break the Enigma codes), the Poles did. The English team worked off of the Polish plans, which Turing enhanced. Indeed, the Poles had been breaking Enigma codes for years, trying to stay abreast of the Germans, who would constantly update and alter the machines.There was no problem getting the bombe built. In fact, everyone in cryptology in the world at the time knew it was impossible to break Enigma by hand, and that a bombe was the only solution there was. Funds /were/ tight, that is true, but the funding problem was solved overnight after the ENTIRE TEAM sent a letter to Churchill, not just Turing. Turing was not made the head of the team in such a way, and did not just fire people outright. There was also not just one bombe. There were dozens upon dozens of the things built, all over England (and indeed, all over the world. The Americans built vastly more codebreaking computers than the English did by the end of the war).Turing and his team had no control over the information. Everything about MI6 and Turing is a complete fabrication (indeed, it was MI1 which became the organization that Turing joined up to make the Bletchly Park bombe), and the idea that such a team would have any input on military movements is absurd.Perhaps most importantly, Turing might not have even killed himself. As is shown in the movie (in an oddly subtle nod to truth), Turing worked often and extensively with cyanatic materials (used to smelt gold to make electroplated parts for his computers), and it's entirely feasible that he inhaled the cyanide that killed him rather than intentionally ingesting it. Turing endured his barbaric treatment with good spirits, according to his contemporaries and friends, and never seemed the type to seek suicide. While that's not proof, it's a far cry from the shaking, weeping wreck we see depicted in the film, for the sole intent of tugging the audience's heartstrings and earning undue sympathy. Turing was unable to work for the government after his conviction, but he held his teaching and academic positions until his death, during which time he continued to research and write papers without problem.Put bluntly, the ending is so callously targeted at the viewer's sensitivities that it's borderline offensive in and of itself. Turing has been held up for decades as an LGBT hero (whether he wanted it or not, it would seem)\u2014and frankly, a character as influential and famous as he doesn't need the help of a Hollywood screenwriter. It cheapens the work of the real figure, and diminishes his influence by turning a legitimate world-changing genius into a pariah, a martyr for a cause that wouldn't even exist for another five decades.I realize that offering up a review on a site like this is like gobbing into the sea for all the difference it will make, and I'll readily admit that everything except the \"based on a true story\" elements are fantastic: the acting is top-notch, the cinematography is brilliant, etc, etc, but I hold on to the silent hope that more people will educated themselves about the real man and not take this film at face value.",

Overall this is a serious movie, however like most British movies of recent years there is a mix of crowd pleasing light humor including taunting, teasing, flirting, and witty dialog to keep the movie from getting too dull or tedious and reveal some character aspects.The movie uses flashbacks to trace Alan Turing in his early teens at a boarding school and his close friendship with a classmate with whom he shared a keen interest in mathematics and cryptography. It depicts Turing as an introverted and arrogant person with little social skills who is brilliant in mathematics and and a top level mathematician in Britain. It traces the ups and downs of the code cracking team that culminated in the breaking of the Enigma code.Setting aside the simplifications necessary in telling a story in a feature film and not a documentary, the movie is apparently substantially accurate. There is one subplot involving a Soviet double agent in Turing's team that is not believable at all as we later learn that the cracking of the code was kept secret from even the high echelons of government lest the Germans get wind of it and change the design of the Enigma machine. The security man in charge claims he has allowed the Soviet double agent in Turing's team to let Stalin know of the progress of the effort. The same double agent claims he knows Turing is a homosexual and warns Turing not to blow his cover, otherwise he would reveal Turing's homosexuality, then illegal in Britain and punished by a jail sentence, to the authorities. It is strange that the British security was unable to \"sense\" what the presumed double agent had \"sensed\".This is a movie worth seeing.",

Historians estimate that breaking Enigma shortened the war by more than two years, saving over 14 million lives.

            "content": "It was last night when I finally saw \"The Imitation Game\", and boy was I not blown-away. There was a lot of buzz going around about this movie and even though I knew about this movie even when it was in its post- production stages, I was, for long, trying to avoid watching it. Mainly because I thought it will disappoint me and belittle the man whom I look up to with utmost respect and honor, Alan Mathison Turing. A pioneer in mathematics, computer science, cryptanalysis, the man who, according to Winston Churchill, made the biggest contribution in the result of World War II. I was being skeptical about it only because everyone kept talking about how shocked they were to know about this man about whom they had very little knowledge, about this man who made such a huge contribution in WWII but was later forced to commit suicide due to his sexual orientation, but I already knew all this. And all that these reviews kept on doing was to make me affirmative that its all about the stuff I already knew about. But I was wrong, like all those other reviews. Its so much more than only that. This movie has some stellar performances, an excellent narrative, a brilliant direction and a good screenplay. It takes you into a world full of cryptology and code- breaking, but still doesn't hamper with your brain. It makes you feel that you are a part of the race, the race against time, a race which would eventually decide the fate of the trauma engulfing the world. The narrative is brilliantly paced, it has a cinematic tension and the point where all this builds up to a point where it just flows out, you yourself become ecstatic, I literally started jumping, laughing and crying, because Enigma was cracked.The movie shows what power does movies possess, the power to move you, to make you cry, laugh and jump all at the same time. I must applaud Benedict Cumberbatch, who took on to the job in a way that I think no one else could have done. He really resembled Alan Turing in more than one way.I also would like to point out a few things that didn't go down well with me, one of them is that even though this movie was a thriller, it was a huge opportunity to introduce to the world a little more about Alan Turing as a person and not just a machine. It was a huge platform which could have been used as to show his condition after the war, his fight within himself to lead a life alone, after all he had gone through.But still this movie creates more than just a few ripples, it really enlightens you about a man who deserved better. No matter whether you are a noob about Alan Turing or an expert, you can watch it and enjoy and be thrilled.",

I note that there are a number of historical inaccuracies regarding a number of the characters (including Turing). When you consider that the films is based on a book(Alan Turing: the Enigma)why is it that screenplay writers and directors can't stick to the facts?

The direction of Morten Tyldum is very good. The score is stunning, very emotional and suit for the movie. The performances are incredibly good; Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best work as Alan Turing, as I watched the film I could totally empathize with him and understand his pain. Keira Knightley performance as Joan Clarke is really good too and there's good chemistry between the two. The screenplay written by Graham Moore is very interesting, but still, the main flaws of the movie are found in it's script. It felt like the film focused on the war more than it has focused in Alan's life. The screenwriter should have given us more details about Alan's relationships with the men and more about his sexuality. In the last minutes of the film, it's seems like the producers want us to feel empathy for Alan due to discrimination happen in the UK against homosexuals and due to the fact Alan had to hide his sexuality in most of his life. the problem it's they did not focus on his sexuality enough during th film so we cannot feel that much empathy for him.",

            "review_title": "Cumberbatch shines in \"The Imitation Game\"",
            "content": "Can machines think? This is the main question posed in \"Computer Machinery and Intelligence,\" a 1950s paper published by Alan Turing. The paper's concepts surfaced in his single-handed design and construction of a machine that broke the German Enigma codes during World War II\u0085or so the film says. While the historical accuracy of \"The Imitation Game\" comes into question on several occasions, the outstanding quality of the film's acting, direction and story is no enigma. The movie focuses on the life of Alan Turing, a British mathematician, computer scientist and cryptanalyst. The British Intelligence recruits Turing along with other cryptographic minds to crack the Enigma codes that the Nazis use as secret communication during the war. The film's narrative alternates between three significant times in Turing's life: his education at Sherborne School as a teenager, his classified work with Enigma during the war and the investigation surrounding Turing's sexual orientation in 1952. The settings of the Enigma machines change daily as the war progresses. The small group of cryptographers has 18 hours each day to figure out the settings of the machines before the Germans alter the settings the next day. This is a virtually impossible task for the team to accomplish because of the infinite number of possible settings the machine possesses, causing progressive frustration amongst the team. Turing's initial rudeness, apparent social detachment and unwillingness to work with the rest of the team only add to the growing tension. Turing conceives, designs and begins to build a machine that he believes will be able to mull through the numerous Enigma settings possibilities at a considerably fast rate. A machine like this has never been built, much less proved to work. His endeavor brings about much skepticism and agitation from the team. Over time however, especially after the acquisition of Joan Clarke (Keira Knightly) to the team, Turing begins to treat his colleagues with respect and gains their trust.To say that Benedict Cumberbatch had an amazing performance at this point in his career is the equivalent of saying the sky is blue, and it remains blue yet again as Cumberbatch knocks it out of the park. Turing as shown in the film is extremely intelligent but lacks normal social skills. He is not the most likable guy; he has trouble interacting with others, takes everything that is said to him literally and has a sense of arrogance that puts others off. However, there is also warmth about his character and he genuinely desires to be liked by others. Cumberbatch expresses both aspects of this persona beautifully. The supporting cast is equally fantastic. Those who play the members of Turing's team (Matthew Goode, Allen Leach, Matthew Beard and Keira Knightly) have great chemistry with each other and Cumberbatch. Alex Lawther as the young Alan Turing mimics Cumberbatch's portrayal well, and viewers will truly believe the struggles he endures from being different than everyone else. Graham Moore took home an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work on the film, and it's not hard to see why. The well-written script is the fuel for the gripping, emotional drama exhibited in the actors' performances.Morten Tyldum's direction is not to be ignored either. The interchange between the various time periods in Turing's life are done smoothly, and the non-linear story telling is carried out excellently. The writing, directing and acting present Turing's struggle well as a homosexual in the 1950s and the punishment that he had to endure because of it. While both aspects of the production are good from a narrative standpoint, the direction and the writing is also where the main issue of the movie lies.In \"The Imitation Game,\" viewers are led to believe that Turing built the machine that cracked Enigma and conceived its design virtually by himself. In reality however, the Polish Intelligence gave a primitive version of the machine to the Government Code and Cypher School in 1939, and Turing was hired to make improvements on the machine based on his knowledge of computers. Also, unlike the movie portrays; Turing was actually well liked by his colleagues and was placed as the head of the operation until 1942. This is one of several factual errors present in \"The Imitation Game\" that range from Turing giving his machine a name, to John Cairncross being a cryptanalyst and a somewhat influential character in the story. Despite these historical inaccuracies, the movie has received widespread critical acclaim. In addition to winning the Best Adapted Screenplay award, it also received nine Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor.\"The Imitation Game\" is a riveting drama with stellar performances, excellent writing and solid direction. Among the better films of 2014, it remains a must-see for 2015.",

            "content": "Absolutely loved this drama about the brilliant Alan Turing and the \"Enigma\" he and his team of mathematicians decoded during World War II. I had never heard of Turing before and was reluctant to see the movie because I expected it to have a dream-like quality similar to Inception or The Adjustment Bureau. However, it was like neither, as it showed realistically the story of how this man, along with his team of fellow mathematicians, broke the Nazi code and helped the British government decipher German communiques. Along the way there are twists and turns that continue to keep our attention. Benedict Cumberbatch is, of course, spot on as the uniquely gifted Turing, who shows signs of promise from a young age, even though he is seen as a misfit among his peers. The movie does a good job of moving among three time periods in order to tell a fuller story of Turing's life. Throughout, we root for Turing, both in his work and in his personal life. Keira Knightley is very impressive. I have never been much of a fan of hers, but here she is very likable and a great foil for Cumberbatch. Allen Leech of Downton Abbey fame plays a minor supporting character, but doesn't really stand out. I am always a fan of a great group of supporting characters and love to see how they interact and add to a story, but the team of mathematicians here could have been utilized a bit more. I give this movie a 9 (as opposed to 10) for two main reasons in addition to what is mentioned above: 1) the story line taking place in 1951 is a little bit unclear to me as the main detective attempts to solve a crime involving Turing; and, 2) Turing is a homosexual, and the director does a politically correct job of ensuring the audience knows exactly what he thinks about the British government's treatment of homosexuals in the middle of the 20th century, not really adding to the overall story and ending on a slightly bitter note. Really unnecessary at the end of this amazing story of an amazing man who dramatically changed the outcome of the war and whose story that same director told with such skill. The Imitation Game is highly recommended.",

Characters are flat and sadly no one has enough material to work with, a part from the lead actor and the film cannot ride on a brilliance of one man, even if it is Mr. Cumberbatch himself; just as good storytelling cannot rely solely upon the importance of the story being told.

            "content": "Benedict Cumberbatch is becoming one of the most versatile and interesting actors of our time, as demonstrated by his portrayal of Alan Turing, the great mathematician whose work provided the foundation for what has become the most indispensable device of our lives \u2013 the computer. He had an extraordinary mind, without question, and in the end, he paid a heavy price for it.\"The Imitation Game\" takes us through three periods of Turing's life: his days at a British boarding school, the apex of his achievements at Bletchley Park in World War II, and his downfall after being prosecuted for being gay, which led to his 1954 suicide at the age of 41.The film is quite good for what it is, as it covers the facts in an efficient and engaging manner, but it was not nearly long enough; in fact, I would have preferred a television series to more fully explore Turing's character. But in Cumberbatch's capable hands, we get plenty (and, to an extent, Alex Lowther, who plays well the schoolboy Turing). All too often, geniuses are portrayed as normal people with an extraordinary gift, but real geniuses aren't like that. Being so much smarter, they're often isolated socially, and those of lesser gifts are frequently resentful. Cumberbatch's Turing, much like his Sherlock Holmes, seems to be in the grip of Asperger's Syndrome: he's highly focused on his work, and he does not suffer lesser intellects well. He is understandably seen as arrogant and condescending, and there is almost no one at Bletchley Park who would not want to see him dismissed from the team assigned to the toughest problem of the war: breaking the Nazis' Enigma code, once thought to be impossible to crack.Those expecting to see a Sherlock rehash, incidentally, will be pleased to know that, despite the two characters' similarities, Cumberbatch plays them quite differently. His Sherlock is firmly in control at all times, while quite often his Turing has no idea what's going on. Sherlock, neat and stylish; Turing, unkempt with an unflattering haircut. That's what I like about Cumberbatch. You never know what to expect. No wonder he went from obscurity to the A-list in just four short years.But I would have liked to see more: there is only one scene which really explains where Turing's manner comes from, and the script never gets much below the surface to find what made Turing tick.Keira Knightley, thank God, is brought in to lend some welcome femininity to this boys' club; she's the flower in the desert and her liveliness, energy and sass balance Cumberbatch's icy logic and wall of indifference. Her character, Joan Clarke, is the only one who can engage Turing as a human being, and their relationship is touching.The film also gives us a glimpse into how British intelligence worked at the time. World War II saw spycraft at its height. Perennial villain Mark Strong here portrays the crafty Major General Stewart Menzies, the chief of MI-6, at the time the agency existed off the books. He's a master at manipulation, and he wreaks moral havoc on the Turing team. When Menzies is in the room, you have no idea what he wants or what he'll do. From him, Turing learns a lot about the world he didn't want to know.Screenwriter Graham Moore uses Turing's arrest on indecency charges as the film's framing device; Turing tells his story to the detective who initially arrested him on suspicion of being a Soviet spy. The scene which sets up Turing's suicide is very, very sad, and I would be surprised at the person who could sit through it without a tear.I recommend this film as a worthy introduction to a little explored aspect of World War II, and a glimpse into the life of Alan Turing, if not his soul.",

Even or specially the ones with more money/budget and great costumes, try to present modern ideas in old times and they comit two sins in my view, creating evil creatures without taking into account the customs of the period and offering a highly pesimistic, dark vision of the past in Spain, as if in the past people were unable to have happy moments. This film, however, even criticizing the period, recognise the efforts of everybody and shows a positive picture of Britain and the people in that period. I envy that fair treatment.Individuals, without taking into account their political, religious or particular things, are the key.

The others could not get so much attention but they also delivered the expected.I've only had one bigger problem. Actually, i totally lost the interest in the last 15 minutes of the movie, as soon as the main focus (cracking the enigma code) was successfully accomplished the story started to concentrate more on Alan Turing's homosexuality. It broke the interesting storyline and from there it became boring and slow. Until that point the movie was an entertaining thriller with a small amount of drama but at the very end it completely turned into a drama which has no more time to expand. Just for the record ,the real acting challenge for Cumberbatch started from there and he nailed it very well.The movie wanted to be a thriller, drama and biography at the same time the but it could not manage it's own time and forgot to share the focus between these 3 genres. Because of this the overall picture became unbalanced.It is hard to tell what more i wanted, maybe a big twist in the end or a really powerful moment during the interrogation scene could make the movie more memorable.All in all, this is a very demanding movie which can easily entertain different ages and meanwhile able to share interesting facts about another face of the war.",

But later we find out that we were more than enough introduced to the story by the events that occurred on the beginning. And that is clever, good, brilliant, what more is there to say?!Switching between the dates and time seemed a bit random, though. Or at least to me, and that is mainly the only reason I didn't like it. It just didn't feel like it had a strong timeline.The acting is... Well, hold on, you have Benedict Cumberbatch in it. And that's practically the acting level for the whole movie. Extraordinary quality and acting from the heart. The cast to the movie is splendid.So happy I've watched this movie! Can proudly say it deserves every single Nomination and I hope others see it from the point of view I do.9/10, Kruno T, 1/18/2015p.s. This is my first movie review on IMDb.",

We, especially New Yorkers, were completely united in the war to save America and the world. Today just 14 years later we now have forgotten. Regards WWII, people around the world even in the free world, have forgotten. The scene where the Mark Strong character interrupts the code breaking team because they were joking together, and adds that in the time they were chatting three soldiers have died \"I hope they didn't have families, then looking at his watch says there goes another\" is chilling and brought a tear to my eyes.Individuals are shown to be unimportant in the war of wars. Winning was the only option regardless of the horror.Then add to all this that the lead character is destroyed and dies literally by those whom are most in his debt.One of the finest stories I ever heard, the fact it was true makes tears pour down my cheeks.Don't Miss",

I didn't know much about the premise of the story when I started but I'm glad I didn't because the plot wouldn't have the same effect on me if I did. I think the portrayal of Alan Turing was very well done. I think Benedict Cumberbatch captured the right personality for his role. I really enjoyed the interactions between Alan and other characters, especially with Joan and Christopher (although Alan's time with Christopher was cut short unfortunately). I love how he named his machine after his first love and, I will admit, I did shed some tears when Alan broke down about not wanting to be left alone without \"Christopher\" when Joan came to see him as it showed how much hardship he went through just because he was attracted to men, which is pretty relatable. Now I do wish that the movie did a better job on differentiating on when the time changed because for half of the movie I thought the plot line of Alan being investigated on the \"break in\" and him working on the enigma machine was happening at the same time. Which makes no sense considering that the movie had already made the effort to mark the time period of when Alan attended his boarding school. I also would have liked to see more of Joan working on the code breaking more as I felt like she was just there to look pretty rather than help and the soviet spy plot was so short lived, i didn't even care for it. Other than that, I do believe that this movie deserves the praise that it has gotten.",

Where the movie shines is showing Turing for his concept of coming up with a thinking machine, or Machine intelligence. A machine that can be re programmed. This later develops into what is know as the Computer. In the digital age it was renamed Artificial intelligence. The unsung hero of science and WWII finally finds the spotlight in global cinema, albeit in the form of a sobering social miscreant. Nor does it end their, the movie failed to show the social class and woman status correctly. Turing developed the machine and outline it theoretically the machine was build by mechanics not Turing himself because it was deemed of lower status to meddle with mechanics and get your hands dirty, the upper class social norm of the time in England. The machines was run and maintained by the woman, and it gave out a lot of heat.",

But when I saw The imitation game, I was surprised for how this movie It's about war, but doesn't have action in it.Recently, I watched this movie again because I haven't seen it in a couple years, and this movie has got even better with the years that have passed. It's a masterpiece, but now let's talk about why The imitation game it's so good.This movie It's about Alan Turing. A person really good at solving puzzles and also very good at math, has to decode Enigma. Enigma It's an unbreakable code that was made by the Nazis during WWII so they could communicate with each other and organize an attack. So the plot of this movie It's about how Alan Turing and his team decode this code to win the war. That's it, I mean there it's a lot to talk about the plot, but I won't tell you more about it because in my opinion that will be kind of spoiler territory.Moving on to the filmmaking of this movie, first, it's very well directed. Morten Tyldum did such a good work directing this film, the way he cuts the scenes, the camera-work, the editing, It's looks fantastic and when I watch this movie makes me feel that I am in this time period. The script of this film it's so well made that this movie feels real, suspenseful, dramatic, and emotionally powerful. All this characters are so well realized that you look at them like they were real people trying to solve this situation and end this war that is killing everyone.The performances are all great, Benedict Cumberbatch it's one of my favorites actors in the world and as Alan Turing was amazing. This is the best performance that I have seen from him in any movie or TV show. I love him as Doctor Strange and Sherlock Holmes but, if i have to choose one, I choose Alan Turing. Another one that shines it's Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, great performance and it wasn't a surprise that she was nominated for best actress in a supporting role.The imitation game it's a beautiful movie, is such a great and important achievement.

The time line was off and there was no mention of the four rotor problem. Nothing about the insanely precise operational magic the British pulled off. And the Bombes (the device that Turing was shown working on) increased by a large number over the war.But that is just technical stuff that there is a movie that covers it pretty well: Enigma with Kate Winslet in it, watch it if you liked this movie. This movie capture the pain of being a software programmer way better than it did the homosexuality issues that Turing faced, which felt bolted on and really could have been easily extracted from the movie. First and foremost, Turing was the first software guy to face project creep, delivery issues and personal problems related to programming.Now if you remove the part about his homosexuality, that is also a very interesting show, and an important message.So bottom line: Why didn't this movie sweep? Was it because of that piece of trash Birdman? That \"insider\" emotional piece about the pain of being paid millions for being a technician at the hands of a director and writer? And the pain of having all that money? Really? Imitation Game has something for everyone who thinks, creates, loves, designs. Birdman? Junk in comparison. Birdman is seeping by people who have the good looks and an ability to follow instructions.Ignore Birdman, watch this twice.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game is a movie about code breaking, intrigue and personal sexuality that should resonate with some moviegoers of today. It brings to the forefront themes not fully explored and presented in most WWII movies. Artistically, the movie is told in a rather disjointed manner with bits and pieces of emotional drama. So, it is up to the spectator to create his or her own sense of the story as scenes come and go. The lead character, Alan Turing -- played by Benedict Cumberbatch -- is portrayed in a way that his personality might come across as being somewhat conflicted and troubled by his own circumstances, which -- unfairly -- is not a full reflection of his true character or own circumstances near the end of his life. Moreover, the movie tries to portrait him as a war hero, tech pioneer, social martyr, or troubled man in an incomplete and unconvincing manner. It is true that code breakers including Alan Turing played a decisive role during WWII, but others also made lasting contributions in so many ways during those terrible years. The movie's focus is more about the character's personal life than the events and circumstances that affected his society at the time, which was markedly totalitarian in the impositions of social norms. The movie has certainly gained considerable appreciation in certain circles of society, which routinely invoke and promote earthly (sometimes hollow) co-existence as the ultimate and indisputable way (and purpose) of life regardless of others' philosophical underpinnings or endless desire for the pursuit of universal truth. Therefore, we should expect more movies with similar themes as the informal debate about the ultimate purpose of life continues to unfold implicitly or explicitly in an already highly accessible art-driven medium.",

            "review_title": "The Imitation Game: An \"A Beautiful Mind\" British Re-make?",
            "content": "The Imitation Game is a very good film...I promise. Benedict Cumberbatch, the highest rising actor in Hollywood, gives a stand out performance as Alan Turing an eccentric mathematician who helps crack the Nazi messaging code called \"enigma\" which allowed the British to intercept Nazi communications without their knowledge and use it to their advantage to win the war. Turing was certainly a genius an possessed many of the common traits that come along with being a genius. Arrogance, the inability to read social cues, defensive, awkwardness, and an overall display of anti-social tendencies. He was also a deeply secretive man and it was his secrets that led him to paranoia that controlled his life to the end. This is all well and good but while I was watching the film I couldn't help but think that I had seen this movie already....13 years ago with Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.Again, I really enjoyed the film as a whole and expect it to be a front runner at the Oscars (I mean hey, it's a WWII film that contains a main character struggling with his homosexuality...two of the Academy's favorite themes!) but the whole time I just couldn't get A Beautiful Mind...well...out of MY mind. Think about it, John Forbes Nash (Crowes' character in \"Mind\") nearly fits the exact description I make of Cumberbatch's Turing above. He had those same personality qualities, the same genius, and the suffered through similar forms of paranoia of the government for years which had negative effects on his health. It's hard not to see these similarities and not be distracted by them (at least for me anyway).Now I am not going to sit here and try to say that Nash went through everything that Turing went through because I'm not that stupid or irresponsible. Turing's battle with his homosexuality and maintaining that secret seemed to torture him throughout his life which was an issue that Nash never had to deal with. It is with all of this inner turmoil where we see Cumberbatch succeed with the performance. He is one of those people who you look at and think that there is more to him than meets the eye. His unique look and his voice give him almost unlimited range as he can go from sounding and looking like a peaceful harmless wimp, to a dark and insidious villain in the blink of an eye. You got the feeling that Turing was a man who wasn't as interested in breaking the code to defeat the Nazis and save lives, but just to beat \"the game\" and put his genius on display for all to see and this is where Cumberbatch excels in the role the most.We get some solid supporting work from Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, and Charles Dance, but it is Cumberbatchs' show. He should be one of the favorites to get nominated and to even take home the Oscar...for playing a role that Russell Crowe some say should have gotten many years ago over Denzel Washington in Training Day. Cumberbatch's performance is not to be diminished by my undeniably distracted mind when it comes to this film. He does masterful work and is certainly worthy of any accolade he gets.However, the fact that \"A Beautiful Mind\" exists and the similarities are too daunting to me it decreases my overall feeling for the film because I felt like I had seen this movie before.",

At the end of the film some text appears telling us that Alan Turing committed suicide through cyanide poisoning after undergoing Chemical Castration for 2 years. When this happens you see the team throwing their work into a fire whilst cheering and laughing.

Now to be sure, the greatest work that Turing did was formulating the theory of Turing machines and decidability, but since that work is not really exciting or dramatic enough, the movie focuses on his work on breaking the cryptographic Enigma code used by the Axis in the Second world war. Now I was slightly disappointed during the first half of the movie, focusing on the usual melodrama involving unsocial and mis-understood geniuses, love interests, 'traumatic' childhood memories, uncooperative bureaucracy, unknown spies and double agents, etc., but Turing lived a unique and singular life, and the second half exemplifies this. As Turing understood so well, while breaking the Enigma code was a challenge, the even harder problem was what to do after it was broken, and how to use all the un-encrypted information strategically so that the Axis would remain blissfully ignorant of their vulnerability. The movie unfortunately does not dwell much on this exciting storyline, which could have provided a much more interesting and unique look at what was going on behind the scenes in the Second world war. The final years of Turing's life were a tragedy, and fortunately, the movie does not shy away from these ugly details. We can only wonder at what discoveries Turing could have made if he had been allowed to work with freedom and support. But, be that as it may, Turing's legacy will continue to live on in the future, and for us mortals, the immortality of their works and ideas, their name is the greatest achievement that we can hope for.",

Sadly, the script did not do justice to the character or his singular achievements in helping to break the Enigma code and that contribution to the allied victory in WW2. The rest of the cast was equally outstanding.Several reviewers have objected to the sympathetic portrayal of Turing's homosexuality as \"having an agenda.\" Society's very unsympathetic attitude towards homosexuality at that time is integral to the story, particularly considering what was done to him by society in general and the British government in particular after the war. That part of Turing's life was portrayed with a reasonable degree of fact.

The letter was delivered to the Bulgarian head of state vice president Pete Hayes, sent by the head of Microsoft's celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the birth of John Atanasov.After experiments with various available at this time calculating devices Atanasov first introduced the concept of \"analog computer\". In 1936, together with Glenn Murphy colleague atomic physicist, create a small analog calculator for study of the geometry of surfaces, which they call \"Laplasiometar\". Atanasoff found that it has the same shortcomings as all other analog devices - accuracy depends on the work of other parts of the machine. Replica of 1997 Atanasoff-Berry computer in Durham Center, State University of IowaIn the winter of 1937-38 his strongest effort to solve the problem leads to the result. One night, frustrated by the many fruitless efforts, boarded a car and makes no specific direction. After two hundred kilometers stops at a roadside restaurant in Illinois.

It should be built on the basis of electronic elements to consider with binary numbers instead of decimal worn long and there is a separate from the CPU memory that is regenerative (with capacitors) [2]. Furthermore physicist and mathematician Atanasov is a highly qualified expert in electronic equipment, which helps to design specific circuit solutions. To build the machine Atanasov need technical assistance, which shares with his friend Harold Anderson, also a professor of physics in college. His latest recommended one of his best students - Clifford Berry (Clifford E. Berry, 1918-1963).In March 1939 the University awarded him $ 650 and Atanasoff and Berry began working as the installation of the machine is carried out in the basement of the physics lab. For a few months they create and refine a prototype of a computing machine, later called the Atanasoff-Berry computer or ABC (English: Atanasoff-Berry Computer). Atanasov plans to record in memory and automatically, a series of commands in the process of calculation, \u0442.\u0435. use software [2].In December 1940 Atanasov first met John Mauchly at the conference and expressed his interest due to the machine and its working principle Mauchly invited guests in Ames. Mauchly visited Atanasoff and guest in his house five days, during which they discussed the design of computer ABC, and other ideas of Atanasoff related to computing. Mauchly read the manuscript of an article with a description of the machine.

Subsequently, in a trial conducted in 1973, the court concluded that as a result of this particular visit, the discussions held with Atanasoff and Berry, the demonstrations and the discovery of the manuscript, Mauchly extracted from ABC \"invention of automatic digital computer\" .With the entry of the US into World War II in December 1941 work on the computer is disconnected.

The movie is overall well directed, performances are good - in some cases exceptional (see Cumberbatch as Alan Turing)- but the script deviates so much from the original story that I wish I hadn't read the book first.The movie presents the story of Alan Turing and the agonizing work of a team of coders at Bletchley Park as they try to crack the Enigma, the machine used by Nazi forces to transmit encrypted messages for the various aspects of the war operations.Alan Turing, a truly enigmatic and complex character (the movie only scratches the surface of his personality)is presented as more or less singlehandedly leading the attack to the Enigma. In reality, crucial contributions have been made by a Polish team who were already able to break the Enigma before the outbreak of the war (they handed their knowledge to French and English) and thanks to either pure luck (see German mistakes) or pure heroism (see dedicated missions to the Atlantic to retrieve Enigma machines).Alan Turing's work was indeed brilliant, following up on the insights he provided in his key scientific contribution - the universal machines - and the upgraded (compared to the Poles) \"Bombes\" machine that he helped design.The brilliance of his, and his co-workers' at Bletchley, work is diminished in the film in rather simplistic, \"hollywood\" style revelations. On the other hand his role is vastly upgraded with regards to decision-making about how to use the knowledge of the broken Enigma messages - something he never took part in. I honestly wonder what good these deviations from his true role really do.Speaking of deviations and inaccuracies, pretty much every character that appears in the film is either misplaced in time, role, story or in terms of interaction with Turing. Moreover the difficulties and importance of Hut 8 work, are significantly misrepresented - mostly confined in false power-plays, spy-hunts and melodrama, while the true pathogeneses of the British war machine are completely overlooked.Last but not least, the way the movie treats Turing being a homosexual is absolutely out of the actual framework of the period he lived in and of his own perception for it. The arrest/detective/interrogation scenes are wildly imaginative with no apparent reason - in terms of helping to build Turing's character in the film - and the insights on his teenage years are not adequately projected.Notwithstanding all the deviations mentioned above, the film does succeed in creating an engaging atmosphere and I assume that for those who never heard of the actual story before it must have a strong impact.7 out of 10 for the \"final product\" noting the immense deviation from the actual story.",

The way he brightly plays his particular personality and intelligence, in order to solve the enigma, is absolutely stunning. It is definitely also to praise the development the producers, and again Cumberbatch, put into the character of Alan Turing, what was indispensable, since he is an important historic figure, that brought a lot of innovation and progress to mankind. To summarize, the Imitation Game is an amusing way to learn how our society evolved to where it is now, and to see the brilliant \"Sherlock\" in action once again.",

To me, the movie is not about showing the negative use of the technology; instead, it evaluates the appropriate level of such an enormous technology. Besides, the movie gives a brief overview on the outstanding works and unbelievable achievements of Alan Turing, who can be termed as father of computer too, because his exceptional thinking of providing ability to machines to think like humans, might has given birth to the idea of computer, partially. Honestly, I am not the one who can judge every movie, but this movie is really an exceptional piece. It plays a vital role in introducing technology, pain, happiness, fear, craziness, conspiracy, realism, burning desire, and enthusiasm.

All the stuff about the name of his enigma breaking machine, his interaction with his temporary fianc\u00e9e, and most of his time with the enigma team was mistaken. Especially annoying was the nonsense about being suspected of treason. What an insult, that this British hero was ever accused of being a spy. Finally, notice how cavalier the screenwriters were about his pardon. Pardoned for what? Being gay? His conviction and that of many, many others should have been expunged.

Tadeusza Ko\u015bciuszki\") was one of 16 Polish squadrons in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. It was the highest scoring of these 16 Polish-manned RAF squadrons during the Battle of Britain. Yet Polish troops - still under the command of Poland's independent government in exile - were forbidden from taking part in official VE Day celebrations due to Britain's wish to appease Stalin.BBC 1...Prince Andrew handed over an Enigma machine taken from a captured Nazi submarine, as a \"symbol of our gratitude\". \"The Enigma codes would not have been broken if it were not for the knowledge of Polish mathematicians,\" he was quoted as saying at the start of a two-day visit. Mr Buzek said he was \"greatly satisfied\" that the UK officially recognised that Enigma was decoded by the Poles. Polish historians say three Polish mathematicians - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - broke the Enigma code in 1933. In July 1939, just before the war, Poland gave Britain and France replicas of the Enigma encoding machine, helping the Allies decipher secret Nazi messages. According to British accounts, British cryptographers cracked the code a year before war broke out. Mr Buzek asked Britain on Monday to change the Encyclopaedia Britannica entry on Enigma to credit the Poles for their role in breaking the system. 2. To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years. But now, the Polish Government has launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings. Seven years later, just before war broke out, the Poles handed over their knowledge of the Enigma codes, as well as Polish-built replicas of the machines, to British and French Intelligence officers near Warsaw. The rest is history - but not the complete history, as far as Senator Piotr Zientarski is concerned. 'We have a duty to remind people just what the Polish cryptologists did,' he told the Daily Telegraph. The government official said that in recognition of the trio's efforts, the upper house of Poland's parliament has passed a resolution in their honour to 'restore justice'. The resolution reads: 'In both popular literature and official information, the public was told that the breaking of the Enigma codes was due to the work of the British Intelligence services to the complete omission of the work of Polish scientists.' The Germans, who had been using the technology since the late 1920s, believed the codes were impossible to crack. Using a complicated system of rotors, the machine would encode messages before sending them via Morse code to another machine. If the receiving machine had been programmed with the same settings - one of 158 million million million combinations - the message would be deciphered. However the team of cryptologists, linguists, scientists and data analysts at Bletchley, in Buckinghamshire, led by Londoner Turing, were able to break it. At its peak, the team was cracking 6,000 encrypted German Enigma messages every day - building on the principles set out by Rejewski, Rozycki and Zygalski. Jan Rulewski, a senator from the governing Civic Platform party, said: 'This resolution restores justice. Not only did the Western Allies marginalise the achievements of Polish cryptographers but the Soviets did the same. 'They were silent about the Polish contribution to saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of troops fighting on all fronts.' The film Enigma (made in 2001), starring Kate Winslet and set at Bletchley, has also upset the Poles - it not only downplays their contribution but also, the only Pole in the film is a traitor. The resentment adds to the wider feeling in the country that their contribution to the Allies' victory has been under-appreciated. Polish troops fought in North Africa, Italy and Normandy, and took part in the Battle for Berlin. In the Battle of Britain, Polish pilots had the highest kill rates. Yet Polish troops - still under the command of Poland's independent government in exile - were forbidden from taking part in official VE Day celebrations due to Britain's wish to appease Stalin.",

It's nice to see a war movie that takes a different approach from films like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, and show the technical sides of war.Benedict Cumberbatch gives one of the best performances of the year, and all of the supporting cast members deliver on their roles as well. The movie is so intriguing and interesting, you will stay invested in this movie for the whole run-time. Watching Alan Turing try to solve the enigma code while getting along with his co-workers, trying to keep his job, and hiding his sexuality all add so much depth to the story. This is definitely a film that will have you invested the whole time.This film is pretty great, but sadly not flawless. There are a few pretty cheesy moments, and the flash forward scenes can be hard to distinguish from the present events. The film also has a tendency of missing opportunities with certain plot lines. For example, there's a side-plot about one of the mathematicians being a soviet spy. Once the soviet spy is revealed, they do nothing with it for the rest of the movie, probably because it's so close to the end of the film and they need to wrap it up. There are a few other plot lines that I personally felt the film could've done more with.Despite it's flaws, The Imitation Game is still worth seeing.

As expected it did leave me on a sad note but i have to say i am really glad i watched it.As expected Benedict Cumberbatch comes up with an amazing performance for the role of a genius, for now it is his bread and butter having already played the legendary Sherlock Holmes.The rest of the cast did well. The story has nice pace altogether but i was left wanting more from it especially during the final minutes of the movie. I wish they elaborated more on how the decryption actually helped winning the war.Instead the war was over...just like that.

Alan Turing has been hailed as the father of modern computer science. This film tells his story, and that of a major allied victory during WWII, that victory being the dismantling of the German Enigma code system, considered unbreakable.As a whole, the film works well. Benedict Cumberbatch does an outstanding job in taking the viewer into the mind of Alan Turing. Very Spocklike in his devotion to the job at hand, his portrayal of the eccentricities and oddities which put Turing at odds with his colleagues was excellent. Very much the loner in the middle of these geeks, Turing sets about solving the problem with the very efficiency of the machine he creates.**spoiler alert**I had a couple of problems historically. After the ENIGMA code is cracked, Turing advises not to tell anyone of the impending danger to a British cargo convoy directly in the path of German U boats because it would be a tipoff to the Germans that the code had been broken. This has been alleged, but NEVER Proved. The film implies that this incident was true. IN reality, the alleged decision not to go with critical information at the outset was Winston Churchill's. I am not sure why this movie put that incident in, but it did provide some drama as one of Turing's colleagues has a brother serving on one of the convoy ships.Secondly, the Poles actually had broken the enigma code, but it was a comparatively crude setup, Turing's machine made the process more efficient.The film was a nail biter all the way though. We see the typical set up of genius versus the system with the system going by the book, and in so doing trying to handcuff Turing all the way. Such was the way in part with Oppenheimer and the powers that be in developing the atomic bomb across the pond in America.By all accounts, Cumberbatch perfectly portrayed all the parts of this troubled genius, even to his personal life.Well worth seeing along with Fat Man and Little Boy for an accurate portrayal of genius on both sides of the Atlantic.",

I would like to believe that most of this film's audience already consider's gay and women rights standard and not a nice treat to get.It seemed like the only characters that were likable at all were only because everyone else was a 1 dimensional force of stereotypical discrimination (And don't bother explaining that in that period it is how people were because people are always 3 dimensional and not just there for the sake of being an opposition).All in all, Benedict Cumberbatch gave an incredible performance, but in combination with several poorly written characters and scenes as well as the forced and overdone themes of gay and women's rights made this a fairly negative viewing experience.Very overrated 6/10",

As we all know \"Imitation Game\" is a Biography based on Alan Turing, a mathematician and an extremely clever mind who's gonna be called to help the war against Germany of Nazi and Hitler, through the explanation of machine \"Enigma\". Germany used this machine to send encoded information about striking spots through daily messages around the Nazis' bases in Europe. As far as the plot, we could say that this movie, got everything from action and love, to agony and conspiracy. Benedict totally embraced his role and and the way he was playing made you think that this man has some serious problems that cant be cured easily. Then Keira come to his live. Keiras role was simple and the way that she was playing, in my opinion doesn't change in her movies. Someone could say that she is playing the same way everywhere, but is kind of cruel to say that so i would say that she can do better, totally. The other characters in the film was embracing their roles too. The interpretations of the actors were amazing. The evolution of their acquaintance when hatred became compassion and love about this great mind, creates to viewer similar feelings. Alongside, the plot and treason of Russian spy makes viewer to understand that not everything is as pure as they seem to be. This kind of treason also, prepare the suitable feelings to viewers, about what's gonna happen next, when the big secret of protagonist is going to be revealed. At the end, we see how the director present the way of governments and society treats the homosexuality issue. And this is the moment when viewers feel the total sympathy for the protagonist, that also makes them love the entire film. In my criticism of this movie, i give it a 9 cause we still don't know if the friend of Alans in the school that be believed that was in love with him, is dead or not. I mean, yes we saw that the school principal told Alans that his friend is dead, but i thought over there a kind of conspiracy. Maybe teachers had seen homosexuality signs about Alan and his friend, and they forced themselves to take over the child. Beyond that, its a great movie that everyone has to watch!

The deliberate juxtaposition of historical footage with modern camera-work is a subtle yet gnawing reminder that the events of the film are true to their core, and the fierce intensity of the emotion in every scene brings the audience closer to the story.

From the basic plot twists like:\"He's fired, take him away!\" - \"No!\"To the quotes that are repeated throughout the film at very predictable and cheesy moments:1. \"Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.\" 2. \"Do you know why people like violence? It is because it feels good. Humans find violence deeply satisfying. But remove the satisfaction, and the act becomes... hollow.\"The performance of Cumberbatch ranges from alright to very strong at times, but his character seems like a mix of Sherlock and Sheldon Cooper from \"The Big Bang Theory\", including the same jokes about his social awkwardness. Then the film has 3 plot lines running in parallel with his school years, the world war and the \"present\" after the world war. The school storyline seems kind of bland and only serves one purpose in the end, which I won't spoil. The performance by the kid is also quite good, I actually liked him even more by Cumberbatch.So sure, if this is one of your first movies you ever saw as a grown up, it might be a good movie. But, it's surely won't be remembered in 10 years as a performance of a decade or anything. If I wouldn't be familiar with computer science I probably would give this movie a 7, but with the many inaccuracies regarding the technical aspects or the statements they make I can give him only a 6.",

A sexual joke is made in a bar where a man wants to put his **** in a woman's mouth while she hums a song (as a joke).Overall:This film is excellent, loving World War Two history, this movie captures what actually happened in London.

He was not good at working as a team and one day he was left alone and he reasoned and came to the conclusion that a machine could think faster than the brain. Alan Turing, after all, invented a machine to decipher the code of the Germans during World War II. That was the most important contribution the English made to end that war. So important was this man to build the world we live in now.\nThis movie is amazing because it shows a man who fought for his goals and achievements, as well as the role of a woman.

            "content": "This was a somewhat enjoyable watch but I thought the movie was deeply flawed in its core. First off, though the general story is true I doubted much of its historical accuracy. Also its characterization of Turing was quite unbelievable. Was he a genius? Of course, we can clearly see that. But was he a flawless machine of a human himself? No. His colleagues were even made out to be completely incompetent dunces as well. Turing's character was portrayed as a cocky self absorbed man which he may well have been, but a lot of the dialogue and humor in the movie seemed out of place and very unlikely. I'm sure a lot of this has been completely dramatized and romanticized, even down to the simple aesthetics of his creation. Cumberbatch is highly praised for his role which was a good performance but failed in some areas. One in particular that I saw was his awkwardness. He was supposed have extreme difficulty reading people which at times he tried to act like that yet at other times he was witty and socially connected which goes completely contrary to that personality.The film leaves the audience with some implied or outright stated conclusions that did not sit well with me at all. The first was that World War II can be diminished down to a conflict being run by \"a half a dozen crossword enthusiasts in Southern England.\" The writers acted like these few people single-handedly ended the war. This is just utterly ridiculous. It was also claimed that Turing saved 14 million lives and ended the war early by two years. That is something that you cannot possibly put a number to. There is no doubt that they achieved something remarkable and were an immense help to the war effort, but think of everyone who was involved in this and especially the men who died on the battlefields (which they conveniently avoided throughout the film even the short scenes of the war they only showed machines, airplanes, tanks and no human lives). It was really a slap in the face and a disrespect to the honor of those who fought, not to mention countless others. Having all of the information from the Axis forces would do no good if there wasn't anyone to act on it.Another idea that they insinuated was that if you are incredibly talented at something you are above reproach or that no one can ever rightly cast judgement on you. Part of that I think was their small push of their own opinions on homosexuality. I think they were trying to implant their own views on the subject as a way of subtle under-the-radar propaganda. I am not saying that Turing wasn't unfairly treated in the end, but they make him out to be a flawless god-like man who could do no wrong just because of his intelligence. The film really avoided the subject of him and his inner demons, not to say that that should have been their main focus.His demise in the end was also very unclearly presented. A robbery, a forbidden relationship, and the other events surrounding it were spattered throughout with no real explicit telling of the facts. It was just another problem near the end that made this movie not nearly what it is cracked up to be.",

            "content": "\"The Imitation Game\" is a gem of a movie; a masterpiece of a biographical work. It takes you through the life of Alan Turing, most notably during the times of the second World War, highlighting various themes as it does - math, the advent of computers, homosexuality, violence and compassion.Alan Turing was one of the best mathematicians and cryptanalysts in the world at the time (1930s-40s), and arguably one of the forefathers of modern computer science and artificial intelligence. One of his key contributions was during the Second World War, when he, along with a team of cryptanalysts, helped build a machine at Bletchley Park, England, that could decode the German cipher-texts flying through the air and thus helped the Allies win the war. His story has been told from his viewpoint, with the beautiful (often gruesome) picture of early 20th century England in the background. The film runs in three time frames concurrently - Alan's childhood, events at Bletchley Park, and the investigation involving Turing in 1951. Many filmmakers do this to try and develop a sense of mystery. This is not the case here, and it comes as a welcome approach, as the viewer is able to appreciate the various dimensions of Turing's personality in a coherent fashion. Many key aspects of Turing's life are aptly covered, like his relationship with a \"friend\" in school, his utter genius when at Bletchley Park and his acceptance of his sexual orientation, which ultimately led to his demise due to the harsh punishments imposed by the British authorities. More notable though, is that the movie explores the relationship between the key characters in detail, instead of rushing through them, as is sometimes the case with biographies of prodigies. The equation between Turing and his colleague, Miss Joan Clarke, for example, has been portrayed in utmost detail, and full credit to Cumberbatch and Knightley for bringing it out in a fashion that doesn't make the conclusion seemed forced, as I had feared for the nature of that relationship. The colors and imagery used point towards certain recurrent themes, and seem to tie the movie together. Many shots depict the turbulence of war, the clouds of smoke, the violence and the atrocities, and the sheer helplessness of the British in that time in a manner that makes the viewer sensitive to these issues, even though much of the shooting is based inside Bletchley Park's code-breaking center, away from all the heaps of rubble and streams of blood. The soundtrack has been intelligently done, but seems a bit mismatched at times with what is happening on screen. The lighting is mostly a bit dull, but I think that fits in with the theme.The costumes tie in well with the place and time. The young Alan is strikingly similar to the older one, which demands commendation for the attention to detail. His looks, his way of speaking and his demeanor bear a resemblance to the Turing who walked into Commander Denniston's office for a job as a cryptanalyst. Benedict Cumberbatch has done full justice to his role of Alan Turing. He does come across as a self-absorbed mathematician, not too good at interpersonal relationships or working in teams, but persevering, intellectual and ruthlessly pragmatic.I feel that, majoring in Computer Science myself, Turing's seminal research and his thoughts about future computers should have been highlighted more. His vision of a general purpose reprogrammable machine was unique at the time, and his ideas for artificial intelligence, which gave birth to the Turing test, or \"The Imitation Game\", could have been explored in more depth. Also, the fate of Miss Joan Clarke after Turing's death would have been a welcome addition to the ending. Overall, I felt that the film was a huge success - being a biography of a mathematician, it never seemed boring or too preachy, even though the story wasn't wrapped in an artificial envelope of mystery and drama. It was simple, honest and moving. I wish that other biographies look up to The Imitation Game and try to emulate the standards set herein. \"Sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things no one can imagine.\"",

There are quite a few moments in movie where it felt slow and dragging on. There is quite a lot of drama as it a biography and based on true events, but the main theme keeps you captivated throughout its duration. Benedict Cumberbatch has outdone himself again. Unlike his role in Sherlock he does play the role of a genius here too but with a asperger like problem. The main fault of this movies comes in the approach they took in presenting the life of Alan Turing. Where they were supposed to show scientific leap that was a result of the mind and efforts of Alan Turing they focused much more on his personal problems which made the movie slow and boring at moments. I for myself felt like fast forwarding and skipping scenes at points but wasn't able to do that since i was sadly in the theatre. The later part of movie felt more like an unneeded extension which could have ended better with a simple epilogue.The movie commences with a scene of Benedict sitting in a interrogation room, alone, quiet, in deep thought, as a lush melody chimes in background, the detective enters the room and he starts to talk, \"Are you paying attention? Good. If you are not listening carefully, you will miss things. Important things. I will not pause, I will not repeat myself, and you will not interrupt me. You think that because you're sitting where you are, and I am sitting where I am, that you are in control of what is about to happen. You're mistaken. I am in control, because I know things that you do not know.\" And thats it. Thats the best part of movie right there. The whole scenario draws you in, gives rise to a grand expectation which the movie fulfils beautifully as it progresses. Soon, we get to meet with Alan Turing, socially brash but a prodigy mathematician, a role brilliantly played by Benedict Cumberbatch. The time setting is of World War II, and Germans are using encryption for tranferring all their messages which is a pretty advanced and unbreakable in that era. One thing leads to another and we have our genius mathematician developing first computer to crack the encryption uncrackable by humans. The whole idea is just fascinating and it seduces you to watch more but then the things start taking a turn for the worse. We start seeing more of Alan Turing personal problems than the things about the grand ongoing World War at hand. Finally our hero saves the day by creating a computer but suicides due to strict laws against homosexuals in that era.Overall, the movie was a good watch and worth every penny but it could have been implemented better. They could have toned down drama and decreased run time to make it bit more fast paced. I was very excited about this movie when i saw its trailers and i wont say that i am dissatisfied with it but i m not satisfied either.",

He is also a great hero in the fight against prejudice. The story line starts in 1939 at the time line of World War II, newly created British intelligence agency MI6 recruits Cambridge mathematics alumnus Alan Turing. (Benedict Cumberbatch) Whose secret project is to break secret code behind the Nazis communication machine, named Enigma. Which crypt analysts had thought was unbreakable. The problem is that Enigma is re coded every day, so that even if the team can decipher a coded message transmitted by the Nazis, that code would be obsolete by the next day. There are 159,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible codes that could be input into Enigma. A largely arrogant, antisocial, and literal minded man, Alan is the team's initial leader. While the rest of the team work on breaking the day-to-day codes, believing that is the only way to learn the secret of Enigma. Alan works by himself on developing a machine with artificial intelligence, which he believes is required not just to break a daily code, but to break any code immediately when it is input into Enigma. Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) the only female member of the team, not only adds another brilliant mind to the team, but also provides Alan with a sense of how to behave socially to get things accomplished in a team setting. Just when the chemistry between Alan and Joan started to build, Alan tells Joan that he is homosexual, and can't start a relationship with her, which completely shifts the theme. And becomes the entire center of the film. Despite this fact Alan and team finally succeed in making a machine in 1940, which can decode Enigma messages, and become heroes. The British government kept it as a secret for 50 long years. After their mission Alan and Joan became friends for life. Everything was going fine until 1951, when Alan's home is reported broken into by his neighbor. Because nothing was stolen, Alan was quick to dismiss the police. But the lead investigator believed, Alan was hiding something. When the police discovered that Alan is homosexual, they send him to prison. Because it was a crime back then. But he somehow avoided prison showing medical reasons. Alan Turing committed suicide in 1954. He was only 41 years old then. The reason was pretty obvious social pressure about his sexuality. The actors did their best in the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch was phenomenal. As Cumberbatch says, at the start of the film \"are you paying attention. You should pay attention, Alan Turing deserves your attention, and his story deserves to be told.\" He made the character more interesting, while you may also get connected with his personal troubles. Keira Knightley also did pretty well, even though there wasn't much about her character. The Imitation Game holds a fascinating story which remains as one of the best film in history. Historians say, Alan shortened the war by two years and saved more than 14 million lives.",

If you are interested in watching a movie that has solid acting with a relatively interesting script then you will likely enjoy the movie.Unfortunately, if you are interested in the historical facts of either Alan Turing or even anything that occurred during his time at Bletchley Park then you may be disappointed. The truth is that on completion of the movie you realize you actually were never even told a single thing about how the Enigma machine works, you would believe that Alan Turing broke the code single-handedly, and you may even think that Cryptography requires merely exceptional skills at solving crosswords, which is of course ridiculous. Consider that at no time is even the most basic of Cipher explained.In Summary, if you want to watch a decent movie and you don't care if the historical facts are accurate and that no technical details are ever explained then you will likely enjoy the movie.If you expect accurate history and you are interested in the real events / how the machine worked perhaps for example, you will be disappointed.That should summarize clearly, though I could elaborate further toward the negative in the technical / historical aspects; however, i assume most will enjoy the movie as is.",

It was one of those films where after you finish it, you aren't capable of doing anything else for the next hour our so, as you're still processing everything. The Imitation Game is hands down one of the best films I've ever seen. I have seen in some other reviews that maybe the historical accuracy isn't quite there, and I cannot speak to that at all. I'm not a historian, and personally do not care if the film is accurate or not. The makers of this film have woven together a wonderful story that keeps you hooked right up to the end. Benedict Cumberbatch was the perfect actor for the main role, he seems to portray the character so well. You can tell that he is passionate about the role, and that the character really spoke to him. We all already know that he is a brilliant actor, but in my mind, he rose to a new height in The Imitation Game.",

The characters were brilliant i could literally visualize the scenes. Which i am sure everyone will however watches it. Contents were well organized and it had certain amount of suspense which required to keep the flow and make it interesting at the same time. Everyone knew what would happen at last but it was fun watching it, at least i did, so will you i promise.

Simply because the life of a personality that important and unforgettable is going to rip you brain into little miserable pieces make you feel insignificant and worthless just sitting there watching that exact movie.The movie is about the brilliant scientist Alan Turing, who during World War II was recruited to decode the German communication machine called Enigma (Greek word for \"riddle\") alongside with a team of mathematicians. Turing, though, had a perplexing personality. Few would say it was arrogance that troubled Turing's team spirit, as he was more of an unsocial personality, unable and unwilling to explain himself to others. He worked alone, while the rest of the team tried (and failed) to decode the messages of the Enigma, designing a decryption machine for the Enigma, claiming that the human mind cannot compete with a machine, therefore a machine was needed for the project. Fighting with his social inability to convince the \"heads\" for financial support on his machine, homophobia and his past, Turing finds himself creating miracles and ruining his life piece by piece.Portrayed by a talented actor, the life of Alan Turing is animated as tragic and unfair as it was, from the beginning of his Enigma project till his unjustified end. A story that shows not only the heroic invention of Alan Turing, but the ingratitude of society towards an important and brilliant personality. While Turing's acts were government's top secret, the same government let a hero go down for his sexuality, momentarily forgetting his contribution to the country and the world and focusing on his personal life.An amazing contemporary portrayal of a significant personality, a true hero of war.",

By the end of the movie you find yourself really feeling for the main characters and the important place they played in history. So the scale that I usually look for in terms of size of a movie's budget was achieved by this movie in terms of the way this group of people affected so many lives in World War 2 and still to this day. The acting in the movie was just terrific. Keira Knightley was her usually charming self (have I ever mentioned she was the real star of Pirates of the Caribbean). Mathew Goode was also solid in a supporting role. But as expected it was Benedict Cumberbatch who really brought the movie to life. Always perfectly subtle in his roles. he perhaps more than any other actor currently in Hollywood is fit to play a role of a man who at times seems trapped inside his own head. He brings humanity to a role that in many ways is a depiction of a person who seems more like a machine than a man. In the end, with a great screenplay, excellent performances by the strong cast and with immense historical perspective, this is a movie that everyone needs to watch.",

While watching Turing and his co-workers/friends slowly breaking Enigma, we not only get some flashbacks into Turing's childhood, but also see what happens after the war. Turing was an absolute mastermind with an amazing personality and an ending which he did not deserve.

And while I can agree that there are historical inaccuracies, I think the well-intentioned reviewers are missing the point.This is not meant to be a pure biographical piece that details the life of Alan Turing with perfect accuracy. It's a story.If they mentioned that the machine was already half-built by the poles the challenge would've seemed less impossible and the task less impressive, leading to a less satisfying ending.If they had everyone on Alan's side from the start, and write to Churchill together, it would've seemed like Alan didn't have to overcome the personal problems and lack of social skills. Leading to a less satisfying character development.If they had Turing quickly concluded to eliminate common words from the possibilities in coded messages, then there wouldn't be any tension.If they Turing's team had no idea what the broken codes would be used for (Sometimes saving lives, sometimes letting them die) then there would be no consequences for the decision they made to let the ships be sunk. And continually choose whether or not to let the germans carry out their plans.If Turing didn't tell the detective his story, he wouldn't have gotten to ask the detective: \"Am I human? Am I robot? Am I war-hero? Am I a criminal?\" Which for me at least, was one of the most impactful lines of the entire film.So, were there inaccuracies? Of course. It's a film after all and \"BASED on a true story\". But if the writers had stuck to history instead of using creative license, this would be a far less compelling story. It would have far less impact. And many of the people who enjoyed it, likely wouldn't have ever even seen it.In the end the irony was that Turing didn't get to enjoy the world he helped protect.

Really clever script, a lot circumlocution which is really aesthetically pleasing from a writing standpoint. Performances are top-notch from well-choiced casting; not once did I have to suspend my disbelief because I needed to deal w/ an actor/actress out of place. This story and it's main character are so thought provoking, and the extenuated ramifications of both respectively are commented on without preaching. Poignant is the correct word to use here, this film takes itself and it's subject matter seriously, it's a look back in time w/ retrospect. It's a previously untold story about a man and this happening w/ sincerity, gravitas and willing honesty.WW2 has almost been beaten to death in film and video games, granted it's a popular time period because of its gravity, but this film finds a niche story to tell among the breadth of other period dramas. I think if you're a film lover or a cinephile and you haven't seen this, you're doing yourself a disservice. This film pulls you in, you find yourself wondering where this is all going, you won't be bored or fiddling around on your phone every half hour. This WW2 drama reigns supreme in my opinion.I think if you're like me and you prefer watching films, appreciate the artistry of cinema and rather a movie than a TV show.

Got inspired by Alan's conversation with the detective and my recent reading of Alfred Adler's book What Life Could Mean To You (role of Mother), I am writing this short analysis of how Alan Turing and his teammates become..... Gods.The moment Alan's team deciphered the codes, they gained a God-like status. In the position of Gods, they decided what was better for the whole human race- to end the war (at least not under the Nazi's control). Here are the two things they have done immediately afterward to become full Gods.Firstly, they identified the cost of the vision: the sacrifice of many (including a team member's, an insider's beloved brother) in exchange for an 'infinitely better world' for all. So Gods do implement or force Their own vision on All, which in nature is a dictatorship or even tyranny.Secondly, as Gods, they found and harnessed the Angels, the messengers. Alan's team used MI6 as Angels (medium) to disseminate their 'divine' and obscure orders (both difficult to understand and known to a very small bunch of people). Then, they stayed behind and away from the world in the little town, observing plots they designed to roll out from above.Although the Angles in the movie (or even in history) seem to have a higher level of agency than Gods, their agency indeed originates from the Gods (think out the negotiation process between the Turing couple and the MI6 official. It can be seen as a kind of authorization/contracting process). Besides, the Angels' existence or right to survival is at God's mercy, since Alan's team technically can discredit MI6's intelligence service (or Ultra in the movie) by providing some false intelligence reports of a critical battle.This also makes me wonder, how much do our elected country leaders know about the 'Truth'? Are they ignorant puppets rolling out some predetermined plots, or even worse, are they self-aware pawns/contractors/ Angels who work to implement hidden Gods' vision of a better world.....?I am pretty sure I am an agnostic now.",

Historians estimate that breaking Enigma shortened the war by more than two years, saving over 14 million lives. Turing's work inspired generations of research into what scientists called \"Turing Machines\". Today, we call them computers. Unfortunately Alan Turing was never acknowledged enough and for 50 years his work was kept secret. A must watch movie.",

The underlying tragic tale of the man himself, his struggles, and how he was treated is what left me staring at the credits weeping.The fact alone that I had never heard anything of this man beyond the expression \"the Turing Test\" is a testament to what a bleak, dark history we have.The Imitation Game sheds a good light on how far we've come, and how we can do better.",

That being said, though well crafted, the film shies away from its underlying historical events in favor of some very generic Hollywood storytelling.To be clear, I'm not at all referring to historical inaccuracies prominent throughout. I'm quite OK with those. But rather that in its adaptation, naturally occurring insights inherent to the historical events were thoroughly overwritten. A tale of intellectual pursuits, dedication, hard work and cooperation was replaced with yet another tale of exceptionalism. Not to say Turing was not exceptional, rather, that since his true virtues could not be easily dramatized, any and all facts were blundered into a chaos that is somewhat irrespective of the real events and people.Though in itself a decent movie, in its disloyal depiction of historical events the film fails to respect its source material, and would have perhaps more appropriately been labeled fiction inspired by real events (much like Song of ice and fire, to name an example).",

            "content": "Masterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.Benedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's \"Sherlock,\" this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.The rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. I don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega- star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.",

During World War II, mathematician Alan Turing applies to a British special force in charge of cracking the enigma code German forces uses. He struggles to find a way to decode it with his fellows, going through repeated failure, deep frustration, and demanding pressure from above. While he is doing this, audiences face a couple of unexpected turns, both of which prevents audiences from relieving tension. With delicately described psychology of the protagonist, it is hard for viewers to take their eyes off the screen even for a second. Besides, they might feel a form of pathos when confronting with the hapless genius, his great achievement, and his poignant later years.I would never recommend this film if you were addicted to roughly made tacky movies, thereby could not finish watching a movie without being distracted by kludge which consists of millions of tons of spectacles.

It doesn't provide a special element to the story: it just portrays (which is fine, I personally enjoy when cinematography has a play in the development of the story). The storyline is full of plotholes that contradict with the screenwriting itself. I quote a previous user who said \"if sexism was so prominent in that time of history, why would she have 2 important math degrees?\", as well as \"by portraying Clarke as an emotional element in the movie, it's contradicting the fact that she was portrayed as the smartest of all of them, by not actually serving as such an important figure in that matter\".

            "content": "Based on the life of mathematician Alan Turing, The Imitation Game is the beautifully told story of a brilliant and persecuted man who played a major role in ending World War II. Played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Turing joins and eventually leads a British team in creating a machine capable of decrypting highly sensitive German communications. Their successful work turned the tide of war and eventually led the allies to victory. His story is poignantly juxtaposed against his future self, where he tells his story to a police investigator while being investigated for (and eventually convicted of) homosexuality. It also explores parts of his young life, including his first love and the beginning of his interest in cryptology. Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, a member of Turing's team who becomes his closest friend and, eventually, fianc\u00e9e.\nDirected by Morten Tyldum, the film brilliantly and seamlessly moves between Turing's childhood, the years he spent working on Enigma (1939-1945), and the period where he was persecuted for homosexuality (1951). There are plenty of clues that help the audience place the time period, making the back-and-forth movement uncomplicated. For example, in one scene we see the police detective trying to track down Turing's military records, in the next, we see Alan approaching a World War II-era military vehicle where troops are loading up. Narration (from Turing's interview with the detective) is pulled in and used to tie the time periods together at times.\nThe film uses montages extensively and skillfully. In one short montage, the screen shoots between conflicting scenes rapidly to show the link between these scholars' work and the war. It effectively portrays the effects their important work has on the war and hints at the effects that their momentous decisions have on them emotionally. A close-up of someone completing a mathematic equation is followed by actual footage of soldiers firing machine guns at targets. Bombs dropping, men dying, and the intelligence director opening up a document that surely came from Turing's group is followed by Alan running at a desperate and punishing pace. Through this montage, Turing is narrating what the war was like for their group. He vividly describes the years after their breakthrough, using evocative phrases like \"blood-soaked calculus\" and \"fleets of ships weighing down the oceans.\" The dialogue here is stunning, but it is very nearly eclipsed by the emotionally consuming visuals.\nThe film is darker, with heavier themes than The Theory of Everything, another film that came out that year. Both are about extremely gifted men who were forced to confront momentous issues in their lifetimes. However, Imitation Game capitalizes on the magnitude of Turing's work by creating a suspenseful yet emotional film and weaves it skillfully with Turing's later plight with oppression. These two time periods were the most significant times of his life, and yet they really had little to do with each other. I'm not sure a film about his life could have left either time period out, nor could it have woven the two together more brilliantly. Tyldum's film about Alan Turing's life, accomplishments, and the tragedies that befell him is both engaging and bittersweet.",

I was disappointed by the casting of Cumberbuch and Knightly. Knightly in particular is quite a far cry from the strikingly plain Joan Clarke and actually the authenticity of the story suffers because of how attractive she is. After watching the film I was left with the nagging feeling that Turing was somewhat misrepresented and after picking up a biography of his discovered that my hunch was spot on. Honestly the film is such a misrepresentation as to be almost entirely fictional which is a pity because Turing was a compelling character who led an exciting life. I imagine certain decisions were made for the sake of brevity and cohesive/understandable narrative but to me some of those decisions seem difficult to justify. Decent film but if you're interested in Turing pick up a biography, I can guarantee that you won't be dissapointed",

            "content": "The movie The Imitation Game is based on the biographical book of Alan Turing's \"Enigma\". Alan Turing was an English mathematician and cryptographer. The movie was directed by Morten Tyldum. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley. The film won a major award at the 2014 Toronto Film Festival. The film's script was in the first place in the annual Blacklist of the Best Out-of-Production Hollywood Scripts of 2011. Blacklist is full of a lot of scripts of film out of production on which were filmed later a lot of successful film like \"The king speech\", \"Argo\", \"American Hustle\".The movie is set in Britain in 1939. It was filmed on location in Bletchley Park, which names also like Station X.The picture tells about several timelines of Alan Turing's life. Events of the film take us back to 1939 when Britain entered World War II. A group of British specialists, including Turing, are being assembled at the secret residence in Bletchley Park. They must deal with the problem of decrypting the messages of the Enigma machine used by the Nazis. Every day the group has only 18 hours to break the code. From 6 am when the first trapped radio messages arrived until midnight. At midnight the Germans change the code word. Turing realizes that without help, even \"Christopher\" will be powerless to figure out the original message. Casually in a conversation with a girl radio operator, Turing figures out that all encrypted messages contain constantly repeated words in the weather forecast. This and some other moments help to decode the secret of \"Enigma\", but the specialists immediately face another problem....\nI strongly recommended The Imitation Game for all film buffs who like a war movie. In my opinion, the main films idea how the power of the human's mind helps to Break the Enigma code which brought the day of victory in the war closer by two years and saved millions of lives.",

The character of Alan Turing himself is only paid arguably just homage, as he's portrayed with borderline Asperger Syndrome to keep with Cumberbatch's socially awkward genius typecast. That being said, the sacrifices in terms of history pay off in terms of drama, as viewers can feel the tension wanting to be portrayed by the crew in a more personal manner than if what historically happened was actually presented on screen.

            "content": "Going into this film, I knew nothing about Alan Turing, but as an avid World War historian, this frustrates me beyond belief! In school we are taught the basics of world wars, who started it, why conflicts arose, some major key players, and how it all ended; however I do not recall learning a thing about this man, this hero; Alan Turing. Onto the film itself, while after much research, I can say it is not totally, completely 100% accurate. Yes, the Polish did crack Enigma in 1932. No, it was not just Alan Turing who cracked the code and no, Hut 8 were not solely responsible for deciding who was to live or die in the war, and so on. However, this movie regardless of some historical inaccuracies, is brilliant.The choice of Benedict Cumberbatch as the man himself; Alan Turing, was the best choice ever made in casting. He proves to be an emotional, sympathetic, and able to connect with audience members, portraying a perfect sense of who Alan Turing was. Keira Knightley, is also fantastic as Joan Clarke, despite other critics of her being too pretty, what do you expect, its Hollywood, and Keira portrays an energized, honest, strong-willed and intelligent woman, who soon becomes one of Turing's closet friend. Other cast members also perfectly chosen range from the talented Mark Strong, to wonderful Matthew Goode, Charles Dance, and a spectacular performance from breakout actor Alex Lawther as younger Turing.The story of this film is moving, and hits all the right places, with beautiful music to transcend the narrative, this movie proves poetic and wonderfully written with much thought and care. Personally, I have viewed this movie 4 times and every time it conveys the same strength at its core; portraying the emotional and tragic story of a man who was not accepted by his peers, and was 'different' all his life, but stuck to his wits and his knowledge and created a machine that not only ended the war early by 2 years, but saved countless lives. Most tragically, doing this all in secret, at the time the only thing the British gov't concerned themselves with was the focus on his sexuality. I could go on with unlimited words about how wrong Turing's persecution was, but ultimately; he deserved a metal instead of the treatment he received. The Imitation Game is a wonderful, yet tragic film about Britain's unsung hero, Alan Turing and should is a MUST SEE FILM!",

            "content": "Understanding that this film is primarily about Turing's time at Bletchley, it leaves out the other important contributions that Turing made to the Ace and Manchester computer projects before his death.First off, Benedict Cumberbatch delivers an outstanding performance, albeit one that implies Turing was a high-functioning autistic and something of a one-trick pony. Those aside, there are various liberties taken by the filmmakers that place Turing's accomplishment ahead of history.The machine that Turing developed was actually called the \"Bombe\" taking that name from earlier work in Poland which had deciphered German communications in 1932. Hampering the work at Bletchley was the fact that the Nazis had added an additional wheel to the original Enigma and assigned differing daily settings for various military branches.It was Gordon Welchman who was credited with improvements that made Turing's design practical.The romantic interest Joan Clarke was indeed recruited to Bletchley, but not by the method depicted. It was actually by the aforementioned (and ignored in the film) Gordon Welchman.Whether Turing truly confided his secret designs with her is questionable if Turing's loyalty as depicted is to be believed. Many former workers at Bletchley have come forward in recent years to admit that they had no idea whatsoever of the overall project for which they had put in their efforts, even after decades.The German \"mistake\" transmission did not lead to solving the Enigma, which had already been cracked, but actually to solving an even more advanced German cipher then being used known as Lorenz and nicknamed \"Tunny.\" The theoretical work on Tunny was made by Bill Tutte and was later transferred to Bletchley. It was this work that most directly assisted Allied victory.Finally an even more advanced machine known as Colossus was designed at the Post Office Reasearch Center in London. This was the first machine to decrypt a transmission directly (which had been recorded on a paper tape reel), rather than just to determine the key to be used against decrypting messages by hand.Lastly, even Turing's deliberate suicide is questioned, being that he had actually been discontinued from hormone treatments more than a year before his death and may not have been as despondent as the filmmakers present.",

While the Allies fight the Germans, the integrity of the quasi-Justice League that Denniston has built at the GC&CS is ostensibly compromised by Turing's incessant belief that the machine he's building will break the Enigma machine. That Winston Churchill himself bankrolls Turing's project when no one else will exudes an air of fiction given the way the narrative is prone to playing such acts of wheeling and dealing for shits and giggles, but the film's faithful replica of the bombe doesn't evoke such frivolity. No one stands before this ominous, monolith-like beacon of promise, with its wall of rotating, ever-clacking drums, without quaking at the thought of what their persistence in cryptanalyzing the Enigma can mean to the war effort. Watching the subservience of the film's characters to the very machine they built, then seeing how this almost existential panic informs \"the imitation game\" that, years later, Turing plays with Nock at the police station during a battle of wills, is close to a masterstroke.An ironic masterstroke, as the unease with which the filmmakers articulate Turing's devotion to exploring the possibility of machinery showing intelligent behavior is itself The Imitation Game's only sign of intelligent life. The trajectory of cryptanalyst Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), from her potential being squandered by her parents to her brief engagement to Turing to, finally, her friendly visit with him just prior to his suicide, is a means for the film to slavishly shore up her bona fides as both a feminist and \"fag hag.\" It's a fashionable pose, and given the liberties the film takes here and elsewhere, it's surprising that it refuses to penetrate Turing's carnality and allow Cumberbatch to truly wrestle with the torment of the man's sexuality. It does, though, reduce Turing in his last days to a Gollum-like creature who regards the bombe-like contraption in his flat as a precious reminder of his childhood crush at Sherborne. In this way, this real-life genius, a eunuch even before his castration, remains an enigma, seen only through a lens of psychoanalytically trite pulp romanticism.",

As one of the Wrens taking down the coded messages, I was in complete ignorance of anything connected with Bletchley Park until the thirty years of the Official Secrets Act were over and I too, went into every detail of those happenings that I could find, mainly through the book Enigma, which was written after that time. There are many errors in the film, mainly in the way their work was discussed in public places, but in general, it is a magnificent portrayal of that perilous time. I find it typical of modern thinking that some reviewers consider that there is not enough emphasis on Turing's homosexuality, but apart from the fact that it led to his tragic suicide, it is of the least importance. Not only that, but these people do not understand that it would be desperately covered up in those days, as public knowledge of it would have led to a prison sentence, not to mention his being taken away from his supremely important mission.

Despite overwhelming obstacles, he and his team successfully develop another machine to decipher the enigma, which historians estimate shortened the war by more than 2 years and saved over 14 million lives.Far from being a war hero due to the nature of his confidential work, Alan is convicted of his homosexuality and is sentenced to hormonal therapy for 2 years, which makes him dogged by depression. After a year of the hormonal therapy, he commits suicide as a 41-year-old. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon, honoring his unprecedented achievements.Sensitively directed by Morten Tyldum, the film describes Alan's tremendous accomplishment and his lonely life. The script is alternatively gripping, surprising, and hilarious. As Alan, Benedict's acting is quite awesome.Overall, I find that Alan's work is really electrifying even at this day and age, and his personal life is deeply poignant. If you have no idea who Alan is, you'd better go see this film! It is not slow-paced, and so you won't get bored, I promise. Based on a real story, it is a bit predictable, though. Anyways, it deserves to be widely praised. I wish you would also have a chance to honor his legacy some time soon!",

The fact that i took the time to actually sit down and think-write a review means that it is a good movie! Anyway here goes nothing! Oh and the review does contain spoilers and a bit of iffy grammar and spelling. Apparently if we systematically bully our brightest students (especially those we suspect are gay) we will be able to produce amazing super-scientists who will advance science in incredible ways and potentially win wars!Irony aside, the movie deals with one of the less known and unappreciated aspects of WW2, and its brilliant at that!Performances where a bit flat and the plot predictable but sufficient.",

            "content": "This is a film about that strange, geeky kid with eccentric idiosyncrasies who gets bullied in the school yard, turning out to be a genius and making a profound impact on the course of history. That kid is Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), who grew up to become an extraordinary pioneer of computer science. His story, as told by the film, is both heart-warming and heart-wrenching. You learn the real meaning of never judging a book by its cover. The film begins in Britain during WWII, when Turing, a mathematics professor, is recruited by the British government to break an unbreakable code - The Engima, a machine that the Germans use to send encrypted messages to each other. It was a mission impossible, and indeed it was, as the odds against Turing and his team were ginormous - as the machine coughs up 159 + 18 zeros different possibilities (Wait what? that's 159 million million million!). As Turing puts it, it will take 10 men, even if they don't sleep, frolic, drink or eat, 20 million years to go through them. And to add icing on the cake, the whole system changes every. single. day. And so, an ingenious idea to build a machine to defeat this machine was born. But of course, conflicts ensue and Turing was faced with funding issues (which he solved through grabbing funds from Churchill himself), being a social outcast and snob to his fellow code breakers (there was an amusing scene where Turing tried to bribe others to like him by feeding them apples), and a frustrating constant need to prove himself and his plans to others. Just believe him for God's sake! And as if that wasn't bad enough, he was also accused of being a Soviet spy, solely based on his social awkwardness and quiet personality. It is also here that he recruits Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), his fianc\u00e9e for a short period of time, an intelligent lady with an incredible knack for solving obscure puzzles. After much turmoil, Turing and this team finally cracks the code, but was confronted with yet another dilemma, which messages should we act on? Whose lives should we save?A series of flashbacks showed us that when young Turing (Alex Lawther) was at boarding school, he formed a close relationship with Christopher Morcom (Jack Bannon), who tragically died young from an illness. Naming his machine after him, Turing's homosexuality was revealed and after the war, was harshly prosecuted for it. Cumberbatch's performance really brings out Turing's introverted yet direct nature. His tendency to say whatever is on his mind, without any filters reminds me of Jim Parson's Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory. His exchanges with Commanded Denniston (Charles Dance) at his job interview were very entertaining. Turing's quick, unintentional wit will leave you humoured and speechless, in a good way. His arrogance is almost adorable, and never makes you want to put poison in his tea. As this film is more or less a dramatisation of Turing's life, there are bound to be historical inaccuracies. But the essence of his tremendous contributions to the war and the degrading treatment he endured for his sexual orientation remain true. You will leave the with phenomenal gratitude and sympathy for this man, who, despite being considered as less of a man at the time, is more of one than many of us.",

            "content": "In the Weinstein Company movie, The Imitation Game, Alan Turning is a compelling and intriguing character. Certainly the opening scene, where he is being viciously interrogated, draws the audience in. This movie has the audience wondering what makes Alan, played by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, so different? Taking place in WWII, this movie illustrates the story of Alan Turing and his cryptanalysis team's mission to crack the German Enigma code. Portrayed in a beautifully compelling picture, and directed by Morten Tyldum, this film takes place in England. In comparison to so many other WWII movies, this particular film gives the audience a taste of the warfare away from the front lines at Bletchley Park. Alan Turing and his team must crack the German code to help prevent possible attacks on British and American ships, which in the end actually leads them to save countless lives. Benedict Cumberbatch does a wonderful job at playing the complicated and multifaceted character of Alan Turing. Benedict displays a socially awkward, but brilliant, Turing in way that encourages the audience to wonder what he is hiding. He is cynical, secretive, mysterious and brilliant.Indeed, we find that Turing is a homosexual, and, because of the legal punishments that can be dealt by Britain at the time, he must keep his secret to himself. He holds this heavy weight while serving as a vital part of helping defeat Germany in the war. After the war, Turing's sexual identity is eventually found out and is sentenced to chemical castration. Ultimately Alan Turing commits suicide. It is a tragic outcome but, because of the unaccepting social culture at the time, it is understandable. One may wonder why such passions arouse and why they must be punished and that is not an easy answer. How can anyone suggest they have not had a perverted thought in their lifetime. According to the Bible all men are considered sinful (Romans 3:23) and so all should be punished. Yet those who understand God's love, through his atoning son Jesus Christ, they will not be punished but will be restored to His perfect likeness.This film is an inspiration and I recommend it. Its humor will make you smile and the honesty of the world it portrays will make you think.",

            "content": "The Imitation Game (2014) seamlessly ties together three story sequences from different times in the life of brilliant mathematician Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Most of the film's screen time is dedicated to wartime when Turing and his team, hired by British government, are working diligently to crack the Nazi code, Enigma. Turing has a brilliant obsession to create Christopher, a machine sure to break Enigma. Turing's teammates, including initial team-leader Hugh (Matthew Goode), find Turing's personality to be quite intolerable, which leads to tension and disconnect amongst the members. Turing's only female recruit, Joan (Keira Knightley), understands and appreciates his quirks and genius, and helps build bridges between Turing and the rest of the men. When tensions arise and suspicions of a spy surface, the group finally comes together to use Christopher to break the code, and use their newly gained knowledge to make war-winning decisions. Throughout this storyline, seamless transitions are used to take us back in time to Turing as a young school boy, developing feelings for his classmate, Christopher, and learn how and why he became the master code-breaker we see during the war. We also are moved forward in time to post-war life for Turing, when, after reporting a break- in, Detective Nock (Rory Kinnear) pursues an investigation of Turing which has devastating long-term effects on his life. Accepting enigmas seems to be an underlying theme of the film, whether the enigma is a machine, situation, or person. Turing himself is an enigma to others; he is uncomfortably antisocial, often seeming self-righteous, and no one understood him or expected his machine to work. This is supported by dialogue, one quote in particular which is repeated three times throughout the film: \"Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.\" Christopher said this to young Turing, Turing to Joan, then Joan again to Turing later. The structure of the storyline is also somewhat of an enigma, as it begins in medias res, and the viewer is forced to pay attention to follow the back-and-forth of times, though superb editing makes this easy to do. One such smooth transitions, is a wipe with the left to right transition of a bomb flying across the screen which turns into a cigarette getting put out against a wall in a different time and place. Once the pieces of the plot \"enigma\" are put together in the end, it falls into place for the viewer to understand, similar to Christopher Nolan's The Prestige (2006). After seeing the film, you might walk away with a stronger conviction to accept people for who they are and to embrace a challenge, no matter how confusing they may seem in the beginning.",

            "review_title": "Great Story About WWII and the War One Man Battled With Himself",
            "content": "The Imitation Game is a dramatic movie with a slight touch of suspense based on Alan Turing's experience well working for the British Government Communication Headquarters. Ultimately Turing is able to help break the code for the Enigma machines that the Germans were using to send encrypted messages during war time. The movie starts with the present day of Alan's life, a break in at Alan's house and how Alan reacts to the officers and the way he responds to others being in his house is alarming to the police that are trying to get information for their investigation. This sparks officers to look into Alan's background. The film then transitions to 1939 when Alan is interviewing for the British Government Communication. This point of the movie we get see the characterization of the key roles in this film. Something that sticks out about Alan is that he a very literal person. We see how socially awkward Alan is when he interacts with a group. At this point the film continues with the non-linear format and flashes back to when Alan was is in grade school. This sets up another character of the film. Christopher, Christopher is Alan's school friend that Alan states is the reason he was able to get through school and who introduced him to cryptic messages. Because this film his based on actual events that occurred and on parts of Alan's life the story is very credible. The film does a fantastic job of showing what life was like living Britain during WWII. All of the clothing and scenery is very dull. Not too many colors and the town's people seem to have come to term with bombings that happen quite often. In one scene the alarm for the citizens to take cover goes off. The camera shows the plane flying over the very dark city and then shows a families calmly but steadily to the bomb shelters. As the bombs were hitting, the scene shows some of the celling falling in the shelter but no one reacts. The screen then transitions to the morning after showing all the destruction that has been caused. This sets the mood to show the pressure that Alan his under help solve Enigmas encrypted messages. I found it interesting that the only other person that Alan truly let see him for who he was Joan. I think Alan was able to relate to Joan because he understood some of what she went through being different. Woman during that time were not allowed to work certain jobs because they were viewed as not being able to have to same brain capacity as men. Joan was a woman who could solve math problems and crossword puzzles faster than Alan. This was unheard of and men never gave her chance, so Alan did. Alan tells Joan the same words that Christopher said to him when he was unsure of himself. \"Sometimes it is the people no one images anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.\" At the time Alan does not tell her it was Christopher that told him the very same words but Joan learns to trust Alan and is thankful for what he has done for her. Joan character develops into someone that is strong and sure of herself that no longer has to rely on Alan to protect her. She actually tries to protect Alan later in the movie when the allegations come out that he is gay. She is scared for Alan and is willing to commit perjury to save him from the government sanctioned laws against gay men. The two points of climax for me was when the commanding officer finally has enough Alan's attitude and takes his personal feelings out on Alan by getting back at him professionally and bring a team to unplug the machine. Alan his able to convince the commander to give him another month which heightens the suspense and anxiety of the audience. We want to see Alan win, he has been through so much and believes in this machine so much. Plus the machine is a extension of Christopher for Alan so it has to work. The second conflict when the officers find out that what Alan was hiding that he is a homosexual. The officer knows that Alan his a war hero and does not want to pursue with the charges but at this point it is out of his hands. The charges are eventually filed on Alan. Alan's internal conflicts eventually win over him. Alan knew he was different when he was younger and tried his best to hide that he is gay. Because of this he does not even want to admit that he was friends with Christopher when the school official tells him that Christopher has died. The very thing that Alan worked so hard to hide and keep to himself is the thing that ultimately ends up ruining the man he was.",

I personally believe that they had killed it, especially Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing. Cumberbatch, in my opinion, did a wonderful job portraying Alan Turing's life and character development. \n\nI thought the quality of the film was excellent because I liked the setting of the film, and it really felt like a window into what the world was like back in the 1940s. I would absolutely recommend this film for anyone who can get their hands on it, but it does contain violence, the use of alcohol, and drama, so may not recommend for younger audiences. Personally, I'd give the film a 5/5 stars because as someone who likes World War 2 history, this film was an enjoyable adventure from start to finish. If you like historical films, I'd suggest this one.",

In essence, back then there was probably some political reason that he was treated like that. Today, again, there is another agenda that is focusing on his sexual preferences. Unfortunately, for me, both are using him to support whatever they want to support, and he is the victim in both cases equally.\n\nWhen you present the life of such extraordinary man, you present everything and focus on his influence. In this movie, in the end he is just presented as a victim of the system, which he might have been, but definitely not for a reason of his homosexuality. That was just a motive. Federal services do not do things for such trivialities. There is something more into that. Even back then, he would be protected and he was not. Why? That, the movie does not explain and does not try to dig into at all. His accomplishments are shown in an extremely superficial way. There is not even an attempt to dig into what he has done. And, really, it is not that impossible to explain. If the scenarists asked me, I could give them one scene that would dig into his ideas, I mean we are using his computers today and we cannot explain how he built Enigma-decoder. Really?\n\nFantastic acting, everything else ok, but using him, yet again, to support the current agenda is just showing that we actually did NOT learn a lesson. People were expendable back then as they are today. Used, abused and then discarded. It is almost certain that he was treated that way because he was considered dangerous, self-sufficient or similar, not because the law required it. The system would protect him otherwise for sure.\n\nYou say that this movie is abolishing some malpractice from the past. No it does not. It is using a life of a man for some new its own end. Just like back then the system did to these exceptional people.\n\nIt is not the point of supporting or rejecting what he was. It is the point of portraying him. There was 0 portrait of him in this movie. Sorry for bad review, but he actually did not deserve this movie.",

Directed by Morten Tyldum, it is based on the true story of Alan Turing, A cryptanalyst who later made massive contributions to the era of artificial intelligence. The character was played by Benedict Cumberbatch, a worldwide famous English actor who won many awards, including the Golden Globe award, Laurence Olivier award, and countless others. The film itself also won the Academy Award for the best-adapted screenplay. \n\nI personally like many works of Cumberbatch, and it could be argued that the Imitation Game is a classic. In fact, Cumberbatch almost specializes in characters that are aloof, intelligent and upper \u2013 class. Through his Career he has played Sherlock Holmes, one of the most famous detectives in the world, Dr. Strange, A character in the MCU which resembled high intelligence but with a chill and arrogant personality, Stephen Hawking and many more characters that fit with the characterization of Alan Turing. On point, realistic and powerful acting are just a few words that resemble Cumberbatch's acting in The Imitation Game. From his face, we see almost Turing himself. Cumberbatch does a very, very great job at exposing the true emotions of success, nervousness etc. Most important of all, he vividly portrays what an autistic genius would sound and would be seen as, even if autistics sometimes don't show their emotions well, Cumberbatch grasps this and uses it at the right time. I personally see the brilliant acting of Cumberbatch as a big bonus to the film. In other words, the film would probably not have held the suspension of disbelief as well without him.\n\nThe plot of the film is generally straightforward. Alan Turing, a professor of Mathematics who was intelligent to the point that he published multiple articles when he was around 20. He signs up for the secret code-breaking mission, and step on the journey of breaking the impossible Nazi code with his faithful sidekicks. \n\nAlthough the film mainly addresses the process of deciphering the near\u2013impossible Nazi code, some of it, especially the ending, is quite emotional. Alan Turing is a genius. However, he most certainly suffers from some aspects of Autism or depression. This is actually quite common amongst many masterminds throughout history. Einstein, for example, was one of the greatest scientists who suffered from severe depression, and It was probably why he died. Turing's fate was in some aspects identical, as the film doesn't state that Turing dies from depression, anyone who's watched the film would have a pretty good idea why he died. He was bullied hard at school, and nearly no one wanted anything to do with him. This became one of the reasons why Turing was a successive but tragic character, which was implied at the end of the story and may spark some tears whilst watching.",

Had high hopes for 'The Imitation Game', after hearing so many good things about it, and it ended up being one of my favourite films of 2014.\n\nThat 'The Imitation Game' is historically inaccurate and has distortions didn't offend me as much as some reviewers, biographical dramas are notorious for this so it's come to be expected by me (not that that is meant to be an excuse). All that was wanted was a film that made me think, moved me, was well made and well acted. 'The Imitation Game' was all those things and more.\n\nIt isn't perfect, the political elements are on the preachy side and there are a few strands that could have gone into more detail, Turing's sexuality should have gotten into more depth than it was.\n\nHowever, 'The Imitation Game' is exceptionally well made. It's immaculately photographed and has some of the best production design of its best, especially in the costumes. The direction allows the film to be absorbing, while the music score is often hauntingly beautiful and never intrusive.\n\nIn terms of the script, 'The Imitation Game' does a wonderful job in provoking thought and providing emotional impact and nuances and fleshes the characters out with remarkable complexity. What could have been potentially dry treatment of the subject matter turned out to be fascinating, thrilling and very moving.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch gives his best performance of a very solid career, an outstanding portrayal that won't be forgotten for years to come. Keira Knightley is a sympathetic confidante and Charles Dance is excellent as always as his superior. The supporting cast are without complaint.\n\nOverall, wonderful film and its acclaim is a long way from an enigma. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Of course, for cinematic purposes, the narrative heavily leans on a specific storyline that does take artistic license on the actual events that took place historically. The truth is that there were many heroes in the war, and there are still other untold stories of efforts just as valiant. That said, Cumberbatch and Knightly did a great job in conveying some of the complex feelings and emotions that arose from many difficult situations.

He completely transforms into this troubled but intelligent man. An outstandingly good performance from one of the many GREAT actors working today.\n\nNotable also are the performances from the supporting, especially Kiera Knightly who gives a warming and sympathetic portrayal of Joan that supports Alan during the enigma breaking process as well as personal troubles.\n\nThe script compelled me throughout, mixing elements of the thriller and drama genres into one. It's a very fascinating film and the script is an important cog in the machine here, excuse the pun.\n\nAn exhilarating watch and a story that needs attention for many reasons. What a remarkable man Alan was.",

Unable to crack the Enigma Code through his own efforts, Bendict Cumberbatch's Turing is only successful when a young girl, that he meets down the pub, delivers to him the crucial 'crib' to unlock the puzzle. In reality this sort of crib would have been worked through from the very first code-breaking moments when the team was first brought together. Lesser brains than Turing's would have noted all available cribs while Turing went through more serious, higher order cognitive contortions. In reality Turing cracked the Enigma Code and then crossed the Atlantic to advise the Americans on code breaking operations, but this nugget of truth doesn't fit with the socially inept creep that Cumberbatch chooses to portray. The film makers lacked the imagination to deal with this subject. Turing was a man, who happened to be gay, whose war effort consisted of sitting at a desk thinking. This is a story that deserved some serious thought, but it ended up getting the standard insultingly formulaic treatment.",

Turing was eccentric, not the simplistic personality disorder sufferer portrayed in this movie.\nAnd the movie is completely disconnected from history, Turing's role at Bletchley Park is inflated to a silly degree, and the sub-story about a convoy and use of intelligence is ridiculous.\nSome will claim this doesn't matter, it's a movie, it's entertainment.

            "content": "(*spoiler warning*) The Imitation Game was hot-Oscar buzz when it was released in 2014. The story is about Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a mathematician assigned the task to break the unbreakable Nazi code called \"Enigma\". Cumberbatch gives an incredible performance as Turing which earned him an Academy nod. Upon further examination, it seems like an obvious choice to cast the Sherlock actor to play the part. The other stand-out performance I'd like to discuss is Keira Knightley as the spunky, humorous, and compassionate Joan Clarke, who is the lone woman working to break Enigma in secret who is an inspiration of social change.\n\nHowever inspirational, Turing's story is devastatingly sad. Instead of being praised and honored as a hero, he was arrested for indecency (being gay) and was subjected to chemically-induced castration. He committed suicide the year after. All that hard work, all those hours he spent, all the lives he saved amounted to nothing. He was given a posthumous royal pardon by the Queen in 2013, but that doesn't quite make up for what happened.\n\nI'm going to try and end this review on a high note, all of what he did do did amount to something. I wouldn't be here typing on this computer (also known as a \"Turing machine\") had it not been for him. And while unknown to many, he and his team took part in saving the war and do deserve to be honored for that. Remember kids, \"sometimes it's the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine\". I highly recommend this movie to teens, though it is not easy viewing it's a powerful and beautiful story about persistence and the hidden heroes of WWII.",

            "content": "The prestige biopic genre meets the \"Great Man\" genre of film in this very stuffy British period piece featuring a host of British actors you will probably be familiar with if you have seen any of the other entries in this genre. I have to admit that I am not a fan of this sort of film as movies like Wilson (1944) and Gandhi (1982) use the \u2018worthiness' of their subject matters as an excuse for their general lack of quality. Unfortunately this film falls prey to many of the most annoying clich\u00e9s of the genre as we see how our main character's professional success is closely connected to a personal tragedy from his past and have a supporting character through which 21st century values can be impressed upon the film. Yes, the production design is decent and there is nothing to complain about in terms of the cinematography and musical score but the clumsy attempts at emotional manipulation towards the end of the film anger an already resistant audience and for me this attempt to force tears out of me was what pushed me from finding the film slight but acceptable to taking against it.\n\nAnti-social mathematical genius Alan Turing, Benedict Cumberbatch, finds employment as a code breaker at Bletchley Park during the Second World War where he is ordered to crack the Enigma Code so that the Allies can defeat the Nazis. He finds a friend in Joan Clarke, Keira Knightley, after initially angering his co-workers and she helps him to endear himself to the men that he works with and become more comfortable expressing his emotions. His homosexuality is something he struggles with as it is criminally outlawed at the time and his only prospect of romantic love was destroyed when he was a teenager. He tries to find fulfillment through cracking the code but the government is determined to punish him for his homosexuality and despite helping the war effort he faces extraordinary horrors under the government's treatment system for homosexuality.\n\nMuch like The Theory of Everything (2014) the film presents it's lead character as a tragic hero who is a victim of society's prejudices but who finds acceptance in the arms of a \u2018good' woman. While I wouldn't call Clarke's presentation quite as irksome as that of Jane Hawking in the aforementioned film she still never feels quite like a real human being and more like the screenwriter's convenient way to force modern values into the story in a way that seems rather improbable. The relationship between the two hits all of the familiar beats as she is a saintly sufferer entertained by all of his quirks and sharper personality traits while he is rude to her before expressing at some point later in the film that he does quite enjoy her company. Having seen all this before in A Beautiful Mind (2001) and countless other biopics I was not enthused about seeing it again and while Cumberbatch and Knightley are talented actors they don't have the stuff to make this tired trope feel fresh and exciting. \n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the film concerns the young Turing's love for his childhood best friend Christopher Morcom, Jack Bannon, whom he is tragically separated from. Unfortunately what could have been a touching teen romance becomes a small sliver of an otherwise unremarkable film that's emotional impact is dulled by the film's other attempts to wring sympathy out of you. Alex Lawther upstages Cumberbatch as the young version of the character conveying multitudes in just a few scenes and really making us believe in his character's investment in this relationship. It would have been nice to see the romantic drama instead of the biopic and in many ways this brief reprieve from the dull, plodding biopic hurt the film because it made me realize how interesting cinema that doesn't concern \"Important Men\" can be. \n\nAll in all, not a terrible film and one that will certainly have less cynical family members and friends crying but for a more discerning audience this may be something that they have seen a few too many times to swallow again. In terms of Best Picture contenders in 2014 it's definitely in the bottom half of the slate for me.",

This writing evel works well in the form of narration which most films tend to stay away from because they fear they will do it poorly (unlike this one). This leads into the other thing being the man himself Benedict Cumberbatch. The cast is good and well acted; Benedict steals the show (as he should). He absolutely accels at playing an anti-social awkward super genius, similar to his role of Sherlock in the hit show \u2018Sherlock'. However what is different from his role in Sherlock is how he portrays himself here. He has crafted the perfect character here that feels very far off from Benedict himself. Beautiful acting and writing overall (and the cinematography is pretty good too).",

Whether as Sherlock or Strange, Cumberbatch excels at portraying an uebermensch figure, whose inscrutable genius and impenetrable self-confidence allow his characters to do what no one else can, will, or should. As played by Cumberbatch, Turing is more than a mathematical prodigy and oddity of a man: Contrary to the standard stereotype, he is also a dedicated athlete running before it was fashionable and a imperious leader who does what must be done, criticisms be damned. Physically fit, intellectually superior, morally domineering: This sound less like a gay crossword puzzle enthusiast than it does the Nazi ideal; late in the film, Turing even demands the right to choose who will die in the war and who will be saved by his algorithms, a fascist wet dream. In this sense, which is admittedly quite Zizekian at bottom, the audience is allowed to enjoy what a dictatorial jerk Turing acts like, is permitted and even encouraged to emotionally buy into the uebermensch fantasy, because on the surface, he is treated as an outsider to the system on account of his queerness, while on a deeper level, he is really an outsider because he is a cryptofascist within the ranks of the Allied forces.",

Maybe it was just me who felt that the film began slowing down once they had cracked Enigma. It had built itself on the basis of events coming one after another, before it transitioned into this slow, emotional second half that worked, but just couldn't match the first half for me. Overall, though, this is still an excellent film for bringing to light the greater story behind one man's supposed eccentricities.",

It is set in 1939 at the beginning of World War II and follows a brilliant mathematician, Alan Turing, who is recruited by the secret British Intelligence Agency MI6 to solve the German Code 'Enigma', which was thought to be unbreakable. Although the movie itself is spectacular, Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing is remarkable. He can keep true to the name of the film and imitate Turing through his quirky and awkward body language. Everything from his movement to his speech impediments paint a vivid picture of what the master mathematician may have been, which is incredible seeing as everything Benedict Cumberbatch knew about Turing is what he read. He plays a very soft yet assertive genius who isn't always able to pick up on social cues and quite frequently creates awkward situations. His portrayal of Turing can easily be compared to Tom Hanks in \"Forrest Gump\", or Ashton Kutcher in \"Jobs\". This is because he plays his part very well but is not over the top, so he never comes off as offensive. The movie is great for all occasions and provides a wonderful insight into the harsh times of The Second World War, as well as showing the \"nerds\" behind the frontlines working to end the war. If you are inclined to solving puzzles, this is a must watch film that will bring you back in time to the hardest code ever broken.",

            "content": "It took a little over 24 hours before I weighed in on my official thoughts on Morten Tyldum's The Imitation Game from The Weinstein Company. My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year's best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. \n\nFull disclosure, I'm fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I've heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn't care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read \"Alan Turing: The Enigma,\" the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later.\n\nMasterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's \"Sherlock,\" this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.\n\nThe rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. \n\nI don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.\n\nTechnical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg's efforts. It's something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let's not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year.\n\nThe Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made. There are sub plots that all resonate and never feel forced. This will not only keep your tension level at a fever pitch but could leave you in tears to walk home with. It's a complete realistic view at the spy game that stands as one of the best films of the year and a performance for the ages from Benedict Cumberbatch. A captivating achievement that I'll likely remember for some time.Truly excellent film and definitely Ocsar worthy material for both the film and the actors. The entire cast are amazing.\n\nAs Cumberbatch says near the start of the film \"are you paying attention\". You should pay attention, Alan Turing deserves your attention, his story deserves to be told.\n\nI went to see this at the London Film Festival last week and I am going to be one of the first ones in the cue to see it when it comes out next month. It is an excellently paced and executed script that has you gripped from beginning to end. The whole audience were laughing and applauding and crying in places, including the man next to me who had to borrow a hankie from his wife.\n\nThe film switches between the drive of the team of code breakers to solve the Enigma code, young Alan Turing and the events after the war that destroyed his life. \n\nIt is truly heartbreaking in places, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Alan Turing is outstanding. He really deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.\n\nIt has been a very, VERY long time since I enjoyed a film so much, that when I came out of the Cinema I wanted to turn right round and go back in and watch it again. A lovely script that had you switching back and forwards between tears and laughter.\n\nI know some wanted a more in depth and in detail look at Alan Turing's life and have commented frequently that this does no focus enough on his sexuality or the events after the war.\n\nIn this case I think less is more, this film highlights the man and the mind. It shows us the genius that was destroyed by a society that was seriously homophobic. It brings to life the man behind the facts and we laugh at his interactions with his fellow code breakers and cheer as he proves his theories and our hearts break as we watch him try to cope after his court case.\n\nOne of the best films I have seen in a long time. Go and see judge for yourself.I  went to see this movie at a screening. I have to admit, I went into this movie not knowing anything about Alan Turing and Enigma, but I love movies based on true events; especially those about the history of our country. \n\nDespite not knowing anything about Mr. Turing or the events of his life, as soon as I left the movie theater, I went home and looked him up and spent the next few hours learning of his life, everything he did for this country and the invention of what we now call 'the computer'.\n\nI want to start by saying that Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie is outstanding. He plays Alan Turing perfectly; his accent, his movements and just the way he plays the character on screen is beautiful. I can honestly say that this is the performance of his career! \n\nThe movie focuses on different aspects of his life: it shows him and his team trying to break Enigma, it shows Young Turing during his time at boarding school, and the events after the war. \n\nThere's a quote at the beginning of the movie: \"are you paying attention?\". Throughout the movie, that's what I did. It's all that I could do because the story and the acting kept my eyes glued to the screen and I couldn't take them away. It's emotional, it's exciting and it is truly heartbreaking in some moments. It was a very comedic movie, too. There were some scenes that had me in fits of laughter and that's what makes it a beautiful script; despite the movie being based on the darkest days of World War 2, they added comedy into it which brought the movie alive. \n\nI remember getting home and after researching Alan's life, I wanted to go back to the cinema and watch the movie again. It's rarely that happens to me but when this comes out in November, I will be straight to the cinema and purchasing a ticket to watch it. \n\nI've heard reviewers mentioning that this film doesn't focus enough on Turing's homosexuality. Now, be that as it may, it focus' enough on the subject. Remember: this movie is about his mind, about the man himself. He was a genius! \n\nThis is the best British movie that I've saw in a long time, and it's probably one of the best movies that I've ever had the pleasure of watching, period. \n\nI would recommend going to watch this movie when it comes out because it will take you into the world of Mr. Turing and the struggles and successes he made in his short life.I've read the reviews and mostly pointing out the inaccuracy of the details in the movie. I have never read or learn about Alan Turing or any evolution of Computers. \n\nBased upon the meaning of the movie, I think it is so fascinating. I believed the producers were trying to point out the fact that being difference is what matters. Ordinary things is boring and wont bring any changes. \n\nBenedict did a fine job as Alan, from being a curious over the head thinker (like he always does in Sherlock) to an insecure man. Oh! The young Alan did a great job especially that scene where he tries to hide his tears upon receiving the sad news about Christopher form the headmaster. All the characters were well played and the scenery of the movie is spot on specifically for the WW period.\n\nWhat's more striking about the movie is the indication of the way homosexuals are being treated back then. It just makes me sad, I mean what else could he have done if he was to live longer. \nThe Imitation Game (2014): Dir: Morten Tyldum / Cast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Charles Dance, Mark Strong: Brilliant true account telling of mind over matter. Set during World War 2 and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician brought in to crack the Enigma to decode German messages. Turing manufactures a machine for which he calls \"Christopher,\" named after a childhood friend. He suffers as a team player and alienates himself from others brought in to assist. He eventually sends out a crossword puzzle urging a meeting with anyone who can solve it under a specific time. Enter Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, bright young woman whom ends up engaged to Turing until he admits his homosexuality. This plagues him in his relationships until it leads to his suicide when it is deemed indecent by government and they place him on chemical castration. Clarke seems determined to accomplish her mission despite obvious disappointments in him. Strong supporting work by Matthew Goode, Charles Dance and Mark Strong either working with Turing or overseeing the project and threatening to halt it when results fail. Director Morten Tyldum details the project and its failings, frustrations and eventually its triumph when the war is shortened by about two years thanks to this decoding machine. While historians will appreciate this film most, it does present a tense time in our history where trials are conquered through a group of brilliant minds and one clever mathematician who ultimately brought victory and found heart break.

            "content": "Can machines think? This is the main question posed in \"Computer Machinery and Intelligence,\" a 1950s paper published by Alan Turing. The paper's concepts surfaced in his single-handed design and construction of a machine that broke the German Enigma codes during World War II...or so the film says. While the historical accuracy of \"The Imitation Game\" comes into question on several occasions, the outstanding quality of the film's acting, direction and story is no enigma.\n\nThe movie focuses on the life of Alan Turing, a British mathematician, computer scientist and cryptanalyst. The British Intelligence recruits Turing along with other cryptographic minds to crack the Enigma codes that the Nazis use as secret communication during the war. The film's narrative alternates between three significant times in Turing's life: his education at Sherborne School as a teenager, his classified work with Enigma during the war and the investigation surrounding Turing's sexual orientation in 1952.\n\nThe settings of the Enigma machines change daily as the war progresses. The small group of cryptographers has 18 hours each day to figure out the settings of the machines before the Germans alter the settings the next day. This is a virtually impossible task for the team to accomplish because of the infinite number of possible settings the machine possesses, causing progressive frustration amongst the team. Turing's initial rudeness, apparent social detachment and unwillingness to work with the rest of the team only add to the growing tension.\n\nTuring conceives, designs and begins to build a machine that he believes will be able to mull through the numerous Enigma settings possibilities at a considerably fast rate. A machine like this has never been built, much less proved to work. His endeavor brings about much skepticism and agitation from the team. Over time however, especially after the acquisition of Joan Clarke (Keira Knightly) to the team, Turing begins to treat his colleagues with respect and gains their trust.\n\nTo say that Benedict Cumberbatch had an amazing performance at this point in his career is the equivalent of saying the sky is blue, and it remains blue yet again as Cumberbatch knocks it out of the park.\n\nTuring as shown in the film is extremely intelligent but lacks normal social skills. He is not the most likable guy; he has trouble interacting with others, takes everything that is said to him literally and has a sense of arrogance that puts others off. However, there is also warmth about his character and he genuinely desires to be liked by others. Cumberbatch expresses both aspects of this persona beautifully.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally fantastic. Those who play the members of Turing's team (Matthew Goode, Allen Leach, Matthew Beard and Keira Knightly) have great chemistry with each other and Cumberbatch. Alex Lawther as the young Alan Turing mimics Cumberbatch's portrayal well, and viewers will truly believe the struggles he endures from being different than everyone else.\n\nGraham Moore took home an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work on the film, and it's not hard to see why. The well-written script is the fuel for the gripping, emotional drama exhibited in the actors' performances.\n\nMorten Tyldum's direction is not to be ignored either. The interchange between the various time periods in Turing's life are done smoothly, and the non-linear story telling is carried out excellently. The writing, directing and acting present Turing's struggle well as a homosexual in the 1950s and the punishment that he had to endure because of it. While both aspects of the production are good from a narrative standpoint, the direction and the writing is also where the main issue of the movie lies.\n\nIn \"The Imitation Game,\" viewers are led to believe that Turing built the machine that cracked Enigma and conceived its design virtually by himself. In reality however, the Polish Intelligence gave a primitive version of the machine to the Government Code and Cypher School in 1939, and Turing was hired to make improvements on the machine based on his knowledge of computers. Also, unlike the movie portrays; Turing was actually well liked by his colleagues and was placed as the head of the operation until 1942.\n\nThis is one of several factual errors present in \"The Imitation Game\" that range from Turing giving his machine a name, to John Cairncross being a cryptanalyst and a somewhat influential character in the story.\n\nDespite these historical inaccuracies, the movie has received widespread critical acclaim. In addition to winning the Best Adapted Screenplay award, it also received nine Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor.\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" is a riveting drama with stellar performances, excellent writing and solid direction. Among the better films of 2014, it remains a must-see for 2015.",

When there are plenty to see when it's possible to see every outcome passes the test to be true. When we can't see past some enigmas to lose our mind at all possibilities we can think about. When we see others do more to serve them others to see the worst and we see time running out and we lose more innocent lives. When we see who to blame when they rather see other things that also don't seem to work neither. When what we can't see we get others to see for us when we can't do it alone or fast enough then others who have fresher and clearer eyes then we do. When we see the importance of getting passed our puzzles is crucial when it allows us to function normally that we see the world for what it is and not what others tell us it is. When we need to see passed what others could see to give the greatest challenge enigma a name that suits it's closest human relation puzzle, the bond between calculation & human intelligence. When something's we don't see it is revealed to us when we see we live under others creations and control to not understand it's functionality or puzzle as it is presented to us. When we can't solve puzzles that we can't see past the nonsense, bureaucracy, and many layered protocols within it. When life we see may makes us look different but in others eyes they see it as similiar to other things associated with what we don't normally see criminality. When other things we don't see we can't associate it with anything when we have no connection to what we can't calculate. When we see something's we get passed puzzles is seeing it like a competition to win and overcome. When we have see that only connection & deeper bond we have ever had was in our past that we don't see we have with anyone else that makes some calculations to problems have it's obvious answers. When we see some puzzles are hands on we can't get passed to only give up when the answer is not worth the time & energy. When others have seen enough to get passed those who have wasted time, energy and money to answer obvious problems to stop it at its tracks when some answers are hands on solution making. When we see some puzzles are meant to be solved with time to only give it to those who are not in control the control they need to get passed. When we see some puzzles are best solved with the support, time, and calculation those need to see more clearer. When we see countless problems arise in moments to not having enough time to solve them all before we continue with larger problems to only provide quick fix solutions with conventions we see without the deeper skimatics associated with it to get passed by. When others see what we don't reveal we are told with those with a keen eye in seeing passed the shallow to what's deep within. When we see what's deep within when it's surfaced and revealed to us in what we couldn't see we bury deep inside in what we don't know. When we are able to hide our knowledge and emotions deep within us when we solely relied on our human senses to get passed our dangers to calculate an exit strategy out. When what we couldn't see it is revealed to us in what others unearthed, we were to interpret and provide the connection between the unknowns to develop a calculation that we are able to see. When we see we were unable to see something's without the right formulas having all components for machines to look. When we see that what makes everything have it's distinct characteristic or properties is what components it has that makes it unique and different from all other countless possibilities. When we see what we are missing we add when we are able to resolve an enigma in what we don't see. When what we see is the absolute answer to puzzles we can't use when we need to see how others see to make them see that we are not in control and not seeing what they plan that changes the course of the war. When we see some answers we can use to solve problems we can't use when we can't let logic & ethics pass on purpose when we see we can't when lives are at cost that outweighs calculation, logic, ethics and connection when winning only matters. When what we no longer can pass we can no longer get past when winning is only on our mind that we remain in places seeing it through to the end. When what we don't see others have been seeing when what we don't see who is in control we see now when others are on-top of things. When we see that we lost when others unearth what they see. When we can't see a life with those whom we see we don't fit the mould of social convention we see what it means and is when it's dishonest to live with miscalculated answers. When others don't see such social conventions neither to only see other unsolvable conventions to live by to not accept a quick fix. When we see that we made a large contribution to the war by seeing the right time and place to use what we see to win. When we never got to see the horrors to see only the failures and success that progresses us further in what others couldn't see coming. When what we see we refuse to see when it doesn't matter when we were only willing to see such unconventional with others who would be able to solve and see our problem to only give up the thought. When what we try to continually get passed each day is what ails us when it's unnatural and incalculable to live incomplete continuously. When we see that we are not alone when what supports us propels us to see past our barriers when it is part of who we are and what we accomplished that we help pave away a future of progress no one could see coming. When we see our invention lead to another invention (the computer) which we are able to solve puzzles even faster. \n\nWhen we see our whole life and all of life is like an enigma that we try to make sense of it, we understand it and how others accept it. When others don't see our unorthodox ways we too become some sort of an enigma that others have to decipher. When we see are far less an engima then others might seem to be when we are renowned all over the world for our problem solving skills. When we don't see some problems arising that we couldn't see before when it never saw a problem to get past rather what propels us to go further. When we see that we do have a problem that we now try to pass but unable to when we see to late for what it is. When we see others in life try to get passed their problems, questions, challengers, foes, blockades, and the unknowing that we have to everyday deal with the larger puzzles then to focus on the little ones. When we see that life looking at every single puzzle that needs to be solved stops us from moving further when we don't know the answers to such questions when the time hasn't researched it further to give us a calculation to pass us right through, but instead we carry it with us and live with it. When we see living in times of progress, much is expected to know and pass us onto a new stage in our life when conventions dictate it to and we choose to not to follow willingly when we can't get pass our past that brings us back where we originally start. When social conventions has its expectations to only fit the mould and pass on by easily or have to wait for when it is ok to come out and move on. When we see we were able to get past our enemies and move forward a future and cultural phenomenon.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) We just watched another World War II flick, Greg. This one is quite educational.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Benedict Cumberbatch does a good imitation of Alan Turing. Let s recap:\n\nSCOTT: We meet young Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant mathematician, logician, and cryptologist. Turing is a socially awkward man who is fascinated with communication codes. He is applying for a position in the British military to help the Allied forces crack the coding system used by Nazi Germany. Turing is placed in charge of a small group of other brilliant minds who are assigned the task of deciphering the Nazi s  Enigma  codes.\n\nGREG: Things are not that easy for Turing. The commanding officer expects the code breakers to decipher messages in 24 hours. But the cipher codes change each day. Turing believes that he must build a machine that will determine the Enigma settings automatically. This effectively breaks the Enigma code permanently. But Turing needs help. He creates a math puzzle that is published in the British newspapers to attract mathematically inclined minds. One of the contestants turns out to be a bright young woman named Joan Clark (Keira Knightley). Turing hires her, but she isn t allowed to work with the other men - because she s a woman. So Turing surreptitiously feeds her secret documents so she can help with the code breaking. And now the race is on to crack Enigma before the Germans overtake Great Britain.\n\nSCOTT: The Imitation Game is one of the better movies of 2014. Like A Beautiful Mind and The Theory of Everything, this movie tells the story of a male genius scientist who is socially challenged and requires the help of a healthy, stable woman for his genius to be realized. Benedict Cumberbatch is terrific in this role and deserves Oscar consideration. The hero story here is constructed with care. Turing is sent into an unfamiliar world in which his vast creativity is put to the ultimate test. His abrasive honesty wins him few friends and attracts several enemies within the British military and intelligence unit. His only ally is his woman friend Joan whom we think is a love interest until Turing s homosexuality is revealed. Joan proves to be a loyal friend and mentor whose steadfast companionship, not to mention her own genius, proves essential for Turing to triumph.\n\nGREG: You re right that the story is constructed with care, Scott. Sadly, it bears little resemblance to the historical facts. Certain elements are true to life: Nazis, Germany, Britain, Enigma, Joan Clark, Turing, were all there at the same time. But the competition between Turing and the lead general, Commander Denniston, (Charles Dance) was fabricated. Turing s abrasive (borderline Aspergers) personality was exaggerated. The objections of the military to creating a machine to crack the code was a complete fiction. Apparently the truth of history wasn t enough to make a compelling story. What was true was Turing s homosexuality and his doomed relationship with Joan. This is where the tragedy of The Imitation Game hits home. After having literally saved the world from the Nazi onslaught, Turing is discovered in 1950 to be gay and is subjected to chemical castration (or face imprisonment). Turing was unable to live under those conditions and ultimately committed suicide. It wasn t until 2013 that Queen Elizabeth pardoned him. Unlike the other movies you mention, Scott, this one doesn t have such a happy ending for our hero.\n\nSCOTT: You ve pointed out the irony within the tragedy of this story. The very society that Turing saves ends up turning against him. Turing defeats the Nazis but he cannot defeat the English society that is intolerant of his sexual orientation. There aren t many hero stories in which the hero saves the people who kill him. It s truly a sad, embarrassing, and appalling treatment of a man who should have been revered.\n\nGREG: That s another of my beefs with this movie, Scott. They had to concoct a villain for Turing to fight against. So they created the  Representative  villain in the form of the Commander Denniston. He represents all the conventional thinking in the military and in British society at large. The unseen enemy is the oncoming German army. The writers also create an enemy in the form of time itself. Since the Enigma code is changed daily, the code breakers have to decipher the messages before midnight each night. So, we get a nice countdown to 12:00 every day which creates a nice sense of tension.\n\nSCOTT: Overall, The Imitation Game is two hours well spent, all the historical inaccuracies notwithstanding. Alan Turing is known as the Father of modern computer science and artificial intelligence, and this film gives us some insight into the challenges he faced in developing one of the world s first computers. Turings heroism may have done more to defeat the Nazis than that of any other single individual. This movie tells a great story and features outstanding performances from the entire cast. As a result, I m happy to award this film 4 Reels out of 5. Turing s hero story is a stirring one. The man has many demons to overcome and makes many enemies. Does his character become transformed the way a good hero should? Perhaps not. Ironically, his refusal to change may be the key to his heroism. Maybe this is a tale about a British society that refuses to transform as much as it is a tale about a hero who shouldn t need to. I give Turing s heroism 4 Heroes out of 5. Turing is surrounded by villains, including his own people whom he saves. The villains here are two institutions: (1) the Nazis with which Britain is at war, and (2) the antiquated moral codes of the English society that ultimately slay Turing. The manufactured human obstacles within the British military are throwaway characters who are caricatures or tropes of typical obstructionist characters in police and military movies. I ll be generous and give this entire diverse array of villains a rating of 3 Villains out of 5.  Movie:  Villain:  Hero: \n\nGREG: Scott, I m a computer scientist and Turing is one of my personal heroes. He laid the foundation for formal computing theory (the Turing Machine). I am thrilled that a movie that celebrates his genius was given a proper Hollywood treatment and didn t shy away from Turing s homosexuality. However, I can t reconcile the historical inaccuracies that pepper this film. It s a complete fiction that merely borrows the essence of the truth. I would normally agree with your score of 4 Reels, but I m knocking one off because I think the true story would have made an equally viable movie. I give The Imitation Game just 3 out of 5 Reels. Turing is a tragic hero in that he saves the world from the Nazi scourge, only to be destroyed by the very people he saved. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a wonderful performance and I agree that he should be nominated for an Oscar. There isn t much transformation here. There is a scene where Joan Clark lectures Turing on playing nice with his fellow mathematicians. After which Turing appears to make friends by sharing apples with his co-workers. But he overcomes obstacles that allow him to rise to the level of a true hero. I give this presentation of Turing 4 out of 5 Heroes. As you point out, the villains here are pretty generic. Nazis are a pretty safe bet as a villain in any story. And Denniston gives Turing a ripping hard time. I can t summon more than 2 out of 5 Villains for this film.  Movie: Villain:  Hero:",

            "content": "A beautiful war drama about a man who literally changed history, but no one ever knew.\n\nDuring the winter of 1952, British authorities entered the home of mathematician, cryptanalyst and war hero Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) to investigate a reported burglary. They instead ended up arresting Turing himself on charges of 'gross indecency', an accusation that would lead to his devastating conviction for the criminal offense of homosexuality - little did officials know, they were actually incriminating the pioneer of modern-day computing. Famously leading a motley group of scholars, linguists, chess champions and intelligence officers, he was credited with cracking the so-called unbreakable codes of Germany's World War II Enigma machine. An intense and haunting portrayal of a brilliant, complicated man, THE IMITATION GAME follows a genius who under nail-biting pressure helped to shorten the war and, in turn, save thousands of lives.\n\nAfter watching this film twice, it's certainly one of the gems of 2014. It's a war drama about a man who went through so much to win a war, but his life went the opposite way of what he deserved. He was a genius, a hero at heart, and history treated him wrongly. But if it weren't for him, who knows where we'd be today. Alan Turing was a bright and brilliant man, and this movie certainly recognizes that. \n\nIn my personal opinion, this is my favorite role I've seen Benedict Cumberbatch in. I've seen him in a couple other films, but I absolutely love him here. He brings so much personality and life into the character of Alan Turing, and I feel like I have a good sense of the kind of guy he was. He wasn't the perfect guy, or the nicest, but that doesn't mean he deserved what happened to him (no spoilers). Even though he's not the best guy, he's still very easy to follow and relate to. You can see his broke heart in his eyes, and just how everything sort of weighs upon him. Him, along with the rest of the cast, all performed admirably. \n\nThe dialogue was also the highlight of this film. The dialogue was quick and witty, but it never felt forced. A lot of the dialogue had so much meaning to it, and some of the best scenes didn't even have Cumberbatch in the spotlight. There are plenty of emotional and tear jerking moments in this film that absolutely get to me and as I reflect on the events afterwards, it still plagues the back of my mind.\n\nI feel like I learned so much about this story. This was arguably the biggest part of WWII, and I had never even heard about it until this film. Granted, I'm still young, but the secret about the Turing machine never surfaced for 50 years (I think). I felt as if this film gave great justice to the situation at hand. I learned what I needed to know, I cared about the characters, I was interested in the situation at hand, and this is a story that was meant to be told.\n\nI guess if there's one thing I could change about this film, the runtime felt a bit too long. At a point, I thought the movie was going to end. However, it kept continuing. Although I felt that what they showed us had a lot of meaning to it, I just think it was a clash in tone, which was misleading. Having the emotion build up and holding it in for an ending that's 30 minutes away took a bit of an unnecessary toll on me. Regardless, it was still a wonderful story.\n\nIn the end, \"The Imitation Game\" was one of the best films of 2014, and is certainly one you don't want to miss.",

From \"Saving Private Ryan\" to \"Schindler's List,\" we have watched amazing, heroic stories being told that has left us breathless throughout. \"The Imitation Game\" is one of those movies: a biopic that focuses on Great Britain's top-secret intelligence program on cracking Enigma. Enigma was a German machine was translated orders in a puzzle that could only be cracked by their operatives. With the machine reprogramming every morning at midnight, it was considered impossible to crack. In comes Alan Turning (Benedict Cumberbatch) who believes he can defeat the machine's puzzle with a machine of his own. Together with the help of Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) and his team, they work to create the machine before Germany wins the war.\n\n\"The Imitation Game,\" while an spy biopic, is also a character study on Alan Turing. While the movie works to the inevitable climax where Turing and his team complete the machine, the film also flash-forwards and back in Turing's life. The movie depicts a post-war Manchester with a detective trying to figure out what Turing did during the war while other parts show Turing's life in boarding school. By the end of the movie (after the two or three twists in the movie come full circle), you start to wonder if you can root for Turing. The movie (and Alan himself) ask the viewer to depict who Alan was: a war hero or a criminal. After seeing this film multiple times, I cannot answer the question without having arguments for both sides. I may lean one way after one viewing and the other the next time. Perhaps this is the only flaw I can find in \"The Imitation Game.\"\n\nWhere the film truly shines is in Mr. Cumberbatch's incredible performance. Nominated for an Academy Award in 2014 (which was won by Eddie Redmayne for \"The Theory of Everything\"), Mr. Cumberbatch is all-in as the arrogant genius who, according to history professionals, helped end the war 2 years earlier than anticipated. While he did not win his Oscar this time around, I doubt this will not be the last time we see him up for nomination in the coming years.\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" is a great biopic that shows us the intelligence side of World War II. While it is not full of blood and war violence that other films of the genre are overstuffed with, the film keeps you on the edge of your seats with tension that many might not see coming.\n\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Three years after being released \"The Imitation Game\" still delivers with a stellar cast and a compelling story. The movie follows the true story of Alan Turing, a cryptanalyst for the British Army and his race to beat the Nazi's encryption system, \"Enigma\", at the height of World War II. Although this venue for film has been done time and time again, this movie takes a new approach to it which keeps the movie feeling fresh. The race against the clock creates a movie full of tension and stress which is shown by the all British cast with riveting dialogue.\n\tBenedict Cumberbatch is the star of the show, playing Alan Turing. The actor's wit and talent shine through in this film and make it seem as if he was born to play this role. Whether it's highlighting Alan's awkward social life, or nailing Alan's speech impediment, Cumberbatch is spot on throughout the film. With his smarts, he's able to truly captivate you through the screen and make you feel as if you're the one who must break the encryption system. But Cumberbatch is not alone in this journey. With supporting actors, such as: Keira Knightley, Matthew William Goode, Mark Strong and Allen Leech, this team of top secret British geniuses work together and feed off each other during the film. \n\tKeira Knightley who stars as Joan Clarke, the only female on the team to break Enigma, is flawless in her role as Alan's friend and colleague. The movie stays true to the real-life friendship between Joan and Alan as they go through the process of breaking Enigma together. The scenes with Joan and Alan highlight how a socially awkward genius can and does connect with Joan throughout his life and is a true friend of his in a world that is just not accepting of the way Alan is. \n\tAlong with the actors, the plot is something to be commended as well. While director Morten Tyldum could have given the viewer every piece of the plot from the get-go, he instead holds pieces of the plot back to intrigue the viewer's mind. By using this approach, the viewer is invited to get creative with where they feel the plot is leading them. With the guidance from Tyldum's directing and the creativity of the viewer's mind, the viewer is lead down a path which ultimately reveals the heartwarming yet heart wrenching climax of the film.\n\tWhere the film succeeds with Alan's professional life, it fails in his private life. Although we see in a few instances into his private life, I wish director Morten Tyldum would have gone into more detail on Alan's background to help draw the viewer in even more and get a better picture of Alan outside of his encryption cracking life. The movie could have also gone into more detail about the team that Alan is forced to work. Besides Alan and Joan, the rest of the team seems one dimensional and the viewer is never fully drawn in emotionally to the rest of the cast. Although the movie is not without its faults, these cons are greatly downplayed by what the movie does extremely well.\n\tOverall, this is a brilliant movie with a cast that blends together well and a plot that is fresh and interesting. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role of Alan Turing and delivers every step of the way. You will be glued to the screen for the entirety of this excellent film. This is a must-see movie that will tug on your emotions like very few movies of this generation can.",

Alan Turing was found guilty of engaging in same-sex behavior, which was (regrettably, to put it euphemistically) illegal in England at the time, and to avoid imprisonment, Turing accepted a judge's verdict to inject himself with hormones as a means of self-castration. While \"The Imitation Game\" does feature a B plot in which Turing is investigated and eventually sentenced, the film largely glosses over the outcome of the trial, revealing to the audience the existence of the hormone injections and Turing's declining health with roughly six minutes left in the film. Turing's contributions to the Allies' victory in the Second World War were incontrovertibly significant, but it is only in the film's final moments that Cumberbatch reveals to a rather horrified Knightley the result of his trial and a few captions of superimposed text then detail Turing's suicide and legacy. \n\nWhen I was a child watching cartoons on TV, every once in a while during a commercial break, a commercial would air in its entirety, and right before the next one began, the last second of another commercial would slip in by accident. I imagine that the local TV networks were merely airing commercials simultaneously and that the wires got crossed somehow; what else could explain the end of a Mazda commercial being interrupted by the half-second appearance of a toll-free number for ordering Barbies? That is how I felt with the final act of \"The Imitation Game\"; a film about a misanthropic code breaker began, played, and ended, and the tail end of another far more interesting film about the horrid treatment of gay men in the mid-twentieth century managed to sneak in before the credits of the first film rolled.",

            "content": "\"The Imitation Game\" is a historical drama thriller loosely based on the life of Alan Turing and the events that helped end World War II. The film tells the story of the group of men and women who worked at Britain's code-breaking centre at Bletchley Park leading up to and during WWII.Their work was to break the \"Enigma\" code, which the Nazis were using to communicate with one another about their land, sea, and sky operations. Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) was one of an elite group of mathematicians, logicians and linguists who were hired by MI-6 to find a way to solve Nazi codes. By taking a pre-war Polish electromechanical codebreaking machine, or \"bombe,\" Turing and his team discover a way to crack the code.\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" is as good as the hype has lead you to believe. Cumberbatch turns in a very powerful performance alongside by the usually charming Kiera Knightley. Director Morten Tyldum keeps the story tight, but does embellish a lot. However, the important thing to take away from this movie is the unbelievable significance Alan Turing has made to our history. Because of him, historians believe WWII ended two years earlier than is should have, therefore saving millions of more lives. In addition, Turing was a homosexual in a time where that \"lifestyle\" was not acceptable, and despite becoming a war hero, he was still arrested for being gay. He had his genitals chemically castration so he wouldn't have to go to jail and shortly after, he committed suicide. The appreciation of the accomplishments of Alan Turing and how he had changed and continues to change the world is the most important thing to take away. \n\nThe movie was nominated in eight categories at the 87th Academy Awards, received  five nominations in the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, and was nominated in three categories at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards. It also received nine British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominations and won the People's Choice Award at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival.",

Unfortunately, the dialogue is cheesy, unnecessarily over-dramatized and over-acted. It wasn't until the very end when the machine finally worked and Alan was having to deal with the law-breaking activity of homosexuality that the theme became as powerful as it had intended. Unfortunately, that was the last 15 minutes of an otherwise boring two-hour film. While the performances weren't bad, calling anything about this film Oscar-worthy is a stretch.",

What does it even mean to think?\n\nIn our time of constantly advancing technology that has gone from the desks to our pockets, it is time to take a look at the man who started it all with his revolutionary enigma machine, as made in a time when homosexuality was a crime.\n\nThe Imitation Game for the greater portion follows the given Hollywood formula for what makes a safely-played Oscar-bait biopic, but is still otherwise as easy to follow as it is inspiring in its account of an underestimated individual who did something nobody could imagine. With a bit creativity and immense usage of logic, Alan Turing influenced the digital world as well as shorted World War II by approximately two years.\n\nRelatively new director Morten Tyldum treats this whole film like an imitation game in and of itself: mixing the continual rage of war with the running cogs in Turing's brain, with quick doses of humor peppered amongst the intelligent dialogue. The overall struggle in Britain over the second World War is surveyed by three different time periods: one of Alan Turing's educational years at Sherburne School, one of Turing's 1941 mission to build a code-breaker with his team of three men and one woman, and one in 1951, when Turing is interrogated by men who wonder if he, a homosexual, is a Soviet Spy.\n\nThe best choice that Tyldum made in directing this project was the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange, Sherlock) as the vulnerable mathematician Alan Turing. The British actor absolutely makes this film worthwhile with his heavy stutter and passionate yet subtle expression of disassociation. He is that rare recreation of a historical figure that easily wins over the audience with his obsessive mechanical vigor apparent from the contents on his desk. I honestly cannot get enough of how much of himself he pours into applying his knowledge of mathematics into something that will save lives. His character becomes all the easier to connect with when we see glances at his time as a child, where he found his first homosexual love with a boy named Christopher, who defended him from the cruel treatment of other students.\n\nOutside of Turing's own little world within his mechanical mind, the creation of warzones destroying the fabric of humanity adds to the impact. The feature is edited by Academy Award winner William Goldenberg (Argo, Zero Dark Thirty) who intersperses the feature with appropriate news reel footage of the war, and recreations of Germany's attacks on Britain, leading to children shipped out of the country on trains and innocent life after innocent life being lost with each passing second.\n\nIt would have been nice to see more of what was going on with the Germans as the war was going on, as to see both sides of the conflict, but the burden put on Turing's shoulders to encrypt their secret codes indeed feels heavy. But the one asset that best contributes to his ambition to help win the war is no other than Joan Clarke, played by Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean, Pride and Prejudice), one of the only women working for the government at the time. If it wasn't for her character to provide the moral structure of the story, then The Imitation Game would have fallen back into a clich\u00e9d snooze fest of a biopic without a hint of inspiration.\n\nIf anybody were to take a simple glance at this story, they would think that this was precisely what happened over seventy years ago. But if one were to do some research on the story of Alan Turing, then the truth would come out: not much of this story is true after all. Here is one of the numerous articles I found about this issue. I understand that creative liberties have to take place when adapting a story onto the screen, but the best stories are the stories that happen in real life to real people, and I say they are not worth altering to fit our own imaginations.\n\nThe Imitation Game is I think one of the most important stories to have come out of Hollywood in the last decade, one that tells an inspiring story that continues to influence us today. You may even be surprised to know that the government kept the Turing Machine used to encrypt German codes a secret for decades: it wasn't until just a few years ago. Therefore, I recommend this movie to anybody who can get their hands on a computer or a Blu-Ray case, as true stories like this only come around publicly once in a blue moon.",

            "content": "I had thought that if a Brit was going to win the Best Actor Oscar (R) this year it would have been Benedict Cumberbatch for his portrayal of math (or maths, as the Brits say) genius and codebreaker Alan Turing but it was not to be. Although THE IMITATION GAME plays loose with historical facts, this is a great film with some fine performances, including one from Keira Knightley, who seemed to be channeling her inner Kate Winslet.\n\nThe story of the group of men and women who worked at Britain's code-breaking centre at Bletchley Park leading up to and during WWII was protected by the Official Secrets Act up to 1974. Their work was to break the \"Enigma\" code, which the Nazis were using for their air, sea and land movements. The Poles had broken an earlier version of the code in the 1920s but, by the start of the war, the Germans had made the Enigma machines ten times more complex, allowing them close to 159 quintillion possible code combinations - that's 159 with 18 zeros after it! The Allies found themselves unable to keep up with the changes that the Nazis were making to the code every day.\n\nTuring was one of an elite group of mathematicians, logicians and linguists who were brought in by MI-6 to turn the tide. He devised improvements to a pre-war Polish electromechanical codebreaking machine (called a \"bombe\") and his machine was ultimately able to crack the code with enough speed to allow the Allies to thwart the Germans' military movements. Unfortunately, war and espionage being what they are, the Allies couldn't allow themselves to be too effective at stopping the Germans for fear that their enemy would realise that their code was finally broken and create something new to replace it. Nevertheless, the work of Turing and his colleagues was credited with not only reducing the length of the war by between two and four years, it also resulted in a successful outcome for the Allies - something that was not assured when they began their work.\n\nTHE IMITATION GAME is more than a film about breaking a seemingly unbreakable code in the nick of time thus saving the world. It's about a man who was different; who felt like he didn't belong. Like the machine he was trying to break, Turing was quite the enigma himself. \"Brilliant\", \"driven\", \"socially awkward\", \"infuriating\", and \"condescending\" are just some of the words that can be used to describe him. \"Homosexual\" was another, and it was that characteristic that did him in. Back then, being gay was a crime. Thanks to a determined police constable who was investigating a simple break in at Turing's Manchester home in 1952, his secret was ultimately revealed. Rather than going to jail, Turing agreed to chemical castration - injections of estrogen to reduce his libido. A few years later, at age 41, Turing died of cyanide poisoning. It was thought that he may have taken his own life although that determination is still in doubt. He may have inhaled the poison in the course of his work.\n\nThe film flashes back to Turing's middle school days where both his genius and sexuality are blossoming. Back in Bletchley's Hut 8, Turing calls his bombe \"Christopher\" - the name of his best friend and, apparently, \"first love\" at Sherborne School. Though nothing sexual between the two young boys is shown to us, it is clear by his love for his machine that he did have deep feelings for his friend.\n\nThe adult Turing finds friendship and understanding in Joan Clarke (Knightley), whom he hires for the team after she completes his entrance test in record time. The two quickly realise that they are both outsiders. Cryptography is not woman's work (at least it wasn't back then), so Turing and Clarke devise a way that she can still be part of the team but maintain the appearance that she is doing something that is acceptable to society. Turing offers to marry Clarke to make them both \"honest\" but ultimately must take it back. Clarke, though, is more than just a beautiful mind. She understands how the world works far more clearly than Turing does. What she wants - equality and challenge - far outweighs being in a sham marriage.\n\nThe film itself follows a fairly conventional route offering no surprises, twists or turns along the way. Perhaps to maintain its PG-13 rating (Category IIA in Hong Kong), any love scenes - homo or hetero - are absent as well. This is somewhat disappointing as we're left wondering what, if anything, Turing did with his schoolmate, and who broke into his house and why. Cumberbatch's performance, however, is top-notch as the man who was as tough to crack as the code he was trying to break. It is very sad that once Turing's secrets were laid bare for the world to see, it cost him his life.",

Yet powerful performances and a worthy story still provide something entertaining to watch, with Benedict Cumberpatch delivering all that he hides in his sleeves for a thoroughly resonant picture. I still believe the film has the potential for better drama.\n\nThe Imitation Game was once included in The Black List, with its adapted screenplay lauded by many. I personally think its okay, since tge plot it features actually derives from real events, with some little extra bits added for drama which I think are sometimes odd and forced, probably serving the purpose of giving its actors more chances to display their skills. To name a few of these elements, the move of portrating Alan Turing as a anti-social, nerdy recluse and giving him a team of normal people that are meant to dislike and then like him, is not faithful to history while not being special as a plot element, weakening the plot. At one point after the team 'rekt' Enigma and proceeded with the fact that their success should not be disclosed, the script goes to say that one of the members realized the convoy his family was located world soon be raided, as he started begging for the others to disclose their work so as to save his loved ones. I know all these elements did allow the film's cast to shine, but they certainly didn't contribute plot-wisely.\n\nBut it all boils down to the fabulous acting of Benedict Cumberpatch and Keira Knightley at the end. Some critics said that Benedict Cumberpatch is the best actors of his generation. His skills are very much portrayed in a character with so much complexity and emotions. His thought often conflicted and abstruse, peerless in terms of academic prowess yet vulnerable as a person. Cumberpatch combined the benefits of his character to engender a memorable performance. Besides, the film also did a great job in publicizing Turing's homosexuality, a firm and glistering call out for LBGT rights. Such fact has been praised by lots of authorities, and I do think it's a good thing, though I do believe people shouldn't take such things seriously in movies. Lead actress's acceptance that her partner was gay is nice.\n\nI'd opine that the movie could be made better if the film emulates Schindler's List, that is to put more emphasis on the greatness and legacy of Alan Turing's work instead of just a few closing captions on the screen. The film could also cut off a few of those minor scenes like the tussle between Turing and his colleagues, and also reminiscences between Turing and Christopher which I think is trivial and unconvincing, so the pace can be faster while leaving more run time for the depiction of war just like what Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan did(but yea I know Steven Spielberg is unique), a more realistic and accurate depiction of the real event that took place in WWII. And so the film's not the best, and the max. rating's gonna be 7. I'll keep it as that.",

What he accomplished during WWII and beyond just before his death will forever be remembered, and The Imitation Game gives us a moving tribute to a brief period of his life that mattered most.  Even with some stellar acting from our lead Benedict Cumberbatch and quite the proper supporting cast, why do I feel like the climax never quite reached the top of the crest before coming back down the other side?\n\nI get that Turing was a tinkerer, but throughout the film, instead of feeling connected with a character's mind to see at least try and understand what's going on, the movie instead keeps the viewer at arms length, much like the rest of his team until the machine magically gets completed at the end of the second act.  Sure we get the machine cost 100,000 pounds and that it works on electricity from being unplugged or switched off and on countless times, but at least give the audience the benefit of the doubt to try and understand how it works with some more depth.\n\nThat aside, Cumberbatch and company put in excellent performances from beginning to end.  Keira Knightley and him shine together on screen with each other's nuances worn on their sleeves.  The importance of the film is doubled with the inclusions of Mark Strong and Charles Dance in brief, but crucial scenes they act the hell out of over the two hours.\n\nImmediately, my mind went to comparing this movie to A Beautiful Mind.  While that ended up being more of a love story and look into mental illness, The Imitation Game sticks to more of an espionage theme.  Perhaps that's why I still consider the former better than the latter here, but overall, whenever the silver screen gives us a chance to peek into great minds like these, I'm more than happy to sit back and be amazed.",

So it was a bit of a shock to find that Alan's character, who was described by reviewers as someone who couldn't get along with people,  was courteous and didn't throw wrenches at people like the athletic one did.  When the girl verbally abused him, too, with no provocation, as well as the time she was kind to the one who threw a wrench at him and told him he needed to get along with people, I felt the reviewer had it backward and that the film brought to light a problem we still have in the world: that of putting the responsibility of the bullying on the victim.

It's a well made character piece with a powerhouse lead brilliantly capturing how this man helped crack an enigma. Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a mathematician who was employed by Major General Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong) and Commander Alastair Denniston (Charles Dance) to work at the top secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, to help crack the German Enigma code that could help them win the war. Turing has come up with a blueprint for a machine that could break the code, but despite scorn and opposition from fellow code-breakers Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) and Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode), Turing is determined to succeed, but he has a dark, illegal secret that will be his downfall. Benedict Cumberbatch really excels at playing Turing, a man who was notoriously impossible to get along with and always kept to himself, but knew what he was doing when it came to solving the impossible. It's backed by a good cast, and while it does go back and forth across Turing's life a bit rapidly, it's a well made film.",

It's at odds with the idea of films being allowed to wander. That's because it's manufactured to achieve its effect; which duplicitous lay it does well. It tells the story of Alan Turing who essentially won WWII by cracking the nazis in breakable code by essentially inventing computers. It features both a framing device and flashbacks so we have stories at 3 different levels. Cumberbatch is of course very good in the lead role but it's in how wheelhouse - irascible genius. Turing joins the mission out of a want to play games and solve problems much to the chagrin of everyone around him. As he develops his computer he battles the odds of disbelievers who he wins over, inevitably. It rises above because the Turing story is amazing and should be told more and is heartbreaking in its finale. Turing was likely autistic to some degree and also was a homosexual which was illegal in England. We also see all the ugliness of war in the MI-6 lying to the people, the government, the Germans, and allowing leaks to the Russians. War is ugly and unfortunate for all involved. The travesty is of course being a homosexual cost Turing his life despite everything he did for his country and the world. The direction doesn't do anything you don't expect it to do, and the story contains no real surprises. The supporting cast is uniformly strong, led by a delightful Knightley. It's worth a watch, but it can't rise above being a Weinstein Oscar-bait true story period piece featuring a sad story f someone overcoming odds.",

The supporting cast also did a bang-up job; almost everyone gets their moment in the spotlight, really really good all around. loved Charles Dance, wanna see more stuff with him.\n\nThe film also did a really good job jumping between the war and after the war; the cinematography kind of focused these switches. during the war was pretty colorful and more even and then after had a more cold British look that really made Turing's loneliness and sadness come to light. I also wasn't really expecting the focus on how his homosexuality affected everything - which i felt was an interesting turn; his isolation became more about that than his intelligence and it was even more of an antagonist than Germany in regards to the plot. real interesting stuff.\n\nI loved the film; i think it told the story of Turing cracking the Enigma machine really well and delved further into his story than I thought it would. definitely worth checking out. you'll go for the big screen, but the huge sound design once Turing's machine gets going is what'll make seeing it in the theater worth it.",

            "content": "I have a lot of respect for Alan Turing. Not only was he exceedingly talented, but he also had a hard time in middle school. This movie shows his journey through breaking the Nazi Enigma code, and the ramifications thereof.\n\nYou go in to this movie expecting the cracking of the code to be the dramatic conclusion. While it is a stunning and satisfying moment, it comes at about the halfway point of the movie. The rest of the film explores the moral and political ramifications of that breakthrough. It takes the movie in a different direction, but the focus on Alan Turing's character never changes, grounding the story.\n\nSpeaking of Turing, Benedict Cumberbatch plays him to perfection. The personality ticks, the arrogance, the brilliantly logical mind, he does it all. Bravo. The rest of the cast also does exceedingly well (as true British actors should). Keira Knightly gives a pleasantly good performance, as does Matthew Goode. Mark Strong is always a welcome sight, as is Charles Dance.\n\nI do have a problem with the non-linear nature of the story. While the bulk of the film takes place in 1941, we keep seeing flashbacks to Turing's childhood and flashforwards to post-war Britain. I understand why they did it, I'm just generally unhappy when films do this. Every film isn't X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\nIt is a very good film about a truly interesting man. It contains history, politics, some math and cryptography, and a whole lot of heart.",

This is a fairly mainstream treatment of  a pretty exceptional story. The direction is strong without being flashy or bravura. The screenplay is fabulously written, but aside from a very-well-handled non-chronological approach, it's not particularly innovative.\n\nTurns out it's all about the characters and the stakes. \n\nAlan Turing was a genius and a hero (although I doubt he'd accept the second compliment). On the basis of this film he was probably autistic, certainly difficult and painfully vulnerable. Benedict Cumberbatch is tremendous, portraying him utterly fearlessly and with massive emotional depth that had me weeping more than once. The supporting characters are universally terrific, from Mark Strong as the manipulative MI6 boss to Rory Kinnear as the copper who uncovers more than he'd bargained for.\n\nThe work done by Turing (and many, many others) at Bletchley Park saved (probably) millions of lives. It ushered in the future of computing and artificial intelligence that is at the heart of everything we know today. It is vitally, vitally important. And it came at a price, the 'blood-soaked calculus' that required his greatest achievement to be kept completely secret for decades. But his personal stakes in this story go way beyond that, as his homosexuality kept him even more isolated, and his despicable treatment by the UK authorities (under the laws of the time) is heartbreaking.\n\nThis is a tremendously good film, and tells a truly human, important story.",

            "content": "In my review of The Great Gatsby, I said that director Baz Luhrmann \"has always been more interested in drawing comparisons between different themes and cultures than he has ever been in historical fidelity.\" Luhrmann often went out of his way to suggest parallels between our world and the Roaring Twenties, whether in his contemporary soundtrack choices or the speeds at which Gatsby's car could travel.\n\nWe approach a similar dilemma with The Imitation Game. It differs from Luhrmann's film due to its basis in historical characters, and if viewed narrowly as a biopic, it definitely has some issues. But if we look beyond the familiar beats of Oscar-bait films, seeing this as less of a portrait than a lens through which to view something else, the film gracefully and poignantly vaults over all its hurdles and emerges as one of the very best of the year.\n\nThe Imitation Game certainly does raise the question of whether historical accuracy should come before dramatic tension. There are clearly many examples in Hollywood where embellishment for the sake of dramatic effect has gone too far, often for no good reason except to make America look good - think of U-571 or Pearl Harbour in recent memory. And it's not just Hollywood that falls into this trap; as much as I praised The Impossible, I still had reservations about the way it potentially marginalised the indigenous victims of the Boxing Day tsunami.\n\nIf The Imitation Game had proclaimed itself to be a documentary or a docudrama, then many of the criticisms made about its accuracy would carry more weight. Speaking purely as an historian, it is frustrating that Joan Clarke's means of joining the team is made more fantastical, or that Alan Turing's machine wasn't called Christopher, or that Commander Denniston becomes more of a villain than his relatives claim. But to obsess over these details to the point of rejecting the film entirely is to misunderstand the true intentions of the filmmakers.\n\nScreenwriter Graham Moore, who won an Oscar for his efforts, said repeatedly in interviews that he wanted to \"honour\" Turing's work and memory. The criticisms that the film glosses over the character's homosexuality are very misleading: drawing attention to his sexuality over and above anything else would be much more of an insult than completely ignoring it. But more than that, these and similar criticisms miss what Moore and director Morten Tyldum were trying to do: rather than faithfully reprint every part of Turing's life, they wanted to use his work as a springboard into complex themes and ideas.\n\nAn equally helpful, if unusual, point of comparison would be with Apocalypse Now. I said in my now-antiquated review that, from a coldly rational standpoint, there are many aspects of Francis Ford Coppola's epic which are problematic; it's overly long, over-indulgent, Marlon Brando is poorly directed, a lot of the characters aren't properly developed, and it contains one scene of actual animal cruelty. But in spite of all these things, the film is a masterpiece because it explains the horrors of the Vietnam War in a profound and powerfully visceral manner.\n\nWhat The Imitation Game does so brilliantly is to take Turing's extraordinary achievements and use them as a foundation for a compelling and ultimately tragic examination of secrecy. The title refers not only to Turing's famous test around artificial intelligence, but also to the lies which those working at Bletchley Park are forced to live in order to do their work and save people's lives. The film is a great examination of the ethical problems of lying to protect people, and how secrecy and denial can eat away and destroy a person's very self.\n\nPerhaps the best scene in the entire film comes immediately after the team have cracked Enigma. After the cheers and tears have subsided, it suddenly dawns on the group that they cannot share their discovery with the outside world; if the Germans find out they have broken the code, they will adopt a new code and all the codebreakers' efforts will have been in vain. In order to protect their discovery, they have to withhold information and still let some ships be sunk. In a split second abstract mathematics becomes the reality of human lives, and we are shattered just as much as the characters.\n\nThis scene also illuminates the skill of Moore and Tyldum as filmmakers. In a more overtly Hollywood effort, the film would have climaxed with Turing's Eureka moment, before flashing forward to the end of the war and everyone going home. But like A Beautiful Mind before it, The Imitation Game tempers its triumphs with the frailty of human emotion. It adds conditions and consequences to the brilliant achievements of Turing and his team, and it has the confidence (unlike Ron Howard's film) to end on a deeply bittersweet note.\n\nSecrecy and deception follow Turing throughout his life. His relationship with Christopher becomes so strong because he doesn't have to pretend to be anyone else when they are together. Christopher's death gives birth to the adult Turing, who is constantly having to pretend to be someone else, covering up not just his sexuality but his innermost feelings, and projecting an image of distance or aloofness. Turing never celebrates his contribution to the war effort because his triumph is balanced by his inner conflict, and his advances in computing could be interpreted as him atoning for his own flaws. In trying to make machines think, and think faster than humans, he is subtly showing his hand about his own feelings of inadequacy.\n\nFor all the skill of Moore's script, precious little of this nuance would have come out without Benedict Cumberbatch. From the first second you see him, you instantly accept him as Turing; the physical resemblance is palpable, and there is an intriguing sadness in his eyes which demands your attention. He inhabits Turing, shrinking into his every pecular foible and tic, and lacking any of the self-consciously showy nature of many 'awards worthy' performances. It solidifies his reputation (as if such a thing were necessary) as one of the most consistently arresting actors of our age.\n\nOne of the other pleasant surprises about The Imitation Game is its playful side. When Turing states bluntly to Joan Clarke what they are going to be doing, Clarke pauses and then simply says: \"Oh.\" Many similar period dramas would have overegged the British stiff upper lip, reducing all the intrigue and high stakes to a mere comedy of manners. But this film has fun with the more rigid social mores of the 1940s, and Keira Knightley does a very good job with the scenes she is given.\n\nOn top of all that, The Imitation Game looks glorious. Tyldum proved in Headhunters that he can utilise shadows and composition to create tension, and here he directs with a steady and thoughtful hand, allowing things to unfold at a pace which is neither rushed nor ponderous. He is ably assisted by cinematographer \u00d3scar Faura, who shot The Impossible alongside genre hits like The Orphanage and Julia's Eyes. The period details are immaculately captured, particularly the dark greens and browns of Bletchley Park and the stiff, starchy white of the men's shirts. As before, it never goes overboard with the period detail, but everything still looks and feels as it should.\n\nThe Imitation Game is a striking and stunning film which uses Alan Turing's achievements as a starting point for a detailed and heartbreaking examination of secrecy, ethics and human nature. For all the arguments about the film's resemblance to the real-life story, Tyldum's creative decisions pay off in spades, resulting in a beautifully mounted, well-told drama which is at turns distressing, thought-provoking and heartbreaking. It remains one of the best films of 2014, as well as an essential and compelling piece of cinema.",

Certainly the tale of genius Alan Turing and his invention of an early computer to crack the Nazis Enigma code has enough exciting elements to make a suspense film.  Add in the fact that Turing was gay and thus had secrets of his own to hide from a society and government that treated this fact as criminal and the tension would easily be increased (and a socio-political statement could be made).  So, what then, has happened to create this very middling film, full of heavy handed moments orchestrated by strings? Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly are fine enough (although not exciting), so it is likely the script and the direction that are to blame.  Or the Weinsteins, tossing out Oscar bait for the bourgeois Academy voters and the masses they represent. If only it wasn't all a bit boring.  We needed Lynne Ramsey or Ken Loach or even Stephen Frears (if we're staying mainstream), but we got Morten Tyldum (unknown to me).",

However, in the hands of director Morten Tyldum it has,This true story of the breaking of the enigma code, which effectively ended World War 2, could so easily have turned out to be one of those overly clich\u00e9d and conventional bio-pics. However, in the hands of director Morten Tyldum it has, surprisingly, become so much more. Starting with a smart and dense screenplay, which hones in on three different periods of time in the life of code breaker Alan Turing, the story is utterly compelling. Wisely, it has also been told in a straightforward and un complicated manner and after about 10 minutes one gets a dizzying sense that the film is going to be an absolute gem, a feeling that reaches fulfilment 2 hours later as the credits roll.\rThe recreation of time and place has been lovingly captured via excellent production design. In fact, the film is rich in detail. There are breathtaking vistas of war torn Britain which includes shots of bombers wreaking devastation over London and submarines firing rockets, as well as more ordinary depictions of rubble strewn streets and houses. It is also good to see the appropriate use of historic Bletchley Park as a backdrop to where all these events actually unfolded over 70 years ago. The editing seamlessly takes us from year to year without confusion or jarring transitions and the scenes leading up to, and immediately following, the breaking of the code are just thrilling. The music is another plus and whilst not particularly melodic it underscores what is happening on screen brilliantly.\rCriticism has been levelled at the film for not focusing more on Turing\u2019s sexuality which is as untrue as it is unfair. Beyond seeing him actually bonking we have more than enough information as to the effect his sexuality had on his life and, ultimately his death. Scenes of his childhood also give insight into the man he would become. End titles, unlike the recent \u2018Foxcatcher\u2019 are also helpful and informative.\rUltimately, the film belongs to its powerful cast. Benedict Cumberbatch is a revelation and he brings real humanity to the tortured Turing. Some of his moments, particularly near the end, are almost unbearably moving.  Keira Knightley is almost his equal in a smaller but crucial role. She has real power here as Turing\u2019s one time fianc\u00e9, the lone woman breaker who as it turns out is better than the men. Supporting actors Charles Dance, Rory Kinnear and Mark Strong all contribute characters that are more than mere ciphers. Also, it is to the credit of the boy playing Turing as a young man that we believe in the subsequent actions and performance of Cumberbatch.\rRarely is a film as all encompassing and engrossing as this one. It is a triumph on every level and a cinematic treat.",

You even get to see flashbacks from Turing childhood and find out how he becomes the man or should I say hero of his time and even the today's modern era.\r Now about the characters in this film, Benedict Cumberbatch does an amazing job as Alan Turing, and what about Turing himself well all I'll say is that he is such a smart, to the point, and sees the world in a completely different way, that's what makes him so interesting, however the other characters in this film aren't really that interesting.\r So if your a fan of history or a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch or just enjoy great films, than The Imitation Game is just for you.",

Benedict Cumberbatch turns in a great performance as Turing, an egotistical anti-social professor and closet homosexual, which in Britain at that time could result in prison.\rWhile historical purists chafe at the nit picking details, it's still a very compelling, intelligent movie that grips you from the start and brings the accomplishments of Turing's work into fresh focus.    He tragically died of what is considered suicide by cyanide, although some think it could have been an accident during one of his experiments when he inhaled cyanide fumes while working on a project.\rHe was found guilty of homosexual behavior and ordered to undergo inhumane drug therapy that was designed to basically destroy his sex drive and chemically castrate him.\rIn death though Turing was finally accorded the hero's acclaim he deserved, and today is considered one of the first great pioneers of the modern computer.\r\"The Imitation Game\" is a brilliant film, and a great relief from the load of hit movies out there right now.",

She's not flashy or extravagance in this role, instead she is deceptively bland, but has a more approachable and kind nature. Her demeanor is calming, also effective in bringing a pinch of innocence on time of war. The charming accent doesn't hurt either.\r Script are well done, dialogues fit the characters in less complicated way. It helps significantly since the theme is already a complex one, yet the underlying message is resoundingly clear, it need not to be deciphered.

Throughout Cumberbatch shows true passion for playing this character causing much emotion when necessary but some comedic elements as well. From time to time you feel for Turing as he makes his attempts to crack Enigma. Not only does Cumberbatch provide emotion but the other cast members are at the same level. Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightley) the female member of the group is as allows you to see such a strong bond developing between the two of them making them a great pair when they are on-screen together. The bond also extends to the other mathematicians like Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) and John Cairncross (Allen Leech) which incites a sort of family between them expressing not only the darker moments but some of the comedic elements from time to time.\r The story itself was incredible and kept me interested and engaged throughout. The film does put the emphasis on the Enigma code causing an awareness of how important the code really is. This emphasis does impact the story greatly in a positive way. During the film there are some extremely emotive scenes that envelope the audience die to the horrors of war and the importance of Enigma. The pacing was well done allowing time for not only the codebreaking itself but allow development of the characters and to see the changes of their understanding to not only Turing but to the code Enigma itself. There is a small part I did trip up on and did not understand however upon re-watching the film and investigating further it had become clearer. The most shocking part I found was the ending which makes me feel sad but more knowledgeable at the same time knowing what had happened within World War II and the factor that Turing played in.\r In all the Imitation game was an excellent film depicting the behind the scenes of the spy network. It was great to see such emphasis being placed on the codebreaking rather than action which most spy films are affiliated with. The story of the code breaking is enhanced even further through all the actors. They all put on stellar performances exerting emotion throughout which furthers the importance of gaining the knowledge of the Germans. The Imitation game is a brilliant film and must be seen at any costs. It is worth your money and time.",

The story is basically divided into three parts - life during young age, carrying out mission and after the end of war, in which the life of Alan Turing, who holds a strong belief of atheism, is beautifully crafted thanks to the great scores from Alexandre Desplat even though there are moments of jumping around from year-to-year in narrating. The powerful performance from Benedict Cumberbatch alone in portraying the awkwardness, triumphant, arrogant, strangeness, both physical and mental struggling of this notorious protagonist and at the same time well supported by great delivery from the supporting cast have elevated this epic material entirely.

Known for his expertise as a mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and philosopher, he was a pioneering computer scientist who created the template for what would become the computers we use today. However, his accomplishments were never publicly known due to his criminal prosecution for being a homosexual.\rBenedict Cumberbatch stars as Turing, and along with his team of code-breakers, were responsible for cracking Nazi Germany's Enigma code. This is particularly important as this was the Nazi's primary code for communicating with its forces around the world. Many of the worlds brightest minds had tried and failed to find the solution to the complex code, but it was this group of minds at Britains top-secret overnment Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (Charles Dance), a head strong military man with his suspicions about Turing, and MI6's Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong), who has a keen interest in the results of the groups work.\rAfter several unsuccessful tries at breaking the code, Turing began his work to develop a machine that could find a way to break the code on its own. Turing took his thoughts directly to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and was given ultimate power over the project. Assembling a team which consisted of scholars, mathematicians, linguists, a chess champion, the team continued to search for an answer to the riddle while Turing began his work on the machine. Turing, being a socially awkward person, found it difficult to work in a group setting and alienated himself from his coworkers. The caring voice of Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), a brilliant mathematician who would aid Turing into winning the trust of his team, would become his most trusted confidant. The clock was ticking on the group to crack the code as the war began to reach a breaking point for the allies. The pressure to achieve his life's goal was beginning to take hold.\rWe experience the troubled childhood of the young genius as his deals with the loss of his most cherished love, we endure the journey of the genius responsible for the end of the war, and we suffer through the the tragedy of his post-war decline following his conviction for gross indecency, but we are rewarded with the story of a brave, tortured soul who became a national treasure. The performance of Benedict Cumberbatch is one to cherish. The portrayal of such a frail human spirit who defied the odds and shaped the history of the world is inspiring and Oscar worthy. Keira Knightley is strong, charming and a perfect compliment to Cumberbatch. Each scene between the two was magical. Matthew Goode is tremendous as Turing's reluctant ally. Goode engaged his characters spirit head on and challenged Cumberbatch's Turing as a chess champion would. Each member of the remaining cast, including the wonderful Mark Strong, was sensational with each providing a wonderful compliment to the telling of the story.\rOverall, The Imitation Game is an absolute treasure and should no doubt hear its name called at nomination time this year. A captivating story of loss and tragedy, but also one of triumphant victory which will no doubt engulf you in your thoughts of how sexual persecution has crippled our society for too long. Alan Turing deserved better, thankfully he has finally gotten his due.",

Though it covers many serious subjects there are quite a few laugh out loud lines and scenes spring from the natural aspects of the characters.\r For those who never heard of Alan Turing he was an English mathematical genius who broke the German Enigma code and is said to be responsible for WW2 ending 2-4 years earlier than it would have. He also was arrested for being a homosexual in 1951 and was given the choice of prison or chemical castration. He was to eventually commit suicide though his mother contends that it was an accident.\r Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing shows the man\u2019s brilliance while at the same time shows that he wasn\u2019t comfortable around people and offering all around him humor by his lack of social understanding. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke the only female member of the group who worked on the Enigma code and accepts Turing proposal of marriage.

This movie actually inspires you to make something great or do something great like Alan Turing. The Imitation Game is one of the best movies of the year, and my favorite biography movies of all time. Watch this movie,  its worth it, trust me. 10/10.",

Along with this gripping story the film also has the intense conflict of the codebreaking, is well acted, and well shot. I would highly recommend this film to everyone especially anyone who felt like the black sheep growing up. Don\u2019t be surprised if you find yourself on the screen and bring some tissues if you are emotional its not a happy story and if you are sensitive you will probably shed a tear.

He may even have saved the life of my own beloved grandfather who worked in the Brooklyn (New York) Navel Yard all throughout World War 2! A military target that would have eventually been within reach of German submarines.\r If it wasn\u2019t for Alan Turing\u2019s genius, integrity and perseverance all of history would have been changed for the worse. Another minor footnote: He\u2019s also the father of the modern computer and one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived.\r Despite being one of the giants of the 20th century, few people outside those with a passion for history or computing have ever heard of the man until now. No universities or streets are named after him. No statues or portrait honor him anywhere in the world all because he is gay. In fact, it took the Queen of England to the year 2013 to issue him a pardon for having consensual sex - in the privacy of his home - with another man! In 2013! That\u2019s an abomination. The Queen of England is sitting on her throne in one piece because of this man! She should have laid a wreath on his grave decades ago!\r I\u2019m not ashamed to admit it, but I sobbed at the end of this movie! This is a most profound story about love!  YES! LOVE! Intense, passionate love is not limited to just heterosexuals!\r It\u2019s also a story about sex. I was born in the 1960\u2019s and consensual sex - in the privacy of one\u2019s home - between men was legal in the State I was living in when I turned 18. But the stigma of being a sexual minority remains in way too many places \u2013 and affects me greatly in my own personal life to this very day. The pain I \u2013 and others \u2013 have suffered for being \u201cdifferent\u201d is indescribable. This story validates my experiences and the experiences of millions of other sexual minorities \u2013 from around the world - both living and deceased.\r The cruelty Alan Turing experienced from his classmate is similar to what I had to endure in high school. But I was lucky; I never had to worry about having consensual sex with another man in the privacy of my own home. But in Alan Turing\u2019s case you get to see a good man who gave so incredibly much to the world be ripped apart by pure evil that was 100% legal back in the 1950\u2019s! It\u2019s so ironic too! Watch closely. The police officer breaks the law and he is the one who should be legitimately imprisoned! It\u2019s not just in the United States that police officers feel they are above the law they supposedly serve!\r Memo to Hollywood: This shows you know how to make great movies. Sure, you won\u2019t make billions every time, but you\u2019re gonna make a tidy profit by doing a spectacular job. Wouldn\u2019t you rather make a film people will be watching 500 years from now on another planet in another solar system then making trash, like The Hobbit trilogy, that no will care about once it leaves the theaters?\r One more point to ponder: Michelangelo is considered by most people to be the greatest sculptor who ever lived. He was a gay man and he lived centuries ago - in peace - till he reached 88 (Yes 8-8). Now fast-forward to the 1950\u2019s - in what was supposedly the country that birthed modern democracy - and look what the British did to one of the greatest mathematicians that ever lived only because he is gay!",

The core of the movie is the cracking of Enigma with some flash back to Turing youth and flash forward to Turing last year (actually, the movie starts in the 50s and then jumps back to the war years \u2013 a completely useless editing idea).\r Altogether not a bad story and certainly a great Cumberbatch and Knightley interpretation. The supporting actors are also good and there is some moment of British humor to lighten the atmosphere.  The only thing I find objectionable is that the movie gives the idea that Turing was the only one who actually cracked the code. The solitary genius who did it all on his own and even against his own team  - with the exception of the Knightley character.\r All this to put Turing on an even higher pedestal and to underline that he was such as genius AND gay.

It surpassed my expectations and it\u2019s both ingenious as it is clever. As Alan Turing said in the movie: \u201cAre you paying attention? Good. If you\u2019re not listening carefully, you will miss things\u201d. That quote is the one thing that kept me entertained, because you really need to pay attention if you want to perceive everything. The structure is very nonlinear, and you must pay attention!\r The first half of the movie is more of the main mission, to crack the code. The rest is much more versatile and exiting. The action-sequences are especially great. Benedict Cumberbatch is really good; it might be one of his greatest performances to date. His character; Alan Turning is extremely well presented, and I really felt close to him during the whole movie.

Kiera Knightley is okay as Turig\u2019s genius, old-maid colleague, but her character is rather boring.

Computer graphics were not realistic either: torpedoes, bombings, etc. That put aside, the movie is just great. What a story! Maybe even too much for one movie. It's about one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20-th century, Alan Turing, who built the first computer to break the  German cipher machine \"Enigma\" code, considered absolutely invulnerable, against all odds. And the horrible way  Great Britain treated him, same as it treated all other homosexuals at that time. A Russian spy line is very interesting in itself. I admired both leads performance.

This tells some people That Alan Turning must have had some kind of autism, yet was brilliant, if only people had been more tolerant (as some are in the movie). I thought the movie was well-written in trying to explain how they were trying to crack the enigma, but I didn't feel it necessary to take such dramatic license when it distorts facts, like the Russian spy situation which Alan was not involved in, and other such distortions (Alan's team did not make the life and death decisions once cracking the code, others did). But Alan's story was interesting, the story was told in an entertaining manner as well as educational (which makes the distortions jarring), good acting, then ultimately sad because Alan was misunderstood in his time. What a difference today on understanding people that are different, whether being deficient in social graces or preferring one's gender, and poor Alan had both.

Additionally i believe the film could have been more focused on the enigma problem, as Turings backstory, while necessary to complete the documentation of his life, drags on slightly. The film is at its best regarding the solving of the Enigma problem, which thankfully  a proportionally large amount of the film is devoted too.

The film is a little bit by the numbers like any biopic is but in this case it all fits wonderfully and the dialogues are very clever, and by the end, the importance of the story being told grabs you and does not let you go.

I am looking forward to the next season of Sherlock.\r I also enjoyed the acting and roles played by Mark Strong and Charles Dance.  I first came across Dance in The Jewel in the Crown and thought he would go far but alas such was not the case.. As to Mark Strong, what can you say? He is one of the best actors around.\r The only let down related to Keira Knightley - her over the top accent and that ugly, repulsive hair colour.  Why on earth did they give her that shade of hair colour for the movie?  It was distracting to me.\r This movie is great. By all means see it. You will not be let down.",

Cumberbatch may have easily won an Oscar this year if it wasn't the close race that it was. Alan Turing is one of the most important men to ever walk the Earth but really before this film most people would have been unaware of his achievements. Cumberbatch does an incredible job of portraying such a complex and genius character and he develops beautifully throughout the movie. Keira Knightley also has one of the best female performances of 2014 with this role. The Imitation Game is a film that can be enjoyed by any adult and it will have to spread knowledge about Alan Turing's genius.",

The critics think they should like this type of film so tend to give it too much praise which is why they should not be followed.  They sell themselves and unworthy films and short change their constituency:  The Audience!  Cumberbatch is a good actor but not a star.\rThe movie is competently made but by the numbers formula and could have been done by any of hundreds of directors for hire in the industry, and yet the Academy nominates this guy over Clint Eastwood whose film is so much more original, artful and emotional.  That's probably because they're mostly all left leaning sheep that always go for this kind of subject matter and don't like that Clint spoke out against Obama.  Whatever.  This is the key:  when you walk out of a movie and swear you were in there for over two and a half hours and then look at your watch and it really was only two hours, well that's not a good thing despite a very compelling subject and true story about the birth of the computer.",
