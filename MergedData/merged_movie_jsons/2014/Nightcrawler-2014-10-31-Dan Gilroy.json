            "content": "Jake Gyllenhaal is the nightcrawler. A nightcrawler is a worm. Bloom, the character played here, is a sociopath. His ambitions and fixations far outweigh common morality. Let's face it, his cohorts in the business aren't much better than he is, but they have a kind of code, and they don't participate in enhancing the crime. When Bloom moves an accident victim for the first time in order to get a better shot, he crosses the line and stays on the other side. He is willing to do anything to get his way and he is a master at monotonous monologue when he is confronted. It's as if he is reading from a book. I heard an interview recently with Gyllenhaal and he recited some of this stuff from memory with almost no emotion. This is a terrific performance by one of our really good actors. The way he is able to slide into every situation unscathed and maintain that sardonic grin is really nonpareil. This is about the voyeurism of the audience which demands this hateful kind of portrayal.",

            "content": "Once Jake Gyllenhaal signed on to do Nightcrawler I knew it would be a special film. The man has been producing nothing but gold lately and this is no different. Nightcrawler is an experience - it takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of seemingly charming slimeball reporter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). Nightcrawler works on so many levels. The writing and direction is fantastic, which is especially impressive as it's the directorial debut by Dan Gilroy who takes on both duties. He had a clear vision of how he wanted to portray LA and the sleek, brooding yet slightly lackadaisical tone transfers perfectly onto the big screen. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance that's the polar opposite from his character in Prisoners and he was on point for every second. He was the perfect casting choice to carry the movie.The movie has a clear message on the media and how they abuse stories and reap the benefits regardless of who gets victimized. It's a message that has been told a million times before, but never quite like this. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou, who starts freelancing as a videographer of crime scenes and selling his footage to a news channel for money. We go along this journey with Lou and watch his transformation from being a sleazy but ambitious individual to becoming a manipulative, self-serving sociopath. Then you start to realize that he was like that all along. His charming charisma masked his true intentions, and this peek into his psyche is the most potent and disturbing aspect of the movie. It's a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle, and told with enough elegance and wit to keep you on board the whole way.There's a dark comedic tone present throughout. Lou's persistence and crass remarks to basically anyone he encounters provide some good laughs. He doesn't sugarcoat anything, he'll talk to anyone in order to get his way, and he has a sleazy smirk that never fails to get a reaction. Also Gyllenhaal's chemistry with Rene Russo (the news director) is palatable and their work dynamic becomes more of a gripping co-dependency as the movie progresses.Nightcrawler is a must-watch for fans of cinema. It's a work of art from a directorial and writing standpoint, from an acting standpoint, and from a basic human nature standpoint. It really does a hell of a job at sucking you into this dark gloomy world to the point where you don't want to get out. It's intense, it's funny, it's thrilling, it's powerful, and most of all, it's real. Nightcrawler is simply sensational.",

            "content": "\"Nightcrawler\" is an incredibly graphic and adult film...so think twice before you watch it. The language, the violence and content is NOT something everybody will want to see...to think twice (I am saying it again just to emphasize this strongly).When the film begins, Louis (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cheap little crook stealing and doing what he can to get by. In the process of doing this, he happens upon a film crew covering a crime scene...and Louis has found his purpose. He soon gets himself a cheap camcorder and police scanner and soon begins spending his evenings driving about LA--looking for mayhem in order to make a buck off it. As the film progresses, Louis' complete lack of ethics and conscience is shocking...especially when he begins manipulating things to make news stories and withholding police evidence in order to get the BIG story!This film is incredibly cynical in the way it shows the news. It shows the newsfolk as mostly a lot of soulless bottom-feeders--and Louis is the king of them all. And, as his videos become more and more horrific, Louis seems to be enjoying it with an almost orgiastic pleasure. I really appreciated in the film is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. His wide-eyed almost insane look really helped his character...as did his weird, gaunt look. And, it helped that the more awful the things were that he was covering, the happier he appeared. Some excellent acting by him. Overall, a cynical, intense and difficult film that is not for everyone...and it's a logical 21st century extension of the sort of exploitative news that thrilled audiences with \"Network\".",

This atypical, fresh-feeling film plays out in an inventive way, inviting the viewer to go on a heart-of-darkness style journey alongside a gaunt and frightening Jake Gyllenhaal, doing his obsessed thing again after ZODIAC and even less human this time around. What transpires is ghoulishly entertaining, featuring strong supporting turns from Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed as others along for the ride, building to a quietly devastating climax. I could have done with the character work a little more grey rather than so explicitly black and white, especially at the slightly contrived climax, but otherwise this is well made stuff.",

            "review_title": "Stylishly Scary Tour de Force",
            "content": "From Welles to De Niro to Hanks to Bale, Hollywood has a history of actors going through extreme body transformations. While Gyllenhaal's intense weight loss will easily fit this trend, to only focus on that part of his commitment to Nightcrawler would be overlooking how impressively gone he is as Louis Bloom, the focus of this intense character study about an overlooked and disturbed individual. It's not a particularly \"pleasant\" film, and the pacing is far from quick, but the tension between Louis and his world progresses so beautifully as to pin you right to your seat. Nightcrawler is an effectively scary, uncomfortably funny, and stylishly gritty tour de force. The premise, plot and protagonist are truly unique: a sociopath becomes a freelance news-cameraman, stopping at nothing to succeed. Though his arc seems implausible, Gilroy crafts it smoothly, and Gyllenhaal's disturbed perfection make it hard NOT to believe. His unsettling bug-eyed expression and breathtakingly inappropriate smile are magnetic. Much like Scorsese's Rupert Pupkin, Bloom seems to believe he is the star of his own story: delusional, bull-headed, and respectably determined. Luckily, there is more here than just Gyllenhaal; powerful set-pieces resound, and the beautifully cool ambient guitar score is among the best of the year, complimenting Gyllenahaal's uneasy intensity. Even the camera consistently reminds us where Bloom stands in the deeply LA locale. At the heart, it's smartly calling out our propensity for praising characters for their desires, reminding us that compassionless ambition is extremely dangerous. For our fame-starved culture, Nightcrawler is a good message within a great movie with an even greater lead performance. A true don't-miss!",

            "content": "\"Nightcrawler\" is the kind of film that will catch audiences by surprise with its painstaking thoughtfulness, and features the kind of lead character that will be discussed in film circles who don't detest American cinema and actually give it the benefit of the doubt. The film plunges us into the dark, seedy world of a nightcrawler, somebody who, often working freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule, patrols the streets of crowded cities with multiple police scanners searching for recently-committed crimes in the neighborhood, like rape, shootings, murders, car accidents, and so forth. The object of a nightcrawler is to get candid and intimate shots of the ugliness that plagues these scenarios as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news stations or eyewitness programs to turn quick profit. Job requirements include possible insomniac, lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror, exceptional navigational/driving skills, and a load of free time.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a man at rock-bottom living in Los Angeles, selling scrap metal to get money before eventually turning to the nightcrawling business. He teams up with Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate to make money to keep a roof over his head, who helps navigate Lou's routes as a nightcrawler and learns of numerous police codes to help Lou decipher the police scanner jargon. Together, the two make for an amateur nightcrawling team, turning profit by selling the footage \u2013 expertly shot, analyzed, and even occasionally manipulated by Lou \u2013 to Nina (Rene Russo), the station manager of a severely failing news station that is in dire need to regain viewership.Ultimately, \"Nightcrawler\" juggles two tricky but immersing features with its material, simultaneously giving us a look into a grimy and often dirty gig as somebody who is essentially a voyeur into the most vulnerable time of the people he meets and posing frightening commentary on contemporary news. The nightcrawler is not looking to help or to provide encouragement; he's there to get his shots and move on, hoping to turn as large of a profit as he can. We see Los Angeles in the light of what could be classifiable as a contemporary film noir, in dark, sometimes shadowy-photography and dingy environments that reveal an ugliness to a city that is normally captured as very beautiful and ideal in terms of climate. Director Dan Gilroy and cinematographer Robert Elswit (a frequent collaborator of Paul Thomas Anderson) do everything in their power to subvert our ideas of Los Angeles and focus on transitory locations that show the ugliest of human events in such a way that is beautiful and captivating thanks to crystal-clear photography.The other feature \"Nightcrawler\" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations, who, in turn, are also battling more rapidly-updated social media websites, the manipulation of news is ever-present on Television. News programs, like sitcoms, reality shows, and sports events, are a game of numbers and those numbers are ratings \u2013 something that \"Nightcrawler\" makes depressingly clear to us. A crucial scene to this message comes into play when Lou has shot and sold the defining tape of his career and has worked to manipulate it for personal gain. He watches as Nina plays the tape on the air, directing the news anchors in such a specific way in terms of language and mannerisms that we see the fear-mongering happen right before our eyes.On top of all the social commentary, we see amazingly realistic crime scenes and car accidents to boot. Perhaps it's the lack of intimacy many directors lend to these situations, often showing a car accident, and characters limping and trudging along with little bloodshed, but \"Nightcrawler\" details these scenes with an incredible eye for attention and realism. Gilroy makes us the voyeur and gives the window into these car accidents that we glance over to see but not entirely anticipate or really want to see. The attention to detail in these seems is simply exquisite and uncommonly believable.\"Nightcrawler,\" in addition, features a wonderful performance by Gyllenhaal who, like his co-star Paul Dano in last year's \"Prisoners,\" plays detached and empty with such conviction, and channels something of an inner-Philip Seymour Hoffman in \"Owning Mahowny,\" showing his character's complete fulfillment when obsessing over his job and his work. Even Riz Ahmed shouldn't be overlooked here, playing the overworked and under-appreciated assistant to Gyllenhaal's Lou in a role that could've been an empty, and even distracting, side role. The entire project is rich in commentary, performances, and environmental beauty that it could easily be one of the most complete films of the year.",

            "content": "If you take the slick look of Drive and the satirical wit of Network, you get Nightcrawler. This film is a genius first film for director Dan Gilroy, it is darkly comedic, surprisingly disturbing and is brilliantly acted. The film tells the story of Lou Bloom, a freelance videographer who covers the crime world in LA for a local news station and ruthless editor played by Rene Russo. It isn't before long until Bloom's demented job overtakes his life, making him colder and colder the deeper he goes. The film plays like a twisted bloody version of Network and has the satirical wit to back it up. Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly fantastic in this film. Lou Bloom is a role that he is completely submerged in and it oozes through every frame as our dislike for Bloom intensifies throughout the film. But what this film does best is not make us particularly like Bloom but it makes us wonder what he is willing to do next. And trust me, his actions get as sick and as shocking as they come. Bloom is a depraved individual and Jake Gyllenhaal deserves a hell of a lot acknowledgment for this role because he pulls off the tricky task of making the audience care about a character that is truly unlikeable and does so with not one false note. It is truly mesmerizing to see. The supporting cast including Rene Russo and Bill Paxton are absolutely great in this film and deliver career bests here. The cinematography also is top notch here, blending the awesome pallets of Drive with a bitter cold makes for an engaging view and makes it hard for you to peel your eyes from the screen. Writer/Director Dan Gilroy is someone to watch, especially coming out of the gates with a film filled with sheer and raw velocity like this one. It is not only an impressive first film but a brilliant film all around. I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler seems like a satire to modern television news about how they choose their leads or often seek for more ratings by entertaining their viewers rather than aim straightly to the facts. But there is a much interesting story beneath here and that is the main character, Louis Bloom. The guy that easily manipulates people with his sinister tricks of persuasion. Everything else may just be the natural world of crime and accidents, but in the eyes of this character, the experience is made far stranger and oddly fascinating. This provides a compellingly menacing and provoking piece of commentary which results to such engrossing film.What the plot mostly does is to fully absorb the viewers into the character of Bloom by studying his sociopathic behavior and the words coming out from his mouth. He is a charming young man with a dark intention hidden behind his grins. He pushes the limits of the law and his own safety, only to accomplish on what he must do in the job, even if it risks many people's lives. The actions of this antihero is ought to feel terrifying on how it affects to both the business he's working on and the society he is watching. The media's side however is more of a picture of cynicism on how they broadcast the scariest stories of the city, giving the people fear so they could earn more viewers out of the concern. It just breaks down on how the evil of their success is disguised as their own ethics.The filmmaking perfectly captures their night's work. You couldn't clearly see the scenario they shoot unless you watch them on a video footage. The violence and peril they witness are shown without any hint of sympathy, since they only use them for the news show. The horror of these gritty scenes once again belongs to the nightcrawler. Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the biggest highlights here. His character obviously has the personality of a psychotic villain; he is mostly bluffing, and by the dashing enthusiasm he shows to the people around him, you probably may not know when his inner total madness will burst out from his frightening eyeballs, and that provides more tension than you expect. This is one of the Gyllenhaal performances that will be remembered for his career.Out of common sense, this story may lead its main character to a moral about how much he is taking this job too far, probably destroying his humanity. But no, this guy is relentless, almost inhumane, and his style in fact helps his career grow bigger, which turns out we are actually rooting for a villain. And that probably pictures to some oppressive ambitious beings out there behind some system. This is where things go in the end, bringing an outcome to a social satire. You can spot a lot of relevance even when some of the situations get a little out of hand. Nightcrawler is something else than a sentiment, what we must focus here is Lou Bloom: a new, possibly iconic, movie vigilante, except the only skin he is purposely saving is himself and his career.",

            "content": "Whereas Gone Girl explored the wild misconceptions and dangerous influence of the media, Nightcrawler explores another even more corrupted facet of the entity's nature: shamelessly capitalizing on the popularity of crime television\u2014violence, murder, blood, gunshots. The program's ratings continue heightening along with the network's desire for even more thrilling footage. Nightcrawler follows Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) as he climbs up the ladder of success and builds a career through rash ambition. Lacking a formal education and adequate work experience, he's truly a victim of the unfair modern job market/unemployment. So, he says \"screw it\" and takes matters into his own hands, acting with sheer desperation and eagerness to reach that level of power and affluence America so often glorifies. After personally witnessing a car accident on the freeway as snooping reporters close in, the scene lights a fire inside Louis and inspires him to give the job a try. Soon afterwards, he purchases a camcorder and a radio scanner, persistently discovering new crime scenes to capture on tape as intimately as he possibly can. Thus, his extensive coverage grabs the attention of a morning news channel, and a special relationship forms therein: a consistent supply of new gruesome/entertaining crime footage for an increasing sum of money. As we see the frightening lengths Louis is willing to strive towards in order to prove himself as a proficient workingman and elevate his value above and beyond, this grave thriller intermittently surprises us with effectively mocking twisted humor, but the incredibly deranged human psychology on display keeps us startled and tense throughout regardless. Gyllenhaal arguably gives the absolute best performance of his career in a role that substantially differentiates from his earlier work. His creepy, relaxed composure hides the true inner scariness and ferocity. Publicly, Louis is a professional, polite, and upstanding citizen who's just looking to work hard. Privately, he violently yells in front of a mirror until he shatters it, as well as blackmails a TV news director to further his career. Rene Russo also impresses as the morning news director\u2014almost as daring in her lust for more provocative violent imagery\u2014who's beguiled by this eccentric and only (mistakenly) fuels Louis' psychotic drive. In addition, Riz Ahmed's Rick serves as Louis' gullible, clueless \"employee\" who just wants to escape the dispiriting state of homelessness and finally earn a living, completely unaware of the perilous and unethical situations he'll be cast in along his employer's selfishly ruthless path.This isn't the kind of film whose quality solely relies on a central performance because the narrative is just as cruelly gripping. Unfortunately, the film industry is stocked with so many safe crowdpleasers and compromising thrillers that it's wholly refreshing to see these uncompromisingly grim, chilling psychological character studies occasionally pop up. The film becomes more morally repulsive and disturbing as it proceeds while the satire on the American Dream and merciless ambition becomes that much more brutal. Nightcrawler is deeply unsettling as well as it is honest in its portrayal\u2014Los Angeles is actually the perfect setting, beautifully shot in its alluring and deceptive nighttime scenery. After all, it is probably the #1 destination for the unrelentingly audacious and reckless individuals of the nation in search of a prosperous career.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is the first directorial effort from writer Dan Gilroy, brother of Oscar nominee Tony Gilroy. However, Dan has his fair share of successful writing too. You may have seen \"Real Steel\" or the latest installment from the Bourne franchise starring Jeremy Renner. And \"Nightcrawler\" may even end up as his best-received film. Critics and audiences seem to enjoy it a lot.Most of this is probably due to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Louis Bloom. I was not familiar with the concept of nightcrawling before, never really thought about where these morning news get their footage from, and this may have made the viewing experience even more intense. The film starts off solid and gets better the more Gyllenhaal dives into madness. I actually really liked the beginning. He is just another unemployed guy trying to make a living. Pretty normal and it adds a nice contemporary reference in these times of recession. However, what comes next is far from normal. His character moves closer and closer to the darker side. First he just watches a colleague, then he makes his own recordings. Not much later he starts moving injured or even dead people at the scene of an accident, so he can get better footage. Afterwards he enters a murder scene before the police arrives and next he pretty much stages a shooting that involves innocent bystanders at a diner and finally he commits manslaughter himself. All for the best coverage. The aforementioned diner scene is possibly the best thing this movie has to offer. It reaches greatness here. Truly tense just like the whole ending pretty much. I loved that it was pretty much in the sense of good vs. evil the worst ending that could have happened. Not only did Bloom not have to face any legal consequences, but he even managed to expand his business thanks to his ruthlessness.The mirror destruction scene earlier on wasn't even needed to display the main characters descent into insanity. It was even a bit too showy for my taste. The quiet way, as it was for the rest of this film, just by his actions with other people around was mesmerizing enough already. Other than that, there was not much I did not like about this movie. Maybe his colleague's accident was slightly too much of a coincidence, but the way it was directed was very nicely done again with the two looking at each other. Performances by Russo (director's wife), Ahmed and Paxton were solid, but this film is all really just a huge showpiece for Gyllenhaal. Also I expected his new watch to play a significant role towards the end, maybe one that leads to his death. But I was wrong. And finally, we need to see that Bloom is really just a pawn in the chess game of the entertainment industry here, so this film works excellently as well as a study on television and how far people go for the most exciting, and thus most profitable, news.",

Guilt that you actually enjoyed this rather original movie-making set in an ethical and moral vacuum. In that sense the movie is entirely ironic. You shouldn't be enjoying this stuff.It's an exposition of entirely greed-induced (financial and ego driven) naked ambition that rivals Wolf of Wall Street for it's blithe abandon of normal ethical practice.Gyllenhaal, as Louis Bloom, almost cadaverous after his dramatic weight loss for the part, is as unsympathetic a movie character as you've seen in a very long time. His back story, which is precisely zilch, renders him a character in search of a meaning. A loner, a drifter, a thief, unemployed (unemployable is the truth) and entirely without remorse - emotion for that matter - stumbles upon a freelance career as an, at first hapless then really rather good, ambulance chasing 'scene of the crime' news cameraman.Starting with motorway crashes and graduating to suburban crime scenes (where the threat of middle America being intruded upon by 'Hispanics' and other Liberal American ethnic minorities) he captures more and more challenging newsreel material that feeds the sensation-lust of an LA loser News Station's News Editor, Nina Romina, played deliciously by Rene Russo.Romina's sponsorship of, and belief in, the expert blagging of Bloom feeds his desire for greater success and indeed for Romina herself. In a toe curling 'date' at a camp Mexican restaurant Bloom lays it on the line with Romina in a scene of toe-curling embarrassment. It's as if Gyllenhaal is playing for laughs, but he's deadly serious.Throughout, Gyllenhaal commands the screen. The Nightime lighting constantly picking out his skeletal, eye bulging look that makes him look like the devil incarnate. This truly is an evil character and Gyllenhaal's trademark smirk only adds to the perverse sense of evil pleasure he is gaining as his success mushrooms.A recurring theme in the movie is his watering of a pot plant in his flat. It's as if it's the only living thing he cares two bucks about. Certainly his hapless sidekick/assistant Rick, played by Riz Ahmed, has next to no chance in this little hothouse world of emotion-free ambition.Gyllenhaal's faux management style 'development' of Rick is at times darkly amusing but usually just plain vacuous and ironic given that he draws from real world self help and management lingo that's bad enough in the corporate world, but downright bizarre in this micro universe.The car chases are gripping edge of seat affairs, the plot, although it has holes in the final reel (quite big ones I felt) is nevertheless highly original and unfolds at a steady pace.The conclusion was, to my mind at least, a little disappointing, but aside from this a good, dark, star vehicle for Jake and possibly a step towards another best actor nomination.",

It certainly does not follow the narrative of one and even though it has the three-act structure we are all familiar with, it spins them around. This is particularly evident in the third act, incredibly suspenseful with a brilliant, almost anti-climax. Suspense is the main key to this film's success, it build and builds to the point where the last twenty minutes of the film are completely unpredictable. Dan Gilroy in his directorial debut here has shown a real understanding of how to keep an audience engaged and following a character who isn't an easy man to spend a great deal of time with. Gilroy's screenplay is fast paced and one of the finest this year. The script focuses the audience on the characters, Louis Bloom particularly yet the supporting characters are just as impressive by Bill Paxton and Rene Russo alike. It doesn't follow the rules of a typical script, we are introduced instantly to a criminal and this man is supposed to be our protagonist. Yet what becomes clear is that there is not a protagonist in Nightcrawler, Jake Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom is the antagonist. He can be described as nothing less than a psychopath and his portrayal by Gyllenhaal is one of his greatest performances. He is very gaunt here, losing a lot of weight for the role, however that is not the main reason for his impressive performance. Gyllenhaal is an actor who continues to impress me; his work in Enemy from earlier this year was just as brilliant. He has chosen excellent roles in films such as Zodiac, Prisoners and End of Watch. The cinematography is also fantastic, night-time LA has not looked this good since 2011's Drive. All these elements come together to make a captivating piece of filmmaking, a film I expect will be discussed more as time goes on.",

            "content": "Let's start with Jake Gyllenhaal here. In a way, his performance can be criticized in the sense that it's one-dimensional. In almost every scene of the film (when he's not putting on a big, s***-eating grin, or yelling at a mirror), he comes wide-eyed, talking a SUPER game, and that game is how to get an opportunity and run with it, how to make the big deal. He has the same determined, crazed but leaning-on-'nice' fervor. And yet it's an actor giving it his all and it works. He finds the... is 'humanity' the word? He's not even really a person, is he - he's less like your common garden variety sociopath. He's relentless, he tries on emotions for what he needs, and can barely sleep. If the movie suddenly revealed itself as an alien or a serial killer, you might believe it. And there's never a moment where Lou Bloom doesn't show that. Gyllenhaal, with his gaunt (he lost weight) appearance, his stream-lined word-a-second performance, is on fire here. He makes this guy completely terrifying, yet recognizable at times, too. Could we see this guy in our everyday life? Or maybe leading a self-help/money-managing seminar? One of the wonderful things about Nightcrawler is how it appears as one thing, but it's about something else, or on top of it. When I mention that he's a sociopath, that's putting it lightly. He may talk in platitudes, in ways that, if you met this person in person you might wonder 'Is this for real? Is this guy just totally nuts?' But it's a metaphor - what would happen if the American Dream, the Horatio Alger situation, went completely to pot? We were told by the Supreme Court in America a few years back, in a matter of speaking, that a Corporation is a person, and that a Corporation should have the rights that any person has in the American process. What Gilroy is trying out here (perhaps akin to a documentary from years back called The Corporation): what happens when a person IS a corporation, that they are always climbing the ladder, always finding the way to make a deal, to make a profit, to get up to the Next Level (in caps)? Everything is seen as status, and damn it all if Lou is going to see his profit margin go down, or a loss to happen, whether it's with his news footage that he's selling to the local station, or if he spots a security guard with his \"fake\" uniform. And, more to the point, when other, actual corporations (like, say, a news network) face such a being. Nightcrawler has a main character as a villain - or, as I've called it (ala Walter White) an anti-villain. He's diabolical, you don't like this guy, he actually may make you sick to your stomach. But he's the \"hero\" still. And like a sort of \"arch\" villain he's got all his information together on so many things - thanks, Internet - and other people around him, like Rene Russo's news director, or his assistant, who is desperate and has to take this man with his slick-back hair at his word. Indeed the scenes with Russo, for me, almost verge on becoming incredulous; how much will she, who seems to be a more sane person, can take with this guy? But he throws his challenges at her, there's rebuffs, and... she needs him.Gilroy's script is sharp and intense, finding a strong plot to hang it on (it's still a neo-noir ultimately, with crimes on going on at LA at night, shot with a strong eye by Robert Elswit), and yet, for me, it works best as a character study. By the very end it almost becomes TOO much. Can we believe this? Maybe it's the point - he's gone to this point because... he can. Or people let him, or don't catch him, or whatever. There are holes you can try to find here. It's not about that. Like Gone Girl, it's a satire that looks at media with the sickening perspective it possibly deserves. It's a movie that challenges the viewer to go where this character does, to squirm, to recognize what is in this person as being something in the real world.Nightcrawler takes a risk to show this character - a cross perhaps between Daniel Plainview and Rupert Pupkin - and explore what happens when Capitalistic ambitions (and on a more we've-seen-this-before level 'if it bleeds it leads' critical pieces) go to/past their limits. It's incisive, it's stimulating, and self-conscious. 9.5/10",

            "content": "Haven't we already had some movies that touched on this kind of would-be journalism? Wasn't there a movie called Paparazzo back in about 2004, or something like that? Didn't Joe Pesci once make something called 'Jimmy Hollywood' back in the early 90s that had a similar theme? True, those movies are not specifically about gruesome crime journalism, but the idea of edgy loners going out and merely showing up with a camera didn't sound too original. I was hoping for more than I got. That said, Nightcrawler is not going to bore you. It may only make you wish they had done it better. The story deals with an asocial loner (Gyllenhaal) attempting to break into television journalism with nothing more than a camera and a police scanner. Clueless at first, the young man discovers he has good instincts. Then, he finds a ratings-challenged news station that is willing to pay him good money for gory footage of crime and accidents; things the mean streets of L.A. would seem to have a lot of. Within mere moments of screen time, Gyllenhaal has graduated to having a fast sports car, top shelf equipment, and even an assistant. His footage is a potential career saver for TV journalist Rene Russo. But there is competition for this bloody footage (surprisingly little, though) and soon Jake finds himself not only recording the blood, but sometimes thinking he has to cause it as well. He finds himself compelled to sabotage his primary competitor, demand sexual favors from Russo, withhold the identities of multi-murderers, and even sacrifice his partner's life. When will his world come crashing down on him? Or will it?That little synopsis is more compelling than many of the scenes. The script plays like a first draft, with no major plot twists that you cannot see coming from a mile away. Some possibilities are offered, then left to dry up on the vine. The manner in which Jake films the mass shooting at a swanky home, leads the viewer to expect that he will in fact be a suspect in the crime. It would not surprise me to learn there is a different draft in which they did actually go that route, and some of the shots were set up to move the story in that direction. Alas, Jake is merely accused only of withholding the identities of the killers. A detective threatens him harshly at his apartment about the possibility he could be charged with obstruction and whatnot. NOTHING comes of this scene. Nothing. Gyllenhaal's performance is uneven. In the first half of the film, he seems to be aping Travis Bickle with his asocial honesty and lack of people skills. By the second act, he is a cold know-it-all who talks down to his assistant and the people at the TV station. By the film's final act, he is a slick, slimy pseudo TV producer. It just doesn't seem like he'd morph so quickly. And if this business is so competitive, why is Bill Paxton the only other guy who seems to show up and compete for footage? This coulda, and shoulda been better. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

When he sees a freelance cameraman filming an accident, he decides to invest money in a camcorder and a police scanner radio from a pawn shop. He overhears the name of Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who is responsible for the TV news of a television station and he sells his first footage. Louis learns how to improve his films and hires the homeless Rick (Riz Ahmed) to help him. When his competitor Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) discloses his new van and equipment to Louis, he sabotages his van, causing a serious accident. The ambitious Louis is a sociopath and for him gore means a better payment for his footages. So he leaves the position of crime photographer to interfere in crime scenes, climbing in his new career. \"Nightcrawler\" is a weird and original movie with one of the bleakest characters that I have recently seen on the screen. Jake Gyllenhaal has an impressive performance in the role of an ambitious sociopath that is capable to do anything to climb in his new job. The plot is totally unpredictable and mesmerizes the viewer that can not foresee the next move of Louis. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Abutre\" (\"The Volture\")",

He echoes the memorable sociopaths played by Robert DeNiro in his prime (Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy and Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver), but he's less sympathetic than either of those. A parasite on the prowl, Bloom soon fixates on a career ideally suited to his amoral loner/ go-getter character\u2014as a crime journalist during L.A.'s night hours. He listens for crimes in progress on his police scanner, speeds to the scene, and then angles for the most shocking, risqu\u00e9 footage he can possibly get away with.New colleagues Nina (Rene Russo), the struggling news producer he goes to first, and Rick (Riz Ahmed), a desperate \"intern\" railroaded into the nightmare, are exploitable because they want what Bloom can give them\u2014money, work, success. The risks he takes and the lines he crosses are mainly ethical ones at first, but he quickly realises the quickest way to make a name for himself is to get truly sensational footage. The kind that requires taking bigger risks, and eventually endangering lives.Bloom is the most detestable character I've seen in ages. He's a soulless cockroach rummaging through the misfortunes of others, ravenously feeding off violent crimes, sometimes while they're still happening. But the news station keeps on buying what he's selling. Viewer ratings spike with each successive horror scene that hits the air.Writer/director Dan Gilroy makes us squirm from start to finish here because Bloom is so queasily familiar. We all know people who share his traits, even if they don't take them to such extremes. He's society's Frankenstein's monster, made from all the worst parts of capitalism. He'll achieve success by any means, and he's proud of that.With End of Watch and Prisoners, and now Nightcrawler, Gyllenhaal is finding the sort of edgy, dangerous roles relished by great actors of the 1970s, and he's attacking them with gusto. This might be his best performance yet. The film itself is a darkly comic treat. It's tense and unsettling as a thriller, but the most fascinating part is seeing how far this scumbag will take his obsession, and how much we'll allow him to get away with.",

He is proof that knowledge is power and that a little knowledge is a very dangerous thing indeed All vulnerabilities must be seen as opportunities and exploited immediately without any regard or the well being of the people involved. They have been deigned by fate to further his cause.

            "content": "Nightcrawler is slang. I will not ruin or spoil anything in this review. Jake Gylenhall has never been better. His character must have been incredibly hard to play, and you will see why. There is a reason this Thriller & Drama opened on Halloween. His character is ambitious to a fault & highly intelligent. He interacts most often with Rene Russo & a man he calls his intern. If you thought Julius Caesar was ambitious or Alexander the Great, this character must have the same motivation to succeed minus the goal of conquering the world. Needless to say he is driven. Russo is also ambitious, so they make a good team. The difference is how far each is willing to cross the lines of morality, legality & humanity. The movie is original in every sense. There has never been a movie similar in the character or the situation, and the movie makes an open commentary about an important but not political aspect of American society. To say it was gripping would be literal. I looked down at one point, and I was clutching my outer thigh. The movie is tense & intense. Every move seems known to Gylenhall but not to anyone else. If you like entrepreneurs, this movie will appeal to that in one aspect. Overall, it is definitely a Thriller full of danger & illegality. It is Gylenhall versus the world, if he were a diplomat & the world represented achieving his goals. That's his character around others. When left unwatched, even for a moment, he devolves into a character that does whatever it takes. See this movie for the originality. See it if you enjoy thrillers. See it because he gives the best acting performance of his life in a character with many sides. See it for fun. See it for a cool fast car. Or, the fact it is tracking above 8 stars out of 10 which is about as good as it gets on IMDb, considering that is the average of thousands & thousands of ratings by people as diverse as patrons watching on a Washington, D.C theater. From that number you can safely predict it's very likely you will find it as highly entertaining as the international average (plus or minus 1 star). In my estimation, I reserve a 9/10 rating for the best of the best. 10/10 stars are for the greatest movies. This is easily the best of the best.

Put the two together and you get an escalating set of events in which the video freelancer goes to greater and greater extremes to film shocking scenes of crime, encouraged along by the media editor who is paying for his results.What makes the film more interesting than just another action drama is the social commentary and the character studies. The main characters are very well crafted, believable, explained through back drop and excellently acted out. The parallels between them are also interesting to observe. Both pretty much without any care for the people around them and focused solely on personal gain. What the video guy will do to get his paycheck is shocking, but what the media editor will do to get her news reel is just as distasteful.The social commentary is also sharp. The media is portrayed essentially as caring about nothing but a good story, even in fact if that story happens to be untrue. What matters is the narrative and the narrative has to fit the agenda of the media agency. By this measure all news is little more than propaganda. The video guy, despite his barbaric methods and behaviour, is also tolerated by those around him and the message, at least from the media editor and her team (acknowledging one dissenting voice in the film), is that it is OK to be cruel and to hurt others if it is in the pursuit of personal ambition. Both are valid observations and comments on today's society, whether we, the viewers, happen to agree with them or not.The film also has a touch of originality which isn't easy to do these days when so many movies have already been made. Yes there are studies out there of psychos, yes there are films that vilify the media and there are films about morbid voyeurism and about the exploitation of victims of crime for personal gain. The originality comes from putting them all together. I couldn't really think of a parallel, although others might.This is well worth watching. You may not ultimately enjoy the film, after all it isn't pleasant, but I am fairly sure you will remember it.",

Nightcrawler is instantly interesting by presenting the unconventional lead as friendly faced but sinister. The plot follows TV news filming, a frankly distressing concept in itself, using someone who would use tragedy for his own fortune. The entire film is well-paced, building at times and adrenaline-fuelled at others, developing Gyllenhaal's character without changing his characteristics. It is truly dark, and no emotional bond is created from an audiences perspective, but that's what makes the character work. Towards the end their is an irritating scene following a shocking climax, but all in all the quality is consistently high throughout.",

            "content": "When we first meet Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), he's cutting sections of chain-link fence from a construction site to sell for scrap. It's not exactly the ideal way to make a living, and Bloom certainly aspires to greater things - he even lobbies unsuccessfully for a job at the scrapyard, but the manager isn't keen on hiring thieves. But while driving home, Bloom comes across an auto accident, with emergency personnel working frantically to free a woman trapped in the wreckage while the entire scene is being filmed by an independent cameraman (Bill Paxton) hoping to sell the footage to a local news station.Something about this profession strikes a chord with Louis, and it doesn't take long before he's armed himself with a shoddy police scanner and a cheap camcorder, trying to get his feet wet in his newly adopted vocation. Louis quickly learns that the veterans don't take kindly to newcomers, and they're not about to share any tricks of the trade, but Louis's lack of experience is more than balanced out by his cunning and ingenuity. In one early scene, as late night news director Nina (Rene Russo) tells him that she already has footage from the same incident he recorded, Louis smiles warmly and informs her that he was closer to the subject, with a better angle - but he's not trying to bargain with her, he's just merely passing along information, with just the right amount of aloofness to pique her interest.With her station struggling desperately for ratings, Nina strikes up a deal with Louis, giving her first option on whatever footage he captures from his late-night escapades. The relationship bears fruit quickly, with the station boasting a steady string of high-rated scoops, and Louis trading in his beat-up hatchback and low-grade equipment for a Dodge Charger and a GPS-enabled police scanner complete with a touchscreen interface. He also acquires the services of Rick, a homeless \"intern\" that assists with navigation and operating the second camera in exchange for a paltry thirty bucks per night, and Louis's constant promises of developing his skills to further his \"career.\"As Louis continues to outrun and outsmart his fellow nightcrawlers, he comes obsessed with recognition, and the power that comes from it. He demands that the name of his \"news company\" be read by the morning anchors anytime his footage is shown, he insists that he be introduced to the TV station executives and credited with Nina's ongoing success, and he subtly threatens to offer his footage to rival news outlets unless Nina yields to his romantic advances. And he does all of these things, and plenty more, with a frighteningly genial disposition, his face always lit up with a cheerful grin.While roles in Enemy and Prisoners afforded Gyllenhaal the opportunity to play characters that inhabit some dark spaces, there's something even more compelling about watching him disappear into the mind of a complete sociopath. No matter what deplorable and horrific action Louis takes over the course of Nightcrawler's two- hour running time, he never shows the slightest hint of guilt or remorse, remaining singularly focused on achieving his goals at any cost. Combined with Gyllenhaal's dramatic physical change - he lost over 20 pounds for the role, with his hollowed eyes and gaunt appearance adding to the creepiness - it's a fascinating performance, and among the actor's best work to date.Undeniably disturbing and unapologetically cynical, Nightcrawler is also an acerbic derision of what passes for \"journalism\" in today's society, where actually reporting the news has become far less important than providing ghastly imagery for the public to devour en masse. One of the film's best sequences plays with this very idea, as the stomach-churning choices that Louis makes after arriving at the scene of a home invasion are justified when Nina agrees to the exorbitant price he places on the footage. The exchange borders on outrageous, and yet we can't help but wonder how authentic it might be. After all, as Paxton's character says wisely, \"If it bleeds, it leads.\"",

            "content": "On the surface, \"Nightcrawler\" is a very well-made film. The production value is high, the visuals are great, acting is solid, and it delves into a number of very relevant themes regarding journalism and TV news. The problem, however, is that director Dan Gilroy doesn't pause nearly enough to examine the really interesting parts of the film. Instead, everything in the movie is kind of viewed in the abstract...with very little (and thus I would argue not nearly enough) context given in order to make it a truly great piece of film-making.For a basic plot summary, \"Nightcrawler\" sees Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying desperately to find a job in a rough economy. One night, he stumbles upon a crime scene and meets Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), an independent TV news cameraman who impresses Louis with his ability to \"do the dirty work\" and get paid handsomely for it. So, Louis decides to get into the TV journalism business himself, even doing well enough to hire a partner in Rick (Riz Ahmed). Along the way, Louis also develops a relationship (that some might consider inappropriate) with head news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo). Things seem to be going great for Louis and his thriving business...until the night he arrives at a burglary scene before the police, making a number of choices leading him down a shady ethical path that he may or may not recover from.Easily the two most interesting parts of this film are Gyllenhaal's Louis and the movie's examination of the TV news business. Both of those subjects carry very weighty, relevant themes in today's society and are worthy of examination. Unfortunately, both are also just kind of glossed over in favor of \"the spectacle\" in this case.Louis is one of the strangest characters I've ever seen on the big screen (done to perfection, as usual, by the underrated Gyllenhaal). On one hand, you can kind of feel sorry for him, as he never seems to catch a break early on. On the other hand, he is such a smarmy individual that he is far from like-able. Usually I like this kind of ambiguity in my film characters, but in this case it comes off more as confusing than interesting. At the end of flick, I didn't feel like I cared any more about Louis than I did, oh, 20 or so minutes in.As for the many themes regarding televised news, I really wish the pace of the film would have allowed even more examination of them. There is a character in the newsroom (played by Kevin Rahm) who always bring up the ethical issues of what is transpiring, but he is quickly pushed aside each and every time. Perhaps that is a statement being made in and of itself, but I still feel like the movie wanted us (as viewers) to take a few too many things at face value. I wanted to see the principals struggle a bit regarding their decisions. There just didn't seem to be any conflict in what was happening.Overall, though, \"Nightcrawler\" isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. In my mind, it is the complete and utter personification of a \"three star effort\", as it easily did enough to hold my interest, yet didn't do anything more to really make me care in the end. To me, this was very much a \"take it or leave it\" experience. Had some closer examination of themes/characters taken place, I think it could have been much, much more interesting.",

            "content": "I avoided Nightcrawler when it was initially stirring around because I thought it was some sort of X-Men spin off. Of course, once the positive reviews came flooding in and I realised that it wasn't about a flexible mutant, but about a man who becomes obsessed with filming violent street crimes for the news, I became interested.Nightcrawler is a brilliant film and manages to do everything right. At the centre of it all is Jake Gyllenhaal's sensational performance as Lou Bloom. He's surely the most ruthless businessman since Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, although his autistic characteristics make him far less charming and compelling. Nonetheless, Jake completely morphs into the character and delivers a performance well worthy of an Oscar. His slimy grin is enough to make anyone's skin crawl and he's totally devoid of any moral compass, however you can't help but admire his knowledge and ambition.The film clocks in at almost two hours but not even a second of a scene is wasted. After a fast-paced first half where we witness Lou's rise into the crime filming industry the film takes a slower, yet stronger approach in the second half where we focus on one particular case which is sure to shock. There are some wonderfully tense scenes towards the end of the film where I could not take my eyes off the screen. It's almost as if you're there in the street with the characters.I loved how the media was so cynically portrayed here and the underlying themes of how voyeuristic society has become are relevant and dealt with well. The media is a ruthless business and it's great how the news values of having white, middle-class people under attack is put on display.There's very little to fault with Nightcrawler. Not only is it intelligent, but it is also thoroughly entertaining with an engaging story and captivating main character who is sure to become a cult icon. Jake has never been better and some aspects of his performance are truly chilling. It's just a wonderfully made film and one which I hope to revisit fairly often.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com",

Louis asks why he is filming such a thing and is told that local news stations pay top dollar for such footage\u0085 the grizzlier the better. He sells some stolen property to buy a cheap video camera and police scanner. At the first potential story he attends the police tell him to leave because he is getting to close; but he has the footage and sells it to a local TV station. News director Nina Romina tells him that she is impressed by his work and that he should bring any more stories to her. Soon his footage is appearing on screen regularly; as time passes he buys better equipment and takes on an assistant, who he pays a pittance. He frequently goes too far; entering properties and even moving a body at a car crash to get a better shot but that is only the start. What he is prepared to do to get a story escalates till one day he hears a message about a home invasion in a well-to-do area; he is minutes away and not only gets there before the police arrive but also before the criminals have left; he films the villains as they flee then enters the house and films the victims; three dead people. The footage in the house is aired but he holds back footage that shows the killers\u0085 he wants to make sure that he has their arrest on camera; preferably in a public place.This is a darkly comic film with a protagonist who is clearly a sociopath; he may not be as obviously psychotic as American Psycho's Patrick Bateman but he is clearly cut from the same cloth. Jake Gyllenhaal is on brilliant form as Bloom; he makes the character entirely believable in a world where violence dominates the news; not foreign wars but murder and accidents in affluent Los Angeles\u0085 it is made clear early on that poor, non-white victims barely count in this macabre ratings war. He is ably supported by Rene Russo who plays Nina, a character who is more than willing to sacrifice morals for ratings and Riz Ahmed, who plays Bloom's assistant Rick; the closest the film has to a moral character. While this isn't really an action film there are still exciting moments; most notably a really good car chase in the film's closing scenes as Bloom and Rick film the police chasing after the killers as high speed. Given the sort of footage Bloom is after it is of no surprise that there are some fairly gory moments as we see the aftermath of violent events. Overall I'd recommend this although I would point out that it certainly won't be for everybody thanks to its amoral protagonist and the subject matter.",

Look at every inspirational speaker, preacher, CEO, politician, car salesman, banker, insurer, and you'll find this personality. He's bored and brilliant which makes him dangerous. I would venture to say he exemplifies the last three generations of human beings striving in an overpopulated world to be noticed and awarded.

            "content": "\"If it bleeds, it leads.\" TV news adage There's plenty of blood to be filmed and sold to a TV station by enterprising photographers in Nightcrawlers. If they can get to the scene of the crime or accident earlier than other photojournalists, aka \"nightcrawlers,\" so much the better. Driven Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) learns how to get there early and how to sell the footage to a station.Nightcrawlers is an expert thriller about footage jockeys and the ethics of manipulating news. Lou bloom is inordinately ambitious, with prestige and money driving him further and further down the amoral rabbit hole. When he arrives early at a scene and moves the bloody body for better light, it's clear he's on his way to more and better crime as he ingratiates himself with TV news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) and becomes a part of her station's leading bloody news stories.What little I have experienced on the TV news set of a local station is accurately depicted: the fast pace, quick decisions (what to leave out, what to leave in), and the integrity of the news itself. No question Lou's footage is what the station needs to rise in the ratings, no question Nina needs to decide if she can pay his price, no question the ethical boundaries are uncertain. In all cases, the OCD Lou has figured the angles enough ahead of time to win the contract and evade the law. He already has answered his partner, Rick's (Riz Ahmed), question, \"Why aren't we at the rape in Vincent Park like everyone else?\" (See the opening quote). Probably not enough blood.The issue of ratings' influence hangs about this movie with decisions about buying and showing controversial footage always present at sweep times. Add the legal ramifications and it's quite a moral-ethical stew.When Lou says, \"I have to go home and do some accounting,\" he is rejecting an offer from a rival firm and confirming numbers and no people are his world. Although he can be a charmer, his vacant, unblinking stare and humorless speeches on business practices, learned from the Internet, are an early sign that he can be affectless and dangerous.Gyllenhaal gives the performance of a lifetime, and Nightcrawler is one of the year's best thrillers.",

            "content": "Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an out of work, eccentric young man trying to make it in LA. While he's clearly optimistic and driven, he just can't seem to find the right opportunity. He spends his time trying just about anything to make a buck. One night he randomly stumbles across an accident and notices the men filming it. With that, Lou is ushered into the world of late night crime journalism; also known as Nightcrawling. While his initial forays into the business are unsuccessful, he eventually gets a break when he meets Nina (Rene Russo), a well-seasoned TV newswoman who is always in the market for compelling footage. Every late night tragedy now becomes a new opportunity; and Lou doesn't hesitate to capitalize on them. But the more successful he becomes and the further he rises in the business, the more clear it is that Lou is more than a just a savvy business man.Gynlenhal is memorizing as Lou Bloom! Lou undergoes a kind of metamorphosis; at first he exudes the determination and drive you can't help but cheer for (and see a bit of yourself in). Then he slowly develops and learns to wield his intellect and cunning to his advantage. But eventually his zeal and tenacity become something else entirely. You don't really realize what's happened until it's obvious; Lou is a monster. And he's the kind of monster you don't see coming. It's brilliant work really and the effectiveness of Gynlenhal's performance is hard to deny. This is the best Gynlenhal performance I've ever seen! Russo is also excellent as the hardened, \"do whatever it takes to get the ratings\" Producer Nina. She's clearly underrated here as her vile, slimy character goes unnoticed for most of the film. It's not until near the end that you realize that she's really not that much different than Lou. There's a great scene where Nina is confronted by another member of the news team about airing footage that goes against virtually every rule of responsible journalism. Nina dismisses him in such a swift and ruthless manner it's amazing to watch; his reaction so succinctly captures the horror of it all and it's nothing short of brilliant. Russo's award worthy turn as this repulsive figure is what makes that scene one of the best of the year; she had to deliver a strong performance here to rival Jake's and she succeeds in doing so. For his directorial debut I don't think Gilory could've chosen a more fitting location than LA. The backdrop of the LA night only seems to heighten the horror of it all, the sliminess and the treachery. The city were so many go to extraordinary lengths to achieve fame and notoriety is the perfect breeding ground for this kind of business. The rags to riches element of Lou's rise kept me engaged as I always find those kinds of stories compelling, but the parallels to the current media were immediate. This film is a critique of the culture of our news media; which seems these days to focus more on entertainment, ratings and driving narrative, instead of providing information and educating viewers. Nina mirrors this precisely in her pursuit of a great story and it's chilling how clear the similarities are. Think about it? How often do you find yourself wandering why the news is covering celebrities as opposed to real news? Another element portrayed here is the TMZ effect in the media. To desire to get the salacious footage or the private phone call at any cost, with no consideration whatsoever for the people involved or how this will affect them. Lou stops at nothing to not only get the story first, but to create a particular narrative to feed into the viewer's already preconceived notions and fears. I found myself looking inward and asking is this the kind of behaviour we're rewarding when we watch the latest TMZ video? Is this what we're craving when we revel is the fall on a public figure because of a private conversation or their personal beliefs? The answer seems to be yes, and that's alarming. The fact is the news and entertainment media has fused together to become what I call edutainment. And we're the proverbial pigs that constantly feed at this trough. Nightcrawler is also very much about corporate greed. Lou does everything in his power to use, manipulate and discard an employee when necessary in is this film solely to keep the majority share of his enterprise; with no sincerity, remorse or consideration. When we watch these characters on film we cringe and believe they are horrible, despicable people. Yet in business, we call these people successful. Why is that? To answer this answer, I had to recall a documentary I watched a while back called The Corporation where they studied the behaviours of various corporations and attempted to equate their behaviour to that of a real person. And what kind of person did their research find most resembled a corporation? A psychopath. What The Corporation mused about in theory, Nightcrawler illustrates perfectly on screen. Gyllenhaal fully embodies the process of becoming a monster and it's chilling to watch unfold. So does Nightcrawler have a \"happy ending\"? If Lou were a corporation we'd say it's reached a new summit of success and would call it a successful, profitable company. Is this what it takes to succeed in today's world? It's unsettling to even consider, but I believe people like this are \"succeeding\" in life. They may very well be at the helm of many powerful companies and organizations. But these kinds of psychopaths won't bludgeon you to death with a knife, but with a smile while wearing an exquisitely tailored suit. And this is why Nightcrawer is one of the most important film you'll see this year. Blog: www.themoviesnob.caFacebook: www.facebook.com/TheMovieSnob247Twitter: @TheMovieSnob247",

Stumbling upon an accident he is introduced to the world of video news filming, opening his eyes to the money that can be made out of real life crime. Muscling his way onto the scene, it's not long before Louis blurs the line between the rights and wrongs of the occupation.We here have our eyes opened to the world of the nightcrawlers (genuine people), and it's a murky one. Gilroy enjoys multi genre blending, splicing bits of horror thriller conventions with satirical barbs pointed at the television based media. Bloom is a frightening character, a sociopath that easily manoeuvres his way around this shifty world, and Gyllenhaal superbly brings him to life. Gaunt (Gyllenhaal lost a lot of weight for the part) with hollow eyes, and spouting management monologues he has learned off of the internet, Bloom only see human misery as a way of making money. Not that TV station editor Nina Romina (Renee Russo) is that much of a better person, and the relationship between the two is troublesome yet dynamic thanks to the excellent script.The look of the picture needed to be atmospherically tight to the thematics at work, and thankfully that is the case. Predominantly set at night, it's all darkness and shadows that in turn are mixed with neon lighted cityscapes and dimmed lamplights. Bloom is at home here, the surroundings match his bents, he has found his calling to a side of the City of Angels which has a fascinating car crash kind of believability to it. The key to it all is that Gilroy and Gyllenhaal rope us viewers in to the point we can't look away, even as Bloom gets worse, morally bankrupt, we are right there with him looking trough his cameras.The relationship between Bloom and his sole employee, Rick (Riz Ahmed) is a little undernourished, but it's a minor complaint. For this is a sharp piece of film making, gloomy of course, but stylish with it, it's also thrilling and deliciously troubling into the bargain. 9/10",

            "content": "The dialogue in the movie was well written really well and the director did a fantastic job, but I have a few gripes and the story as a whole was missing a lot. First, how Lou just gets into this. He just shows up to a news station with video. Like \"here ya go\" oh OK thanks for the horror videos! What? Nobody questions him at all, then he is laughing it up with the people in the news network. This guy could be a psycho (he is) they don't know him from a ham sandwich. Second, he breaks a ton of laws. You cannot enter scene of a crime PERIOD, or tamper with evidence. Or how he films people in their last moments dying, aren't you legally supposed to help? There is a law for that. Yelled at the screen many times like \"oh come on\" Walking into somebody's house filming without their permission and taking video of family photos? Illegal. I can't remember the last movie in which I despised the main character so much. And 2 months in he is in a SRT dodge and paying his helper $35 a night... that's insulting. Then he threatens him with no consequences. Bill Paxton's character never shows up a again after a car accident. He shoved the camera in his face while he was being carried into an ambulance, i was hoping he would come and get revenge. Instead, we get no development but \"i bough new cars/vans better camera\" oh wow 2 hours to buy vans. NO BACK STORY on this creep, but he \"comes from the valley\" I wanted Karma to catch him, but unfortunately it didn't. The movie just ends... Jake could have and should have gotten an oscar nomination but, they probably looked at this and understood there was ZERO arch in this character whether it was done deliberately or not Iam not sure. The movie really suffered because of that IMHO. He doesn't flip out or come to a realization of what he is doing, just the same blank guy the ENTIRE FILM. This could have been an epic movie but we get no other story besides him trying to pressure an ageing news woman to sleep with him for employment advancement. That's all we get? 6 stars for the cold acting, shots of LA, and the dialogue written. -4 for unanswered questions, factual errors and a weird, rushed ending.",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect from Nightcrawler. Critics had raved about it but it was essentially shut out of the Academy Awards so I was going in without expecting much. What a terrific surprise. This is a gritty, dark and twisted thriller with twists and turns you don't expect and a story that literally keeps you on the edge of your seat just by storytelling and not by using special effects or even scenes of action. It is the definition of a thriller and certainly has undertones of social commentary about what is acceptable and what is \"news.\" The film is undeniably creepy. There is something off about our main character and its not the sort of story where you \"root\" for a hero but rather you're a witness to something strange that you can't turn away from. Maybe that's the brilliance of Nightcrawler. The entire film focuses on the old expression \"if it bleeds, it leads\" and how we are entranced by suffering and gore and we are sitting there watching this guy immerse himself in that world and we are once again transfixed by it. The more I think about this movie, the more impressed I am by it. Its another film from 2014 that I am catching up on that won't easily be forgotten. Its extremely intelligent and a must see thinker.Jake Gyllenhaal is one of Hollywood's best talents. He has proved himself time and time again. I think the roles that suit him best are ones with a lot of depth to the character. He seems to have this knack of making you intricately understand even a supporting character. You can't help but be mesmerized by his fast talking, manipulative, bizarre, eccentric and almost morally corrupt Lou Bloom. Its a fantastic job by him and he commands the lead. Rene Russo is the producer of a late news program who Gyllenhaal forms a strange sort of work relationship with. It has this sort of sick feel to it and they both have a desire to use anyone or any situation to get further ahead. Their brief mention of something more profession only adds to the eery quality of their relationship and the film. Riz Ahmed is Gyllenhaal's intern who is put into harm's way to further Lou Bloom's agenda. Ahmed is okay in the role but he could have done more with it and he sort of gets buried by the overpowering performance of Gyllenhaal. Bill Paxton has an unfortunately small role as a rival freelance reporter. He has a great role and the few scenes he has with Gyllenhaal are fantastic. Their dynamic could have been an entire film on its own and their last scene together is stomach turning.Writer and director Dan Gilroy is brand new to the scene for directing and he is off to an amazing start. I usually discourage writers directing their own work and usually a new director shows a lot of inexperience but Gilroy is a terrific exception. He has created this dark twisted world that if you're looking for a thriller that is far different than anything else out there, you will find this perfect. It is a water cooler film or perfect for a film club or class. I think this story has layers that can be examined and talked about but on the surface its just a very intelligent film. There is even a car chase of sorts in the movie that is just amazing because it comes out of nowhere and yet fits the film very well. Car chases are a dime a dozen in movies and most of them look the same but this one stands out. Nightcrawler is a unique and worthy film so definitely give it a shot! 8.5/10",

            "content": "Set in the nocturnal underbelly of contemporary Los Angeles, Nightcrawler tells the disturbing story of a career driven young man, Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) who find that shooting footage of accidents and crimes in Los Angeles to sell to news channels is big business. Aided by Nina (Rene Russo), a veteran TV news producer, Lou blurs the line between observer and participant to dangerous new heights. Directed and written by first time director, Dan Gilroy is indeed a character driven story, as Jake Gyllenhaal really pull, no stops when it comes to Lou Bloom. Note the subtly of Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. He speaks in an eerie monotone. He speaks like an evil business motivational speaker who acts like he's for your best interested, but in truth, he's manipulating the people around him to get his way. This part remind me of something out of 2000's American Psycho. The way, he tries hard to hide his alternate motive and his psychopathic ego from his co-workers with a hollow smile and articulate demeanor. You can tell that he's misanthrope, who could snap in any minute. I like how he asks so eagerly for a job. How his eyebrows jot up during his little speech, displaying that this has all been thought out well beforehand, like he has rehearsed what he would say. Then, how he tries to hide his disappointment to mask his pride when things don't go his way. It was very creepy. Gyllenhaal might have got too into the character, as he literally hurt himself, during filming. A good example of this is the mirror scene, where he end up cutting his hand. When, it comes to his extreme weight lost for the film, it's scary how sharped, his skinny gaunt body tone does makes him look ghoulish as if a man who hasn't sleep in years. Remind me of Gollum. It makes him look metaphoric and physical hungry to get anything, he wants. It's like watching a 'Car crash'. In a way, you don't want to root for the guy, but you can't help, watching how captivating and unnerving, he can be. Clearly, an award nomination is worthy, for sure for Jake Gyllenhaal. Even supporting characters like Rene Russo really stand out, despite her, not acting in many of movies, as of late. Plus, she pretty attractive at her mature age. If anything can be said, against the film is that it wasn't disturbing enough. The violence in the film is pretty tame and not that graphic, compare to other dark movie concepts like 1976's Taxi Driver. This movie serves more like a dark satire social commentary of how dark the media can be. It reminds me, so much of 2014 David Fincher's film, 'Gone Girl', on how much, the media can be both dishonesty and devious. It kinda makes real life news people like Kent Shocknek, Sharon Tay, and Pat Harvey look like lying jerks. While, the movie is mostly fiction, there are some true in how cut-throat the news business can be. Unlike it portray on film, I doubt in real life, a news station would be able to show a lot of graphic footage. Still, I can see a story being change, to push an adjective on somebody. There has been examples of that in the past of people acting like vulture, feeding on other people's misery. The film also touch upon, the unhappiness that comes with a troubled economy. While, Nightcrawler makes 'stringers' seem like they can make big money off of filming tragedy, in reality, there isn't much money to be earned. Yes, a stringer could bag several thousand dollars for the right footage, but most of the time, local news operations are really unwilling to open up their wallets for film footage when they can get it for free or find other multiply choices. The world has change, as a lot of people with digital media cameras are giving away footage for nothing, posting things on sites such as Youtube or Twitter. To make things worse, for stringers; Police encryption on scanners has also become an issue. Now, it's harder to listen in, to 911 dispatch calls. The movie serves more like a neo-noir fever dream of an L.A. than in real life. The movie might have some symbolism, after all, the movie title character is named Lou, as if he's basically named after Lucifer. Think of the story of Lucifer when you look into this film. How he fell from grace due to his over-demanding pride. How he tempted others through manipulation and a clever tongue. It's really no surprise, that Lou drives a bright red car through the shallow streets of Los Angeles at night. Could, Nightcrawler be a symbol for evil? Who Knows? The mystery of the film makes it all engaging. This movie is indeed a thought-provoking film. One thing, the movie could had done better is the soundtrack. If anything, this movie needed Trent Reznor. I don't mind, James Newton Howard, but the film score sounds too generic. The cinematography could had work a little more. I like how the opening shots, but as the movie moves on, Gilroy's vision of modern-day Los Angeles isn't quite as visually sophisticated. I was really hoping, it would be just as beautiful as night films set in L.A like 2004's Collateral and 2011's Drive. Another problem of the film is its pacing. I believe the bitter ending went a little too long, and end unrealistic. How on earth, did he not get in trouble for the car chase? The film really didn't really end in a height note. Overall: it's a very skin-crawling film. This movie knows full well that these types of stories sell best, and Lou is happy to accommodate. In the movie words, what grabs the audience is \"a woman running down the street, screaming, with her throat about to slit\". Indeed, it felt like that.",

His portrayal is layered, sharp and captivating, making the character come alive in a threatening and troubled way. We might question the ethical dilemmas that the character has but we cannot question the class of acting that is done to bring us a character who is narcissistic and sociopath, showing no remorse, emotions and regards for anyone but himself.-it's a well executed movie with a beautiful screenplay, beautiful in a sense that the writing is smooth, raw at times, real and gory, making it as real as it gets. The direction is praiseworthy and so does the entire team of the movie.\nWhat did not work:\n-maybe I would have wanted some scenes from the television set to be cut down if it was possible , not that they hindered the narrative but at times they were given some more importance. Again, it's considerable considering the nature of the movie.\nminor loopholes; I would have liked the movie more if a scene was added where he tries to exhibit his innocence in the shootout at the end of the movie. Maybe some scenes about what he does in the day time would be nice to understand him better.Final verdict: recommended",

Cinema has created another one of those memorably weird characters based on an utterly all consuming performance from the lead actor. For me the portrayal of this obsessive loner was chillingly believable on a Travis Bickle level. The supporting roles were all outstanding. The footage itself of the crime scenes and the driving scenes was fantastic to watch. You cannot help but notice the satirical critique of modern media and the collective thirst of viewers for macabre story lines. Lou Bloom operates in an underbelly of society as a nightcrawler. At first we admire his drive and fearlessness but this soon turns to disgust at the truly immoral and despicable lengths he is willing to go to get the results he wants. This is something I also find to be a critique of modern living - of the monsters that have been created in an unforgiving and detached society. A society where highly powerful corporations like the media can enable outcast, ruthless individuals to thrive in a dog eat dog environment. I did feel with the frantic pace of the movie and the increasingly risky behaviour of Lou Bloom that it was heading for a highly dramatic climax. In this respect I felt a little let down by the ending. This is something I was willing to overlook however as my resounding enthusiasm rests squarely on the shoulders of Gyllenhaal for a terrific and convincing psychological performance. So convincing that it serves as a chilling reminder - there are people like Lou Bloom out there.",

Bill Paxton was a bit odd, and whoever scripted the word \"brah\" made a serious error, but Gyllenhaal is unstoppable.And the film doubles as an action film (with impressive car chases and fire fights), or triples as a satire of the news industry... pointing out the well-known phrase \"it bleeds, it leads\" is even more true on television.

            "content": "Its an intriguing concept, and I love a good urban-night thriller (Collateral, Drive etc), but this was hugely disappointing. Here's what was wrong: - Rene Russo (as well as other actors) make it feel like a bargain basement DVD movie. I can't help but feel like she was shoe-horned into this by her husband, the writer/director. She seems just as ill-placed as she was in his other written movie, Two For The Money. The handling of her character felt awkward and unbelievable. A TV studio director being manipulated by this young, cocky loser? Its absolutely ridiculous, and it feels like Rene knows this whilst she's trying to act it out. - Jake Gyllenhaal tries his best but the character just isn't deep, nuanced or credible enough to be properly fleshed out. It all feels written, showy and trying to be clever - but annoying. The script aims for Norman Bates but comes across more like Macauley Culkin trying to buy a toothbrush in Home Alone. The character could have been played equally well (if not better) by Jared Leto, Michael Cera, or someone more up-and-coming. This is a step backward for Jake after Zodiac and Prisoners. - The story is hugely underdeveloped. Too much time is spent showing him discovering and getting into the job, as we need an \"origin\" story. Why? Did we need to see Gosling become a stunt driver in Drive, or Cruise become a hit-man in Collateral? Its really boring to watch, and by the time he's fully fledged and trying to sell his videos, there's little time left to do anything interesting. There's a home invasion/shooting scene he gets to before the police, which is supposed to be some big dramatic centrepiece - except it falls flat. It could have opened with that scene, then developed into the aftermath of it in far more interesting ways than it actually does. There's no actual story here - nothing to engage with properly. - The metaphors and subtexts about voyeurism, media responsibility, moral decline etc just feel heavy handed and redundant. - The soundtrack was dull and not memorable, which is unforgivable in a film like this. Its crying out for a decent atmospheric soundtrack, but we get this David Cronenberg-esque blandness that makes it feel like a misguided sequel to Crash. - Writing and direction are absolutely pedestrian - there is nothing memorable or remarkable about it at all. The writing in particular is flat and underdeveloped, especially with regards to character, story development and subtext. Its watchable in a late-night obscure eighties throwaway kind of way, but unengaging. It certainly doesn't deserve the hype that its marketing and buzz is creating - its a sheep in wolves clothing.",

            "review_title": "Nightcrawler is Gyllenhaal's starmaker performance",
            "content": "Dan Gilroy's Nightcrawler is a bit of an unusual film. First off, Gilroy has never directed a feature film, or anything else to my knowledge. His start came with screen writing. The only particularly worthy bit of writing Gilroy has the credit for would be an interesting 2006 film called The Fall. Other than that his screenplays have mostly been for box office fodder like Real Steel or more recently The Bourne Legacy. Yet out of nowhere Gilroy both writes and directs a small film called Nightcrawler with not only Jake Gyllenhaal but also veterans such as Rene Russo and Bill Paxton. I say small because this film only had a budget of $8-million. Believe it or not that is actually small compared to most movies you see at the theatre. Compared with the $125-million budget of Gilroy's previous screen writing venture The Bourne Legacy an $8-million film is an indie. However, what Nightcrawler lacks in budget it makes up for in heart and storytelling.Gyllenhaal is a tour-de-force in Nightcrawler. His character, Lou Bloom, is a wayward young man. The first time we see Lou it is in the early dark of night. He has a trunk full of stripper copper wire, and is in the process of cutting out a section of chain link fence. After decking a security guard, and stealing his watch, Lou visits a construction site where he proceeds to auction off the fence and wire. Right away the message is clear: Lou is a scavenger. Through mere coincidence he ends up witnessing a brutal car crash. As two police officers try rescuing the injured driver, Lou watches a guerilla television crew trying to get exclusive, gruesome footage of the accident. Lou asks a member of the crew (Paxton) if he could get a job, but is shooed away. On the morning news Lou sees the same footage he witnessed being taped the night before. This chance encounter leads to a new obsession Lou sets his sights on.Essentially the film is a look at our modern society. Gyllenhaal plays a seriously motivated and possibly very unstable young go-getter who only wants to find something at which he can be successful. I believe Gilroy is attempting to present a look at not only how the media is a cutthroat and vicious business, but how we as modern viewers are also demanding more and more of this extreme footage. No longer are news channels simply a NASDAQ scroll on the bottom of the screen while reporters talk about elections and local events. Today the news is almost like a horror film reel at times from images of war to school shootings. Lou Bloom represents the younger generations today, and how we widely hold the view that anything can be a career. Even in this case, where Lou risks his own safety and the safety of those around him to get even 60-seconds of footage to auction off for television networks. In a day and age where the grotesqueness of reality television dominates ratings it isn't hard to imagine there are already plenty of Lou Blooms already out there exploiting car crashes and victims of gun violence for money.Most reviews of Nightcrawler have been positive and I can't disagree: it is a cracking good film. Technology aside, it reminds me of a movie we could very well have seen in the 1960s. Gyllenhaal himself is worth the price of admission. He physically embodies the character of Lou; the way he walks and talks all frame him as a ghoul, out in the night to find dead bodies and other nasty business. It's really remarkable to see the young kid from Donnie Darko continually choose challenging, unique roles. Another thing I particularly liked about this film is the lack of a forced love story. Gilroy utilizes Rene Russo, playing a television a television network executive, here as a strong female character who is both complicated and flawed. He does not write her as a typical love interest so common in a lot of other mainstream films. Although there are a few sexually charged moments between Gyllenhaal and Russo, the film never falls prey to pushing anything in our faces, and stops very short; the plot never gets bogged down with unnecessary love scenes of any kind.I can't help giving this a full ten star recommendation. Though I often try to avoid nitpicking a film to death because it ruins the fun, I'm definitely capable of admitting when a movie is not the greatest. Even if it's one I personally enjoy. But there is nothing about Nightcrawler I can pick apart. It's a refreshing film with a tight script, beautiful camera-work, and a genuinely starmaker performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. Get out and see this. Now.",

What struck me was the role that Russo has.I am interested in films where the filmmaker \u2014 usually a man \u2014 is in love with his lead actress. Love bends film. Passion drives the creative process and spills into my experience. Here is a case where the filmmaker also wrote the part. And what a part! This is the rare film where the main character (Bloom) is less deep than his foil (Russo).Bloom reacts to and within his environment. His reactions are engaging for sure, but is Russo that envelops him and becomes the environment. He cannot resist. In the past, I have not been impressed by this actress, but here her husband/lover seems to have known precisely what she can do and built the character's behavior around those abilities. Superficially, she is not an attractive being. But look more closely at how she carries herself, even when challenged. Look how in the shared scenes the camera frames her face differently than his. This is built around her.In particular, there is a device called folding, the simplest example of which is a film within a film. Whoever controls the inner film (here an ongoing newscast) we also subconsciously understood to *control* the outer film. Whether Gilroy consciously knew this or not, I cannot say. But you can sense his mature passion in how this woman shapes his world.Another dynamic worth mentioning is something I call *exploitation irony.* A common use is in a film that is ostensibly against sexual exploitation; say it is about a father who learns that his daughter is an enslaved porn actress, is repelled and enlists us in an enterprise to save her. But then we have some sex scenes that are shot to appeal to the very same prurient attractions we superficially deplore. It is a good trick because it builds tension within us. Here we have that with our intended abhorrence for emphasized exposure to violent lowlifes. And then our engagement with the same behavior we are set to criticize. The effect is amplified because of this film-within dynamic and the on screen lover effect.",

Here he plays Lou Bloom, a fast-talking, self-help studying, ultra-charming sociopath, with creepy bug eyes (thanks to a 20-25 lb weight loss) and an even creepier grin. Mr Gyllenhaal nails the role in a way that reminds of Travis Bickle of Taxi Driver (Robert DeNiro was 33 at the time - the same age as Jake now).Three other movies came to mind while watching this: Network (the lack of a conscience approach to ratings), Drive (the stylistic camera work and loner lead character), and Body Double (a fascinating Brian DePalma film from years ago). Rene Russo is the veteran news woman who encourages and enables the Bloom character to use his \"good eye\" to pursue the money shots ... defined as anything that strikes fear into the suburban world.Gyllenhaal is all in for his role as Bloom. Nightcrawling is the label given to stringers (private cameramen) who compete for the video that will lead the newscasts. Bloom's google-based training has turned him into a Tony Robbins type who blows through dialogue at a speed every bit as fast as he drives his red Dodge Challenger to the next tragedy. Bloom is the epitome of charm in the wrong hands. Think Ted Bundy with a camera. While Bundy actually committed the murders, Bloom blurs the line between recorder of history and influencing the criminal action. He also delivers one of the first on screen 'chasing a car chase' scenes.This is Dan Gilroy's directorial debut, though he has written over films, including The Bourne Legacy, which was directed by his brother Tony. Dan also wrote my of my favorite rarely seen films entitled The Fall (2006). Dan Gilroy is married to Rene Russo, and her calm, yet equally sleazy, presence works well with the quirky, in-your-face Gyllenhaal character. Cinematographer Robert Elswit (known for his work with Paul Thomas Anderson) beautifully captures the nighttime energy of Los Angeles, as well as the brutal and savage crime scenes.Gyllenhaal is the real deal here, and somehow makes this frightening monster believable as a guy who could walk amongst us every day (or night). Early on in the film, his character is asking for a job and spouts off a line that includes a bit about being \"raised in the self-esteem movement so popular in schools\". It's our first glimpse of his psychosis which is also grounded in reality.",

When he observes veteran cameraman Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) who is first on the scene to shoot footage of a car wreck he decides to become a nightcrawler himself.Buying a police scanner and a camcorder, Bloom learns fast and soon hires Rick (Riz Ahmed) a homeless man in need of money to be his driver.Bloom and Rick quickly find footage of accidents and murders, Bloom even cynically manipulates crime scenes and television news producer Nina Romina (Rene Russo) laps the footage up with no questions asked.Gyllenhaal gives an intense performance as Bloom, a plausible personality but really a cynical liar to enrich himself. Ahmed matches him as the nervous Rick, the more humane one knowing he is being manipulated by Bloom.There is some wonderful night photography, the director Dan Gilroy delivers a cynical take on the news media but it really is a character piece than a movie. The storyline leading to the climax was hard to take and felt tagged on to give the film a conclusion.All that speeding about the streets of LA and no police are present are a big much to take as well as disturbing the crime scene and the police take no action.",

That incorporates all the best elements about Drive (2011), the color, cars, and thrilling intensity. This is one of the best thrillers of the decade a lot of hard-work and dedication by Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom paid off (he lost twenty pounds for the roll). With his future appearance as Mysterio it seems his past acting is even better. Riz Ahmed is great as always and Jake had some really great chemistry with him, Riz makes Rick a really relatable and believable character. You have to be patient with this movie as you work your way through a story of news dramatizing everything, only reporting on rich white neighborhoods etc. Our protagonists are freelance photographers and overtime Lou Bloom expands his business and rakes in profit. However his lack of care about others and the morals of his recordings makes this film heat up in the third act. This makes the long and interesting wait, trying to establish each of the movie's characters in the first and second acts worth it. Oh and I can't end without mentioning Rene Russo's performance as Nina Romina, the unethical news director, who's relationship with Lou Bloom plays a key part in this films greatness.",

In this picture, Jack Gyllenhall's character reminds me a little Kirk Douglas's one in Billy Wilder's ACE IN THE HOLE aka THE BIG CARNIVAL, where he played an ambitious reporter who stopped at nothing to get the best scoop possible, at any cost. And the most interesting in both movies is that at the start, those heroes seem very sympathetic, but as the films go on, the things, the events change rapidly when the audience find out that those reporters are chasing bloody scoops, pushing themselves to finally provoke them, such as in THE BODY SNATCHER, remade two decades later by THE FLESH AND THE FIENDS did, concerning no more reporters but undertakers of a special kind...It also reminded Sidney Lumet's NETWORK.

Hitting upon the idea of becoming a TV journalist he hires an unpaid assistant and a camcorder with the idea of selling footage to the local TV station This film written and directed by Dan Gilroy owes more than a bit to Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY . Now for some of us anyone who wants to emulate Martin Scorsese is okay in our book since he's the master of American cinema who has made some genuinely great films . Also Gilroy acknowledges he's not executing an original concept and there's a scene early in the film where Bloom changes his hairstyle which is no doubt semiotic code similar to what Travis Bickle does towards the end of TAXI DRIVER . I can also recognise that while on the surface being a TV journalist isn't necessarily someone who may become a folk hero but as someone who has spent far too much time on youtube laughing hysterically at episodes of TO CATCH A PREDATOR I've got to admit Chris Hansen had the best job in the world The difference between TAXI DRIVER and this movie is that while many men if they were honest they would confess to recognising an element of Travis Bickle in themselves or at the very least recognise the motives of Travis wanting to become a gun toting vigilante . Louis Bloom works less successfully as character recognition to the audience . Played by Jake Gyllenhaal as a wide eyed loon he's a little bit too creepy and weird to be entirely sympathetic as an anti-hero . He's also written as a little too broad . You can instantly see he's pursuing the all American dream but in doing so his pedantic speech mannerisms and his motives mirror all too much the problems of corporate capitalism . In short NIGHTCRAWLER is an interesting and engaging black comedy without being the great film Gilroy had hoped it might have been",

Every shot is perfectly done, the editing is sharp, the score nails the tone of the movie at every opportunity, and the film has just the right lighting to create an aura of creepiness that you still want to pursue.But it is the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal that makes Nightcrawler a discussion for the water-cooler. Just as Gilroy is reminiscent of Scorsese, Gyllenhaal is reminiscent of DeNiro's Travis Bickle. Gaunt and hungry, Lou Bloom is a full blown psychopath who the audience can appreciate (but certainly not understand!) just by watching the minute subtleties in Gyllenhaal's face. It is clear that Bloom has no idea how to interact with others, and self- teaches himself how to laugh and show emotion, when in reality he approaches humans in the same way that a fly batts at a window.Nightmarish and creepy, Nightcrawler combines a fine directorial performance from Dan Gilroy with one of the finest and most disturbing male performances of the year.

            "review_title": "Good Flick, but with Strange Multi-Layered Symbolism",
            "content": "The movie itself was pretty good. It had a nice pace and kept me interested the whole time.But what grabbed my attention more was the symbolism I interpreted from the movie...1. The Parasitic Media - The most obvious message/symbolism from this film is its portrayal of the media as nothing more than a parasitic entity. This is a sentiment I can agree with.2. Channel 666 - Most of the symbolism didn't really rear its head until late in the film. When Lou was talking to Nina (Rene Russo) in the studio, they were standing in front of TV's stacked in rows of 3, all showing the channel 6 logo,obviously \"666\" aka Mark of the Beast...This was meant to catch your attention, so that you might pickup on the rest of the underlying symbolism. It also served as a further indictment on media, symbolizing that the media itself is \"of the devil\" or evil.3. \"I think Lou's had a big influence on us all\" - When I heard Nina say this to the guy trying to warn her that she was letting Lou have too much influence on her, I somehow immediately understood the underlying message/symbolism... When she said \"Lou has had a big influence on us all\", this wasn't actually just a reference to the character \"Lou\", this was a veiled reference to Lucifer (aka Satan, aka the devil) having \"a big influence on us all\"...$. \"Lou\" represents Lucifer - Now i don't mean that Lou is literally supposed to be Lucifer in the movie, but he is following the archetype and displaying the devil's traits. He tricks people and makes them feel as though they are being forced to make a deal with him... Nina is willing to sacrifice anything and decides to allow herself to be controlled and manipulated by Lou the lunatic, symbolically, this is her selling her soul to Lucifer. Lou's partner Rick almost walked away from it, but sin got the better of him, and he too ended up making a deal with Lou, again this symbolizes him selling his soul to the devil... Rick thought that if he could demand enough in return, it might actually end up being a fair deal for him, but that devil is tricky, and the moment he no longer had a use for Rick, he led Rick right into his eternal death. In the beginning of the movie, Lou tries to negotiate employment from the scrap yard owner, but the scrap yard owner firmly rebuked him, calling him out as a thief... The scrap yard owner chose not to sell his soul to the devil...5. Rise of the Psychopath - It is actually quite common for those you might call \"psychopaths\" or \"sociopaths\" to attain positions of great power and influence... People who psychiatrists would label as psychopaths, are people who seek power by all means, and they have zero empathy or sympathy for others... Most people are not like this, a normal person has limits and boundaries, the \"psychopath and/or sociopath\" does not suffer these restrictions, and they take full advantage... It is a little known fact, that among those in the \"super-elite class\" it is common to find people that could be categorized as a psychopath, but others would say they're just plain evil, or bat-crap crazy... Anyhow, I believe that the director is also aware that it is quite common for people like Lou to work their way into positions of power. When the movie starts, Lou is a nobody, and by the end of the movie, this lunatic was well on his way to achieving his goal of owning a network. The message here is that places like Washington DC, Hollywood, and \"Wall St.\", are filled with \"nutjobs\" who have no sympathy or empathy for their fellow man, rather they seek to dominate and control their fellow man.7. FINAL - Symbolism Synopsis - So what does all this symbolism culminate into? What overall underlying message did the director want to transmit? I'm not 100% sure...What's with the 666/Lucifer symbolism? Would the director go to such great lengths to show the media as evil or corrupt? Was it necessary to bring Lucifer element into it, just to symbolically hammer home the most obvious message of the movie (that the media is evil)? That seems like overkill to me... I'm not really sure why he chose to use this Luciferian element... It certainly isn't an attempt at any kind of \"pro-christian\" message, nor does it in anyway culminate into an \"anti-christian\" message... What is he trying to say????What do we have to work with? 1. Lucifer Symbolism 2. Media is Evil 3. \"Mentally ill\" people rise to positions of powerThe only message I can see all this symbolism adding up to, is a message that the people with the most power are psychopathic satanists, who use all forms of media to manipulate and control us. I do NOT really endorse the notion that that was the underlying or hidden message in the movie... Some gigantic leaps must be made if one is to accept this interpretation... But as far as I can tell, it's either that, or the symbolism is ONLY meant to further illuminate the evils of the media, which also doesn't seem likely... And if the writer/director did intend for the symbolism to be interpreted along the lines of \"satanic lunatics control the world\", then why make it so veiled??? The symbolism is so subtle that anybody who is able to pickup on it, would have to already be knowledgeable on such subjects... Which would make trying to convey this underlying message to the masses pointless, because nobody is going to get it... Unless his intention was to be smug and rub your face in it, knowing you wont pickup on nor understand the underlying message.",

It would be easy to point the finger, and say that it's all on \"journalists\" who blindly follow \"if it bleeds, it leads\". But this goes beyond the surface, pointing out that, if viewers at home didn't tune in for this footage, then they would stop favouring it(even if they might not stop showing it all together). Perhaps we as human beings are to some extent drawn to grisly images, and that's something we need to own up to, and figure out how how to not let it go too far. This is a movie willing to be completely, terrifyingly honest about how far some will go to feed it. Some of the characters do take issue with this exploitation. This typically gets shut down by those who do not. Which is something that could very easily be preachy. But it doesn't get to be like that, due to the deft hand of first-time director Dan Gilroy. This is 1 hour and 49 minutes not counting the end credits, or 53 if you do include them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this also contains strong language.

And I even heard some reviewers claiming the main character to be someone you could root for. I will have to disagree, there is just about no character in this with any redeeming qualities. And that especially includes the main character. So the plot is about this guy who is psychologically disturbed and thinks he is smarter than everyone else. The guy has some mental issues, where he has poor interpersonal skills but thinks he knows exactly what to say to get what he wants. In another words, he is calculative, methodical and highly manipulative when it comes to getting what he wants. Even by doing things that are highly illegal. And you really get to see the darker side of this character when he feels desperate to reach his goal. Which can apply to a lot of people, but Jake Gyllenhaal really knows how to sell this character with his outstanding acting chops. As this really strange and weird character Louis Bloom who most audience could tell as the film progresses that their is something off about this guy. More than the direction of the movie which is about a Lois Bloom going around capturing accidents or harm to other people on camera in order to elevate his status with his naive partner. It's the character's sociopathic behavior and hidden agenda that drives this film in my opinion.

            "content": "Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) plays Louis Bloom, a desperate young man living in LA who is looking for work of any description. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts at gaining employment (one reason being that he is a known thief), Louis cruises the streets and stumbles across an accident on the freeway. His inquisitive nature leads him to ask questions to the camera crew about the industry that they're in and he then asks for a job which is quickly declined. Seeing a potential earner for himself, Louis equips himself with a camera and a police scanner and sets to work becoming a freelance reporter who sells his work to TV News Director Nina Romina (Rene Russo).Dark & Edgy - those are two words that first sprang to my mind when describing this film. Dark refers to the plot and Edgy refers to Gyllenhaal's character and the general narrative. In essence, it's actually quite a thin plot that sees Gyllenhaal and his apprentice Rick (Riz Ahmed) racing to various crime scenes in an attempt to cover the story before other news crews and law enforcement agencies attend the scene so that they have exclusive coverage. All these scenes are edgy and quite thrilling and there is also a bit of humour thrown in (notably when Rick causes Louis to overshoot a turn by 5 blocks because he was unable to follow the Sat Nav). The first half for me was much stronger than the second half; Gyllenhaal's character does suck you in right from the start; he's quirky, weird and a bit different, but it's a bit of a gimmick and it does start to wear thin. There were a couple of problems with this film; firstly I felt that the final act was a little too drawn out (although the exciting car chase does make up for this rather long final act). Considering, it's billed as a Thriller I wouldn't actually say it was consistently thrilling (although it certainly had many exciting moments).Ending on a positive note I thought Gyllenhaal was fantastic and I do believe he did a really good job at portraying a quirky and multi-layered character. The directing and editing were also superb and the whole film was very well put together. It's worth watching as it does offer the viewer something different, but I just didn't think it was a masterpiece or even close to being a masterpiece.",

            "content": "\"Compassion is the basis of morality.\" \u2015 Arthur SchopenhauerThat above quote, by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer is one that barely reflects on Nightcrawler; a film less so about sociopathic tendencies and more so about moral ambiguity; the film is an extreme example of one who is beyond a moral compass, and thrives off the pain of others. Another recent film which echoed, to a lesser degree, a number of the same thematic principles that Nightcrawler touches upon was Damian Chazelle's astounding picture Whiplash, which also addressed the human's desire to achieve and position themselves. Nightcrawler takes the characters, their motivations and their will and ups the ante by a hundred, giving us two 'protagonists' who test the viewer's boundaries on what they perceive as entertaining, and what they perceive as flat- out disturbing.The film centres around Lou (Jake Gyllenhaal); an incredibly diligent, hardworking man, who also happens to be a petty thief. After spotting a car wreck and investigating the damage, Lou spots two men shooting footage of the scene, and they inform him of their intent to sell it on to a news agency so that the agency can broadcast the images on television. Lou believes this a good way to make some money, and goes out, buys a camera and a police scanner, and begins to shoot crime scenes of his own, whilst forming a professional relationship with a news director (Rene Russo) who appreciates Lou's commitment, drive and work ethic.Nightcrawler is at once both an immediately horrifying film, but one that is hard to look away from, just like the scenes that Lou and his assistant Rick are shooting to sell off to news agencies. Despite our knowledge that what we're seeing goes against our own ingrained decency, we can't help but stare in awe of the vulgar and brutal sights before us. Director Dan Gilroy takes us into the shady and highly unpleasant Los Angeles underground, and takes us on an unsettling journey with a man who is obviously deranged, but highly likable. He is addictive. His monologues are gorgeous, rivaling that of Jordan Belfort's from last years brilliant The Wolf of Wall Street. He has a charisma that we don't often see from other characters on screen. Part of this is due to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, which is transformative, smart and entirely horrid (in the best way possible), and part of this is down the sensational writing, also provided by Gilroy, who provides a voice for this insane individual.To maintain a semblance of normality, Lou adopts a fake smile; a persona that carries through the entirety of the film. Even at his most raw, or at his most personal, Lou still maintains that carefree, homely, almost loving smile, inviting you to join him in his car as he does unspeakable deeds. Intervening in crime scenes before the cops arrive, or even planting his own information to provide a better story; there is no ground which Lou will not cover. It's at once astonishing and yet still riveting and entertaining; the viewer cannot help but stare in admiration for this character who is doing such things. But it's not these unspeakable deeds that harrow the most vividly; as aforementioned, it's the calculated and never-failing persona that he projects to everyone around him that unsettles us the most. The first scene of the film helps to establish the real Lou, who is a man who is willing to do anything, and this allows us to see him for who he really is as the movie plods on and somewhat, in its own way, tries to convince you that Lou is an OK guy. Which you may almost believe by the end of this adrenaline rush of a film.Despite Lou's obvious sociopathic nature, we still root for him as he rides around the streets of Los Angeles, intent on getting to a crime scene first and grabbing the best angles achievable. These scenes are exhilarating and heart-pumping primarily due to quick editing and fantastic cinematography, provided by John Gilroy and Robert Elswit respectively, who add drama and mayhem to this already fast-paced escapade. Their work is undoubtable. In terms of the cinematography, the film is absolutely outstanding; Elswit captures the gritty and dark nature of the urban Los Angeles, and embraces hand held. A vast majority of the shots seem utterly simplistic, but they add to the realism of the picture; positioned flat, focusing on the characters alone. There are few high or low angles, only when it serves a highly dramatic purpose, and so we are brought into this tale of deception, madness and drive with supposed simplicity.The score, by James Newton Howard further engrosses, reflecting the evil and darkness that actually lies within news journalism and television news broadcasting. As the morning news is turned on by Lou at the beginning of the picture, the chirpy main themes of the programs contrast with Howard's undercurrent of low ambiance and danger. It resembles something that we do not perceive the news to generally be, and it is immediately noticeable and riveting. As a contrast, when Lou is performing heinous acts, the music is heroic, almost applauding his efforts. That's what Nightcrawler is; a film which applauds strive and drive, despite its consequences. It's entertaining, oddly funny, brilliantly acted (Russo and Gyllenhaal providing career-defining performances) and directed with pace and furious intentions. The themes are vibrant and highly interesting. This is brilliant film-making, however morally ambiguous. I can not wait to return to the shady underlyings of this version of Los Angeles.",

            "review_title": "A Hannibal-like performance by Gyllenhaal",
            "content": "Jake Gyllenhaal carries the movie. That much is clear. His performance is chilling, yet charming. It is apathetic, yet humorous. It is disheartening, yet inspiring. He masterfully coerces the audience into falling victim to the charm of a character who is by all accounts unlikable. It reminded me somewhat of Anthony Hopkins' iconic performance as Hannibal Lecter. Relax. This was not quite the transcendent perfection that Hopkins displayed as Hannibal, but the characters had a similar effect.As the film opens, we find out just about everything that we need to know about Lou Bloom within the first five minutes. Lou is attempting to steal fencing and other metals to sell for scrap when he is caught by a security guard. The guard questions Lou, to which he retorts a number of lame lies. Upon spotting a sleek watch on the guard's wrist, Lou wrestles him to ground and flees with the watch and materials. He then attempts to sell the materials, negotiating skillfully and rattling off prices with expertise. After the sale is made, he attempts to finagle a job from the manager, who turns him down repeatedly. He then stumbles upon a graphic car accident, where he stares, sans any emotion. A man filming the scene informs Lou that he is a freelance nighttime news journalist (nightcrawler). From these opening events, we learned that Lou is sleazy, manipulative, ambitious, smart, and creepy.The remainder of the film serves only to provide further evidence to support our original impressions of Lou, and it makes a strong case. He is a fascinating character, one with many idiosyncrasies, the most prescient of which is his obsession with control. He seeks control constantly. He spends much of his time reading about tactics of management, conflict, negotiation, and communication. He is able to recite passages from readings with machine-like accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, Lou is very successful in his attempts to manipulate and control, and when something does not fit his rigid expectations, he does not like it. So he makes changes. These changes are often illegal, immoral, and creepy. He does not like people, mostly because they are undependable, and they ruin the control for which he thirsts.One person that he did like was a network station manager named Nina (Rene Russo). Initially, they get along well because he impresses her with his work as a nightcrawler. But then he inevitably tries to manipulate her while they are out at dinner. He makes a proposition that they begin a sexual relationship, which she firmly declines, making the scene awkward. The situation quickly turns droll when Lou seems oblivious to how uncomfortable he has just made Nina feel until she bluntly informs him. To alleviate the tension, he efficiently (his perspective) and rudely (everyone else's perspective) asks her to leave.Just as he did dinner with Nina, Lou often had a peculiar style for handling people. He operated very much like a robot that had been programmed through countless hours of reading articles online about controlling human situations. Thanks to his lightning-quick learning ability and his accompanying encyclopedic knowledge, he was able to recite textbook-style monologues and quips, which were darkly humorous, unnerving and charming if not intimidating all at once. This style of speaking contained brutal honesty and consistently succinct speech used for clarity, which were amusing given their perfectly machine-like efficiency and lack of any semblance of social acceptability. Lou operated negotiations and manipulations like a genius, but totally flopped at establishing personal relationships because he was so emotionally off putting. He clearly struggled to understand others' emotions, yet he anticipated the thoughts of others very well. A subtle and fascinating distinction.Lou's inability to understand the emotions of others is not at all surprising when we observe him constantly behave with complete apathy. He shows zero remorse for any of his sinister decisions, no matter how grave the outcomes. He manages to maintain a completely calm disposition throughout the entire film, aside from one scene that seemed out of place. In all other cases, Lou never lost his cool no matter how intense the circumstances were around him. The only emotions that he ever displayed seemed contrived, as if he was acting in that manner because he thought that people expected him to. Or perhaps it was all a part of his ever present manipulative tactics.In the film's final sequence, there are no redeeming moments for Lou or for any character. Lou never improves or worsens as a person during the movie. The events simply reveal in more detail exactly what a kind of person like Lou is capable of. Apparently in a chaotic nighttime atmosphere in L.A., people like Lou can do just about anything.",

            "content": "It's really amazing that 'Nightcrawler' is the first directing achievement of Dan Gilroy - whose record only includes a few scripts (one of the Bourne series movies among them). It's a real catchy, witty, brutal and realistic story about the thirst for sensations in the news and the monster it creates. It's also a very well written story (Gilroy authored it as well) with crisp and interesting characters which we keep discovering as long as they are alive on screen. The visuals also have quality - on one hand I have visited Los Angeles recently, so I could not only recognize the places but also feel the atmosphere, on the other hand much of the action happens at night and is news related, so the nervous camera moves with focus on blood and violence makes a lot of sense.The main character, Louis Bloom is unemployed. I suspect that the proximity with another more famous character L. Bloom is not coincidental, as like Joyce's Ulysses he is wondering at nights in a big city, looking however to more earthly matters of life. He is a smart unemployed who spends his time navigating the Internet in search of educational and motivational stuff that can push him out of the current status of small criminal, steeling metals and selling them by the pound. The only problem is that nobody wants to hire him, despite his verbal skills of self-promotion, and the reason is bluntly put to him by a potential employer: 'I am not hiring thieves'. There is however one industry that does not seem to have such scruples: it's the crime news industry. Local TV networks are ready to pay good in order to serve their customers (us!) the bloodiest news and the most graphical images at breakfast time. Bloom will soon learn the technicalities of the profession, and find inside himself enough resources not only to survive but also to become successful in it.The action takes place in Los Angeles, and we can even see the Hollywood sign at some point, but it's far from the typical Hollywood production. It actually has more of an indie atmosphere, and reminded me at some moments 'Drive' which was released three years ago. Same intensity, same fringe world. The difference is in the approach. There are no good guys in 'Nightcrawler', maybe the exception of Lou's assistant Rick (played by Riz Ahmed) who does not have much chance of survival in the world described by the film. The film takes also a sharp critical stand about the business, work and human (or should I say inhuman?) relation in the corporate world of America. The words we can hear day to day in the corporate environment sound so natural in the mouths of the criminals. Something must be wrong with the words or the way they are used.On a higher level however the film is not only about the industry and one specific character that makes his way in it. It is also about the audiences who create the demand for sensationalistic news soaked in blood. About us.Much of the quality of the film relies on Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Bloom. Gyllenhaal has in this movie the sparkle, darkness and craziness of the big roles. He may not get the Academy Award this year, but he is getting close to that level. Rene Russo also provides an excellent support as the hungry producer ready to accept almost anything and to bend almost any moral or legal rules in order to rise the rating of her news show.This was the first movie I have seen in 2015. I can only wish that the year in movies will be as good as this one.",

Nightcrawler is a decent movie. But there were some scenes - and sequences for that matter - that dragged, and Jake Gyllenhaal's character was creepy, unlikable and surprisingly underdeveloped.Arguably, what prevented me from giving this movie a generous 6 is that the movie culminated in an adrenaline-filled, high-octane chase sequence at the end. It got me quite giddy, and provoking this type of emotional response is more often than not indicative of a good thriller.It's such a shame that it ended so vaguely and the plot was a bit weak. For example, a great plot movement could have been if Gyllenhaal's character started MAKING the news and then filming it. That would have been more interesting.Anyway, this is my opinion. I went into this movie with high expectations, which is always dangerous, and I was disappointed. Nevertheless I'm glad I watched it, I've definitely seen worse.",

Nightcrawler follows a Los Angeleno with no conscious (redundant?), Jake Gyllenhaal, as he finds his professional calling as a \"stringer,\" someone who films accidents and violent crimes and then sells the footage to the morning news. Man, is Gyllenhaal a scumbag in this movie! One of the biggest sociopaths in film history, the film is mostly amusing because it's just a blast to watch this slimy bastard work. This is not only his best work, but probably the best lead performance from an actor I've seen so far this year. As he gets better at his job, he gets bolder and bolder and thinks nothing of manipulating crime scenes (if he can get away with it) to get the better shot, and even the better story. Rene Russo plays the news director he directly deals with. Kevin Rahm (of Mad Men fame) plays the only person at the station with any conscience, so of course he is completely ignored. Riz Ahmed is also excellent as Gyllenhaal's assistant and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 - kind of a goofy idiot, but it's fun to watch Jake bounce off of him. Any flaws are very, very minor, and I'd easily call this one of the great films of 2014, so far my second favorite (surpassing Gone Girl but not The Grand Budapest Hotel).",

            "content": "A bizarre young man, jobless in LA, drifts towards 'nightcrawling', chasing after true crime with a camera that he can sell footage of to news stations; there's lots of frantic driving through neon night in search of suffering, life where it's broken by dumb accident, fires, carwrecks, home invasion; along the way we have those evocative moods around LA, up and down canyons, that I love.But this isn't about the pursuit of truth in that suffering; he progressively intrudes upon reality, moves a body to where it will photograph against a LA horizon, rearranges life to yield a more horrifying truth until of course the sardonic conclusion. So it's not about confronting horrible reality out there; a murder of Latinos is worth nothing the man is told, it happens everyday, no one wants to hear. It's about using life as fiction, something people can talk about in the morning around the water-cooler.The satire is that doing even this ruthlessly enough lets you climb the ladder, buy the fancy car etc. Okay. So the first-time maker acquits himself well, the observation cuts at the modern void with regards to how we're swallowed up by images: \"news\" isn't news unless it spells out disaster. I'm with this so long as it shows a desensitized modern world drifting in the night towards images; but only their outer form. His footage (merely form, bloodied bodies) mirrors the protagonist's mind, a sociopath only concerned with the outer form life can take, about success. Suggesting meanwhile the broader malaise that makes viewers tune in; people are addicted to dwell in suffering, misery, apparent meaninglessness around us.I can never muster much excitement about satire though, not Network, not Firemen's Ball or Fight Club, so I leave that part to be enjoyed by others. I can like this only up to a point, up to when it expects of me to be appalled at being secretly titillated at how much the protagonist can get away with; the same carwreck fascination that is behind Fight Club (thankfully without the twist). Past that point I find it feeds the same void and lack of center, making me wonder if unfurling stylized swathes of LA night isn't much the same thing as moving that dead body to where it will photograph better.

Lou Bloom's psychotic, wide-eyed, single tracked ambition for success is materialised by Jake Gyllenhaal's visceral, cunning performance. Most of this review is going to be praising the performance of Jake, because he's an actor I do really love. He's a character actor ultimately, who still does have lead actor charisma and sex appeal, and his Lou is as natural as he is constructed. The weight loss is an obvious construct (an idea that supposedly was all Gyllenhaal's), as it makes him look like a ghoulish, haunting figure of the night that's looking for the next kill or something along those lines, but his charm (albeit superficial) grows across the film. His emotional journey is one where he implements himself into the business and establishes himself as a leader, doing something few others can and become his own boss, as well as portray a brutal rise that few films portray as well as this. I'd go as far as to say this is his greatest performance to date, and the fact he went without being nominated at the Oscars is an insult.Other things to say about the film is how much like LA it feels; its very flashy, very location heavy, very media-centric. Because Lou is written to have grown-up in LA, it makes sense that the film plays these themes out with Lou, and also his Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Rick, competition Joe Loder and 'love interest' Nina. The films themes come through because of the soundtrack which is very high-octane and based in the electrical sphere.Other positives to give this movie that I feel a great amount for is that this film, being a family affair, plays greatly to the strengths of Tony Gilroy as producer, John Gilroy as editor, and Nina Russo (Dan's wife) as actress; production and editing make this movie shine in the night, and the chase scene between the films \"bad guys\", the police and Video Production News is so tightly shot and edited, its almost amazing the movie cost the amount it did - you'd think it be at least twice as much as that. And Nina, played by Russo, grounds the film in a place where she is both authoritative but vulnerable to Lou as he forces himself on her - both in business and in sex - and how she makes decisions based on Lou's articulate, rapid analyses.Nightcrawler is a great independent film that shows off the city in ways that movies like Collateral, Midnight Cowboy, Training Day did, but this does whilst adding a commercialised, business-like message that sets it apart. Give it a watch, it's really worth it.",

            "content": "Seriously, Jake Gyllenhaal has become an acting powerhouse in recent years. He's always been a talented guy but he's really taken over the spotlight with some amazing work lately. For example, his work with Denis Villeneuve (especially ENEMY) was fantastic, if you haven't already checked it out. Now he's come along and blown away both of those with NIGHTCRAWLER, from writer/director Dan Gilroy. For what it's worth, I'm ranking this as my favorite movie from 2014. Robert Elswit's cinematography is gorgeous, the three key cast nail it, and the story puts the network news system on blast for shady practices. Gyllenhaal is Lou Bloom, a local Los Angeles loser whom we meet as he's stealing metal from constructions sites to see for scrap. When he stumbles across a late night accident on the freeway, he's amazed to find a freelance camera team breeze in, grab some footage, and gun out for the next piece of news carnage. Bloom buys a set of cameras, hires a desperate assistant, and starts his own team. His disregard for procedure and human decency allows him to get the real bloody footage that other news crews can't and he becomes a hit with a local network news outfit. As time progresses, Bloom's footage becomes more and more risqu\u00e9 and he develops a stranglehold on the station's desperation for ratings. Bloom means business and the lengths he'll go for hit news become frighteningly apparent, and he refuses to let anyone stand between him and his success.This is Gyllenhaal's show and Lou Bloom is his best character to date. Bloom is a full- blown psychopath. We're given a glimpse in the opening when he's caught stealing the scrap metal; when he realizes it's an independent security outfit and not a police officer, he has no problem going on the assault. He's a fast-talker and incredibly intelligent. It makes you wonder how a man of his skill was down on his luck to begin with (unless that whole psychopath thing has closed a lot of career opportunities to him). When it comes down to it, Bloom is a terrifying individual. He holds no value for human life and he only values personal success, frequently at the expense of others. From what we learn, he's perfectly suited for the job as a nightcrawler or stringer (freelance camera teams who roam the city in search of footage to sell to local news). He has no qualms with getting right into the middle of the action, forgoing good taste in exchange for video other crews can't, or won't, obtain. He becomes an instant hit with news manager Nina (Rene Russo). He's her ratings guarantee, a chance to rise to the top of the local competition. She's just as unscrupulous as Bloom and she's willing to go to\u0085well\u0085great lengths to retain their business partnership. Russo and Riz Ahmed (as Bloom's assistant Rick) are really the only other two main characters in the movie and they all deserve accolades for their work here.As much as NIGHTCRAWLER is the tale of one psycho's rise to the top of his game, it's also a commentary on local news and the lengths to which they'll go to keep people tuning in. Bloom is only able to become a success because fear sells. Murders, carjackings, fatal accidents\u0085this is what grabs the peoples' attention and the news outlets know this. Constructing faux crime sprees out of isolated incidents and flashing pixilated corpses on the screen is enough to terrify the populace and keep them tuning in for more. The local news, as portrayed in NIGHTCRAWLER (and most assuredly true to life), is just as shady as the 24-hour cable news networks and their fear-monger campaigns (as satirized in David Fincher's GONE GIRL, also in 2014). Bloom violates the law and human decency because it's what the audience wants to see, and his disgusting nature is rewarded. NIGHTCRAWLER is definitely a dark movie and it's seriously an awesome watch. It's a gritty rags-to-riches story where the one person who displays an ounce of morality, Rick, eventually caves to the lure of extra cash. The end of NIGHTCRAWLER is one that leaves you feeling a little morose because we expect justice, but instead it plays against our expectations as a reminder that, in the real world, the good guys don't always triumph. This is a 100% recommendation on my part; NIGHTCRAWLER is a fantastic.",

            "content": "Not as though we needed any more evidence, but if there was any doubt about the talents of Jake Gyllenhaal then let Nightcrawler be the final word in the statement that he is one of the most impressive actors working today, as his creation of Louis Bloom is a creation for the ages in screenwriter Dan Gilroy's impressive feature debut that has some harsh points to make about today's modern day media techniques and makes them with a modern day Travis Bickle like central figure.While the city of Los Angeles is impressively captured here, a night time lit city of crime and desperate figures, while James Newton Howard's subtle yet effective score plays out as proceedings grow ever darker and while Gilroy's smart direction and unique script takes shape there is nothing that compares to Bloom. A haunted eyed loner who wants nothing more than success, no matter the cost, is a vile yet undeniably watchable figure that prowls on anything or anyone as long as he can achieve his questionable goals. From the moment we first meet Bloom in a restricted zone at a city train track through to the tense and white knuckle finale, Bloom is the cold blooded beating heart of the film and his rise from wannabe crime videographer through to aspiring businessman is one that will keep you well and truly glued to your seat even if proceedings sometimes take a turn for the unbelievable a little to often. Gyllenhaal deserves plaudits for sinking completely into Bloom, from his gaunt physical appearance, his empty yet razor sharp eyes and his general characteristic tics, this really is a full bodied performance that makes Gilroy's film more than the sum of its parts.While everything is professionally done in a production sense, Nightcrawler's greatest weakness is strangely found within it's narrative arc. Bloom's rise up the ranks of the local TV station is worryingly quick, his dealings with Rene Russo's desperate news station head Nina doesn't always ring true, Bloom failing to be penalised for obvious crime scene breaches make you scratch your head and Bloom's rivalry with Bill Paxton's industry veteran Joe takes a far fetched and in the end underplayed turn that feels like it belongs to another movie. It's a shame that so many elements of Bloom's story feel to far flung from reality, as when Nightcrawler strikes a believable cord it's a striking indictment of the modern day media circus and an often hugely original big screen picture.While not all elements ring true in this impressive feature, Nightcrawler is a great debut by Dan Gilroy. There's yet another award calibre showcase performance by the increasingly great Gyllenhaal and the journey into the mind of a man so concerned with his goal no matter the obstacles that may hamper his cause is an entertaining one. Nightcrawler is a thriller of the highest order and a depraved tale set in the city of Angels that deserves to be seen.4 abnormal job interviews out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "'NIGHTCRAWLER': Five Stars (Out of Five)Indie thriller about a quirky sociopath who aggressively pursues a career in freelance crime journalism; video recording it and selling it to the highest bidding news station (also referred to as nightcrawling). The film features Jake Gyllenhaal in an award worthy performance, as the lead character, and also stars Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton. It was written and directed by debut feature film director Dan Gilroy and has received nothing but rave reviews from movie critics. While I found it to be very sickening, and extremely disturbing, I also think it's one of the best films this year. Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom; a thief as the movie opens, who makes a living selling stolen material from Los Angeles construction sites. He's determined to make something more of himself though and is inspired, by two 'nightcrawlers' one night, to go after a career in freelance video journalism. He specializes in violent accidents and murders, which specifically take place in wealthy neighborhoods, because that's what news stations will pay the most money for. He develops two odd relationships; with a naive assistant he hires (Ahmed), that's desperate to make some cash, and a career driven news director (Russo), that's past her prime. Bloom seems to lose any reasoning of what's right or wrong (if he had any to begin with) as he becomes more and more obsessed with making a name for himself. The film is quite possibly one of the best examinations of a sociopath ever put on screen; I would definitely compare it to other classics like 'TAXI DRIVER' and more recent hits like 'GONE GIRL'. The way Gyllenhaal's character (Louis Bloom) is so brilliantly calculated and disturbingly driven, in accomplishing his lofty goals, he's very similar to a character in 'GONE GIRL'; the two movies are also a lot alike in how they present all the darkest parts of society, and humanity, without showing much of the light or hope. Gyllenhaal's character also (eerily) seems to be driven by the same morals, and ambitious drive for success, that FOX News is always trying to promote on their network. This guy lives by the same exact moral code, and lack of ethics, that the popular conservative news channel is consistently trying to prove is necessary in achieving happiness and success in one's life. Their network is probably made up of hundreds of Louis Blooms, and Russo's news director character, as employees. Gyllenhaal is one of my favorite actors and this is arguably his best performance; Gilroy's directing and screenplay are masterful too. It's a movie I'll never forget and while it made me sick to my stomach (for awhile) after viewing it (and I found it hard to adjust to any kind of a happy mentality, for a great deal of time afterwards too), it's still a great film and shouldn't be missed. A movie this ugly and disturbing deserves nothing but compliments; for being able to do those things this well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/ON8Zn42-940",

            "content": "The most horrific aspect of this film \u2013 and it is terrifying \u2013 is the fact that the main thrust of the storyline is not too far from the truth. The media, its lack of morals and sympathy for victims of crime, is attacked on no uncertain terms through the career trajectory of Louis Bloom, a small time criminal who has aspirations of success. Also included within the story's framework is how the career options of someone from 'the wrong side of town' are only pursued with the aid of superhuman cruelty and lack of regard for others.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Bloom brilliantly, with piercingly wide-eyed intensity and a staccato delivery of lines of dialogue restricted to only the bare bones of the subject in hand, his intent and the likely outcome of his endeavours. Every conversation is presented as a last-minute business deal, like that of an eternal car salesman unable to switch off, but on a grand scale. Every intricately constructed audacity is accompanied by a wide smile, either of arrogance or warmth \u2013 either way, it is hugely disarming. Writer and Director Dan Gilroy has said that Lou exhibits all the traits of a sociopath, and is on the autism and Asperger's spectrum, although nothing is ever addressed or specified. Instead, it is deliberately left to the audience to work out reasons for his manic social behaviour.Employing the homeless Rick (Riz Ahmed), he hacks into police radio messages to gain access to crimes the moment they have happened \u2013 the bloodier the better \u2013 and films the results. Then he presents his footage to hard-nosed mogul, Nina, with whom he very logically points out he would like to have a relationship. She finds Lou's complete lack of humanity appealing, and the footage he provides ensures they both appear to have a successful partnership, career-wise \u2013 but utilising methods so heartless, even seen-it-all-before Detective Frontieri (Michael Hyatt) is appalled. But Lou's methods are so blatant and meticulous, she cannot do anything about him \u2013 he and his activities are, as it were, hiding in plain sight.When Nina eventually gives into Lou's 'charms', she accepts his employment opportunity and promotion almost as a sexual, spiritual thing, cementing not only his illustrious future, but hers as well, personally and (most importantly) as a business proposition. That the film ends with Lou and Nine thriving in their appalling way of providing news stories at the expense of anything approaching empathy, is telling indeed, and markedly close to the truth of such things.",

OK, sorry for the very Saturday night feverish intro in my film review of Writer- Director Dan Gilroy's \"Nightcrawler\". The movie stars the aforementioned Jake, as in Gyllenhaal, as the mentally disturbed and obsessed Louis Bloom. Louie Louie is unemployed and looking for work until he stumbles into a roadside accident and notices independent freelance videographers who shoot tape of nocturnal news events and sell them to the local television stations; otherwise known as nightcrawling. Bloom then blooms into a more disturbed individual when he runs with this concept and decides to become a nightcrawler himself. Gilroy shoots \"Nightcrawler\" with a subjective eye prioritizing on Bloom's narcissistic demeanor. Gyllenhaal does some of his finest work in his career as Bloom. Other eye-catching performances were derived from Rene Russo playing a sensationalistic-seeking TV news director, and Riz Ahmed playing Louis' gullible nightcrawling assistant. So slam your footage I mean foot to the pedal, and investigate \"Nightcrawler\". **** Good",

Upon reflection the movie's ending is better. Bloom thrives and is about to divide and multiply himself into infinity, like cancer cells.

            "content": "\"That's my job, that's what I do, I'd like to think if you're seeing me you're having the worst day of your life.\"Dan Gilroy's feature debut is not only an impressive and dark character study of a persistent and ambitious man, but it also is a social critique of our culture's obsession over bloody and graphic news stories. It would be easy for Gilroy to center his screenplay on the cheap criticism of today's TV news stations motto, \"If it bleeds, it leads,\" but it goes beyond that and makes us wonder why we as an audience eat up those news stories. There is a reason why the media feeds us these graphic stories and it is because we have this morbid fascination for these kind of stories. That is exactly what Jake Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo's characters represent in this amoral and dark film. It's not only a criticism towards criminal journalism, but a sharp critique on our society's fascination with graphic and bloody images. Robert Elswit captures this dark mood through his camera lense to give us a different and stylish view of Los Angeles than what we are used to seeing on film. Nightcrawler reminded me a lot of Scorsese's work in Taxi Driver. Jake Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom seems to be in some distant way related to De Niro's Travis Bickle. Both these characters are dark and psychotic, while at the same time having some sort of charm that attracts us to them. Bloom is a determined and ambitious young man who becomes fascinated with the possibilities in the journalistic world. He likes to drive around at night and is drawn to violence. Unlike Travis Bickle, he has no sympathy for anyone and simply wants to make a career out of his freelancing camera work. The more violence he can capture in his camera, the better opportunities he will have to succeed. There are no moral boundaries when it comes to his work and the transformation he goes through in the film is subtilely played by Gyllenhaal. Jake Gyllenhaal is at his best when he plays these sort of dark characters that move around at night (Prisoners, Zodiac, and Donnie Darko come to mind). Rene Russo also delivers an impressive performance and plays a huge role in Bloom's ascendence as a nightcrawler. The power shift between her character and Bloom is portrayed really well in this film. She seems to be in control of the relationship during their first encounters in the news station, but as Bloom rapidly ascends in the business he takes control of his own destiny. There is an interesting dynamic going on between these two characters and in the end they aren't too different from each other putting their careers before others. How these two actors were ignored by the Academy for their performances is beyond me, but this film wouldn't have worked as well as it did if it weren't for those two powerhouse performances. Bill Paxton and Riz Ahmed also give interesting supporting performance. Ahmed (who was also great in Four Lions) plays Rick, a personal assistant of Bloom who is easily manipulated by him, and Paxton is a night journalist who Bloom perceives as his competition. The cast in this film deliver solid roles, but it's Jake Gyllenhaal who carries the film with his impressive physical transformation. As big of a star as he is, he disappears and becomes this amoral man who will stop at nothing to get to the crime scene first. He gives a magnetic performance and as an audience you never know what to expect next from him. Kudos to Dan Gilroy on his feature debut for delivering such a wonderful thriller and having had the vision to cast Gyllenhaal for a role he was meant to play.",

Armed with a camcorder and police scanner he records violent events late at night in Los Angeles and sells the footage to a local television news station. Going to ever increasing lengths to capture car crashes, fires, murder and mayhem 'Lois' eventually films the aftermath of a violent home invasion, the resulting police investigation threatens to turn deadly.Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing in this; gaunt, brilliant, obsessed, slightly Rainman-ish and crazy. Even the way his character walks is unique. This was also a different story than I'd ever seen before which is so refreshing in this day of endless remakes, CGI fests and superhero movies. I was also impressed with Rene Russo as 'Nina' the news director who mentors Lois, welcoming his grisly crime photo footage as a chance to raise her station's ratings. Their relationships really shows Lois' rise to power. Bill Paxton has a small role as a fellow nightcrawler.Will watch this one again.",

It is fairly simple linear story bolstered by strong direction, a superior performance by Jake Gyllanthal, and great supporting acting from Rene Russo, Rick Garcia, and Bill Paxton. At the core, the writing for Gyllanthal slimy character is superb. It paints a pathetic, base, immoral, and mentally ill sociopath bent at nothing to gain money and power. We've seen these kinds of stories before where a character will stop at nothing to attain something he or she desires. Indeed the storyline is retrodden, but Gyllanthal and Director/Writer Gilroy have hit their marks so well, that the clich\u00e9 doesn't matter. Gyllanthals' ultra polite verbosity and rapid fire cadence are dead on and worth the watch. Renee Russo's news director's character is layered and sympathetic, Bill Paxon lends a newsy chipper demeanor as a competitor. The movie had solid camera work and music to add. It stretches believability sometimes but is nonetheless a great watch. 8/10",

Truth be told, no this isn't like infinity wars or mission impossible. This movie is not at all aiming to entertain very pleasently so one can enjoy their popcorn.This movie tells the story of a person I would consider to be a clinical psychopath that talks like he just read a book called \" how to build a company and be a winner\" and treats humans around him unspeakably bad to a degree where you feel pain seeing it.The reason this movie is so great is how we can see the plot of a movie through the eyes of the villain who also happens to be our protagonist. Jake Gyllenhaal is acting his best here. Probably his best performance so far. I would say that without him this movie might just have ended up as a mediocre film, a 5-6 / 10 but his insane performance makes this freakshow so thrilling that you can literally not distinguish between the actor and the finctional lunatic anymore.I don't wanna get too much into detail though. The ending of the movie is absolutely phenomenal and all in all it's almost flawless til then.The only reason I am struggling to give it 10/10 is that the part about him being sexually attracted to the elderly woman, which just completely disgusted me and I found it unecessary but maybe someone else finds especially this obscure part extremely good and therefore likes it even better.

Once you finish watching Nightcrawler you realize that it deserves each and every single accolade that it got.The story of Louis Bloom, a man with possible pyschopathic tendencies is shown to be genuinely trying to get a job or even a possible internship. But, after being turned down and labeled a thief, he witnesses an accident on a road being recorded by a couple of freelancers. This embeds in him the idea to record similar incidents on his own and sell it to a news channel for cash, which he most desperately requires. We get a look at how Louis, gradually blurs the line between being and observer and an actual participant. Money is no more his sole incentive. In addition to that he wants to be renowned for his videos. His pyschopathic tendencies can be seen when he threatens his assistant of how he does not like people or when it's very subtly revealed that he sabotaged his competitor's van and earns a reward by recording his story. And all this time he does not even flinch.After a long time , somebody in the industry thought of making a movie based on an untapped premise, despite it being rampant all over the globe. You still feel irritated when Louis is ramming his camcorder into the face of a witness or sneaks into an active crime of scene,but, you still can't help but be astounded by his absolute audacity. In the end, he seems to have rubbed on his influence onto others as well.Jake Gyllenhaal is the soul of the movie and delivers what is, undoubtedly his best performance till date,as Louis Bloom. Just when I thought he couldn't trump his performance in Prisoners, he pulls this rabbit out of the hat. Rene Russo, Bill Paxton and Riz Ahmed are also very good in their supporting roles. Dan Gilroy has done a splendid job behind the camera and especially with the writing and screenplay. He ensured that the movie did not tend to drop it's pace anywhere and maintained the tension and twists throughout.

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 stars\"Nightcrawler\" is a great film on Los Angeles, a great film on the media, a great semi-noir, and a darn good thriller, powered by a supremely creepy performance from Jake Gyllenhaal in what is perhaps the best work of his eclectic career. But fundamentally, it's also a film about the power of showmanship, and the danger of believing your own hype.Ambition is supposed to be a good thing, especially in this country. Pulling yourself up from your bootstraps, building something out of nothing, making a name for yourself \u2014 it's all part of the American dream. In the assured hands of Dan Gilroy, a longtime screenwriter (\"The Fall,\" \"The Bourne Legacy\") making his directing debut, that dream becomes a chilling nightmare. (Gilroy's brother, Tony, the director of \"Michael Clayton\" and \"The Bourne Legacy\", serves as producer here while Dan's twin, John Gilroy, is the editor.)Gyllenhaal's character, Lou Bloom, enjoys great financial success and dominance at the top of his chosen field, working as a freelance videographer who sells exclusive (and usually graphic) footage to an L.A. television station. Crashes and crime scenes are his bread and butter. He is driven. He is innovative. He is happy. He is also a monster \u2014 a fiend who preys on people at their weakest and worst moments. What's fascinating about Gilroy's approach to the character is that he doesn't judge him. He lets Lou do his thing and lets us gawk at the awesome lengths to which he'll go without an ounce of remorse or shame. You've got to hand it to Lou: He's really good at his job. Veering wildly between satire, psychological thrills, and moral drama, \"Nightcrawler\" attacks the seediness of contemporary TV journalism like network on steroids. Filmmaker Gilroy, makes every cinematic second count. If you blink you miss a tell-tale reaction shot, a vital visual plot clue, or a brilliant cut-in. For a first- time director, Gilroy demonstrates an uncommon assurance, not only in his audacious tonal shifts but in the stellar work he elicits from his cast and crew.The most attention-grabbing contribution comes from Jake Gyllenhaal. Now 33 years old, Gyllenhaal is the same age that De Niro was in Taxi Driver and, like him, he is learning to channel an eerie, inner charisma, offering it up in glimpses and glimmers rather than all at once. If one were to somehow merge the Scorsese-directed Robert De Niro characters Travis Bickle (of \"Taxi Driver\") and Rupert Pupkin (of \"The King of Comedy\"), the result, I imagine, would be someone very much like Lou Bloom. From Bickle, he would inherit the nocturnal restlessness and vehicular inclination; from Pupkin, the delusional self-regard and entrepreneurial ambition; and from both, the sense that behind those eyes, some strange, and perhaps dangerous, thoughts are beginning to percolate. Never one to shy away from the darkness of a character's soul, Gyllenhaal, is absolutely in his element. He anchors \"Nightcrawler\" with a gonzo, transformative performance. Long since, it has just been Christian Bale, who's been regarded as the dastardly endearing baddie, and true successor of De Niro and Nicholson-esque roles. Well, now, he finally has worthy company.You have to begin with the eyes. They've always been Gyllenhaal's most distinctive feature, but in \"Nightcrawler\" they're like parabolic antennae, wide and unblinking, attuned to any signal, however faint. As Bloom perfects his trade, he also perfects the art of improvisation, moving from observer to director of his grisly tableaux. Would the shot look better if the accident victim were repositioned more cleanly in the headlights' glare? If the murderous home invaders are not caught tonight, perhaps they can supply some additional footage tomorrow? Gyllenhaal also lost between 20 and 30 pounds for the movie\u2014another echo of Bale and young De Niro\u2014in an effort to physically substantiate the animal that he and director Gilroy say inspired Bloom's character: the coyote, feral native of LA, creeping down from the hills after dark. The effect is most visible in his face, in the sunken pools of his eye sockets and the rigidity of his jawline when he grins. Everything about him says \"hungry\". Gilroy's script is less interested in social commentary than in crafting a slippery character study, and Gyllenhaal is perfectly suited to that. Creepy, nasty, and at times darkly hilarious, \"Nightcrawler\" shows Gyllenhaal exactly where he seems to want to be, and having the time of his life while he's at it.Although far from subtle, the metaphor of man as corporation in \"Nightcrawler\" is skillfully hidden behind black comedy, intense scenes, tense suspense, and artful cinematography. It's a slinky black cat of a movie, commanding attention and reeling you in to follow down filthy, dangerous alleys. As much a character study as its a thriller, the film will get under your skin with its profile of a go-getter whose ambition and amorality know no bounds. \"Nightcrawler\" is a modern- noir portrait of the way we eat our news, but amid the media, it slowly turns its unblinking eye on something darker, and much closer to home. It presents a creepy world of urban blight with rawness as mesmerizing as it's threatening.Dark, funny, unsettling, restless, visually sleek, and powered by a lithe star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, \"Nightcrawler\" offers dark, thought-provoking thrills. It's indisputably one of the best thrillers ever made and offers a devil of a performance from its lead star.",

He's not trying to fit in or becoming the greatest. He just wants to fight to get somewhere.

When he gets some great footage of a murder as it's happening, he decides to mix his story with the murder story to get the perfect footage he could sell.It's not as complicated as I've wrote it to be. My favorite aspect of the movie is that it's about a cool loser in Los Angeles, living on the other side of the fence. He doesn't want to work a normal job, and instead takes up this weird hobby. The hobby ends up being pretty cool, and he becomes pretty successful at it. It gives people hope that one day they'll finally discover something that makes them who they are.Jake Gyllenhall does excellent in this movie. The lighting is perfect and eerie.

            "content": "Nightcrawler (2014): Dir: Dan Gilroy / Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed, Bill Paxton, Michael Hyatt: Slick crime thriller about seeking sinful thrills at the expense of others. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom who shows up at crime scenes and films extreme footage and then sells them to TV stations. Rene Russo plays Nina, the director of such a station struggling in the ratings. Bloom's footage calls to question journalistic integrity but she is inspired by his persistence and encourages him to continue. Central plot regards a shootout at a residence that Bloom arrives at. Hidden out of sight, he gains footage of the gunmen and then further shoots footage of the bodies and carnage inside the house. One issue this film crosses is the unlikeable persona of the lead character. Lou Bloom is a lowlife seeking success at any means possible despite how it affects others. Gyllenhaal plays this sleazy individual with wit and intelligence taking risks on the roads as well as verbally bypassing police questioning. Russo is at her best as a struggling station director caught in Bloom's web especially when he shows romantic interest. Riz Ahmed plays Bloom's assistant in need of cash and offers to film accidents but he becomes increasingly alarmed by Bloom's reckless disregard for others and his ability to undermine everyone working under him. Bill Paxton steals moments as a rival news team leader who makes Bloom an offer that is turned down. Other roles are not very broad whether it be criminals, station news team or police investigators. Director Dan Gilroy presents a well crafted thriller about the devious extent of thrill seekers. Score: 8 \u00bd / 10",

Jake's character Lou Bloom character is a the true definition of a psychopath in that he will stop at nothing and tread on anyone to achieve what he wants. You are never really given his background which would have been interesting. Lou is desperate for work, and stumbles on a job he feels he can be great at - it's a low job involving taking footage of tragic accidents/scenes just after they have happened. From there things spiral, although I don't think Lou sees this. This is a truly fascinating movie, and unusual. It certainly plays havoc with your morals as well. Jake does a wonderful job in the role. Highly recommended.",

It's a snob's movie.It's an interesting idea, but the main character is so despicable and so removed from being an empathetic character, you really just want to strangle him rather than understand.It's a simple idea, that goes against the norm. Why? Not because the story is that interesting, it's because the script requires it to. Let me give you an example... If I were to tell you that in every movie a man will start up his car, drive down the street and pull into work, my solution to making it mundane is to make the guy an assassin. The anticipation of his drive becomes different. Does it make it a little more interesting? Yes. Does it make it a good movie. No.What I do like were the supporting characters. It's frustratingly easy to play them mental case, as Jake G. does. It's a slow burn, but a constant one. He isn't right for this role. He's got a dull look. And losing weight to look gaunt doesn't improve the interior storm. He becomes a bargain basement Tobey Maguire when they needed someone that could balance the dark and funny. Gyllenhall is just too bland.To the movie though, there are just too many open ended moments. What really irritates me abut this, is that ratings are so high that a pedestrian movie watcher is going to feel really driven to watch it. Most should be warned, it's not typical \"entertainment.\" Most will be confused as to what they just watched. It's unfair for intellectuals to not realize that a guy from a factory coming home for a weekend is going to take your suggestions and think it's really great. It's not. It's so interior with its ideas most people outside of L.A. may be disappointed. It's the culture that doesn't exist outside of oddball self-involved jerks.",

The film immediately picture him committing minor thefts, but then he escalates quickly, becoming crazy and dangerous, when he discovers that he can make tons of money by filming real crime scenes, and building a career out of this. The more you watch him, the more you hate him.But this is not a movie just about a socially awkward sociopath, but also against the media manipulation, how news broadcast can twist facts and create a story from scratch, panicking people. In particular Nina, the KWLA director, has no morale at all and always pushes Louis one step forward, so she can obtain the latest scoop, to have bloodier and more graphic contents airing on the network. She just wants to save her career, and be the best on the field. These two are not only completely unprofessional, but also horrible human beings. The acting from Mr. Gyllenhaal is on point and managed to perfectly portray the descent into madness of the main character.The movie is very tense, and there a few scenes, especially in the middle and final sections, that kept me glued to the screen. The few action-packed sequences are very well directed and perfectly choregraphed. There are very explicit moments, but these are never all over the place, or unjustified. \"Nightcrawler\" is not scared to push boundaries and it takes quite a few risks, but it delivers. The result is an entertaining and intriguing movie that lasts two hours. It is not for everyone and if you are particularly sensitive to violence, this might be a hard one to watch, or even a pass. I highly recommend it and I wish that we can have more productions like this one.",

            "content": "As someone who has both worked in the local news media and on many low budget guerrilla film sets, I found this movie markedly funnier than most comedies. For the most part, it gets the universe pretty correctly in that the media is not concerned with the facts so much as it is in painting a narrative. In the movie, it's to promote an agenda that may come off as a little old fashioned by today's commonly seen sensibilities. The news director many times tells him to bring only stories that further their agenda so he adjusts and ignores a lot of real news to focus on what makes the most money.I've always sort-of liked Jake Gyllenhaal but this movie cemented him as the De Niro of our time. He's the best anti-hero since Travis Bickle as an ice-cold fake-smiling sociopath who finally finds his calling when he gets a stolen camera in his hands. Everything about the artificiality and unscrupulous nature of his character along with his gaunt, hungry appearance encapsulate the soullessness of the media. We never find out anything about his backstory so he remains something of an enigmatic specter, but at the same time very human. We have all encountered many personalities like him in the media and entertainment industry as it acts as a flame which draws in the lost soul moths who will do anything to feel important. I particularly loved his negotiating speech at the critical moment of the film where he rants for about 3 minutes straight about what he wants the studio to provide him without relenting or blinking. It's a spellbinding combination of acting and writing that reminds me of why I love cinema.On top of all that, I really love the look and tone to the film. It's set largely in the streets of LA at night reminiscent of such other one-word titles as DRIVE, COLLATERAL, and HEAT, but shot in a very clean, saturated style. There's no obvious attempts at comedy, but the biting satire and ways in which absurdity play a part of the proceedings make the film tremendously entertaining with what could be called subtle dark humor. It's a shame that the film ends when it does as I could have loved to watch another 2 hours of it. It leaves you hungry for a sequel though I'm sure it would never live up to the promise and tarnish this film's status as something of a minor miracle. Even the stuff that usually gets goofy in movies like this (changing and hiding the names of brands and editing software, etc.) never gets in the way of things here. I really wish there were more movies like this. This may be the best film of its (albeit, sad) decade, up there with SICARIO.",

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a mysterious, lonely oddball, who is trawling the streets of LA looking for a job. One night, he chances on a highway accident, and is struck by cameraman Joe (Bill Paxton) and his determination to be right at the scene for his local news channel. After obtaining his own equipment, he shoots some footage of his own, and brings it to the attention of station head Nina (Rene Russo), who comes to be impressed with his style. But as he becomes more deeply drawn to his new activity, he crosses more and more blurred lines and becomes desperate for the best.While most films are driven by an intriguing plot and a cohesive narrative of some kind, there are sometimes those that are motivated by a central performance, or as a character study of a certain individual. Intended as a satire of the twenty four hour news culture, and of the ruthless determination to succeed in that world, debut director Dan Gilroy, who at the age of fifty five at least has a lot of writing credits to his name, has given us in Nightcrawler Gyllenhaal's Bloom, a fictional character set against the backdrop of this modern world. Channeling a method style in the vein of Robert De Niro, he creates a character with a mysterious background, who has something smouldering beneath him that begs to be unravelled. He's a socially awkward and unaware man who doesn't come off as a normal person in any way, and at certain points, like when standing in front of a bathroom mirror, suddenly unleashes a roar of insanity.Although awkward, he is charismatic and hooks the viewer and the people around him in with this magnetic web. These people create some fine supporting characters, including Paxton's rival 'nightcrawler', who goes from being disinterested to frustratedly desperate to work with our anti-hero, as well as Brit Riz Ahmed, managing a fine American accent as Bloom's hungry but na\u00efve co-worker, and Russo's station controller, who proves only marginally less hungry for infamy as our lead boy. But above everyone else, this is destined to be one of Gyllenhaal's defining roles, in a film centred around him and driven by his character's mesmerizing personal quest. In the first film he's directed, much like the film itself, Gilroy coats the whole thing in more of an intriguing style and veneer than anything else, but it doesn't make it any less dynamic or original.It would have been nice for more layers of this edgy and mysterious character to have been revealed, especially since the film is so centred on him, but Gilroy has still achieved something quite funky and new. ****",

The movie just repeats the same events over and over. Even the ending was too predictable (at least for me). This is not a bad movie, but it's really nothing special.Oh, and putting Bill Paxton there is a weird choice.

Even in studying Bloom, we only see him in action; Gilroy doesn't spend any time showing the time Bloom puts in to prepare for being an independent filmer, it's all shown in his practiced knowledge of minor details and robotic explanations of successful companies. It works extremely well as a character study, as we clearly see Bloom's willingness to do anything to succeed and cold calculation with other people. It did feel a little too easy for him in many regards. His entrance into the industry was surprisingly smooth for someone with zero background experience, and his success with the news company seemed unlikely. His personal threats never came back to bite him, and he somehow never got caught despite his absurdly risky plays on crime scenes. I would imagine the police would be far more aggressive in investigating him than they were; both he and the news company didn't get nearly as much flack as they deserved. Nevertheless, Nightcrawler absolutely keeps you engrossed the entire time and is a fantastic character study of a sociopathic, aggressive main character played in one of the great recent acting performances from the man at the top of the game.",

It's not. This is an interesting look at the news business. FYI: The name nightcrawler refers to a person that spends his nights looking for things to film, such as crimes or murder, and sells the footage to a news station. Jake plays an out of work opportunist. He will steal things-it can be anything from copper wire to a bicycle-and then turn around and sell it. It's like he has no moral sense that what he is doing is wrong. He is without a real purpose in his life but he is a fast learner and a go-getter. One day, while driving home, he comes across a traffic accident and sees Bill filming the scene. Bill informs Jake that he can sell the footage to a TV station to make a living and Jake decides that he now has a new career. Jake starts researching everything he needs to know on his computer and then hires Riz as his assistant. They then spend their nights , driving around, looking for something to film. Rene plays the head of a news station that Jake sells his videos to. What Jake does to get news stories is what is interesting here because, as I mentioned earlier, Jake is not a good person and it makes you wonder how much of this movie could be true.

However, by showing it indirectly - as a news broadcast, or through a camera, it feels more real, and you feel guilty for watching it. The attraction of sex and violence.I am not American, and not used to American-style news, so for me this felt all a bit exaggerated (and it very well may be). The media situation portrayed in the movie is one spiraling downwards, and hopefully reality is not that bleak.In addition to the graphic content mentioned earlier, the movie is also interesting in what it does not show. There is talk of blood on a character's shirt, but it is never shown. The same with sexual encounters that are mentioned, but not shown. This fits well into the above mentioned theme of the movie.In the focus of this movie is interplay between desperation and moral depravity. Lou's character is not brave, his sense of moral is missing. Through him, the desperate (the two other main characters) try to solve their own problems. Doing this, allowing Lou to continue his work, corrupts them morally - but it helps solving their problems.My main objection I guess would be that it's hard to how Lou ended up where he is in the beginning of the movie. Some hints are dropped at how he spent his time, but he \"learns so quickly\" that it's hard to believe he would be at the point the movie opens on.",

They're literally trawling the night for news-worthy footage. That this 'needs' to be \"bloody\", as Bloom clarifies with Nina (Russo) at the news station is either an indictment on TV news stations/shows, or the public in general - or possibly a bit of both.Gyllenhaal is very captivating as the main star, being in basically every scene and using his huge eyes - and gross mini-ponytail - to creep you out. You don't hate him, but start to fully comprehend what a psychopath he is as the film progresses. Sure, he doesn't kill anyone himself, but he certainly does some despicable things and has no remorse and you start to truly despise him - which proves how good he's acting!Ahmed, Russo & Paxton are good in small, but significant roles.

Until he passes by a car accident where two guys are filming it. He is interested in this and finds they are giving this footage to the news. He then decides to take a job into shooting footage of major events going on in LA.Thats the basic plot anyway. Giving away the entire plot of the movie would be spoiling it. Now I'm going to tell you about the good stuff. First off, Jake Gyllenhaal as the main character. Honestly this is probably one of the best performances all year. Though there is one thing you should know. The character in this movie, he is a freaking lunatic. He is an incredibly insane character both mentally and to watch. He goes over the limit with what he will do to get the footage needed. Its also really interesting to see what he will do next.One other thing I liked about the movie was that it also talked about how the news industry is trying to get news that will make the general audience want to watch then actually reporting important news. The way they also portrayed it was also really clever.The final thing I really liked was the cinematography. The way they shot the city and the lighting really made the setting feel alive. It really gave the city a great atmosphere. It also helped create the best car chase scene of 2014. You want to know why? Because theirs no stupid shaky cam in it!This was also the director's (Dan Gilroy) first movie, and I feel it was an amazing debut and I hope he makes even more amazing movies in the futureFinal Rating: 9/10",

The fierce satire that \"Nightcrawler\" targets modern media coverage and the lack of morality in news ethics is far from misguided, but is sometimes maybe hammered in a little too well. Despite this, \"Nightcrawler\" is a film that neatly and effectively shows the morbid thirst of all the people involved. And is an extremely vibrant thriller that manages to offer an equal dose of night-black social satire.With an very fascinating character, Lou that is in the moral darkness in which he ends up and see how far he actually goes is an equally refined and entertaining experience. With his studied and psychopathic behaviour, almost manic appearance, an extremely unpleasant person is created, as the slender Gyllenhaal portrays with brilliance.",

            "content": "I find it truly amazing that Jake Gyllenhaal did not win nor was even nominated for an Oscar for this stunning performance as Louis Bloom. Makes me wonder how much of who gets nominated and who wins rides on insider politics and not on merit. Or how many Oscar noms and wins are \"gifts\" in the respect that either an actor has a catalog of wonderful performances and has never won (Henry Fonda comes to mind for \"On Golden Pond\")or the effort put into as role somehow makes it an Oscar winning performance (Leo DiCaprio in \"The Revenant\").Gyllenhaal becomes his character; a feral, single minded, means justify the end \"bottom feeder\" catering to the worst in humanity - our seemingly built in need to view others pain. He sees nothing at all wrong with what he does or how he goes about it. Easily he is most believable sociopath I have seen on film. In a performance marked by many stand out moments perhaps the most galvanizing one is not an action sequence but a quiet moment (before a storm) where he tells an employee that \"Maybe my problem isn't that I don't understand people, but that I don't like them.\"How his work was over looked for an Oscar is beyond what good acting warrants and indeed must fall within the machinery of Hollywood backroom politics. Going by IMDb, he was nominated for outstanding acting by just about every other award given in entertainment except the Academy. Maybe perhaps his Lou Bloom was too good and looking at this work, for Hollywood, was like looking into the darkest darkness; understanding the reflection they saw in it was themselves.",

            "content": "A sociopath like individual, who - though his behaviour is incredibly abnormal, has a certain code of conduct and a constant and unbiased logic that really provides him with strong credibility throughout the film, so much so that one has to keep reminding themselves not to like him, because he is the bad guy. Though Lou's logic really is quite admirable, it is not user-friendly and his execution of said logic is wrong, dishonest and criminal.Without taking the whole dissociative disorder route, Nightcrawler was able to somehow create a lead character who is both the protagonist and antagonist, who also was able to make you feel uncomfortable most times he was on screen, because of his unpredictable, though logical, but illicit nature.Nina, portrayed by Rene Russo, assists greatly in highlighting the protagonist in Lou, making her another aspect the viewer has to keep in mind, when straying away from disliking Lou, because he is an antagonist at his core, but still, somehow one keeps finding themselves hating to love him. I mean what he does to Joe is vicious, immoral and evil, yet still, you don't quite find yourself completely against him... Or maybe that's also because of how impressively well Jake Gyllenhaal knocks this character out the park.Ultimately though, what Lou ends up doing to Rick, even though Lou was doing what Lou does, which is calculating, weighing and using logic, finally gets one completely against him, like how it should be, given his depraved execution.Dan Gilroy and Jake Gyllenhaal deserve a round of applause with this one. The writing, direction and performance was exciting and gripping. Rene Russo was graceful and the supporting cast was compulsory. A title reminiscent of an incessant bug delivered by a performance which captures said image almost flawlessly, I give Nightcrawler a solid 9.2/10.",

Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal on one of his strongest roles to date) is one of the most unsettling characters in film today, a disjointed, borderline criminal looking for both an adrenaline rush and easy money. Bloom is undoubtedly what makes this movie, but there is far more to it than just well-written characters.The dynamic between Gyllenhaal and Rick (the role that brought Riz Ahmed to American audiences) shows how uneasy the atmosphere is, whilst the competition with rival cameraman Joe Loder (played by the late Bill Paxton) shows just how far some people are willing to go for money. The deeper the plot goes, the more Bloom treads the border of sanity and the law, making decisions that others would consider reprehensible. Nightcrawler is worth watching for the tension and the drama - but don't forget to appreciate the darkness of LA's criminal underbelly.",

Renee Russo is also good, but her role is very secondary.As the info sheet on the movie says, he becomes a roving cameraman, shooting crime scenes, and that's about all that happens. There are some scenes that show the lengths he will go to to make it, but that is about it. There is a purported moral lesson in the movie, which boils down to all the American viewer wants is blood and guts, not news. Not exactly the biggest revelation.So Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent, Renee Russo is good too, but barely in it.

For me this film was all about this character though there are excellent points made on the way the news media work, how people like quick fix horror stories than any news of real substance and Lou Bloom(Gyllenhaal) is only feeding this beast. This is set at night, through moral free glasses with a reprehensive obsessive character who the audience will look to see fall.

            "content": "Honestly, I can't remember a movie with Jake Gyllenhaal which I disliked. Every movie which features him seems to be entertaining and often memorable. From the days of Donnie Darko, to Enemy (the last one I saw) and now Nightcrawler. In this movie, Jake Gyllenhaal is a loner who just doesn't seem to be able to get a job despite all his efforts. One night, as he is probably driving home, he sees a camera crew filming a fatal car crash and quickly selling the footage to some news channel. Mesmerized by what he just witnessed, he goes to a pawn shop the next day where he buys a video camera and a police scanner to track incidents. From then on, he will be driving the streets of LA on a hunt for the most unique footage. What starts as a way to make money, quickly spirals into a crazy obsession for the protagonist. And that's exactly what the movie is about: the transformation of a man who goes from being a lost cause to a completely different beast the moment he finds something that gives his life some direction. Sadly, as it often happens in the real world, the new him will have no hesitation in crushing everything that comes his way to make it to the top. As a spectator, you rub your hands while trying to imagine how far he will go. But apart from the adventures of our protagonist, what I liked about the movie is how the director depicts the unknown world of media in a way that feels surrealistic but true. You can't help but wonder if the movie is in fact closer to reality than you'd like to think and the world of communications is as obscure as you are shown. This enigma still got me thinking about the movie two days after I actually watched it. That in itself is a clear sign I got what I paid for. I do not often say this, but I will definitely re- watch the movie at some point. Personally, I highly recommend it.",

Basically Louis Bloom (BAFTA nominated Jake Gyllenhaal) is a thief and hustler in Los Angeles, he makes a living selling stolen steel, bronze and copper - wire and fencing, anything he can get his hands on, he wants to make a change and is seeking a job, but no one will give him a chance. One day while driving home he witnesses a car crash and sees a freelance cameraman, also known as a \"stringer\", arriving to film the accident, inspired by this he steals a racing bicycle to trade it for a camcorder and a radio scanner, to listen to police frequencies. That night Bloom captures the aftermath of a carjacking, moving closer to the victim for a better shot he and a rival cameraman are kicked off the crime scene, but he manages to overhear about how to sell his footage to a news station. At the station Bloom meets local TV morning news director Nina Romina (BAFTA nominated Rene Russo), she agrees to buy the footage, she says it is good, she tells him the station is most interested in footage of violent incidents. Bloom driven by this advice plans to find more crashes, fires, murder and other mayhem to shoot, this is called \"nightcrawling\", he finds young man Rick (Four Lions' Riz Ahmed), who is desperate for money, he hires him as his assistant, to direct him to reported locations, but his rival Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), who has better equipment, beats him to several important stories. Bloom trying to get the best shots possible tampers with some crime scenes, even moving a body in one case, his work gains traction and he is able to buy better equipment. Bloom takes Nina to dinner, threatening to end his business with her unless she has sex with him, knowing her jobs depends on him supplying footage, Bloom also turns down a business offer from Loder. Nina explodes in anger when Bloom misses out on an important plane crash story, she demands better footage to keep up his end of the bargain, so Bloom sabotages Loder's van, causing it to crash and create severe injuries, including to Loder himself, and he arrives at the scene to film Loder as he is taken to hospital. One night while driving in affluent neighbourhood Bloom and Rick happen upon a home invasion, arriving before the police; Bloom records footage of the gunmen leaving in their SUV, then of the murdered victims in the house, he takes the footage to the station, there is fretting over the ethics of the footage, but Nina is eager to break the story, in exchange, Bloom wants a credit for his business, he calls Video Production News, and more money. The next day detectives question Bloom about his knowledge of the robbery, they ask him for his footage, he gives them an edited tape, withholding the footage identifying the gunmen or their vehicle, that night Bloom tells his plan to Rick, he plans to stake out the gunmen and follow them to a more affluent area. Rick is scared and demands half of the money he makes, threatening to tell police of Bloom's actions, Bloom agrees, but demands Rick to film a second angle, he refuses until Bloom threatens violence on him. The gunmen have stopped at a restaurant, Bloom calls the police to arrest the men, they arrive and within moments gunfire starts, one of the suspects is killed while the other escapes, the police chase and Bloom in his sporty Challenger SRT8 392 tails, with Rick recording. The gunman's SUV crashes, Bloom urges Rick to film the suspect, the gunman was not dead like Bloom claimed, merely wounded, he shoots Rick and tries to escape, he is shot by the police, Rick lies dying, Bloom films him and tells him he cannot work with anyone he does not trust. Nina is in awe of Bloom and expresses her devotion when shown his footage, the \"home invasion\" the news station discover was in fact a drug deal that went wrong, to make an impact Nina omits this information, the police try to confiscate the footage as evidence, but Nina defends her right to withhold it as property of the station. Bloom is interrogated by police Detective Fronteiri (Michael Hyatt), she is sure he is lying when he fabricates a story that the men in the SUV were following him, there is no evidence that can prove his is lying, in the end Bloom has hired a team of interns and vans to the expand Video Production News business. Also starring Kevin Rahm as Frank Kruse, Price Carson as Detective Lieberman, Ann Cusack as Linda and Kathleen York as Jackie. Gyllenhaal is superb as the cynical, smart, calculating and perhaps sociopathic thief turned video journalist, who will go to extremes to get the best footage of breaking news, Russo is also splendid as the TV station manager equally ruthless to get the ratings, this is a fascinating anti-hero character study and a modern morality tale, it is not just the horrific car crashes, homicides and shoot-outs that will shock you, it is the dark cut-throat corporate culture bringing it to life, a brilliantly entertaining neo-noir crime drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay. Very, very good!",

It's a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle... multilayered, deep, true.The cinematography and editing was for me on point as well, fast and slow cuts, amazing variety in pace and tone.

He lives out of stealing and then reselling copper wire, fencing and most anything else he can get his hands on. One day he witnesses an accident and while the medics helps the driver, some men show up and record the whole thing. He learns that they intend to sell the footage to a TV news program, he thinks he may have found something he would be good at. He steals a bike to afford an video camera and a police radio and is soon spending his nights racing to accidents and crime scenes. The film follows him on this journey and for each story he films he push the boundaries of legality and morality that little bit further, until he's trespassing, moving dead bodies, and even sabotaging rivals. Here you can see he's lack of empathy, he doesn't care victims at all. As long as he can get the best shot of them to earn him the most money. Straight up, Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing. It's his best performance to date maybe even in his career he's been putting up some great performances before (Donnie darko, Prisoners, Enemy etc). Just all the details he puts in as his creepy grin and weird finger pointing and how he almost never blinks. Lou is one of the least likable character you seen in a long time thanks to him. I do hope he gets Academy award for this one, something he deserved for a long time. What a directorial debut of Dan Gilroy. The directing was amazing, how each scene gave emotion. This is everything but a normal Hollywood film and constantly will surprise you (in a good way). The story is very well written and very original, the script is thrilling and intense, but funny at the same time. The humor is subtle and dark and everyone won't will get it. My theater had about 7-10 people. Only three people including me who laughed. Something a thought about was how good the cinematography is. The cinematographer really captured this mood of this underground LA with some amazing shots. So to round this of, this film was the best I seen in a long time. I rate it 9.5/10.",

There cannot be too many more convincing portrayals of psychopath/sociopaths out there. Incredibly intense, and very convincing. Good support from Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed, but it is really the Jake Gyllenhaal Show - he is in every scene. How he did not get a Best Actor Oscar nomination, I do not know.More broadly, how this movie got only one Oscar nomination (for Best Original Screenplay), I don't know.Only negative aspects of the movie is that it is a bit too neat, the way things pan out.

I went to see this movie with high expectations, some movie critics even called it \u0084the most complete movie of a year\" (whatever that means). And boyoboy, I was disappointed in the extreme. To be honest, the photography of the movie is captivating at times and the acting is OK, but the story itself is naive and hard to believe. Our \u0084hero\" is a sociopathic thief who is trying to find a career for himself. He went to some \u0084help yourself\" seminars and quotes motivational slogans half the time he speaks. He discovers the world of nightcrawlers, who film scenes of car accidents and crimes and sell the footage to the highest bidder. First of all, I can't believe that the TV-stations in the USA are ready to pay so much money for gore. I say so much money because our main-guy (I can't call him even a \u0084hero\") in a very short time buys some cool racing-car and listening equipment, which is probably worth tens of thousands of dollars. So, to make the long story short, he manages to record a crime in real time, hides some evidence from the police, finds the perpetrators of that crime by himself, and stages a confrontation between the bandits and the police in a place with the possible highest victims-count. Before that, he manages to remove (maybe kill?) his competition by sabotaging their van. He then records the bloodbath with the police, send his partner into death, records everything, gives the police some half-a..ed excuse and gets away with it. And of course he expands his filming business and live happily ever after. If you miss this movie, you won't regret it.",

It's a depressing and depressingly relevant commentary on the obsession our culture has with news of the most depraved variety and the bottom feeders who profit by it.The film brings to mind \"Taxi Driver,\" though the character created by Robert De Niro is actually the more terrifying of the two. Travis Bickle thinks he's bringing justice to the world through his violent actions. He's the avenging angel on a self-imposed mission. Gyllenhaal's character, on the other hand, has no illusions about himself or his motive, which is pure greed.I've never seen Gyllenhaal act as well as he does here, creating with his emaciated frame and raccoon eyes a nightmarish creature of the dark. Rene Russo (where's she been?) is also terrific as a news producer who becomes Gyllenhaal's primary customer.I had some problems with the ending. It gets a little too Hollywood for a film that avoids the clich\u00e9d trappings of typical studio product. But it wasn't disappointing enough to mar my overall reaction to the film.Grade: A",

            "content": "Unique and specific as this film is, it has strong echoes of a number of others. The character's warped ambition and unapologetic viciousness is reminiscent of Travis Bickle; his relentlessness and the efficiency of his violence of Gosling's character in \"Drive\"; his slightly robotic, homicidal clarity of Cruise's in \"Collateral\". Other echoes are more literary and will be less familiar to the standard film- goer. He is in many ways very close to the perfume- obsessed psychopath in \"Perfume\", S\u00fcskind's unique novel set in eighteenth century France; substitute video production for perfume and you have a similar cold purity of inhuman intent. As it happens, a movie WAS made in 2012 of Maupassant's novel \"Bel Ami\", an expert portrait of an amoral arriviste in nineteenth century Paris. For the rare person who knows the novel or film, a strong argument could be made that this is a stream-lined, modern retelling of that Machiavellian tale of how to advance in the media of one's time. Which, as shown in both works, is already amoral enough. One strong theme here is how readily the low-life outsider using unscrupulous methods readily finds allies in more established, \"reputable\" media. (The film is at its least subtle when we are told that crime really doesn't matter if it affects minorities and the underprivileged; the \"good\" stories are about their problems seeping into the lives of the more privileged). Here the film's resonances include \"Network\" and other works which satirize or dissect how far people are willing to go to get good ratings. (While I doubt Harvey Levin's arc was anything like this one, it would have been fun to watch his reactions to what is largely a portrayal of TMZ's style of journalism.) As for the acting, Gyllenhaal has been compelling since \"Donnie Darko\" and just gets more so, especially with his under- weight look here, drawing the bones out in his face. Russo readily makes you forget she was once one of the world's top models and shows a combination of predatory ambition and resigned awareness of being an older (and over-made-up) woman that adds a surprisingly erotic tone to scenes which on the surface are about anything but sex. (With one notable and fleetingly crude exception.) Riz Ahmed brings multiple unspoken layers to a deceptively simple character. Overall, a strong, pure and uncompromising film and, almost incidentally, a searing satire of today's media.",

Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic in this, easily outperforming Donnie Darko, all the other characters (the few that they are) are perfect support, the direction is good, the soundtrack appropriate. Everything, just great. But as I am prone to do, I rate highest the story, which is simple, but to the point, a perfect satire of the American dream.The main character is a textbook psychopath. He feels no remorse or empathy, has an above average intelligence and his only goal (as far as the movie goes) is to make money. We see him as a lowly thief at the beginning of the film, stealing and selling wire fence, but he quickly evolves as he finds his niche: nightcrawling, which is driving as fast as possible to 911 call locations and recording video to be sold to TV stations. In everything he does he uses and speaks corporate clich\u00e9s on how to improve your business and, if you ignore the ethical and moral, as he does, he does everything perfectly well and \"by the book\".The ending of the film disappointed many, but I think it was the perfect twisting it in. Can't say much about it without spoiling it, but for me it cemented the pure satirical purpose of the movie. Do watch it: great performances, slow rise of tension and a constant feeling of wrongness, like things are not really like that, up to the end, where you finally get it and feel disappointed not by the movie, but by the real world.",

He manages to up his first-class standard of acting and single-handedly carry this thrill ride of a film. \"Nightcrawler\" is one of those movies that comes out of nowhere and astonishes you, proving that Hollywood can still widely release great films. It's a game-changer, and an entertaining one at that.The film centers around Bloom, a driven young guy living in Los Angeles that never quite operates on everyone's level. Desperate for work and looking for something to occupy his time, he comes across the fast paced world of crime journalism. Quickly forcing his way into the business and filming anything the news stations will buy, he begins to tow the line between observer and participant, all for his own favor. The more dangerous it is to capture, the more money he receives. And as you can expect, things get out of hand (much to the pleasure of the audience).It moves at an insanely rapid pace from one incident to the next and is one of the most captivating films I've seen in a long time. I never stopped to check the time once, which certainly says something, and was mesmerized by the mannerisms and dialogue coming from this peculiar character.

Aiding him in his effort is Nina, a TV-news veteran.'Nightcrawler' follows a man's desperate journey to prove himself. He goes to extreme measures, to get out there. The protagonist, Lou Bloom, played by Gyllenhaal, first comes across as a sympathetic junkie who's a victim of a bleak America, but later comes across, as a manipulative & power-hunger animal. Its a sharp, but risky character, who grows on you & later haunts you.Dan Gilroy's Screenplay is dark, but exciting, as well. It also delivers some humor, which comes as a much-needed relief in the intense proceedings. Gilroy's Direction is pitch-black, complementing the film's mood, most accurately. Cinematography is grim. Editing is pretty crisp.And now of course, let's move on to Gyllenhaal. His embodiment here deserves some serious awards consideration. He's every bit of the freak he portrays, and for sure, he's the best choice for this part.A Special Mention for Rene Russo. Its so nice to see her in a substantial role after a long time. She's fabulous & shares an awkwardly interesting on-screen chemistry with Gyllenhaal.On the whole, 'Nightcrawler' packs a solid punch! Very Strongly Recommended!",

Jake Gyllenhall once again gives an Oscar worthy performance as a crime journalist who gets caught up in 'his business' and pushes the limits of what is morally right. I haven't seen all the performances so far but I cant see Gyllenhaal not getting nominated. It's not even him in the role, it's Louis Bloom. Not once do you even really think that it's Jake Gyllenhaal, and there aren't many actors who can do that.What's perhaps the most amazing thing about this film is that it's Dan Gilroy's directorial debut. Every shot and scene perfectly flows and the finale is stunning. This film truly kept me on the edge of my seat. The limits that Bloom goes in this film to protect his business and for financial benefit is insane. What's really scary is that he's not phased by the most ridiculous things that happen to him. I actually found myself rooting for this borderline psychopath throughout most of the movie. That's when you know a film is actually making your brain function. This movie is one of the most thought provoking movies I've seen in a long time. It's drawing comparisons to Drive, which is fair. But it's also less artistically driven and meant more as a brain twister. This film also has one of the most intense finales of any movie this year, that's great directing.Bloom basically becomes obsessed with his job and building himself as the top 'video news journalist' and it completely encompasses him. He starts taking things too far, as you may have thought. And really Bloom is basically the antagonist to his own protagonist. It's worth noting how much insight this film gives into this world and how people potentially get video on crime scenes. It's actually quite scary to think that real life people are doing things very similar to what Bloom does. I really cant recommend this film more. It's a great psychological thriller with a great lead performance. Expect this one to get a lot of buzz come February 22nd.+Gyllenhaal?

When he asks the owner of a junkyard for a job, we find out why he can't find employment--he cannot see himself from the viewpoint of others.

As the story plays out, we find that Lou has deeper problems, but he manages to create a job that he \"likes\" and he achieves some success.But \"Nightcrawler\" is really about the television news industry. With a nod to \"Network\", it forces the viewer to consider the possible consequences of sensationalism in news. The film's narrative also invokes comparisons with \"Blow-Up\" and \"The Conversation\", as Lou's desire to succeed takes him deeper into the news stories to the point of personal involvement.Renee Russo (wife of director Dan Gilroy) plays Nina, the news director of a local television station.

That is until he happens upon a car accident on the highway, stops to investigate, and bumps into a news crew filming it. He suddenly gets an epiphany - that's what he wants to do with his life; that's how he can earn himself a lot of money.The film then follows him as he embarks on this project, and each instance sees him push the boundaries of legality and morality that little bit further, until he's trespassing, moving bodies, and even sabotaging rivals. Louis is the extreme embodiment of today's paparazzi. He has no care for his subjects - just getting the best shot of them to earn him the most money. But there's more. He's egotistical, ambitious, manipulative, and curious. There isn't much he won't do in order to further his goals, including playing the people he surrounds himself with with threats and blackmailing.

I haven't seen him make a single mis-step in his career (even his English accent in Prince of Persia was better than most), and Nightcrawler is no exception. If anything it only makes him an even bigger force in the acting world. He carries the entire movie and absolutely makes the most of it. It cannot be understated how spot-on his portrayal of a sociopath is. From the trailers I thought he was going to be playing a Jordan Belfort type character, but in reality he plays Louis a lot closer to Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman (American Psycho); a genuine sociopath (by which I mean not the typical Hollywood sociopath/psychopath that plagues slasher flicks). In fact I would probably say Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom is a much closer representation of a sociopath than Bale's Patrick Bateman purely because Bateman is still a serial killer, whilst Louis never actually kills anyone (the majority of sociopaths aren't murderers).Visually, as I mentioned, Nightcrawler definitely mirrors Michael Mann's Collateral. It's the same city filmed in the same way so that it comes alive and becomes a character itself. Much like Collateral, Nightcrawler explores much of the city, showing the different neighbourhoods and different people that inhabit it. It also takes place almost entirely at night with the streets bathed in the orange glow of the streetlights.Nightcrawler is an entertaining character study of an unlikeable guy, which feels like such a rarity these days. The satire angle is also very welcome, even though it satirises a fairly unoriginal concept. I mean there's quite a lot of unoriginality on display in Nightcrawler. We've watched Collateral and we've gotten to know Patrick Bateman. The problem is the comparisons are so obvious. Despite all that it does put an original spin on it though (how many movies have you seen that follow a sociopathic news cameraman?), and what isn't original it arguably does better anyway, so for that I have to commend it. It's thrilling and tense, with a dash of witty humour here and there, and Gyllenhaal's performance is incredible. I give Nightcrawler a solid 8/10 and would certainly recommend it.",

            "content": "Maybe not totally what i expected. I expected something more abstract, less accessible. Not saying this in a bad way at all, but it definitely surprised me. I think it's one of the most purely entertaining films of the year, mostly because it does such a great job at setting up the main character. For those who've seen it, what did you think of them showing us that Lou is a murderer from the opening scene? I'm still not sure. It sets him up well, but maybe the lengths he goes to to get what he wants throughout the film would've made more impact had we never seen what he was capable of from the start? It would've made the fact that he's a psycho more unique to the situation he finds himself in as the film goes on? Either way, Gyllenhaal is absolutely amazing. He's sort of shown he was capable of this sort of thing in Donnie Darko, although obviously not to this extent. Here, he's mesmerizing, simultaneously terrifying and funny, that sort of feverish can't-look-away work only achieved very rarely in an actor's career. I've been a big fan of Jake for a while now even if I had never thought he was absolutely flat-out brilliant, he had just always been really great and dependable. Here, he gets a role that gives him more to work with and does wonders with it. The film is really great, completely relentless in its pacing with a really manic style, even if it's not afraid to linger in the moments that count. I had never seen Riz Ahmed before this, and he's a natural. He provides the film with so many awkward laughs along with Jake that really do highlight its satirical quality more, and both make such a great pair. If there's one complaint, it's that the film doesn't seem to know where to end. The final scene is great, but the few minutes before that sort of seem to wander aimlessly, only working as ways to show us how loose ends were tied up.I'd seen many comparisons to Drive, but outside of some beautiful LA shots, I think that this is more accessible and it relies a lot more on the script, as well as making its themes more obvious, whereas Drive was a film entirely dependent on its aesthetic and direction.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is a Schraderesque character study of a man far more dangerous than Travis Bickle. Like Bickle, Lou Bloom doesn't like people, however Taxi Driver saw Bickle feel compassion for at least one person, Lou seems to have contempt for absolutely everyone. Lou's interactions with other people have only one purpose - control. He is very opportunistic and has an unshakable confidence that isn't hindered by the human inconveniences of nervousness and guilt.Jake Gyllenhaal commands the long monologues of Dan Gilroy's script, stealing every scene he's in as the unnervingly brazen and enthusiastic Lou Bloom. Gyllenhaal lost 20 pounds for the role and it really worked, his gaunt face and glaring eyes do quite a lot of the acting for him. The performance carries the film and this will no doubt be recognised by the Academy next February.In the film's opening moments, Lou is a vagrant who is shown committing crimes both petty and, it's suggested, not very petty at all. He's in the desperate pursuit of a job, and when he meets someone who could be of benefit, Lou initiates his charm offensive and inundates them with a relentless barrage of articulate yet platitudinous language as if he's reciting the effusive CV of a quixotic student.Although his self-promotion is overbearing in the first few instances, Lou soon proves his skill in accruing large amounts of information and repeating it with the utmost conviction and credibility. Gyllenhaal must have relished delivering director Gilroy's excellent script; his manner of speech reminded me of Patrick Bateman's highly detailed monologues on everything from his morning routine to Huey Lewis and the News in Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho. Despite both men's articulacy, their diction feels recycled, and this is because it is - their cynical sociopathy means they cannot form true, sincere relationships, but they are able to counterfeit them through their adroit ability of learning and imitating the necessary behaviour.Quick wits and amorality are key skills for any successful paparazzo, so it is unsurprising that Lou Bloom thrives in the field. His first forays into professional prying are very funny. Inspired by a chance encounter with venerable camera man Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), Lou buys a rudimentary camcorder and scours the myriad streets of Los Angeles. Abruptly stopping next to the scene of a car accident and poking his camera right in people's faces. When he's challenged he proclaims with an uncommon doubtfulness -'I'm fairly certain I'm allowed to do this!' You soon see Bloom gain confidence as he pushes the boundaries further and further, making for tense and unpredictable viewing.His audacity proves successful, snatching footage that's nice and gory, impressing Nina Romina (Rene Russo), the blonde, brassy director of a local news channel. Despite an appearance and demeanour that suggests seasoned business acumen, Nina spends much of the film under the thumb of Lou.After proving his worth, enjoying his growing control over Nina and soon realising how vital he is in maintaining the news agency's spiking ratings, Lou proves that his manipulation can work, albeit it very unattractively, in courtship. Gilroy's best monologue occurs when, over dinner with a reluctant Nina, Lou blackmails her into establishing a longstanding sexual agreement, using a business-like vernacular bereft of anything remotely romantic, erotic or sexual.Like Gone Girl, Night Crawler is a satire of the yellow journalism peddled by television news, content that's perhaps interesting for the public but not in the public interest, a distinction that is gleefully ignored in favour of lucrative scare-mongering and countless other immoralities. As the majority of the characters are under this satirical gaze, I found it hard to care when they fell victim to Lou's vicious conniving, my apathy even extending to his long suffering accomplice Rick (Riz Ahmed), who is too darn wet and spineless to get that emotionally invested in. None of this, I hasten to add, is a significant detriment, if a detriment at all.The film is attractively shot by Robert Elswit, much of whose striking work can be found in the films of Paul Thomas Anderson including There Will Be Blood (2007), Punch Drunk Love (2002) and Boogie Nights (1997), the latter's sun-kissed, neon-lit aesthetic being most similar to Nightcrawler's. Elswit's work here is also likely to draw comparisons with Newton Thomas Sigel's photography in the beautifully slick Drive (2011).With a tense, unpredictable narrative that's laced with strong satire and anchored by a great character and great performance, Nightcrawler is one the best films of 2014.",

However, Jake rose to challenge by masterfully playing his character against-type, as a chillingly sociopathic, ruthlessly upwardly mobile wannabe video news stringer. (An appropriately applicable definition of Hollywood/L.A. is that it is \"The place where you become what you pretend to be.\")Jake reportedly lost nearly thirty pounds to play the gaunt, soulless, Mephistophelean petty criminal, Louis Bloom, who accidentally stumbles on an exciting way to earn instant cash from TV stations: by videotaping on-scene police activity and bloody accidents. Jake figures out early on that he needs a police radio call \"scanner\" to find the action. He later barges into a local TV station during night hours, and discovers a ready TV market in Rene Russo, playing a desperate, over-the-hill, graveyard-shift news director looking for gory, ratings-pumping news stories.Jake \"hires\" a naive rube for as assistant to cover the police calls and give him lightning driving directions t calls through the streets of L.A. The goal is to be first on the scene, get the video shot, then hotfoot the footage to the station for a hopefully exclusive airing on the news. Jake pays the assistant practically nothing, but salves him with ongoing promotional \"titles,\" such as Vice-President (of apparently nothing, as far as a real company is concerned). When the assistant wises up and demands a large share of the sale of a major news story, Jake schemes to eliminate his now-troublesome assistant by setting him up to become part of the news himself in an impromptu but lethal final assignment. Director Dan Gilroy's earthly, noir-like photography of the L.A. streets is shot almost totally at night. Gilroy captures the ever-present juxtaposition of the saccharine West L.A. affluence and the searingly dangerous underbelly of the L.A./Hollywood scene.Truly riveting, entertaining, and best of all, pic does not suffer from the typical \"Hollywood Ending\" that has ruined many films.

This leads to his fast rise into that world because he offers footage that goes farther than any one else's.So this is a great look at a man who is obviously dangerously indifferent to consequences. He's smart, and probably on the spectrum, the character showing a cool calculation in the face of emotional excess (blood and gore, for one thing). But his lack of boundaries is what makes him successful.But the movie ends up going farther, and this is what makes it start to seem like a \"great\" movie: it indicts the television studios who hunger for this kind of news, and who manipulate it to ratings advantage. And the indictment goes further, because it's the public eventually who craves to see it--that's what ratings measure.And so there is a weird inevitability to it all that makes none of unreasonable. And the fact that it's reasonable is further chilling. Add that Gyllenhaal is brilliant in this role and you have something special happening.This idea of a ruthless photojournalist clearly goes back to Weegee in late 1930s New York (there is a great video with him narrating his methods out there on Youtube). But the idea of arriving before the police, moving evidence, and filling the needs of the press and the public all start there, at least in someone who made himself famous doing so.Watch it.

Nightcrawler promises to be one such drama and it succeeds well in its promise.Talking about a cunning thief-turned-freelance journalist Lou (Jake Gyllenhaal), the story takes you inside one of the most daring professions and uptight businesses in the current world. Lou embarks on a journey to earn easy money out of his newfound passion which he also happens to be good at: crime scene shooting. His road to mastery as a freelancer could not have been shown in a better way: he self- studies and grasps things that he believes will be useful in that particular profession. Being manipulative and daring, he is an opportunist who scavenges for news stories as Gilroy's script gathers pace. He stops at nothing, and by the startling climax, it is evident that Lou has been transformed into an unscrupulous psychopath who will do anything to keep the meter running.The plot addresses the issue of how dangerous journalism can be, and forces us to think about the present codes of journalism followed around the world. In a fast-moving life, journalists do not care for lives, depicting a new world order. As a result, the film turns out to be engaging and sort of a real procedural from a journalistic eye.Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific and totally into the character throughout the movie. His eyes, physique, make-up - all work of pure genius - transcends his usual performing skills. Riz Ahmed, as the amateur sidekick, is very good. Rene Russo gives an enthralling performance. All are directed well and although, few scenes may seem like dragging, they culminate into excellent story arcs.A great score drives the whole drama and creates a thriller out of it. Seamless screenplay, some good photography, and a dark setup succeeds in bringing out a perfect package which entertains as well inspires us to think about the corrupted times we live in.BOTTOM LINE: There is no particular bad thing about Nightcrawler. It is definitely a modern masterpiece and the fact that it is being heavily snubbed in this year's bias kingly awards season backs it.

The film follows Lou Bloom (an emaciated Jake Gyllenhaal), an anti-social and driven man desperate for work who stumbles upon the world of \"nightcrawlers\" \u2013 freelance camera crews who film footages of car accidents, fires, shootings and all sorts of mayhem to sell to the local TV news. The lives of everyone around Lou is put in danger as he falls deeper into this rabbit hole of madness and immorality.What is captivating about Nightcrawler is that it does not judge its characters. The film tells a story that delves into the seedy and unnerving realms of the human psyche and it us up to the audience to ponder and reflect on what unfolds before them. Gilroy skilfully balances the dark comedy, thriller and satirical elements in the film, giving us a thematically-rich and suspenseful dive into the abyss that will surely stay with you long after the credits have rolled.There is an abundance of unsympathetic characters in the film, from Rene Russo's twisted TV producer to the fellow nightcrawlers Lou crosses paths with who will stop at nothing to exploit tragedy in hopes of making ends meet and surviving in a cutthroat society. The moral compass of the film is Riz Ahmed's Rick, a young man Lou recruits as an assistant who is unwillingly made an accomplice as a determined Lou commits one illegal act after another, trying to make his way up the top of the game. It's not just about being the first to reach the scene of the crime, it's about creating a story so shocking it would be impossible for people to turn away from.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a mesmerizing and disturbing career-best performance as one of the most memorable characters of the year. He is physically and mentally committed in embodying an eccentric and fascinating human unlike anything we've seen before. From his distinct mannerisms to his impeccable monologue deliveries, Gyllenhaal makes sure the audiences can't look away no matter how uncomfortable the situations become (a particular scene involving a broken mirror will surely be an image that will be seared into your memory). What's even more unsettling is that we see bits and pieces of ourselves in Lou. From the first frame, the film is given an eerie and ominous atmosphere, thanks to cinematographer Robert Elswit (Paul Thomas Anderson's frequent collaborator) and James Newton Howard's minimalistic but effective score.Part satirical view of media sensationalism, part success story, Nightcrawler is one of those rare films that is not only superbly entertaining, but sophisticated and thought-provoking in equal measure.",

If you think the film is a cautionary tale about the danger of disappearing ethical standards in journalism, think again. While it has the look and feel of a satire: exaggerated situations, overdrawn characters, and dark humor, it is, unfortunately, more of a reality show than a satire. Not only an indictment of the \"fear porn\" that dominates our news, it is also a character study of a sociopathic personality who reflects its dubious morality and of those whose viewing supports the ratings that keep it going.Set in Los Angeles, Bloom is a petty thief who makes a living stealing and selling scrap metal. When he comes upon an accident on the freeway, he watches as an injured woman is pulled from the wreckage of a flaming car while a news van arrives on the scene. The van belongs to cameraman Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) who is first on the scene to shoot footage of the accident. As a \"nightcrawler,\" his job is to provide film clips to be shown on the morning TV news show. Looking for a new career path, Lou decides that this is a job that he can also do. As his own self-evaluation proves, he is a fast learner. Learning to talk the language of corporate upspeak, outwardly he exhibits a smooth-talking sincerity, but can scarcely hide the hollowness of what lies underneath.Picking up a police scanner and camcorder, Bloom hires Rick (Riz Ahmed), an unemployed and homeless young man for $30 a night to help him navigate his Dodge Challenger through L.A.'s mean streets. Though Rick needs a job badly and is mostly loyal to his boss, he never really buys into Bloom's modus operandi and becomes the only voice of humanity in the film. Both Lou and Rick find plenty of blood and gore to satisfy Nina Romina (a terrific Rene Russo), however. She is the news director at a struggling Los Angeles TV station who is willing to pay good money, even for the most horrific footage. As Nina tells it, her preference is for violence that takes place in the white suburbs with a black man as the perpetrator.Her ideal footage is \"a screaming woman, running down the street with her throat cut.\" She is also not above manipulating the news for the sake of ratings. Captured by cinematographer, Robert Elswit, Nightcrawler takes us to accidents, fires, police shootouts, and a multiple murder. In his uncontrollable desire for profit, Bloom's activity veers more and more into legally and morally questionable territory, tampering with evidence, breaking into crime scenes before the police arrive, and more, even though his actions are uncharacteristically overlooked by the police.Nightcrawler is fast-paced, engaging entertainment that ranks as one of the best films of the year, yet it is mostly Jake Gyllenhaal's performance that keeps us riveted to the screen. Gyllenhaal disappears into his character in such a way that makes him truly scary. Unfortunately, however, in a society that elevates individuals without integrity into folk heroes, we admire people like Lou because he stands outside the system. Bloom teaches us that anyone can become successful regardless of their limitations if they provide a salable product without regard for its true value or for anyone that stands in their way. Without any scruples, like Frank Abagnale, Jr. in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can, he lifts criminality and moral blindness to the level of art.",

He was like a mix of Travis Bickle and Ted Bundy (two very different characters). Plus his usually unintentionally bizarre or hilarious (verbal) responses to many situations.. I was laughing as much as finding him morbidly fascinating. I predict some will become classic movie quotes. He thought he was handling everything perfectly! Yet clearly (to us) was seriously not normal, as his boss finally saw with his completely misjudged attempt to woo her. Gyllenhaal was mesmerising so you could see why some characters saw his confidence as a positive trait - but we the audience could tell he was seriously screwed up, but in a way that was so uncliched, and ultimately much more realistic - and therefore genuinely chilling. There *are* people like this. Everywhere.Also, cinematography: one of the best things about the movie. The 'teal and orange' trend in so many movies is driving me mad! It's so distracting and annoying once you begin to notice it. But this movie had a broad range of colours, used very carefully, throughout that were just perfect. People often think great cinematography has to be 'showy' - here it just made a great movie a visual masterpiece too.

They are both completely amoral, and by the end of this film you despise the both of them. Jake's Lou is an extremely quirky character who spouts strange pearls of wisdom throughout. Russo is just as vicious, and will do anything necessary to survive. Nightcrawler is one of the ten best movies of 2014.",

But Nightcrawler fascinated me from the very beginning: noirish style, sophisticated leading character, lots of irony and grinning at gutter press - to name a few - and all this presented in a distinct and versatile manner. And Gyllenhaal's performance (as Louis Bloom) is not worse than in Brokeback Mountain, perhaps even more consistent, as he is really the leading character in this move, there are hardly any scenes without his presence, and multiple scenes with only him on screen. The main supporting characters - performed by Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed, Bill Paxton - are rather brief and schematic, although they provide a solid complement to Bloom's actions and ideas. For me, there were several pleasant twists as well, and the \"large ending\" (=pre-ending) appeared to be a witty and unexpected solution, thus tensions and questions were open throughout the movie.So, a good movie, recommended to all who are eager to follow twisted things carried out by \"decent\" people in their modern struggle for fame and recognition.",

If you loved the \"quiet psychosis\" of Deniros' Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, well you're going to love what Gyllenhaal does with this performance.

As for the lead character, who on earth talks like that? Although his bizarrely precise stream-of-consciousness rambling was presumably supposed to come off as...something (quirky?), I never got the impression that Jake Gillinghall (or however you spell it) was doing anything other than trying to remember his lines from the script as he spoke. This got annoying fast and I didn't buy any of it.As for the plot, what could've been potentially thought provoking soon became monotonous and increasingly obvious as it went along. Why do so many films these days feel the need to repeatedly smash you over the head with the 'point' they're trying to prove? Subtlety is dead. Before long it all got sappy, and anodyne generic guitar-based backing music started playing over scenes for no reason.

It will be hard for you to take your eyes off of him. As the creepy Nightcrawler, he gives an amazingly controlled performance. Rene Russo and Riz Ahmad provide great support.

The film is chock-full of insights into how the media world works in the background --- for example, even \"news\" is not about news, but ratings, and bottom dogs may bend or trample the rules in order to gun their ratings. Gyllenhaal is so calculating in the role that he clearly crosses the line into psychopathy, so this is also an opportunity to gain insight into how an antisocial personality might accomplish his objectives while simultaneously pursuing a career path. I was most struck by how Gyllenhaal never once lapsed even slightly or momentarily from his \"reptilian\" character. While psychopaths can often be charming, Gyllenhaal's character is probably better described as smooth, quick, unflappable and calculating, as he uses intimidation much more readily than say, flattery or charm (which are also common tools in the psychopath's armamentarium). However, the film is much more than a character study of the psychopathic personality, as it also has much to say about the media business, and about human nature generally. Special credit to Rene Russo for matching Gyllenhaal beat by beat as he escalates into increasingly unsavoury tactics and behaviour.",

It was mesmerizing to watch writer/director Dan Gilroy's shocking portrayal of a psychopath calmly doing the very dangerous and criminal things that exited him no end but would leave a normal person senseless and useless. The story and format of the film has been discussed so I will concentrate on the very engrossing way the story told about Louis Bloom(Jake Gyllenhaal) and the very scary way he lived his new-found dream(nighcrawling TV sensationalist \"news\")and why he was so successful at it when we are all told that psychopathy is a severe mental disease with no cure and no hope of a normal life. In this film story it was so well shown to be the opposite in this story, as the psychopath Louis Bloom not only did well, he prospered greatly by living his crazy but carefully calculated life without the personal care, caution and integrity that most of of us try to live by. Nothing mattered to him but his work, and big success from it, as all people were mere pawns used for his game, even if it killed them. His all-engrossing intensity during \"the chase\" and accompanying car chase of each story was mesmerizing to watch. You will not forget Louis easily after seeing this film. Nightmares may result. Watch your neighbor carefully.The denouement suspense was without equal, the car chases were wonderfully shot in nighttime L.A., especially the last one that ended in tragedy(but not to Louis, of course, he loved it). And, the final, nearly sexual climax conversational interplay between Louis and the TV station news director, so well played by Rene Russo, gave us real insight into the distorted emotions and greed that drives these deranged types to want to show such gruesomely graphic and sensationalist stories as the lead-in stories for their \"newscasts\". Winning at any cost, of course, was their only goal. Nothing else mattered, certainly not truth, facts, obeying the law, or even human decency.The film was hard to watch at times, and it will leave you creeped out at the end but also entirely satisfied that you just saw a great and original film story with great acting.

He then goes to a pawn shop and trades his stolen ten-speed for a video camcorder and becomes a freelance news cameraman himself. This in turn leads him to a television news producer named \"Nina Romina\" (Rene Russo) who buys one of his clips and encourages him to continue in his new-found profession. He then becomes enamored with Nina and sets about becoming the best news photographer in Los Angeles in order to increase his wealth and to have her. Now rather than say anything more and risk ruining this film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very well-made movie which seeks to draw a moral line in the sand when it comes to how far a news camera crew is willing to go to get a shot on tape. Needless to say, Louis shows no hesitation in crossing it. At any rate, although there are some scenes which seem to be a bit slow the ending more than makes up for it and because of that I rate this movie as above average.",

There are really no good guys in this story, everyone is full of greed. That's is what makes it so brilliant. It works on all these levels.

Riz Ahmed plays his part well as the sidekick, who our main character plays off, by using Ahmed's character's insecurities and lack of opportunities for his own gain. Rene Russo also works well as the news editor, who has great chemistry with Gyllenhaal and slowly but surely we see she is just as bad as him in her desire to get what she wants. The thing that makes this movie stand out though is the juxtaposition of the music to what is going on. The music is used in such a way, that you would thing we're watching a coming of age story of a hero rising from the bottom, rather than what we see on screen.

Not all stories need to contain twists, but if this film was an onion, you'd get to see the heart section after only peeling a couple of layers. The characters are two-dimensional and the story unfolds somewhat predictably - even though it attempts to create a subtle atmosphere of mystique to make you think something unexpected is coming. For an almost two-hour long film, this feels very ponderous and stiff.It's the directorial debut for Dan Gilroy, and the lack of experience shows. The soundtrack is perfunctory and the cinematography... well, it's like an experienced influencer with a fancy camera in their hands. The camera work doesn't add on to our understanding of the ambience nor heighten the portrayal of the inner feelings of the characters. In fact, it often feels claustrophobic. The director is so eager to center us on one thing at a time sometimes we desperately need a breather from it. Think of a photo with a person in it, but photo after photo, he stands right at the center of it. Even worse, sometimes there are 'mistakes' - for example, a clean frontal view of something but other objects bleep in from the sides or people/faces are awkwardly cut off at the sides of the frame.It has a few nice shots of L.

            "content": "\"My motto is if you want to win the lottery you've got to make money to get a ticket.\" What a brilliant performance by Gyllenhaal in this rather morbid and exciting thriller. At times I was wondering whether it was meant to be amusing and jokingly or that it was intended to be presented as a serious and shocking story. Judging from my own chuckling at times and disbelief about what was being shown, I could only conclude that ultimately it was a mix of both. And it's masterly portrayed by Gyllenhaal, the chameleon of Hollywood and someone I do appreciate very much as an actor. After his appearance in \"Prisoners\" (which was an exceptionally exciting film) and the arty movie \"Enemy\" (as a story it was not my cup of tea, but in terms of performances it was again a success) just like Matthew McConaughey in \"Dallas Buyers Club\" he transformed physically into a gaunt, pale-looking good-for-nothing. Initially, he looks like a marginal person with a mental disability, but as you get to know him better, you come to the conclusion that he's extremely intellectual and has a kind of photographic memory. The way he quotes chunks of information that he has read on the Internet is pretty impressive. Louis Bloom is not exactly a simple figure but rather a cunning and manipulative character.The whole story starts with Lou in the process of cutting a fence. He's initially no more than an insignificant criminal who earns his money by stealing copper and the like. Until he witnesses an accident one night on one of the highways around Los Angeles and he sees a freelance reporter (Bill Paxton) capturing the whole thing on film and after wards selling it to the highest possible price so that it can be used for the morning news. Lou doesn't waste any time and purchases a simple camcorder and police scanner. Immediately an assistant (Riz Ahmed) is being contracted and he hits the streets every night to film police interventions. His unconstrained personality and unscrupulous approach, ensure that he can capture pretty sensational images, allowing him to conquer a permanent position at the local station KWLA6. Here it's Nina Romina (Rene Russo) who rules as news editor. The straightforward film style of Lou appeals to her. As a sensation channel the presented footages can't be bloody enough. As she clearly stated : \"The best and clearest way that I can phrase it for you, to capture the spirit of what we air, is think of our news cast as a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut\".As the title \"Nightcrawler\" partially reveals it, most of the scenes are made during the night in the city of Los Angeles. This provides some beautiful nighttime shots with Lou speeding around in his shabby car (which subsequently will be replaced by a flashy sports car) through the streets on his way to a variety of calamities he has overheard by using the scanner. He's a \"disaster tourist\" equipped with a camera. The film is an indictment against the growing sensationalism in contemporary reporting. The look and shocking effect takes precedence over content and objectivity. You can compare it with the bread and circuses in the Roman Empire. Lou is the personification of this somewhat repulsive attitude. On the one hand he's quite insane and frightening. On the other hand he's a real goal getter who misuses the Achilles heel of the media world in a shrewd way to benefit from. One man's loss in this case is Lou's gain.That the masterful rendition by Gyllenhaal, as the extremely manipulative and creepy Lou, takes on the lion's share of this exciting and simultaneously satirical film, is beyond dispute. But the supporting characters contributions are as important,convincing and certainly successful. First there is Riz Ahmed as the pitiful Rick, the assistant Lou has chosen in between, after a rather absurd interview. Rick is the prime example of someone who can use the money and who's offered the job because he has a smart phone with GPS function. He's overwhelmed by the silver-tongued Lou and him being a dogsbody after wards was also predictable. No wonder you instantly think he's likable. It was also a pleasant surprise to see Rene Russo acting again as Nina Romina, the unyielding editor without a conscience. I haven't seen her after \"Lethal Weapon 3\". The fact Dan Gilroy is her husband, probably made sure that the selection criteria were flexible. Yet this wasn't a bad interpretation and you witnessed the way Lou gradually took control over this seemingly fragile little personality.It was clear how it would end eventually. Although there was a choice between two possible denouements (two logical endings that arose to me spontaneously), the end was still intense and surprising. A disgusting example of self-centeredness and self-preservation. An example of which way our society is going and how people disregard ethics. The moral of the story is that there is a lack of morality in the media landscape and society today. Does this sound pretty cynical, nasty or downright morbid to you ? I'd suggest to take a look at yourself in an honest way and think whether or not you would slow down when passing a traffic accident in order to catch a glimpse of a victim? Or you'd return home quickly to zap to a news channel just because you have heard a disaster happened somewhere ? You come to the conclusion after wards that we are all a little bit like Lou.

The beautiful cinematography , the fantastic writing , the superb acting by all, the gripping story and the outstanding climax all awed me.I would say Lou Bloom is one of the most complex characters in movie history. He's resolute, diligent and smart but at the same time he has no respect or care for the concept of morality, ethics and others lives in general. He's the incarnation of the word sociopath. He manipulates others, lies and deceives and does whatever is needed to get what he wants no matter the detriment he inflicts upon others. The last scene where he instigates chaos just so that he can film it and make some cash is a shocking and satisfactory ending I've seen in a while.Impressive performance by Jake Gyllenhaal esp on the scenes when he is lying and manipulating others with a straight face and a charming smile. His skinny and gaunt look also helped him morph into his conniving character more. Not to forget his supporting characters Riz Ahmed and Rene Russo who nail their roles perfectly.It's message was also delivered well showing how the media, we are the supposed to trust, manipulates us by spreading fear porn to keep us addicted to their deceptive and misleading narrations.

The eponymous nightcrawler drives around Los Angeles at night listening in to police communications, waiting for a car smash up or even a murder, and racing to get to the scene before the cops and other nightcrawlers to obtain graphic images on a camcorder that can be sold to a TV news channel desperate for ratings. Lou Bloom is a newcomer to the role but learns quick and knows no physical or moral limitations. The role is totally inhabited by Jake Gyllenhaal in a brilliant performance in which he has slimmed down his body, slicked back his long hair, and adopted a speaking style that is invariably calm yet robotic and utterly chilling. And it's good to see 60 year old Rene Russo (the director's wife) back with a decent role as an avaricious, yet vulnerable, television editor. Great credit goes to screenwriter turned director Dan Gilroy who has crafted a sharp script and an almost documentary-style debut direction that draws in the viewer remorselessly with never a weak scene in a story that simply races along. The gritty urban landscape and thumping soundtrack add to the atmospherics. This is a biting satire both of \"if it bleeds it leads\" television news and of senseless and insensitive management speak that hits the mark time and time again in a narrative that would be funny if it was not so callous and cruel.",

            "content": "Lou is a determined and driven man looking for work. He talks smart, learns fast, and at everything, he's willing to do almost anything. One night he stumbles upon Joe Loder's crew of nightcrawlers, amateur news crew who rush to crime or accident scenes to get footage to sell to TV Stations. He immediately buys a camera and a police scanner and goes on hunting for footage. Lou doesn't hesitate to involve himself in the scene, breaking into homes and rearranging things if he feels the need arises. Soon he's able to pay an assistant Rick to read him directions so he can arrive faster than other crews, though Rick fumbles bad at his first time. Lous sells his footage to Nina from Channel 6. Even though her colleagues reject Lou'd work for looking like he barges in to homes uninvited , Nina still uses them. Some while later, Lou asks Nina on a date. She declines the offer, but eventually agrees to it as Lou threatens to stop selling her the footage if she declines. Loder meets Lou and offers him a position under him. Lou firmly rejects it. At the date, Lou tells Nina he wants to be more than professional acquaintances, to which Nina again refuses. But Lou reminds her that her Channel is the lowest rated in town, so she needs him as he wants her. Lou and Rick are beaten by Loder's crew at an incident, making Nina rejects Lou's footage on it. The angry Lou goes and tampers the brakes on Loder's van. Later, Loder gets into an accident because of it while Lou films him being taken to the hospital. A home invasion at a mansion gives Lou a big break. He and Rick arrives before the cops. Lou gets into the house filming all the graphic footage. He succeeds in pushing his big demands to Nina over the footage. But then detectives visit Lou and demand a copy of the video. Lou doesn't tell them that he saw two suspects fleeing the scene as he arrived at the mansion. Lou brings Rick to track the killers down. Rick demands a raise due to the dangerous nature of what they're doing now. Lou agrees to Rick's number but answers he could have gone for higher. They then find the killers at a restaurant and Lou reports the location to the cops and that one of them has a gun. Cops starts to come two by two and the killers starts shooting. After his friend got shot, a killer flees the restaurant. Lou and Rick join as cops give chase. Eventually the killer's car and a cop car crash. Lou close in with his camera, sees the killer, and tells Rick that the killer's dead. Rick comes in for a close up when suddenly the killer shoots three holes in his body. While Rick's dying, Lou reveals that Rick's beginning to trouble Lou as the business owner. Nina is amazed by the footage. The detectives confiscate the footage as it's evidence. They also question Lou, saying he may had withheld information about the killers. Lou dances his tongue without blinking, so the cops let him walk. Her colleagues approach Nina about the real story of the mansion, drug robbery considering there were packs of drug in the mansion. But Nina dismisses it, stating the the criminal violence angle is more appealing. Lou then manages to grow his business, now with three interns .The story is very nice that it has equally strong positive and negative depictions of the human nature amidst all those gruesome imagery. I like how the story shows that determination is one of the main keys of success. This is shown in how Lou can advance from being jobless to earning his first pay for his footage. Yes, the negative depictions are even more overwhelming. Lou's blatant drive of advancing his own interests, even by doing all and everything, is not exemplary at all.The movie nicely depicts how a resourceful man with the right entry point can end up a successful man in a harsh city such as Los Angeles. Or is it the otherwise, that in a city such as Los Angeles we often demanded to do everything even bad things to be successful? The movie also nicely grasps the possible outcomes that can happen in such cases of criminality. It limits itself challengingly in showing those graphic imagery.The acting work overall owes its good perspective to Jake Gyllenhaal. He did a very great job in depicting the Lou Bloom character. He really realized that the movie's mostly centered on Lou and how Lou deal with things his own way. He nicely balances that aspect of Lou's unmeasured blatancy with the constant great play of facial expressions. He did great on those serious faces, especially on those crucial parts with Rick, and those newbie smirks when Lou kind of begs for a job even as an intern. Rene Russo and Bill Paxton did quite nice in giving the much needed balancing angles for the story, For me Nightcrawler is worthy of a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is a definite and quick yes from me. It's very intriguing as a movie that it leaves the viewers with contradicting senses of being irritated but also amazed by what Lou did.",

            "content": "From the first scene in which we see protagonist Lou Bloom, we know what he is. He's an amoral liar and thief who doesn't bat an eyelid when cornered, or when he sees a thing he wants. His first go-to is violence. Within minutes we also know he's a bizarrely confident slick- talker, albeit with delusions of grandeur.\nSo what do you get if you cross a thug with a car salesman? A psychopath. And where better for a psychopath to find his niche than within the orbit of journalism as a collector of carnage video content for fee-for-service news programming?\nThis package of information is delivered deftly in the first act but the trajectory for Lou Bloom is well sign-posted which, for me, deprives Nightcrawler of 'thriller' status.\nIt does rate as satire, although the use of a psychopath to represent the distillation of our own most base and craven instincts and behaviours is a well-trodden (and more successfully trodden) path. Let's face it, since the chase that ended Princess Diana's life we've all known that it's our own weirdly voyeuristic drive to see each other, and our celebrities particularly, at our most vulnerable or hurt that feeds the paparazzi and shock journalism.\nJake Gyllenhaal does do a pretty neat job of capturing Bloom's twitchy descent (or ascent, depending on your POV). Rene Russo is the most improbable local news director ever rendered and suffers from the weird, unresolved and ultimately unnecessary sexual interest sub-plot. Similarly, the glancing blow Bloom has with law enforcement feels lacking in tension and intent.\nFor me, Nightcrawler was more an interesting film than a compelling or thrilling one. Props to Dan Gilroy - the film looks slick and gritty with Bloom's wild, shining eyes the focus of the frequent night-time scenes, then hidden behind sunglasses in daylight like he's developing into some sort of modern-day vampire. The soundtrack is grinding and unsettling. But for me these couldn't compensate for a lack of slow-burn and points of tension release that a really great thriller needs.\nA solid 7 though.",

            "content": "While Jake G. and Renee Russo give good performances, the story is really lacking in development. It feels like a movie that was originally 10 hours long that got edited down to 2.There was very little character development. Like, we're supposed to just know all the characters where they are and accept them as is. This creates no deep connection between viewer and character- very superficial. As such, you never get quite a feel for the characters.It wasn't a bad film. In fact, it keeps your attention and was riveting at times. It was good, but very forgettable from a great movie standpoint- it's one you want to forget, even though it isn't bad.Also, they could have emphasized the behind the scenes of the news room even more to make it more compelling and intelligent. They delve into that, and it's interesting when they do, but like the character development, it's very superficial and shallow compared to where they could have taken it. It felt like the cliff notes of a movie that could have been much better.The final setup scene was anticlimactic. The reason I say this is because it looked like this guy was on an epic filming endeavor, and for that one story to be the climactic one felt a little lackluster. Once again, it just felt like it could have been better for the climax story. It was also a little bit unbelievable.Despite this I would say it was still interesting and one of the better movies I've seen this year, which isn't saying much. It was just okay. I guess that's what's expected from Hollywood today.5/10",

What is noir? Noir stories typically feature gritty urban settings, morally compromised protagonists, dark mysteries, and a bleak outlook on human nature. This story checks all of those boxes. Lou Bloom is one seriously morally compromised dude, yet as we do with Tom Ripley, we want him to succeed. I doubt a single viewer is rooting for the police to stop him. What is wrong with us?\"What if my problem wasn't that I don't understand people, but I don't like them?\"I love this line. Lou Bloom, like Patricia Highsmith's creation, understands people too well. He uses the weaknesses in others to make those faults his assets. If Lou needs to make this happen through violence, they that's how he does it. Like Ripley, Lou is a very quick study and goes from inept amateur to master manipulator in the shortest apprenticeship imaginable. It's easy when you love what you do, as he'd tell you.It's pure brilliance how the movie shows Lou creating the tension and suspense as a product to be sold to the public.

His brother, Dan Gilroy's debut Nightcrawler is wickedly entertaining and just as insightful. I was hesitant about Jake Gyllenhaal's transformative performance as Lou Bloom, a man with an unbeatable work ethic. It's difficult to get the balance right. But his unhinged approach is perfectly measured, especially paired with his relatively meek voice. He paints an arresting portrait of a character who represents a cautionary tale in the dark side of the media. This is where the film has its misstep however, and only one that means it falls slightly short of its potential, outside of the clumsy mid-section showing Bloom's rise to success.The film's final stretch which presents the make-or-break situation for Bloom where he manipulates a crime as it happens for good footage yet risks getting caught is edge-of-your- seat enthralling cinema. It's an utter treat of a sequence. However, Gilroy gives Bloom too much power. Untested, the film stops being a character study then focuses solely on being a social commentary on the derangement of broadcasting. It's fine, but it's a step down. The film reminded me of Breaking Bad for the sly operation and empire building, and that show exemplifies how you can keep the character tested yet on top like Nightcrawler attempts. However, that social commentary is still potent, as overt as it may be, and rings true. The film is rich with atmosphere with reliable cinematography from Robert Elswitt, paired with a stunning score. Nightcrawler could be a favourite worthy film if it holds up on rewatch.8/10",

This film is based around Jake Gyllenhaal's character who takes it upon himself to film public tragedies in order to sell it to news channels. This then becomes an intense obsession for him, leading to acts of crime, just to get the perfect shot. This film really allows the audience to think twice while viewing news stories. It represents the emotional manipulation as well as exaggeration enforced behind the scenes, in order to gain a reaction from the public. The performance by Jake Gyllenhaal in this film is beyond Oscar worthy, and is widely considered to be his best acting performance ever...Although he didn't receive a golden globe or an Oscar nomination... Anyways this film contains highly suspenseful and exciting moments which at times can be truly horrifying. This movie is extremely memorable, with such insane and uneasy moments. It's a film which blurs the lines of morality and makes you question aspects of humanity. My one flaw surrounds the cinematography during car chases. I've seen it been done a lot better in films like Drive and The Place Beyond The Pines. I feel like if the camera work and direction was more exciting in those moments, it could've really elevated the intensity of the action scenes. All in all, everything else in this film is flawless. Jake Gyllenhaal along with excellent writing means a spectacular film. So therefore I give Nightcrawler a 9.",

This is characterization and script with real zing. First time director Dan Gilroy gives us the slimy underbelly of TV news, where ratings have become more important than any sense of ethics - and flies with it.The film has a streak of dark humor, but more than that, it reflects the zeitgeist. In a world where TV is struggling this makes us a little too uncomfortable as we suspect it might all be possibly possible.With excellent performances and a killer script this is the thriller of the year - a nasty slice of satire that deserves its evident success.",

The good thing though was this was rare.When I watched this movie, I was taken back to a few of my own experiences in dealing with Stringers and it got my blood boiling as I though of how they conducted themselves.Thus my dilemma in rating this movie.I've tried to put aside my bias towards the minority and rate this purely as a movie- on that, I've got to give it a good rating as I thought it was well done, it was realistic, it was confronting.It also made me wonder how many Stringers would actually go as far as he did to get the perfect shot?

            "content": "A thrilling masterwork of precision craftsmanship, an immensely fascinating vignette of the pursuit of American dream & a thought-provoking exposition of the dark side of TV news business, Nightcrawler is a firmly crafted, neatly structured, viciously executed & intensely entertaining thriller that presents its interesting premise in a very polished manner but what single-handedly elevates it to a whole new level is Jake Gyllenhaal's manic performance.Set in the nocturnal underbelly of contemporary Los Angeles, Nightcrawler tells the story of Louis Bloom; a driven young man desperate for work who muscles into the cut-throat profession of L.A. crime journalism by filming murders, mayhem & accidents taking place throughout the city during nighttime and with the help of a local TV news veteran eventually succeeds in blurring the thin line between observer & participant to become the star of his own story.Brilliantly written & fabulously directed by Dan Gilroy, Nightcrawler is a blazing work of originality that marks a sensational directional debut for Gilroy & is presented in a very polished manner. Cinematography crisply captures the silent, almost deserted look of Los Angeles during nighttime & seamlessly encapsulates the whole picture with a quiet sense of foreboding tension. Editing is carried out in a concise, calculated manner while James Newton Howard's score simply fits.Coming to the acting department, this is Jake Gyllenhaal's show all the way as his work here effortlessly overshadows every other input from the rest of its cast n crew. From the gaunt appearance to those unblinking eyes & creepy smirk, Gyllenhaal completely gets under the skin of Louis \"Lou\" Bloom and plays the sociopath with riveting finesse to carve out a jaw-dropping performance that's easily his career-best work. Supporting him are Rene Russo, Bill Paxton & Riz Ahmed who all chip in with vital contributions.On an overall scale, Nightcrawler can be seen as a stinging satire of TV news business, a biting criticism of modern capitalist society & a contrary interpretation of American dream yet above all, it remains a deeply unsettling yet immensely fascinating character study of a fanatical sociopath. Ingeniously shifting its tones by blending subtle moments of humour into its dark ambiance and bolstered by Jake Gyllenhaal's coyote-like presence & bone-chilling performance, Nightcrawler is one of the best films of the year that comes highly recommended.",

Here's why: Firstly Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Lou Bloom, portrayed as a freelance TV news cameraman with a nose for graphic tragedy, actually began as a weird petty thief. The problem here is there was no character background. The audience became manipulated. They were fooled into thinking this would be better than it actually was. It's mostly about fake news, a persuasive manipulative person getting into adrenaline junkie situations to make some quick cash then realises he could command more money and more respect. We are quickly thrown into a tense thriller.Lou goes around filming incidents he learned about on a police scanner. (It is not that simple believe me) and points a Black Friday value camera then sells this to a news company. Strange really if the character has been doing this for three months earning in excess of $1000 a night or whatever we never see him spending it or anything. There's just too much unbelievability with this movie.What was quite obvious to me and not to others was Jake himself slipping up so many times with his accent. At first he played a deluded, mental person let's be honest yet within a few minutes he's a fast thinking dreamer with an education. Not long after he's a rather posh accent, with manners almost English. Then not long after he's an American roaming around talking line he's a top businessman very prim and proper. Not much consistency. Yes he's a brilliant actor and really carried this film but I do not think through much of this movie that his performance was terrific or anything",

            "content": "\"Bourne Legacy\" screenwriter Dan Gilroy exposes the skullduggery behind tabloid TV journalism in \"Nightcrawler,\" a gritty, engrossing, but seldom surprising satire with savvy actor Jake Gyllenhaal cast as an unsavory stringer with a camcorder. Hollywood has been producing expos\u00e9s about the depths that shady journalists will plumb to land the big scoop. Some of the best include \"Five Star Final\" (1931), the venerable \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), and \"Ace in the Hole\" (1951). If you know anything about the history of yellow journalism, few things can top what one sleazy news reporter orchestrated during the execution of Ruth Snyder at Sing Sing Prison back in 1928. Convicted of murdering her husband, Snyder was sentenced to die in the electric chair. The New York Daily News hired amateur photographer Tom Howard to cover the execution, and Howard snapped a photo of Snyder quivering in the electric chair as 700 volts sizzled through her body. Naturally, the infamous photo appeared a little fuzzy, but the Daily News ran the notorious picture on its front page. Sales of the newspaper skyrocketed, and the Daily News ran the same electrifying photo again on its front page the following day. Most of what occurs in \"Nightcrawler\" is tame compared with the stunt that the Daily News reporter pulled. Indeed, little of it is as exciting as the real-life incidents that the movie's technical advisors have encountered on a regular basis. Nevertheless, this polished, fast-paced, pulp thriller about what an ambitious but unscrupulous journalist does to deliver the goods is often more amusing than audacious. A gaunt-looking Gyllenhaal manages to be both charismatic and creepy as the anti-heroic protagonist, and he lets nothing interfere with his ignoble aspirations. Rene Russo makes the most of her role as an over-the-hill Los Angeles television news director, while Bill Paxton scores in a peripheral role as a veteran nightcrawler who shows Gyllenhaal the ropes. Although he doesn't break new ground with \"Nightcrawler,\" Gilroy proves with his directorial debut that he can capably stage not only suspenseful shootouts and careening car chases, but also conjure up flawed but hypnotic characters in a morally skewered universe.Initially, when we encounter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal of \"End of Watch\"), he is a petty thief who will pinch anything. He steals copper, cyclone fencing, wristwatches, and even tournament racing bikes. Eventually, he discovers that money can made as a freelance crime videographer lensing scenes of blood-splattered murder and mayhem. Since he resides in Los Angeles, where people die violently every day, Bloom decides to hock a trophy bike for a camcorder and a scanner. No sooner does he try his hand at his new profession than he rubs shoulders with a professional stringer. Joe Loder (the incomparable Bill Paxton of \"Aliens\") cruises around in a souped-up minivan equipped with high-tech cameras and a sidekick to shoot those big scenes. Loder has a computer editing console on-board, and he can upload video to the highest bidder at the various competing TV stations around Los Angeles. Loder admires Bloom's determination and drive. Bloom scoots around in crappy 1985 Tercel and wields a low-tech camcorder. He sneaks inside a house where a homicide has taken place and reorganizes the crime scene so it appears more photogenic and then sells it to a TV station. Later, the enterprising Bloom hires a homeless man, Rick (Riz Ahmed of \"Centurion\"), to serve as his navigator. Whenever Bloom races off to a potential crime scene, Rick struggles to route his impatient employer along the fastest streets to the crime scene. Bloom pays him $30 a day, but Rick is still pretty clueless about being a stringer. Meanwhile, the unscrupulous but captivating Bloom has taken a shine to a dame, Nina Romina (Rene Russo of \"Lethal Weapon 3\"), who works at the lowest rated Los Angeles TV station. \"I want something people can't turn away from,\" she tells Bloom. \"If it bleeds, it leads,\" she explains. She avoids his amorous advances, but she praises his video. At one point, to acquire better video of a corpse after a car crash, Bloom drags the body into the light. At the station, Nina observes that Bloom has blood on his hands. Indeed, Gilroy uses Romina to make a sarcastic comment about Bloom's cynical nature, but Bloom has no qualms. Ultimately, Bloom and Rick get so good at their game they beat the LAPD to a crime scene, and Bloom prowls the premises where three corpses lay sprawled in puddles of blood and photographs them. He even shoots footage of the perpetrators fleeing. Bloom orchestrates events so he can make big bucks off the crime as well as the eventual capture of the killers.If you have read the Internet interview with Austin Raishbrook who served as the technical adviser for \"Nightcrawler,\" you have to wonder why Gilroy didn't replicate more of Raishbrook's exploits. Some of the sights Raishbrook and his two brothers have seen would make you cringe. When the Raishbrook brothers rush out to shoot video, they suit up in bulletproof vests and prepare for the worst. Not only have they have been shot at, but also thugs have smashed their equipment. Some of the chaos they have seen sounds surreal compared to the formulaic genre shenanigans Gilroy puts his characters through in this vivid R-rated urban epic. Despite its shortage of surprises, \"Nightcrawler\" features some incredibly amoral characters and top-notch performances. Bloom doesn't care what it takes to obtain footage, even if it means either sacrificing an employee or eliminating the competition. In this respect, \"Nightcrawler\" differs from most movies where the villains get their just comeuppance. Louis Bloom is most certainly not a hero. He qualifies as a vile, low-life, bottom-feeder, but \"Nightcrawler\" doesn't punish him for his wicked ways. Instead, he comes up smelling like roses no matter what he does and that is the singular thing that distinguishes the above-average \"Nightcrawler\" from most mainstream, standard-issue, Hollywood film releases.",

            "content": "This is not an ideal movie for escapism and certainly not a family movie. It plunges you into the deep end of the world of peril and tragedy - without being violent or brutal. The film is so realistically done that some scenes are difficult to watch due to the tragic (realistic) nature of them.This is an interesting insight into how footage for newscasts is obtained - sometimes so easily overlooked. It's also a sad fact that a price tag is determined by the level and scale of a tragedy. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic. He has a constant eeriness about him. There's such a strong resemblance here to Joaquin Phoenix' performance in 'Joker'. The film is creepy and disturbing in so many ways, and in many instances it has nothing to do with what is directly displayed on screen.The film has a stunning, nail biting climax. Although a very good film, I probably won't be watching it again due to the nature of the film.https://paulsmoviereviews",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is a realistic and dark film about a sociopath turning a smaller buisness into an eventual larger business, by filming and manipulating gruesome crimes, in order to put them on the news, glorifying and instilling fear into the people. He does whatever it takes to get what we wants, innocent's dying, manipulating a womens career, almost setting up a brutal crime, by withh olding information from the police and allowing his \"employee\", to be killed. This film touches on the subject how news glorifies brutality, and how big corporations and the people part of them, will do whatever it takes to achieve higher, touching on the major theme and subject of the evil side of capitalism. Lou Bloom, searches for power, but also for meaning. He is a sociopath, and doesn't connect with or like people, and find his true place to grasp power and manipulate, through his news company. This film explores the worldview of capitalism, as Lou is a white male manipulating his minority employee, as he also explicitly states that the news wants urban crime leaking into the suburbs as stories, to instill fear. The cinematography, editing, lighting, and framing are dark, gritty are perfectly fitting. The script is brillant. Lou Bloom speaks like a person imitating a real person, and uses his false charming and manipulative words to lure his employee and Nina into his game. He has no formal education, he says he spends time on his computer trying to learn new skills and take in knowledge, in order for him to excel, as he speaks facts and demands with no understanding of any human elements behind them. He doesn't understand buisness ethics and doesn't know to function in society. The score is meant to be taken as it is from Bloom's perspective, as he believes that he truimphat, after manipulating a dead body into view of his camera. And at first, the audience is tricked into rooting for Bloom. Ome of the film's essential themes, is that us, the audience, lets bad people rise to power because they give us things. That the ones will all the power were the ones willing to do anything, and step on anyone to do it. This is implied by Nina a few times in the film, and the film also shows corrupt capitalism and its connection to racism. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is amazing. The film's major theme is that it exposes the spirit of capitalism, and what the human spirit becomes in America. A character like Lou, who is disconnected from society, who probably wasn't correctly diagnosed, and gets all of knowledge through the internet and self help books, arrogant, emphatically bare, demanding and and succeeds through that. As this film takes the more realistic look at the underdog to riches story, and removes the downfall, as in Lou's case, he's only going to get more poweful. He is clever, with a learned and false sense of niceness. And in the beginning, Gilroy makes the audience almost feel sorry for Lou, with traits of likeable not relating to morality. The problem isnt Lou, the problem is the society that rewards him. The advantages of sociopathy in a capitalist society.",

Direction is crunchy adding taste to the film every time new scene turns up. The beautiful nightlife of LA adds charms to the cinematography. Hats off to Jake Gyllenhaal who gets into the character of Louis Bloom so effortlessly that it is difficult to identify any other actor playing that part. He is horrifying as a news reporter who can get into any length to achieve success. It is the evil character that you feel weird , funny, angry and yet captivating. He emotes so accurately through his expressions and is complete natural. Rene Russo does well in a small roleSo overall , superb intellectual movie in all respect. Must Watch. Excellent 4/5",

Jake Gyllanhal does a great job, (even if he's not as creepy as I thought he'd be) and the script is smooth and solid, but the film tries the whole time to be terrifyingly creepy, but is just kind of so so.It does do a good job of grounding you in reality on the bloody crime of Los Angelos, and the nightcrawling TV reporters that go out of their way to get good shots for the news. It explores the fine line between doing your job and disrespecting and exploiting the dead for your own personal gain, but in the end it didn't leave as much of an impact.All this talk about how Jake should have been nominated, I disagree. He was really good, not as creepy as I thought. He's smart talking and clever, but he doesn't leave enough of an impact to get you thinking.A lot of the movie was me waiting for something to happen. It sets up the character and motivation well, it sets you in the right mood, but a lot of it was just me waiting for it to change. In the end with a few crazy twists here and there, I for some reason was not very intrigued. I guess the film is trying so hard to be creepy based on it's strong contrast in lighting, with a really dark toned film, but in the end it's not that creepy of a film. This kind of story could almost be a comedy or drama, not a dark thriller.I give it props for its clever screenplay and decent performances, but I was hoping for something a tad bit more. Not bad, but was missing something.",

Although I have given the film a generous rating, the film is not without its flaws. This film is the most controversial film of 2014. The film portrays an egocentric, compulsive and soul-less character Lou Bloom(played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who will stop at nothing to get what he wants and by whatever means necessary.Plot: Lou Bloom is a thief who sells his wares at a scrap yard, Bloom asks for a job, but the yard manager tells him he will not employ a thief. Undaunted, Lou looks for better prospects and he finds this opportunity while watching a freelance film crew he sees working the scene of a car crash. Lou steals a racing bicycle and trades it for a camcorder and radio scanner. He shoots the aftermath of a carjacking and offers the footage to a local TV station. The morning news director, Nina (Rene Russo), buys the footage and encourages Lou to continue his work. Thus Lou finds that by shooting raw footage of crime scenes and accidents as they happen, he could make a lot of fast money. Lou hires an assistant, Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man just out of high school and desperate for money.See the film and find out what happens next... The acting, photography, background sound-effects are professionally handled. Dan Gilroy makes a superb debut as director and this film makes a solid starting point in his career as a director. While watching this film, you'd never expect that this was made by an inexperienced newcomer(remember Spielberg's Duel 1971 film).The best actor in the film is Jake Gyllenhaal. He is complemented well by veteran actors Bill Paxton and Rene Russo. I hadn't seen Bill Paxton for a long time. I think the last film I saw of his was Twister(1996).You may also like - Jake Gyllenhaal films: Zodiac (2007), Source Code(2011), End Of Watch(2012), Brokeback Mountain (2005).Rene Russo films: Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), In the Line of Fire (1993), Outbreak, Get Shorty (1995), Tin Cup (1996), Ransom (1996), Lethal Weapon 4 (1998).Bill Paxton films: Aliens(1986), True Lies (1994), Predator 2 (1990), Near Dark (1987), Monolith (1993).",

His sociopathic moves throughout the movie made me wonder why I ever thought he might be portrayed as an under dog at some major turning point in the story. Boy was I wrong. I would say this movie was good because it left you feeling something and because Gyllenhaal will, without doubt, make you believe he is this character. If you're looking for a feel good movie, don't see this. I would even recommend Gone Girl before this film. I literally feel sexually violated by the film.

Set in L.A. the city of angels you have Lou Bloom(in a dark and raw performance from Jake Gyllenhaal)as a young man who's a loner and a dark character as he makes his living from stealing metal and selling it as he lives a sad life in a one room L.A. apartment while driving a high mileage older model Toyota car. Being out at night he sees the streets and the darkness of underworld night action in L.A. and how that it attracts news, so a light has come on he must buy a camera and start recording the action footage as it happens and sell the footage! Slowly one by one Lou becomes a new L.A. crime journalist as each night he sees car crashes, blood, murders, police chases, and shootouts and he gets them all on camera as they occur and this real life footage he then takes into the last place news station in L.A., and it's here at this station the news manager Nina(the raw and attractive Rene Russo)has a plan this footage will air for ratings! All while Lou collects a buck so he can soon start his own news footage company! Overall this film is entertaining though dark it proves that news and the media is all about thrills, spills, and underworld drama as that is what leads to news company profits, in today's age the media and journalism is hungry for drama and a news making story at any and all cost it's what drives people and the culture of society.",

The blackest of black comedies and a pulsating thriller, this is the kind of movie that will become legendary just as Jake Gyllenhaal's career-defining performance will become legendary. He's Lou Bloom, (yes, if you want to you can read into Lou's travels through night-time LA something akin to Mr Joyce's Leopold Bloom's journey through Dublin's 'Nighttown', but only if you want to), and Lou's vocation in life is to film the dead and the dying, particularly the victims of violent crime, and share his work with the world on television. Of course, he's an obvious sociopath but he's probably psychopathic as well which makes Gilroy's film very scary as well as very exciting. As a character he's up there with Travis Bickle and, as has already been suggested, Rupert Pumpkin whose delusions of a kind of grandeur, (he keeps spouting the same kind of aphorisms), are both funny and very frightening. Gyllenhaal is never off the screen and should be a front runner in next year's Oscars. In fact, this would have been a one-man show were it not for the brilliant supporting turns of Rene Russo as the TV station's voracious news editor, (she makes Faye Dunaway's Diana Christiansen look like a pussycat), and Riz Ahmed as Lou's greedy and none too bright assistant. I did say that this was the blackest of black comedies and I did chuckle a lot, almost in disbelief, knowing all the time that Gilroy has put nothing on screen that isn't already out there in the public domain. \"Nightcrawler\" isn't telling us anything new; there are no limits anymore and everything is up for grabs but if there is nothing new under the sun then at least we should be grateful we're getting it as full on as this.

It's been more than a month and I still can't stop thinking about Dan Gilroy's directorial debut 'Nightcrawler'. It's a smooth yet very suspenseful thriller about a friendless sociopath who decides one day he is going to start a career in freelance TV new reporting, where we see him succeed as well as go to the metaphorical \"dark side\". This sociopath is played by the impressive Jake Gyllenhaal who (to put lightly) has major psychological issues. We've seen him play something similar before in 'Enemy' and 'Donnie Darko', but here, he's on a whole different level. It's easy for me to say that Jake Gyllenhaal plays the most frightening character in film in the last decade.We meet Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) as he is brutally beating up a security guard so he can steal some scrap metal for money as well as the man's watch. It's easy for us to see how unhinged Bloom is here with his facial expressions and actions towards everyone around him and needless to say, he can't hold a job for very long, but he is very willing and able to do almost anything in addition to him being somewhat of a brilliant mind. One night, he comes across a bad car accident and sees a freelance videographer (Bill Paxton), shooting the crime scene in order to sell this footage for money to local television stations. These freelancers are known as \"nightcrawlers\".Once Bloom sees how much money can be made with this, he is quick to sell some of his belongings to get a cheap video camera and a police scanner, and soon enough, her is out looking for something bloody. He catches his first major car accident and does everything wrong professionally including getting into the police officer's face, shooting closeups of the victims who are bloodied and on the edge of death with no regard of personal space or pleasantries. He has no limits of how he should act, think, or speak, which is why he is a loner. He turns in his first video to a local TV station where the news director, Nina (Rene Russo) will do and show anything on television for good ratings. Her motto is, \"the more blood and guts - the better\".Gilroy's script allows us to see Bloom in such a way where we should be afraid of him as well as encouraging him. All instances are awkward and horrifying, including Bloom holding an impromptu interview with an intern (Riz Ahmed) or taking Nina out to dinner and ultimately blackmailing her into sleeping with him to keep the news ratings high. There is literally no limit to what Bloom is capable of. And after Bloom witnesses a brutal home invasion/murder scene happen on camera, the things Bloom will do to satisfy his personal urge as well as his career definitely cross a big line.]'Nightcrawler' keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout its two-hour runtime. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom so pitch perfect, that you have no idea what he is capable of doing at any given moment. You don't know whether he will shaker your hand with a grin or rip your heart out of your chest and feed it to you. He's that scary. 'Nightcrawler' is one of the finest films of the year and looks impressive up and down the scale. Make it a point to see 'Nightcrawler'.",

He finds that filming tragedy, news, you can sell this for profit. The bigger the scoop = bigger the check. I thought Jake did bring a good sense of what he wanted this character to be like, a recluse, little sociopathic, and definitely crazy. The director did good at delivering this film from basically Jake's characters view point. Overall this is a definite must watch for any fan of Gyllenhaal's or Los Angeles.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is a disturbing thriller that entertains as much as it unnerves, and I'm not sure that's necessarily a good thing.The directorial debut of screenwriter Dan Gillroy (The Bourne Legacy), Nightcrawler does for paparazzi what One Hour Photo did for shop assistants and, indeed, Jake Gyllenhaal is on similar, sinister territory to Robin William's award-winning turn.Lou Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is an unemployed petty criminal searching for work and a quick income. As driven as he is desperate, he chances upon an emergency situation and observes the underbelly of journalism at work: The nightcrawlers, an unsavoury breed of TV news camera operators who monitor the police radio channels and scour the streets to capture lucrative, graphic 'real life' footage of accidents, murder and mayhem for the early morning news. The greater the tragedy and the more gratuitous the footage, the bigger the cheque.A self-professed quick learner, Bloom buys a cheap camera and shoots his first footage. An astounded news veteran, Nina (Rene Russo), snaps up the footage, gives him a quick lesson in shooting for the news and sends him on his way, unaware how ambitious Bloom is, or that he just might be a psychopath.Nightcrawler is a film of blurred lines. Is Bloom obsessed or unhinged? Does the news provide a service or macabre entertainment? When a cameraman shoots bedlam, is he a courageous professional opening a door onto another world for us, or just a voyeur twitching back the curtain for us to gawp? And are we any less guilty for watching? Gillroy has also ensured the relationship are as blurred as the themes, creating an ambiguity around that of Bloom and Nina. The scales of control waver and quite how much one party is coerced or a willing participant becomes hazy as Nightcrawler progresses, and it is all the better for it.The dynamic between Gyllenhall and Russo is exciting to watch, with the actors sparring beautifully. There is a crackle in the air when they share the screen due in part to the actors' possession of it, more so to the balance of fragility and confidence of their characters as the see-saw of power teeters on its fulcrum. While Bloom and Nina might claim to be newshounds offering a public service, when we get down to it he is little more than a grubby paparazzo and she his pimp.For those who recall the night and the aftermath of the paparazzi hounding that resulted in Princess Diana's death, Nightcrawler highlights the apparent good intentions of the responsible press and their overtures of self-governance and accountability by pointing at their abject failure to actually change. But it doesn't go far enough.Nightcrawler gives the impression of being really edgy but it doesn't quite hit those heights. Certainly it is unpleasant at times, occasionally it is downright distasteful, but it needs more. It scratches the filmy surface when it desperately needs to penetrate and sink to the murky depths of the mire beneath.Its strengths are in the idea and the characters, both the two principals and the supporting characters: Joe Loder (Bill Paxton as a rival nightcrawler who regards Bloom as a dangerous threat) and Rick (Riz Ahmed as Bloom's put-upon assistant troubled by both scruples and fear). But while both characters add a layer of depth and understanding to the human mess that is Bloom, in Joe's case, at least, I couldn't help feeling there was more that should have made the cut.Gillroy has packed Nightcrawler with darkness, brutality and the kind of horrific shots that make it onto the worst news shows on TV, but here they make the viewer want to see more, not to squirm and look away as we should. His film, though a fine debut, doesn't shock or horrify in the way it feels as though it should, and in the end Bloom doesn't come across as a sinister man, just an unpleasant geek with dark methods.Nightcrawler is exciting in a gratuitous way and I'm not entirely convinced that was the intention or that I am any better than Bloom for having sat there and enjoyed the experience. But I can handle that. Rather more concerning is that it peters out with a whimper instead of a stinging finale.I don't care about the morals of the film, I wanted to emerge either enraged or whooping it up in celebration. Instead I departed with a sigh akin to eating a fine cake, saving the cherry until last only to discover it is a wax decoration.",

            "content": "Dark, thrilling, gritty, exciting, absorbing. These are just a few adjectives that describe Nightcrawler. It's also superbly written, directed, and acted with Jake Gyllenhaal giving an outstanding performance as Louis Bloom, a sociopathic loner who discovers the world of freelance journalism. It's also a fantastic directorial debut from Dan Gilroy, and thankfully a much better writing piece than his last outing, The Bourne Legacy. Everything you could hope for from a movie of this genre, Nightcrawler delivers and it delivers it excellently.We all know that this is obviously a fictional story but really what the film shows us isn't too far from the truth with regards to the paparazzi and news networks. For instance, the extremes Bloom goes to - for the most part at least - in trying to get his exclusive scoops, and the networks all desperate for their ratings, can be likened to those who do the same in the real world. The point could be argued that the film takes it a bit far just to add excitement & suspense, but when you read about what happened to Princess Diana and the way the networks completely distorted the truth regarding the Zimmerman trial, the film doesn't take it too far at all.As for the cast, well, Gyllenhaal completely dominates with his performance as Louis Bloom, and how he wasn't even nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars is beyond me. He plays Bloom in such a way that you don't know whether to like him, feel sorry for him, or be completely creeped out by him. For me, it's a combination of all three to start, but as Bloom becomes more obsessed & more relentless the creep factor starts to come out much more. Special mentions go to Bill Paxton & Renee Russo for their roles as Joe Loder - a weasel of a freelancer and Bloom's main rival - and Nina Romina - the network's morning news director who's desperate for not only those exclusives, but to stay in her job.This is definitely a movie that should be put into the \"must see\" category.",

Sometimes I have trouble sitting put in the theater if it doesn't engage me. Thankfully, this movie made me forget about the running time and took me on a ride I won't forget anytime soon. Until I see otherwise, this is the movie I will be rooting for come Oscar season. This isn't terrifying in the typical way! This movie is terrifying because of the realistic nature. It is a fantastic look at the ethics of broadcasting. Morals and ethics are thrown out the window to a big degree in this movie. Hardly anybody is sympathetic in this movie. (Except for Ahmed) It's unabashedly unapologetic and I respected that heavily.It grips you right from the outset and doesn't let go until the end. Everything about this movie is amazing. Even the cinematography is incredible. Some of it was truly mind-blowing to look at! Shooting a lot of the scenes at night augmented things in a big way. It was a very memorable experience. I was disgusted and disturbed to see how far somebody would go for the price of fame. Jake Gyllenhall gives a harrowing portrayal of Louis Bloom. He's an eccentric weirdo, but a fascinating one. I abhor his character, but I couldn't look away. He plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever had the pleasure of watching. His performance packs a wallop and I hope he picks up an Oscar for best actor! I'll never look at him the same way again. Rene Russo is excellent as Nina. Her character isn't as appalling as Jake's, but she was pretty evil herself. She still knows how to command the screen and delivered a great performance. Her chemistry with Gyllenhall was pretty good. At the age of 60, she's still gorgeous! Bill Paxton can play these types of charismatic slime balls in his sleep, but it was still a lot of fun to see him work his magic. Riz Ahmed is the only sympathetic character in this movie. He's flawed, but he has morals and he's genuine. I'm not too familiar with him, but he was awesome. The ending had major balls to end like it did. I was shocked, repulsed, and mortified. That being said, I loved every minute of it. I love anything that makes me think about it for a day or two after! Nightcrawler managed to do just that. Not sure this movie will be for everyone, but anybody that appreciates great filmmaking, good character development, and flawless acting should love it! Either way, you should take the risk! Plunge into the world of Nightcrawler and prepare to get dirty! You're in for a ride. 10/10",

            "content": "I was mislead by the synopsis of this movie; it suggested that the protagonist, Lou Bloom, through his own ruthless ambitions at getting a news story no matter what, somehow ends up being a sort of victim. It sounded like it might live up to its little 'thriller' tag. That is so far from the case it's not even funny.The story: Bloom is a desperate, unemployed man struggling to make ends meet, and then one night he discovers 'nightcrawling' \u2013 selling video footage of crimes to TV stations. He employs a young man named Rick and together they ride about at night chasing blood in Los Angeles; they come along a home invasion, Bloom catches the criminals leaving the house and eventually decides to hunt them down, having dire consequences \u2013 for everyone but Bloom, that is.And that is where it all goes awry for me. I can understand that it was the filmmakers point, that sometimes in life, good things happen to bad people and not only do they get away with their tasteless, immoral deeds they are in fact awarded for them. I do understand that, and I don't necessarily have an aversion to that - being honest here: when Anthony Hopkins \"had an old friend for dinner\" in The Silence of the Lambs, it gave me a dark feeling of glee \u2013 that was Hopkins and his Hannibal was basically rather charismatic. But what I felt to be a huge problem here is that Jake Gyllenhaal's Bloom is so completely, entirely, profoundly unlikeable that I was honestly hoping he would get himself killed, or for Rick to just knock him one on the head. He was smarmy and cold, and possessed not one bit of anything human I could relate to; his desperation became callous ambition, and his character was so monotone that I honestly had to skip through some of the scenes to the end because I just couldn't tolerate it anymore; it was literally making my fingers curl into little fists of sublime irritation \u2013 THAT'S how bad it was for me. Another irksome component was how Bloom, as a rather strange little upstart could basically threaten and manipulate a veteran of the industry to continue buying his footage.I dunno. There were just too many cons weighed against the pros for this one; there wasn't much character development, apart from assuming that perhaps they were all acting on their own desperations and needs, be it professional or personal or whatever else \u2013 but even that is surmised; and at times it felt rather slowly paced. Though undoubtedly - for me - I think that if they had made Bloom just slightly less of a sordid aspirant the film wouldn't have been as bad as it was; it was certainly nice to look at and it had an interesting story: I liked the idea of exploring just how deep people would scrape the gutters for 'journalism's' sake, without regard for morals or humanity, and to what extent would we disregard the dignity of others for our own benefits (as was sort of the case with Rene Russo's character)... but at the end of the day Gyllenhaal was just too much to bear.Very, very disappointing, and a waste of money.",

From the beginning there's just something lurking under the surface that doesn't feel right about Bloom, and it's slowly peeled back during the film to reveal him as a sociopath. Manipulative; arrogant, sleazy, egotistical & most certainly callous - his lack of empathy for human life is astounding. Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely superb throughout, creating a character that is so morally repugnant it's hard to forget him.In the beginning of the film, I definitely empathised with Louis' character.\nHaving to resort to petty crimes for income, due to unemployment, his persistence to better his circumstances (even if he has to work from the bottom up) is admirable. My opinion quickly changed when he became more and more obsessive with building a repertoire of grisly crime scene footage; each one more risqu\u00e9 than the next, exploiting a homeless man to become part of his news footage 'crew' and essentially staging murders to boost his career.The film is not a satire, but a scathing social commentary about the media & the content they air to boost ratings (victims need to be white & affluent, injured at the hands of the poor/minority & must be gory). Statements delivered in the film such as - \"if it bleeds it leads\", is deeply disturbing though reigns true; and we as viewers are equally complicit - our integrity questioned by our gluttony for blood.The relationship Bloom strikes with Nina is troublesome on many levels. Firstly his coercion of her to be submissive to his demands professionally and sexually & that she finds his murderous ways inspiring.Likes:\n-The music was calculating (like the cogs inside Bloom's brain)\n-Morning news segments\n-Rick's \"interview\" scene\n-Bloom testing his camera",

LOL By coincidence, the very same night I see this movie off Netflix, and it's Jake Gyllenhaal at his very creepy best! I don't know what exactly they did to his appearance- something with the eyes perhaps-??- to make them more bulgy- ?? (more so than usual?? LOL), but he was certainly playing against type in this. I would say this is my favorite role/film of his to date probably with \"Brokeback Mountain\" second. Gyllenhaal plays a low-life living in L.A., scraping out a living stealing things like copper wire and selling to junk yards, who upon chance, gets the idea to become involved in the seedy end of crime journalism- taking video of car accidents, stabbings, murder victims, etc..- then selling to local news stations. He becomes involved with one of the managers/editors (Rene Russo), and develops an exclusive deal with the station. Bill Paxton is also good as a veteran, competing crime journalist. This movie sorta reminded me of the films of the 1970s- with Gyllenhaal playing the type of leading man character you don't see too many of in today's more proper/PC films. He's the type of character you really don't like, but at the same time you sorta root for him, hoping things might turn out okay for him in the end. This is the type of role someone like Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro would've played, and a filmmaker like Brian DePalma may have directed back then-?? All I gotta say is a big WOW!- big thumbs up, and this may very well be my favorite film of 2014!",

Though not a narrative demanded by audiences, it is a compelling and fast-paced film that commands your undivided attention and viewership.Lou Bloom is a hustler, a driven man eager to make his mark while making a living through a career. He muscles his way into being a Los Angeles freelancer filming the horrific crimes that make up the evening local news. Inspired by the prospect of forging forward in life, Lou crosses the line of morality and past the role of bystander.Dan Gilroy perfectly captures the abhorrent and callously detached nature of LA local news through his direction and writing of Nightcrawler. People watch local broadcasts to gain information about their neighborhood, be it education, transportation or politics. Instead they are bombarded with story after story of local crimes that are sensationalized, blatantly fabricated, misinformed and embellished. \"If it bleeds, it leads,\" states one character.Gilroy writes a unique character in Lou Bloom, burying soundbite observations of the world in his dialogue, that comes to life through Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake Gyllenhaal physically transforms into the eager vulture-like Lou Bloom. Bloom is a fast-talker, he is self taught, he is smart, and he is willing to cross the morality line to make a name for himself. Had Bloom been portrayed by any other actor he would have been a dislikeable punk. Gyllenhaal brings a fierce light within him to the role and the viewer can't help but feel Bloom is just playing the hand he was dealt.There is nothing bad about Nightcrawler. The notable original score by James Newton Howard is complementary and eerie and quite frankly a surprise he wasn't recognized by the Globes. The film itself is dramatic, it is engaging, it is original and it is well shot, an extraordinary feat for Gilroy's directorial debut. Even as the plot builds toward the interesting and unexpected climax, there is never a lull.Please check out our website for more FULL reviews of all the recent releases.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler, a riveting and strangely horrifying story, that is a character study of a true sociopath. I tend to enjoy these films that analyze unique and perhaps sick characters. The films I can name off the top of my head include 'Taxi Driver', 'Prisoners', and even perhaps 'The Social Network'. There were plenty of strong points and attributes of this film that I particularly enjoyed, those being the acting performances, cinematography, and character work. This film constantly created an increasingly unsettling tone, through its actors, camera work and lighting, which is something I want to further explain. This film focuses on a profession I had never heard of, a side to 24 hour news, or maybe even Hollywood I had never seen, it created a guilty curiosity that I do believe the film emphasizes. This feeling of people trying to get above each other no matter what at the beginning of the film, seems foreign, disgusting even, however it slowly becomes a feeling of inevitability and that disgust becomes that guilty intrigue I mentioned before.The cast of this film is very good, their acting performances being a very strong point to this film. However Jake Gyllenhall was absolutely fantastic, his portrayal of Louis Bloom was honestly really disconcerting and was a perfect choice for this film. My admiration continues to grow when I encounter films that feature and present performances like this, it is also emphasized when I learn facts about Jake Gyllenhall and his commitment to this role, this being that; Jake Gyllenhall 'lost 20 pounds for his role. This was Gyllenhaal's own idea, as he visualized Lou as a hungry coyote.'. Additionally Riz Ahmed was in this film, I hadn't encountered any of his work, but I knew of him. I thought that he does play this character very well, he brings this sense of realism into this film, instead of a mad sociopath parading around gathering and selling footage of crime scenes without feeling any resistance. Riz Ahmed's character, Rick, offers this. Rick at many points in the film calls Lou out, however there is another character that is used to accentuate Lou as a sociopath, and also bring that level of disparity that is so prevalent in today's society. This character is Rene Russo's; Nina Romina, this character shows disparity, for success, to be stable, and to do anything to gain an upper hand, as a result falling into Lou's madness. I thought this was a brilliant addition to the character because it also presented and emphasized reality, that being that people can become truly desperate in this world, and there are people who take advantage of those people.I did enjoy the cinematography in this film, a lot of the shots were very well composed and constructed, creating those intended feelings of either anticipation, sympathy, or disgust. There was seamlessness and fluidity created in the camera movement and editing, it sometimes made me as a viewer uncomfortable, because it did sometimes alienate the audience, forcing them to watch as opposed to being immersed within the world. For example in a scene at the beginning Lou Bloom is seen to be taking down a police officer, and in the film it cuts to a wide shot, the audience are forced to just look at the scene from almost, the outside, it makes you feel helpless and accept that this character is going to win throughout the film, and the audience will not be able to do anything about it...",

Judging on similar tales about the American Dream, such as 'The Great Gatsby,' is not always a positive thing.-Nightcrawler was about as good as I expected it to be. It was very well made and compelling. It also told the story and theme very well, with a building sense of negative connotations as his news filming progressed.-This was probably one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best performances. He was fantastic. Everyone else was good, but not great.It was about two hours and very well-paced. It had a pretty neutral overtone, however, which came from the very unlikable main character. He's compelling to watch, but you just have to hate him. I was not a huge fan of its ending either, but I guess it ended how it ended. It was a much better ending than The Maze Runner! -The music was very good.-It's rated-R because of its moderate language, which was a little above Gone Girl and largely under Fury. It also has some violence, but PG-13 violence.-Overall, Nightcrawler delivered in exactly what it was supposed to! It was well acted, well told, and offered an uncomfortable compelling story and tone to the film. If that is your thing, or if the trailer looks good to you, Nightcrawler is worth seeing in theaters! I personally enjoyed it a lot and would give it an 8/10!",

As soon as I saw Lou move a car crash victim in order to get a better shot with his camera, I knew it was only a matter of time before he would actually be creating stories instead of filming them.What actually made the movie even more creepy for me was Gyllenhaal's resemblance to a guy I grew up with. I never noticed it before so it might have been attributable to all the weight he lost for the role. But he did look spooky most of the time, didn't he? Something I thought about when I first heard of this film - was there any push back from the Marvel Comic folks over use of the term Nightcrawler? They have an X-Men character by that name so I thought there might have been some legalities involved with it, but I never heard anything come of it. Lou must have passed on the story.",

Admire isn't the right word, what he does is wrong, but the ambition is still respectable in a sense. Sort of like a much darker version of Jordan Belfort.

This is a fictional story about them, and focuses on one of them. Jake Gyllenhaal is Louis Bloom and as the movie opens we see him clipping chain-link fence. As a security guard approaches and with a smile on his face Bloom tries to talk his way out of the trespassing. Then he sees the man's watch, overpowers him, and steals his watch. Soon we see him at a salvage yard to sell his scrap steel and copper, including a few manhole covers.That is about all we get as a hint to his backstory, he clearly has little money, drives a very old Tercel, but he studies a lot on the internet and has ambitions to do something that will become high profile. He has a great belief in himself, but absolutely no scruples.One night when he happens upon the scene of a bad accident he stops and is amazed by the man filming the site. It is an activity he had no exposure to but, being a fast learner, figures it out and soon is getting footage that others miss, mainly because he has no scruples. And, as we eventually see, he is not at all above creating havoc so that he can get an exclusive.Bloom is ruthless, with his pursuit of havoc, in the way he treats the young assistant he hires , and in pursuing a relationship with a news director twice his age (Rene Russo, who was actually 60) otherwise he just may take his exclusive footage elsewhere. And as the story progresses we see his fees getting larger and his cars getting fancier.It is difficult to describe how good Jake Gyllenhaal is in this role. You get to really believe he is this half-crazed, egocentric prick who would, and does, throw anyone under the bus to get his footage. If he is first at a crime scene or accident he does nothing to see if he can help the injured, he just wants to get his footage.My wife said there aren't any good, sympathetic characters here, and that is about right. But it is entertaining in its relentless drive to show Bloom's focus on what he wants and seems to always get. Louis Bloom",

In short, the story is flat and stale. This is because the theme of seedy people in the seedy underside of society has been done so often that it's now a clich\u00e9. One need only to watch Chinatown or Crash to get a glimpse of the underbelly of Los Angeles. Indeed, even Pretty Woman (1990) deals with that subject.

Jake plays Lou Bloom, an intense and ambitious young man. He's also entirely self serving and seemingly without scruples of any kind. Therefore, he's a natural for the business of \"nightcrawling\": functioning as an independent operator who will show up at crime scenes, accident scenes, etc. and film the most lurid stuff possible to sell to local TV networks. Lou continues to up his game as the sordid story plays out, and finds something of a kindred spirit in Nina Romina (Rene Russo), a weary and hardened veteran of the news business.It's all too easy to be cynical in this day and age. The idea of characters such as Lou, who value self gain more than human life, and profit from the suffering of others, is absolutely believable to this viewer. While it may be tough for some people to stick with, given the nature of this guy that Jake is playing, he manages to be interesting and compelling BECAUSE of his deeply flawed personality. You may despise the guy, more and more as the story goes on, but you're always curious as to what depths he will sink. After all, this is a man who thinks nothing of rearranging a corpse at an accident scene for the sake of a better picture. Functioning as a counterpoint and something of a moral centre is Lou's assistant, Rick (the appealing Riz Ahmed), who is often taken aback by his unethical boss. And representing the seen-it-all extreme cynicism that experience provides are people like Nina, who realizes just how desperately her station will need to rely on Lou, and veteran nightcrawler Joe Loder (Bill Paxton, doing a solid job in a fairly small role).Jake is wonderful in what is one of the best performances that this viewer has seen in movies of the last few years. He truly is a talent to watch. And it's nice to see writer / director Dan Gilroy and the production give Russo what amounts to one of her best parts in ages.Slickly shot, entirely on location in Los Angeles. \"Nightcrawler\" is fairly long, at just under two hours, but it's so riveting at times that the time moves along quicker than one would think.Gyllenhaal was also one of the producers.Eight out of 10.",

After acquiring a sidekick, Lou's success and business partnership with a local news director (Rene Russo) afford him a level of personal success, but the extent to which he's willing to go for his work edges into an increasingly moral grey area.Going into \"Nightcrawler\" with a minimal knowledge of what the film was about, I was really surprised at its content; the entire profession of \"night crawling\" was something I'd never even thought about, so the film was fascinating just on a logistical level for that reason alone. Throw in a perfectly illustrated sociopathic antihero and top notch performances, and my expectations were far exceeded.While the film toys with the darker social mechanics of morality and journalism, there's a consistent undertone of dark humor that pervades throughout Gyllenhaal's performance, bubbling up in idiosyncrasies and one-liners, but \"Nightcrawler\" never allows itself to enter the territory of camp or silliness. There's a very sour core to the film, which is embellished with a sweet surface of slick cinematography and editing, and the smarminess of Gyllenhaal's disturbed and borderline translucent character is a large part of this. Rene Russo's performance as an equally desperate news director is on par with Gyllenhaal, and the role provides her not only a respectable platform for her return to the screen, but plenty of space to show just how great of an actress she is. Support from Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton is all solid as well.Overall, \"Nightcrawler\" is as befuddling as it is engaging. I left the theater with an unpleasant feeling, and therefore take it that the film was effective at at least one thing. Though it is a slow burn with marginal payoff by Hollywood standards, it is an engaging and incredibly well acted film that deserves an audience for those reasons alone. Social commentary or not, it's a glossy and subtly disturbing venture into the art of unease. 8/10.",

            "content": "Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a fast-learning young man striving to find his niche. If this involves theft, well, then he steals. He does what he needs to do to survive in this world red in tooth and claw. And he will claw his way up and out like an alien beast hellbent on smashing through the barriers that are blocking his existence.I must comment on Gyllenhaal's appearance in this movie. For this role he dropped a little weight and gave Bloom one of the leanest and hungriest looks I've ever seen with searching raygun eyes bulging out of their sockets ready to pounce on anything even faintly smelling of an opportunity to be grabbed and swallowed whole.At the beginning we catch him in the dead of night clipping off chunks from a chainlink fence with heavy weight pruning shears. Confronted by a security guard he at first claims to be lost, but then without warning he lashes out like a coiled serpent and strikes the man down. In the next scene we see him driving away admiring the man's wristwatch, which is now on his own wrist. At a scrapmetal company, he attempts to peddle the metal scrap he's stolen. Regurgitating a non-stop ratatat spiel, he frantically tries to cajole the scrapyard's owner to hire him. The owner cases him over carefully with a wary eye and snarls, \"I don't hire thieves.\" Bloom gives him a wry smile and mutely walks out the door. He must claw harder.Chastised and frustrated Bloom leaves dejected, driving off into the dark night. Cruising along one of the interminable LA freeways trying to figure out what to try next, by sheer chance he spots a car that has overturned at the side of the freeway. By sheer instinct he pulls over and gets out. A woman is trapped inside the car, which threatens to burst into flames at any minute. Two policemen are desperately trying to pull her out before the car flames up. A man, not a cop, is there frantically taking videos of the entire scene with hand-held camcorder. Bloom becomes instantly intrigued. He hears the man as he's calling to sell his tape to the highest bidding TV station as a stunner to open the early morning newscast. Bloom can feel the rush of adrenaline and excitement in this kind of work. He's hooked.At Venice beach he steals an expensive bicycle and trades it to a pawn dealer for a camcorder and police scanner. Armed with these he tries out this new game for himself and discovers he likes it. Likes it a lot as it turns out. Soon he's off making his own nocturnal forays across the city seeking out horrific accidents and shocking crimes, turning them into videos and hustling them to TV studios as blood-splashing openers for the morning news. Very quickly he lands on a particular TV studio to sell his wares to and obsequiously schmoozes up to the morning news director, Nina Romina (Rene Russo), a woman who herself has clawed her way to the top. She recognizes another clawer in Louis Bloom at first glance.At first Nina's in control but as Bloom's business picks up, he hires a down-and-out as his assistant, Rick (Riz Ahmed), and pretty soon he's turned the tables on her. He starts calling the shots and demanding more and more privileges and recognition. He's the master of the videos-for-hot-news game. But then he experiences a few setbacks. Nina shouts at him and berates him. He desperately needs a big story to sell the station on. And he lucks out. He gets a blasting hot one. Two thugs shoot a man, his wife, and their housemaid in their plush suburban mansion in Granada Hills. Bloom catches it all on his video recorder, including the license plate of the SUV the murderers flee in, all before the police arrive at the scene. The police are furious at him and want his footage.Perusing his video Bloom realizes he had the license plate of the SUV, which he excises from the film so that the police can't see it. He wants to get even more bang from his video. And this leads to the denouement when Bloom's true colors come out in a shocking revelation. To enhance his business and career he's willing to create a shootout setup to film leading-edge video coverage for the morning news. Rick (recently promoted to Executive Vice President of Bloom's business in an attempt to satisfy him) is aghast. At this point Bloom says to him, \"What if I told you I really don't like people.\" Rick doesn't want to have any part of it but finally Bloom gets him to take footage. But Rick pays dearly for his insubordination. And in the end Bloom's video news business blooms.Bloom exhibits a sociopathic personality. A person who uses other human beings as rungs to climb to the top, whatever that top happens to be. Or if you will, fodder for their success. Like Rick. And I've heard several psychologists claim sociopaths are much more common than one would image. Many of them will do drastic things to you if you cross them. Like Bloom.The acting's outstanding. I've seen Gyllenhaal in several movies and he always turns in a great performance. And his lead characters aren't always flattering. Like Louis Bloom. I don't purposefully see a movie because a particular actor's in it but I find myself seeing a bunch of movies with a particular actor in them because that actor's plainly superb. Like the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Or Gyllenhaal. The supporting actors are good too. Especially so Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed. Kent Shocknek has a cameo role as a male news anchor at the TV station. Not a difficult role for him to play I would imagine. The directing and cinematography are good, and the movie moves along well.10/10",

Dan Gilroy's directorial debut is arguably among the best since Shyamalan's Sixth Sense---another impressive debut with the similar under the bubble suspenseful psychological horror that keeps you on edge until the final minutes.How the writer behind Reel Steel and Two for the Money managed to imitate Fincher I'll never know, but it sure does help to have some Oscar-worthy acting at front and center. Jake Gylenhall as Louis Bloom is easily the strongest aspect of the film, as his character is like a bone-crushing car accident: brutal, uneasy to look at, but you still can't look away. This is Gylenhall's movie easily, as his cold eyes, anti-social demeanor, and psychotic way of life makes his character one of the best you'll see in cinema nowadays.Similar to how End of Watch (Also\u0085Jake Gylenhall) took a known lifestyle and then displayed the grim dark side of it, Nightcrawler chronicles the late-night lives of people that record and deliver the late-night news\u2014while simultaneously showing the ugly underbelly mannerisms behind what you see on television. Dan Gilroy's script pulls no punches as he not only writes an interesting character in an interesting premise, but also interweaves some clever and biting commentary about the pursuit of success and the murky morality during the rise to the top.But the movie never appears preachy because it still has a good story to tell, and consistently prevents you from figuring out how far, how deep, and how wicked it goes. Nightcrawler has a slow yet steady pace as it morphs from a glimpse of a lifestyle to a scenario that stems from it. The ascetics enhance the mood as the cinematography transforms Los Angeles into an eerie environment with heinousness creeping out of the dark corners everywhere. What is more surprising than Gilroy's superb directing debut is Howard's score which deviates far from his normal blockbuster orchestral feel and gives us a low-volume high-intensity score that undermines and bubbles under the silent terror of the hunt for grisly footage.What honestly kills some of Nightcrawler's momentum in the Oscar run and attempt to be the best film of the year is ironically David Fincher and Gone Girl. Gone Girl not only came out first, but also has the biting commentary that oozes out of its script, superb directing, and a phenomenal musical score that ties together a story that has few heroes, and even fewer chances of the audience figuring out its next direction. Gilroy makes a grand entrance, too bad it had to follow up the master of the broody underground cinema scene\u2014similar to how the wonderful David Bowie had to unfortunately follow (and never have a chance to surpass) Queen's legendary performance in Live Aid 1985.However it is cruel to bring up another movie when the one currently being discussed is still a great work of cinema. Gylenhall, Gilroy, and Howard are Oscar-worthy as their skills blend together to create one of the best films of the year, and a hell of a thriller overall. Even if the ending underwhelms and dissatisfies a little, there is no denying that Nightcrawler will leave an impression on you from the character of Louis to the slick writing and camera-work that perfectly unites him and the midnight environment slums from which he comes from.Nightcrawler is dark, dark chocolate: satisfying, fulfilling, and with that nice bitter aftertaste.",

Louis compliments Nina on her method of shutting down her colleague and says he learns quickly, later giving her a bit of self realization, putting her in her place. However, Bloom's never tested himself or has any sort of self-awakening, just cold and sinister. Rick's somewhat endearing and humorous, but only halfway. It's a unique ending, that he walks away freely with no comeuppance. There will always be those that cheat the system, so it's hard to compete fairly.

Jake Gyllenhaal does a fantastic job as an amoral sociopath who is far too committed to his work as a freelance videographer who films whatever graphic carnage he can and sells it to the local scuzzy news program who's ratings depend on this garbage. Rene Russo runs the late shift and her character and Gyllenhaal's develop an unhealthy dependency on each other, until it tilts in Gyllenhaal's favor to icky results. Russo, who has been absent from screens for the better part of this decade, turns in a sharp performance that she modulates almost perfectly as a past her prime news director just trying to stay in the cesspool of early morning news. These characters have no redeeming value and the film mines comedy from them reducing the worst, most horrific crime to a hefty payday or ratings. Cinematographer Robert Elswit films LA in a sickly, almost diseased way and director Dan Gilroy keeps the tone demented throughout as we watch Louis Bloom - who seems to be channeling some shades of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver - plummet down to some truly grievous depths. Nightcrawler is a cynical film that has the guts to never cop out on its repugnant subject matter.",

Louis is a low-life crook and con man that happens across the job of \"nightcrawling.\" Nightcrawling seems to be nothing more than listening to a police scanner and running around the streets of a major city filming tragedies. Because Louis has no conscience and no issues with treading upon laws and ethics, he gets film footage of things that other nightcrawlers can't (or won't) get.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the role of a d-bag too well. He's a pathological liar and a sociopath. As the movie goes, so does any remnants of his soul. He progresses from small time lying and thievery to practically setting up murders\u0085 all for his advancement.This movie takes me back to the 90's and the various sociopath-based suspense films I used to watch like Pacific Heights, Single White Female, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and others. You know, those movies with the despicable character that has everyone fooled and can't be stopped by traditional means. Nightcrawler treads along that same path and it's such a fitting title for Louis Bloom because he was a worm. Actually, I think that'd be an insult to worms.",

            "content": "Writer-producer Dan Gilroy's directorial debut Nightcrawler is a smooth, brightly colored, compulsively watchable movie that plays with journalism, employment desperation, and the motivational online-educated loner world of a marginal news bottom-feeder in the mean streets and freeways of Los Angeles. He's Lou Bloom, a lonely Angeleno who's hungry, driven, and amoral. Jake Gyllenhaal becomes an intense character actor here, moving way beyond the obsessive crime investigator he played in Fincher's Zodiac. Taking the coyote as his metaphor, the actor dropped 25 pounds for the role and played his scenes grinning, bug-eyed, and always literally hungry. Though with need and ambition instead of poetry in his heart Lou might fit into the fringes of the Hollywood outcasts of Nathaniel West's Day of the Locust. Now, Gilroy hasn't penned a high literary work. This is a kind of sleazy thriller, but with a witty satirical edge and an implied strident message. It knows not the network of corruption we find in James Elroy, only carjackings, baby killings, and home invasions. At its center is a creep we love to watch, and in spite of ourselves almost sympathize with. As we meet Lou, he's a scavenger (like a coyote), selling found or stolen copper wire and manhole covers to a wholesaler and delivering a comically detached, motor-mouthed job application that's instantly rejected: \"I won't hire a f-ing thief!\" But Lou happens on a bad car accident with a bloody victim and encounters the nocturnal world of free lance videographers who feed off accidents, selling lurid footage to the TV stations for the best price they can get. It looks perfect to him. He steals a fancy mountain bike and sells it to buy the tools of this game, police radio, camera, and starts chasing cop cars and ambulances He hires a desperate \"intern\" called Rick (Riz Ahmed) he hilariously \"interviews\" in a luncheonette using business-model lingo and agrees to pay a retainer of $30 a night to be his navigator and assistant, decoding police case designations, picking best routes. Suddenly, Lou is in his element. TV news at its most lurid \"viewer discretion advised\" level feeds off human misery just the way Lou does.Importantly, Lou develops a purchase source, the aging woman director of the region's lowest-rated TV station, called Nina (Gilroy's actress wife Rene Russo), a kind of desperate poor relation of Faye Dunnaway in Network. She buys and sells fear to suburban white people. \"The perfect story is a screaming woman with her throat cut running down a street in a good neighborhood,\" she says. Lou bargains intensely to raise his prices and status with Nina, and he clearly wants her as well as her patronage. Lou isn't clueless about people. He just doesn't like them. In fact he knows very well how to manipulate them. To speak of \"chemistry\" between Gyllenhaal, Russo, Ahmed, or Bill Paxton, who plays Joe Loder, a more experienced photo \"nightcrawler\" he follows, then climbs over, would be absurd. Lou exudes a kind of sweet, misleadingly innocuous-seeming poison, which doubles as creepy charm. Lou has gotten into all this by breaking the law, and it's not long before he starts overstepping bounds even more dangerously. His eagerness to get to news sites before his competitors, like Joe Loder, who humiliate him for his clumsiness and poor equipment at first, soon leads to his getting himself and Rick to crime or accident scenes before the police do. And soon enough he winds up essentially involved in and covering up a crime in order to get a scoop. But skimming the margins of the permissible and the legal is all in the cause of local TV and the business model works, even though some of the workers don't survive. Now there are several weaknesses in this movie. But they are not Lou's hilariously glib and clueless patter and the disarming manner in which Jake Gyllenhaal delivers it, nor the stunningly filmed speed chases in Lou's newly acquired red Mustang and the other dangers and excitements, nor the glowing day 35mm. film and night digital cinematography of multiple-award-winner and Paul Thomas Anderson regular Robert Elswit (Magnolia, There Will Be Blood). But the screenplay might have spread wider its picture of corruption beyond merely the camera hacks and the ratings-mad TV hacks who exploit them; the police are knights in shining armor here, so a whole dimension is missing. The movie further should not have been quite so continually caught up in Lou Bloom's own obsessions. It needed to step back and look at him from some cooler angles. Despite the more strident than necessary editorializing, and too intensely cynical, this isn't exactly fresh new ground that's being broken here. But it's still a creepily engaging, wonderful-to-look-at movie. If it's astonishingly polished and mature for a directorial debut, that's partly because of experienced family help. Dan has a twin brother, John, who's an editor, and another brother, Tony, who's a writer and director, and they were both on hand to help. Gyllenhaal, who co-produced, evidently contributed substantially to the spirit of the enterprise. And he delivers an amazing performance, as do Rene Russo and the rising British star Riz Ahmed. Nightcrawler, 117 mins., debuted at Toronto. Watched for this review at The Academy Theater at Lighthouse International, NYC at the courtesy of Academy member Marilyn Stewart, 29 October 2014.

            "review_title": "A wickedly brilliant thriller . . .",
            "content": "Nightcrawler is a wickedly brilliant thriller, a social satire and an eerie look into the mind of a sociopath who can manipulate with the power of cold-blooded reason. That sounds like a tall order, but this is a deceptively simple plot made functional by a well-mounted script and a near-perfect performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, a man who seems to be as bland as the white shirt on his back. He's a drool, square fellow who talks with the confident detachment of a marketing video and dresses as if he's stealing from Good Will. Outwardly, he's painfully unremarkable, the kind of guy that you pass every day without notice, just another face in the tapestry of your busy day.He lives on the fringes of Los Angeles. When we first meet him he's collecting scrap metal to make a few bucks. On the way home he passes a car on fire, and pulls over. What interests him is not the firemen rescuing the driver, but the presence of a man with a video camera (Bill Paxton) who is filming the action. Louis asks the man which news channel he works for, but the man tells him that he's freelance \u2013 he finds accidents and crime scenes, shows up, films footage and then sells it to the local news stations. Louis has a burst of inspiration and, before you know it, he's bought himself a police scanner and a cheap video camera and is scouting police activity.What is unsettling about Louis is how good he is at this new venture, and how willing he is to break every moral code in order to get paid. Before long he's crossing the police tape and snooping around the bodies with his camera to get the best and bloodiest images. His talent captures the eye of an attractive news producer named Nina (Rene Russo) who likes this guy's moxie. He does more work for the station, and demands higher pay. Before long, he asks Nina to dinner. What develops is not a romance, but an odd business arrangement built on curiosity and blackmail. At dinner he reveals himself to be a schemer, a deceiver, a liar and a manipulator with all the moral dignity of a bus station toilet. No one wants anything to do with Louis and yet he has such a bizarre method of concrete reason that you're surprised that the person in his cross-hairs doesn't fill the pauses with \"Go on.\" They are fascinated and so are we.Like Hannibal Lector or Travis Bickle or Gordon Gecco, we are fascinated by the charming monstrosity of this Louis Bloom. He's a man with the brain of a sociopath, a scummy little creature with the heart of a rat, and yet you can't take your eyes off of him. He has a way of motor-mouthing his way into whatever he wants. Watch carefully the way he turns the casual small talk of the dinner with Nina into a whirlwind of blackmail built on bold assumption. It's a brilliant piece of writing and acting.Nightcrawler was directed by Dan Gilroy who wrote the screenplay for The Bourne Legacy. Here, in his directorial debut, he has constructed a hard-bitten satire, a look at 21st century TV news which rises and falls on ratings and the holy sacrament of \"If it bleeds, it leads.\" Louis is the most effective supplier of this, choosing the lowest rated TV station in L.A. so he can bilk it for all it's worth.It's hard to describe too much of the plot without giving much away, except to say that when Louis films the aftermath of a domestic bloodbath before the cops show up, he ends up all but manipulating the news in order to get the footage. He's morally bankrupt, but we find ourselves glued to the action. We also find ourselves laughing at how willing this screenplay is to go for the throat. We laugh even when it isn't appropriate. Take, for example, the moment at the end when two people have an intimate conversation in front of a piece of footage on a screen. It's a moment so cold and heartless that you can't help but laugh.",

            "review_title": "VIEWS ON FILM review of Nightcrawler",
            "content": "Dan Gilroy makes his directorial debut with 2014's Nightcrawler. You wouldn't know it though because he comes off as a veritable, seasoned pro. Take the best neighborhoods in Los Angeles and make them seem unsafe. Take a calculated, free-fall actor and let him roam wild. Film a car chase that gets your blood pumping and your heart rate up, and make the storytelling interesting, absorbing, creepy, disturbing, and even nervously funny. That's what Gilroy does here. For 95% percent of \"Crawler's\" running time, I was blown away. I laughed, I cringed, and I sat numb and transfixed. Only an undeveloped interrogation by L.A.'s finest and a stomach-flu induced ending could keep me from calling this thing flawless. Would I endorse this exercise as realistic? Probably not. I watch the news everyday and it doesn't seem fathomable that dead bodies with grisly images would actually be shown on television. But you can't deny how fascinating or how original these proceedings are. Nightcrawler is one bitch of a ride. And sadly, I almost feel guilty for recommending it.With a film score that doesn't always trend towards the dour, a disregard for the L.A.P.D ever pulling over a excessively speeding motorist, and a look/feel that harks back to 2004's Collateral (also taking place in the city of angels), Nightcrawler gets you fixated on Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). He's unemployed, a thief, and a real weird dude. You don't know anything about him except for the fact that he becomes obsessed with filming crime scenes in order to pocket some cold hard cash (through the fictional Channel 6 news). He uses a police monitor, finds out where crimes are committed, and captures the hideous bloodlettings on video camera. He gets paid monster dollars for these trysts but eventually gets in over his head when he gets there before the police. There's an investigation on him, he almost gets charged for murder, but Bloom although lacking in social skills, is smarter than everyone. He starts to blackmail his newswoman, his co-workers, and the whole plank of Southern California. All the while he has his sunglasses on, he puts up a steely face, and gives the middle finger to anyone who might get in his way.Now the cast for Nightcrawler is proficient and noteworthy. Their roles are equal parts nasty, mean-spirited, unethical, and cold. Bill Paxton is as always, reliable playing a supporting role as a fellow rival to Bloom. He's jealous, angry, and ultimately pays the price for being his videotaping rival. Rene Russo (Gilroy's spouse in real life) is ravishing and frigid as Nina (she manages the news station where Bloom sells his findings). She wants ratings, wants respect, and doesn't give a hoot about what's right and what's wrong. Then we have Riz Ahmed as Rick. As Bloom's sidekick, he's startlingly effective. He may be poor and unwanted, but he still has a sense of decency and with a few un- choice words, goes down in a wave of palatable flames. Oh and did I forget to mention the great Jake Gyllenhaal. So OK, I've always been a huge fan. He never ceases to amaze me of how inventive an actor he is. If you've seen his nerve-endings brilliance in Prisoners and Zodiac, nothing will prepare you for how perfect he is in this role. It's obvious that he lost weight to play Bloom. You can see his cheeks sucked in, his gangly appearance, and his eyeballs looking like flying saucers that might just haunt your dreams. Daniel Day Lewis was in every frame of There Will Be Blood and held the screen in the palm of his hand. Gyllenhaal does it with a similar approach here but he goes a step further. He holds the screen like a molecule that can only be seen by the naked eye. Oscar nom anybody? I sure as heck hope so. Oh and did I mention that Jakey boy channels a little Travis Bickle a la Taxi Driver. He drives around L.A. just like Bickle drove around N.Y.C., is socially inept like Bickle, but he talks a little faster, looks a tad more desperate, and doesn't have a back story or nullified Mohawk like Robert De Niro's infamous, repressed psycho. To endorse Gyllenhaal, I'll give a short dissertation: there is no other actor in world that could have played Lou Bloom and I mean no one. No one!In conclusion, with superior yet far fetched direction from Gilroy and a social commentary that will cause your jaw to pretty much slam to the ground, Nightcrawler is the type of dark, L.A. based calamity that will \"crawl\" into one's head and stay there. It's horrifically brilliant because its main lead (Gyllenhaal) is astute in the most creepy, habitual way. For my money, one of the best films of 2014. Let the Oscar race begin!Of note: (spoiler alert) I'm gonna warn you, the last twenty minutes of this cynical, pale-hearted vehicle may upset you or leave you with a severely bad taste in your mouth. If you've seen Nightcrawler's trailer, you've probably figured out that Lou Bloom is the perennial bad guy. Well you're right. I for one hate when the bad guy wins and this is exactly what happens. In truth, this is the only stipulation I have for relegating a true four star rating.",

James Newton Howard's soundtrack fits very well here in the same way it did in It Follows (and not in The Guest)If I have one criticism, it's that the passage of time in between scenes sometimes catches you out - you don't know whether it's the next day or a couple of weeks later.

But something told me to stick with the movie, and in the end I am glad that I watched the entire thing. I thought that the movie was a good study of different characters in a disreputable occupation. I will admit that one theme of the movie - how uncaring and dirty-dealing the television reporting industry is - will come as no surprise to any viewer. But seeing how these different characters dealt with working in this industry was interesting. Though they were all loathsome, I was curious to see what would happen to them. Indeed, the movie has a very unHollywood ending (which I will not reveal except to say it felt pretty realistic.) And there are some real nail-biting scenes here and there to add some kick. But as I indicated in my summary line, this movie is definitely NOT for all tastes. I would suggest you read more reviews of the movie first before deciding whether it would appeal to you or not.",

            "content": "An ambitious young crime journalist probes the dark underbelly of L.A.Lou Bloom is a petty thief in search of a payday when he stumbles onto the scene of a grisly car accident, and witnesses a seasoned \"Stringer\" gathering video footage for a local news broadcast. Convinced that this is a career he could excel at, Lou purchases a police scanner and a video camera, and hits the streets. As a fast learner with an eye for detail, Lou isn't above manipulating a crime scene in order to get a picture that tells a story. When he beats the police to the scene of a deadly home, his shocking footage catches the attention of two homicide detectives who suspect he's hiding evidence that could be crucial to their investigation.....When watching this masterpiece, I noticed during the scene where Gyllenhaal is bargaining with Russo over money for the house invasion footage, how much he looked like Count Orlock from Nosferatu. Bug eyed, almost clinging to himself and even framed in the same way and then it struck me.It's the best vampire film ever made that doesn't feature a vampire.....Lou is more alert, more prominent at night, and he prowls the streets if L.A. Looking for his next 'victim'. But instead of feeding on their blood, he stores the footage and feeds on their bleeding and pain.Gyllenhaal portrays the sociopath with such genius, that at times, you almost forget that Lou is human, as the only real emotion he has is rage, but the writer doesn't dwell on the fact that he is angry. The audience know that he is responsible for one of the acts in the film, but the narrative doesn't need to explain it, that's how well Lou is fleshed out.Bloom is like a mix of Rupert Pupkin, Patrick Bateman, Norman Bates, and Raymond Babbitt, and to say that this is Gyllenhaal's finest hour doesn't give the actor enough credit.The film does feel a little familiar though, as if I was watching an early nineties thriller melded with elements of Manns Heat, Manhunter, and Collateral.The score is wonderful, and the support is brilliant also, Russo hasn't been this good in over 15 years, and Ahmed has chosen a wonderful breakthrough role.Belief the hype, its one of the years best, and you'll be thinking about for days after.Tense, funny, scary, and highly original.",

Its a character study of something that can only be characterized as a Entrepreneurial psychopath, if patrick Bateman wasn't in advertising. Lou Bloom, a desperate man ends up as sort of a journalist essentially selling video footage of news around the city the more sensational the better. Its a story about the spiral he gets into going deeper in the rabbit hole and you discover the character as he changes or rather brings out himself in this misadventure. I imagine productivity guru's or self help book writers whose only success is motivational speaking being something like this. Its like someones narrating a marketing, motivational bible and its brilliant.The silence in the film is beautiful and powerful its not a haunting feeling but you get time to absorb it in and just at the right time, the character would break into a beautiful monologue and every monologue levels up the character for you. Think of it as reaching a level boss in a video game and every time its a bigger and cooler looking boss. Its also about relationships and how he Lou Bloom deals with different people in different capacities how compartmentalized he is. From the trailer I imagined it to be much darker but it turned out just brilliant, it goes right in my must see list in the American psycho category.",

Jake Gyllenhaal plays a man who captures crimes and accidents and their aftermaths on camera to sell to news channels. There is a 'Breaking Bad' type of very dark humor amidst a morally bankrupt context. There are some very funny scenes with his assistant Rick - the interview and the salary negotiation. So to his \"date\" with news director (Renee Russo) is quite laugh out loud. The climax is exciting and disturbing at the same time. Jake Gyllenhaal is made up to look particularly ghoulish and gives a spellbinding performance as this anti-hero with few redeeming features. He delivers his originally hilarious lies with the business like terms perfectly. Renee is well cast as the slightly over the hill, big haired, morally questionable news director. I didn't think her look suited romantic roles well in the past but here she has found a good fit for her physical type. This is one of the best and most original movies of the year and deserves accolades in the upcoming award season.",

            "content": "Stringers in Los Angeles walk a fine line between artists and nuisance. A stringer is a person who drives around the city at night and uses a police scanner to track the location of crimes and accidents as they unfold. They try to arrive before the police and use video cameras to film the incidents and sell their footage back to news channels. This is real or as much as reality television can be and documented in a US TV show called Stringers: LA (2007). Nightcrawler, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, is a fictional representation of this occupation. It is directed by debut filmmaker Dan Gilroy, a former entertainment journalist who wrote The Bourne Legacy and brother of screenwriter Tony Gilroy. In hilarious and disturbing ways, the film asks what would happen if a nightcrawler not only filmed the news for money but manipulated it as well. Nightcrawler also dissolves society's moral boundaries as a person solidifies themselves as an entrepreneur, who might move the bodies slightly to get the right shot. Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is the film's protagonist or more precisely its anti-hero. He is first caught trying to steal metal from a fence, which he sells for money. Louis never sees himself as immoral but rising an invisible corporate ladder. The humour and huge laughs throughout the film are from Gyllenhaal's performance, drawing delusions of enterprise and ambition from his bulging eyes and childlike smile. He plays Louis as straight-faced and highly mannered and articulate, like someone who has over rehearsed himself for a job interview in spite of his openly deplorable actions. Louis doesn't have a backstory or friends or family. He is a twisted, subverted viewpoint of both the self- made man and the icon of American accomplishment. The initial premise of the film is simply him filming crime scenes for money. The plot though is how far he is willing to leap over the boundary lines and his rivals. Referencing how he filmed tornadoes in Twister, Bill Paxton has a small role as Joe a rival nightcrawler. He's pivotal not only as someone who hates Louis for being the competition but asserting Louis's singularity. Joe offers him a chance to work with his company but Louis refuses, determined to heighten his own empire. Louis records footage of various road victims and sells them to a news station run by the director Nina (Gilroy's wife Rene Russo). She sees Louis has a gift for capturing other people's misery. The more graphic and up-close the footage is, the higher the ratings and the payouts, which saves her job. There are pitch-black hilarious scenes where these two characters realise they need each other. Louis blackmails her into promising him sexual favours (unseen in the film), manipulating her desperation to keep her job during the demanding high ratings period. Louis and Nina are devoid of conscience or empathy. They are by-products of a dog eat dog world and the uncertainty of today's economy and lack of job security. Both are driven by monetising other people's misfortune, ensuring their own survival. Epitomising this lack of empathy is Louis's shift from independence to constructing a business venture by using other people. As well as a new sports car and enhanced equipment he also acquires Rick (played by Riz Ahmed), an intern who he refuses to pay and uses him to help locate crime scenes. Nightcrawler is therefore about how much people are willing to do in order to have a steady job in today's fluctuating climate. Where the film is most troubling is in the increasingly radical behaviour of both Louis and Nina and how immoral they'll become to make money. Through a number of very dark sequences Louis interrupts crime scenes. At one particular car accident he arrives before the police and then moves the body so that he can film it up close. In another scene he watches a shooting unfold and waits for the murderers to leave before entering and filming the victims. This is voyeurism at its sickest but I never disengaged from the character or story. I wanted him to escape before the police arrived, which is investment married to the nail-biting tension. Louis's involvement in the crime scenes are mirrored by the news channel. The film doesn't flinch in characterising the news stations as fear mongering for ratings. Nina watches her two news reporters on screen and coaches them during a broadcast to stress key words, reminding people of urban crime in predominantly rich, white neighbourhoods and hammering these points to sustain the story. In an age of Fox News or news channels telling us about non-event terrorism raids, can we start calling these scenes authentic instead of satire? One action at the end of the film feels sour but until then Gilroy's debut is hugely impressive. It employs and subverts a relatable subject matter, the necessity for people to find paying work, to access an otherwise terrible character. The pacing of this story appropriately runs at high energy, channelling the velocity and rhythms of an action movie. Filming mostly at night is also both stylistic and metaphoric because the film's characters evoke darkness. Louis Bloom, refreshingly devoid of redemption, isn't a person but an embodiment of the evil lying inside us. His journey isn't a transformation but a descent, stressing how far a person, one the director compares to a coyote, will overstep others to survive. The fact Gyllenhaal holds our attention and our care for so much of this film is an achievement but also strangely terrifying.",

A point was reached some two thirds of the way through where I began to wonder if this was not going to prove rather predictable and then we launch into the most incredibly bravura final section. The film had been good up till this moment but then becomes pretty delirious and including the best car chase I've seen for some time.

This flick is no exception.We're given insight into a unique corner of the world that has never been highlighted to my knowledge in film before. I'm not even sure if the concept of a \"nightcrawler\" is real, but what it means to go \"nightcrawling\" is to give television stations (or their competitors) the chance to give their viewers front-row seats to breaking stories.The footage they capture can be seen as raw and unprofessional, but our title character gets so in-depth he starts his own business where \"in order to gain job security you must make yourself an indispensable employee\"...at any cost. The film plays like a behind-the-scenes look into the world of television news, and could be seen as insightful as why our news is so dark. While the \"news\" is not at all the subject of this flick, the heart of the whole thing may just be how to get your own business running, but the plot itself plays perfectly in the background of a mad character study. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, a conniving manipulator who is more character than personality, both smart (even though he doesn't come from a \"proper education\") and psychotic (he'll do whatever he needs to get ahead), in a performance so precise we always know what's going on in his head and his motivation (business, capitalism) so haunting he almost disappears as an actor. The film itself almost makes you forget you're watching a movie from cinematography mixed with shaky-cam (\"steady hands\") so purposefully and editing that builds into an edge-of-your-seat climax culminating itself with a car chase of the like I haven't seen in years (even if it is still overly-edited).If this flick were made in the '80s, we would get sequel after sequel with new actors playing the main nightcrawler, but as the genesis film surely warrants a dozen rip-offs of an idea this great, this one will stay fresh in our minds for a long time.",

Gyllenhaal is joined by the equally effective Rene Russo, who plays the television news director who becomes overly invested in acquiring Lou's graphic film clips.The degree of sleaze apparent in both characters offers a fascinating social commentary on the degree to which news bureaus will stop at nothing to raise network ratings through the purveyance of lurid, tabloid stories.A successful news figure, Russo's character is depicted as part of the same mercenary mindset as Lou. The film even develops a bizarre personal compact between the two characters that implies a kind of sexual blackmail in their relationship.The direction of the film was superb with fascinating camera angles, set-ups, and location footage in Los Angeles.

The story is so close to reality (paparazzi, manufactured crime stories that blast out on the 11 PM news to give us nightmares, shady reportage, the extents to which some people will go for money and fame, etc) that at first the story is painful to watch unfold, but the performances by every actor in the film are so credible and exact and memorable that the film deserves to be high on the list of awards.When Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal in a brilliant performance), a driven man desperate for work, muscles into the world of L.A. crime journalism, he blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story. Aiding him in his effort is Nina (Rene Russo), a TV-news veteran and his 'hired intern' Rick (Riz Ahmed, in a career making performance). Lou is a guy who's a thief and hustler. He wants to do something else only thing no one wants to give him a chance. One day he witnesses an accident and while the CHP helps the driver, some men (Bill Paxton) show up and record the whole thing. He learns that they intend to sell the footage to a TV news program. So Bloom decides to get into it. He starts small. Eventually the station where he sells his footage to, is impressed with him. Later he comes across a murder and gets there before the police do and records the dead bodies. But he also manages to get the killers on tape but doesn't give it. Instead he intends to wait till he can call the police and record them being arrested. But it doesn't exactly work out that way.The cinematography by Robert Elswit, the musical score by James Newton Howard, and the brilliant direction by Gilroy coupled with the tremendous cast make this hard to swallow film a winner on every level.

I got some pictures with Jake (he's a really cool guy in person) and then sat back for what I expected to be a simple, entertaining movie and was very pleasantly surprised by a film that delivered so much more.Simply based on entertainment value, the movie is fantastic. The acting across the board is fantastic. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is like Jack Nicholson's in \"The Shining\"--so terrifying that it puts a grin on your face. The tension is built masterfully and it explodes onto screen in the form of car-chases, shootouts, and heart-pounding, breath-holding scenes of lurking danger. And visually it's pleasing as well. The city streets of LA look fantastic at night, especially when they're scattered with fiery wrecks, and the eerie glow that comes from the protagonist's camera-mounted light makes some of the more gruesome scenes really shine.All of this I expected. What surprised me was its ability as a satire. GYllenhaal's character basically embodies the sociopathic tendencies of modern news production, so as the movie delves more and more into his disturbingly twisted mind it also establishes a very interesting social commentary. It's highly entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time and isn't that what we go to the movies to see? When this film hits wide release, I hope it gets the success that it deserves.",

            "content": "Jake Gyllenhaal, perhaps known most for his role as Donnie Darko, the troubled teen with futuristic visions of destiny, may never truly escape that pigeon-hole. As Louis Bloom, he siphons similar traits of Donnie to bring us a character with the same intensity and psychological uneasiness. The main difference is that Donnie becomes a symbol of sympathetic teen angst amidst a growing world of discontentment and detachment. Louis' motive is purely out of survival, a man driven to succeed at any cost by his instinctive desire for rising above the average and middling. It has been reported that Gyllenhaal lost 20 lbs and did extensive daily workouts to perfect the gaunt, eerie gaze he utilizes, drawing our eyes to his as we watch him survey his surroundings and react. This is an opportunist who seemingly has no conscience as to his actions, which is obviously the message of the movie; a message that is, regrettably, nothing new to this most cynical and knowledgeable of ages.Writer/director Dan Gilroy seems to have attempted to stay loyal to the family modus operandi, that is to build quickly and quietly to an effective climax intended to challenge preconceived notions and foster thorough questioning of our understanding. His brother, Tony, did this to great effect in Michael Clayton, a similar story about a man driven to fight for survival, only in this case it was out a sense of moral righteousness. Louis' determination to succeed seems to stem from a desire to cement himself not only as a winner and accomplished businessman but also for fame and recognition from the larger community. This makes it rather apparent why Gilroy set the story in Los Angeles; not only for its endless supply of criminal activity but also its cult of narcissism and self-promotion. Alas, Gilroy never seems to drive to the heart of this matter, or at least drive into an area which we haven't already been exposed. There is a great deal of time devoted to Louis' interaction with the ruthless and desperate TV producer (Rene Russo) who lives by the ratings, which means she wants more graphic violence and less journalistic emphasis. She is, however, a pale imitation of Faye Dunaway's great performance in Network, who was far more ambitious and had more of an impact on the men in her life than Russo does. Additionally weak is the handling of violent crimes and accident scenes. Sequence after sequence point out how newscasters and news outlets want the story which sells above all else, which in this case consists of more violent and upsetting information. Even for a huge metropolis like LA, the amount of serious crimes within this narrative is very unsettling (although Louis uses the falling crime rate as a bargaining chip for his increasingly intense coverage of these scenarios). Yet, Gilroy sweeps all this aside in order to emphasize his righteous message. Instead, we get a gratuitously extended violent sequence that stretches plausibility and simply confirms our beliefs about these characters instead of evolving them. There is a great deal of dark comedy attempted in this story. Indeed, the audience seems to laugh right along with Gyllenhaal's bizarre and creepy intensity which also happens to be border-line parodist acting. Yet, how much does Gilroy intend to be comedic and how much is intended to be dogmatic? Whichever the case, the end result remains the same. How terrible it is that television news praises ratings and showmanship over honest and straightforward reporting? David Simon gave us this same message in a much more effective manner in The Wire (ironically, the weakest of all five seasons). Couldn't Gilroy, with the expansive potential of cinema, have at least delved into slightly darker, more provocative territory? As it stands, Nightcrawler remains a less-than-powerful expose on a subject with much more potentiality in this digital era, an angle Gilroy mysteriously neglects.",

A lot of people were buzzing about this movie and Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, then I read things about the screenplay and that is mainly why I was really looking forward to this film. Firstly, Jake Gyllenhaal gives probably the best performance of his entire career. He has blew my mind earlier this year in Enemy and he's elevating the acting level one more time. Gyllenhaal is fantastic because he manages to make you forgive who he is and what he has done before: he embodies perfectly this character. His performance is honestly worth an Oscar nomination alongside with Matthew McConaughey as he has as well did such good choices in the last years with Zodiac and Prisoners for instance. Secondly, the screenplay is a real masterpiece; you cannot stop focusing on the dialogue scenes and the fact that the character is becoming this obsessed guy trying to capture the perfect crime on film and making money doing so by selling it to news channel. As you watch him and his obsession you can actually see his evolution, him turning into this psychopath. It's really interesting as you are trying to figure out how his brain is working, what he is thinking, you're even starting to root for him and want him to succeed even if he's the protagonist and the villain of his own movie, Bill Paxton's character is likable next to him. In fact, he's not the most likable guy ever but he intrigues you, you want to know where he goes, see how he gets to the next step and how he optimizes everything. Moreover, Nightcrawler is a very good looking movie. But the main point here, is the understandability of his obsession as you know where he's coming from and little by little you understand him as a person. It makes you questioned yourself and it made me crazy. That is also why his performance works so well and why the screenplay is so good, it focuses entirely on characters. Finally, this movie has also the most suspenseful finale I've seen all year; the last 20 minutes are absolutely brilliant. Overall Nightcrawler is an interesting and intense character based movie evolving around the underworld of the news, with a brilliant performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.",

After last year's one-two punch PRISONERS (2013, 8/10) and ENMEY (2013, 8/10), NIGHTCRAWLER is screenwriter Dan Gilroy's director debut, set in L.A., the title refers to hired hands who usually drift at night, as soon as any accident or crime happens, they will rush to the scene and take lurid photos and videos, then sell them to the local media for highest bid. Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom is one of them, he is so good at it and professes that he is born to do this job, what's more chilling is that he is a callous sociopath with no moral boundary, even more shockingly is the society not only condones him, but encourages and rewards him bountifully. Gyllenhaal physically morphs into a slightly-built figure with his back a shade contorted, the weight-lost stunt now has become quite a norm in the industry (works wonderful for McConaussaince and Jared Leto in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB 2013, 7/10), and here it injects an ineffaceable first impression of Louis' character, makes his extra-widely-open eyes purposefully dominant, firstly one cannot help rooting for him because of his underdog confidence, for his ambition and obsession is so scorchingly determined, the performance is nothing but Oscar-worthy, Gyllenhaal stuns as one of the most dangerous and compelling sociopath ever on the screen, noticeably his barely-blinking bluntness, if one can recall his eccentric blinking in PRISONERS, you will realize how phenomenal he is, the devil is all in the details. Louis is not a guy deserves admiration, he is covetous, crafty, glib-tongued with mechanical oration, intriguingly he is also rather candid, both with his guileless assistant Rick (Ahmed) and with the Nina (Russo), the producer of the local TV news program, who stands for the usual haughty stereotype of media personage with a sole rate-seeking guideline. Russo shoulders on an intensely passive aggressive verbal battle with Gyllenhaal, and the mutual influences are being put under the magnifying glass with pungent smell, which will effectively give us some introspection to chew on afterward. In a modern capitalistic society, how far we have been gone? Dehumanising individuals in order to pursue success, this is the underbelly of humanity which Gilroy is gutsy enough to uncover, equally praiseworthy is Ahmed, he represents a realistic take on how crazy things are and his upshot is the harshest indictment of the encroaching injustice. The film mainly happens in the nighttime, Oscar-winner DP Robert Elswit (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007 9/10) capture the nocturnal seediness in a subdued tinge, evokes an uncanny tension whenever Louis is on the move, exploits the found-footage gambit to state a point. Also the car-chasing piece near the end is a masterful endeavor, on the whole the entire film is utterly gripping like an urban tale itself, though he might miss an Oscar nomination due to fierce competition and the dark subject matter, but for sure Gyllenhaal-aissance is officially on fire now! Next stop is Antoine Fuqua's boxer-drama SOUTHPAW, it will not just be another impressive physique sea change on the horizon.",

I know Gilroy has been in the industry for some time, but it's always great to see the work of a first time director and go 'wow'. Doesn't happen too often. It's a gripping piece, doesn't spoon feed; relevant topic and offbeat dialog really make this film come alive on contact. It's a great feeling to be in the theater and to sense that there is a steady, deliberate hand at work behind the machines. Elswit behind the camera is always an honor, as is the brilliant sight of 35mm film grain - we aren't treated to that enough anymore.

One of the best parts about the movie is the stunning performance and physical appearance/transformation of Jake Gyllenhaal. Lou is a character that much of the time makes you feel very uncomfortable thanks to the way he speaks and the way he is written. The plot always feels like it is progressing. There is a great feeling that you get of Lou's antics becoming more and more extreme. The film lacks humor and I think it plays to the style of Lou himself, a person that barely seems to know what humor is. The downside of this movie is too me it seems very plain. The point is to see how others interact with Lou as someone who very calmly and professionally responds. Lou does not evolve as a character only evolve in business, professionalism, and in relationships with others. Overall very interesting film with a dark tone that works well for the subject matter, but as a movie it seems that the 2 hour runtime plays against it seemingly wearing out the audience by the end.",

            "content": "Telling the tale of an internet-educated entrepreneur looking to crack into the sordid business of late-night crime reporting, you've probably never seen anything like Nightcrawler before. Tackling both writing and directorial duties, Dan Gilroy constructs a world that is eerie yet exhilarating, seedy but tempting; presenting a side of Los Angeles rarely captured on celluloid. From the opening shot it's clear that formula and convention has been thrown out the window, Gilroy preferring to subvert expectation with morally dubious characters and an unsettling progression of events that is creepily plausible. When you think it will zig, it zags, and when you think it will zag, it throws up a middle finger to predictability with any number of gasp-inducing plot developments, leaving you clenching your armrest for majority of the runtime. Its success is also attributable to the astonishing central performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, who lost weight and changed the sound of his voice for the role. Gyllenhaal's Lou Bloom is an utterly enthralling character who teeters on a knife-edge of sanity; his all-smiles and wide-eyed disposition making the rage bubbling underneath the surface that much more unnerving. This is Gyllenhaal's show without question, however he's given solid support by Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed as a ferocious but failing station chief and Bloom's gentle- natured sidekick respectively. Mix in Robert Elswit's tremendously atmospheric night-time cinematography and James Newton Howard's pulsing score and you have one of the best motion pictures of 2014.",

The calm demeanor of Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) was one of the things that made this film interesting. He used this calm demeanor to get what he needed out of people, even if he was arguing with them he remained calm and I think that's one of the things that made this film, also his deceptive and cunning ways and his drive to take him to the top and to be the best at what he does played a big part in it too. The action sequences were just right. It wasn't way too much, it was just enough to give the film that edge and excitement.

All right, just me then. Anyway, this film \u2013 also entitled 'Nightcrawler' has absolutely nothing to do with superpowered mutants and more to do with the dark, seedy behind-the-scenes world of modern newsrooms. I do like X-men, but I like this more.Jake Gyllenhaal \u2013 once again \u2013 plays a brooding and possibly damaged character. We're never really given much backstory regarding how or why he's like he is. He just is. And he's just dark \u2013 possibly a modern day sociopath. While I was watching this film, all I could think of was 'American Psycho.' Not that Jake spends his evenings slicing up ladies of the night. He's far more subtle than that. He doesn't set out to cause misfortune, he simply realises that there's money to be made from other people's suffering and therefore decides to exploit this situation by becoming an independent cameraman on the streets of L.A.It's fair to say that this is hardly a 'noble profession' and he quickly discovers that he has to cut the metaphorical throat of anyone who stands in his way. Watch out rival cameraman played by Bill Paxton \u2013 it's not just aliens, Terminators and Predators who are out to get you! Gyllenhaal's character adapts with ease to this lifestyle, happy to step on anyone who gets in his way in pursuit of the next big scoop. In many films they say you have to 'relate' to the central character in order to enjoy the story. I doubt many of us will 'relate' to a man who is quite happy to trample anyone who gets in his way in order to further his own ambition, but then I doubt many people felt like they identified with Patrick Bateman and 'American Psycho' was a pretty big hit! If you watch 'Nightcrawler' you need to be prepared for a pretty bleak and dark insight into the way the world (or rather modern day news) works. It's hardly a 'feel-good' film and the whole show rests on Gyllenhaal's shoulders, but, as with many of his films before, he carries it all the way. It's weirdly hypnotic and you'll want to see just how far he'll go to achieve his self-serving ends.Ultimately, it's another notch on Gyllenhaal's impressive range of deeply disturbed characters. Don't expect a laugh a minute, side-splitting two hours, just get ready to descend into the underbelly of society and what it takes to get those 'exclusive' pictures on CNN or Sky News.",

Although a bit slow in the first ten or fifteen minutes, the film, and more accurately, the character of Gyllenhaal pulls you in and does not let go for an hour and a half.

It's quite a slow film to get going, though we are taken in to the main story rather quickly, it takes a while to give the audience a clear idea of what is going on, what are this characters motives and why he has chosen to take this path, but the journey is important. Louis Bloom is an extremely well written character, he's creepy, unrelatable and nothing like a normal human, but Jake Gyllenhaal still managed to make him likable, he's an anti- hero, but I found myself rooting for Bloom all the way through and wanting him to succeed in his objectives, any film that can do this which such a corrupt and strange character is a winner in my book, and Gyllenhaal deserved an Academy Award nomination. A thrilling and very interesting tale, I would recommend Nightcrawker to anyone looking for a good crime film or thriller.

If it rises to the category of satire, as many of the reviewers here think, it's hardly original in attacking TV news for featuring crime and blood as a way to boost their ratings. That's been done a hundred times, and often much better than this. Most of the action consists of a guy rushing up to a n accident or crime scene and pushing his way into the chaos to get video footage. Not much of that sticks in your memory.The movie's one saving grace is the driven, manipulative insanity of the main character. Gyllenhaal has a gleam in his eye that, even in the quietest moments, makes it clear that this guy, for all his attempts to charm people, is crazy and dangerous. There are plenty of time-wasters worse than this.The writers deserve special credit for one scene. The main character's attempt over dinner in a Mexican restaurant to seduce the woman who's in charge of buying his videos is so wacky, so remote from any normal relationship, that it's humorous at the same time that it's appalling.

Lou Bloom, the protagonist and at times the antagonist, is a lone wolf, who quickly becomes Johnny on the spot news cameraman as he takes us on a tour of what it takes to make it in the Los Angeles news market. In a broader sense it really reflects reasons why society tunes into the news and why the news itself is manipulated...because we want to be manipulated.The movie is perfectly executed. It has a low budget and independent feel to it but that's actually one of its strength. Because of this, the story becomes more personal and compelling. It has unique and original set pieces that are carefully structured in a way that you can never fully get ahead of the character but pays off in ways that you don't expect. Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance yet.It's been years since I've seen a thriller that literally had me on the edge of my seat and this one did it. The noodles shop scene is one of the most suspenseful sequences I've ever seen. I don't know if Hitchcock could have done that scene any better, and I've seen all of his films, all 56.

But Nightcrawler proved again, that my first hunch about this actor was right. Without any pretentious manner Gyllenhaal embodies, almost in most humanely way possible, the vicious and 'every men for himself' world of media. There is a cold, detached and almost determinist way about this movie. In this, the movie becomes a perfect replica of what it is trying to represent: a cold and immoral attitude towards the suffering of others. And this is not the whole story. Media and its workings, how standards are being lowered in a self-perpetuating way, the shiny but bullshit titles of business management and human resources, violence and its banality are all possible starting points for discussion based on this movie.

As the film brightens, he genuinely looks like a creature of the night: pale, fleshless, with huge sunken eyes.

The film picks up where we see him driving home one night from his dead-end job, fossicking for scrap metal which he sells to a junkyard. Lou spots a couple of men with video cameras near a highway car crash. These are nightcrawlers, freelance reporters who cruise the streets of Los Angeles listening out for police radio reports of accidents and crimes, which they film in hope that the footage will be picked up by the morning news. Fired up, Lou buys a cheap camcorder and starts doing the same himself, finding a mentor in Nina (Rene Russo), a television producer who sees the grisly footage supplied by her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as a short cut to higher ratings.Many have considered that the character of Lou does not go fully crazy as compared to Christian Bale's character in American Psycho (as in over the top), which seemed to have been false advertised, but the film as a whole keeps you on your seat, and it flows very well.

Not only to they obstruct the views from others trying to capture the event with memories, but the filmed footage can never do the outing any justice and will likely never be viewed again. Focusing on capturing the event more or less creates a new intention. Rather then going to listen to the music and talking about what the songs meant or even the artist themselves, the idea now is to bring proof that you were there; to say that you attended the Nicki Minaj rather then enjoyed and had fun at it. I compare those that film concerts in whole similar to the camera crews hired by studios to capture the grittiest of news. For cases like a mass murder, it means trying to find footage of the victims or at least something that was affected by the weapon used. For something unimportant like a DUI, it might amount to shooting the poor sap getting arrested and making a buffoon of him later on. The television studios that show this stuff know that people will watch because they know that most are addicted to anything grizzly happening in their part of town, even if it has nothing to do with them. Nightcrawler examines one such camera guy who takes advantage of the situation.Louis Bloom (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a sociopath who doesn't work, but makes money as a thief. He's well read as he shows in one scene where he talks to a construction guy about a job and what he can offer him. Louis is turned away, not aware that he probably scared the guy more them impressed him. On his way home, he witnesses a car crash along with a camera guy, Joe Loder (played by Bill Paxton) shooting the mess. Inspired, Louis buys a camera and a police scanner to get himself in the business. Though he comes to several dead ends, he eventually captures something worthwhile enough for a local TV station to notice. A morning news director, Nina (played by Rene Russo) buys the footage and tells Louis to continue. This gets him to hire an intern, Rick, and starts turning to altering the crime scene to make things more interesting. Nobody else sees Louis doing his dirty deeds, so he is able to become a hit for the station. Rick is the only one in on Louis' actions and might be the only one to turn the tables.Nightcrawler fits right alongside Network and The Truman Show on great movies about the dark side of television. What got me was that it made clear that media companies may know us a bit better then we know. They know we follow patterns on what time we tune in and what to expect. Nightcrawler exposes what people really want; something important to talk about at work, whether it's really a big deal or not. Jake Gyllenhaal has always been kind of a filler actor; a guy that can do a good reading, but has never managed to surprise me. He finally does here, giving a performance that's not only worthy of an Oscar, but may be setting himself a place in the scariest characters on screen. Like Norman Bates or Alex DeLarge, Gyllenhaal delivers a character that is absolutely terrifying because we can never understand what goes through his head. There's never any sympathy for those he invades; he shoots and makes money. The nights of Los Angeles are the perfect backdrop for this setting, filling our characters with unnatural lighting and ideas. I'll give this ten camera flashes out of ten. Nightcrawler is seedy, sleazy, and a great thriller for those that want to see something held besides a gun. How about a camera?",

            "content": "Only four years before the release of this film, Jake Gyllenhaal was bronzed, maned and six-packed, and ended up watching Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), a blockbuster based on a popular video game (always a bad idea), crash and burn both at the hands of the critics and in terms of box office receipts. Hollywood's attempt at sculpting this young actor we first saw as shifty and strange in Donnie Darko (2001) into something he was not, had failed miserably, and it seemed he was destined to fade and disappear. Four years later, it's difficult to imagine Gyllenhaal as anything other than the great actor he has become.In Nightcrawler, he plays Lou Bloom. When we first meet him, he's trying to steel metal to sell for scrap, attacking a security guard when he is caught and stealing his watch. He sells what he steals, trying to cement a business relationship with the manager of a construction site, pitching his long-term ideas in Googled sales- speak. The guy isn't interested, maybe because he doesn't want to get into business with a criminal, or maybe it's because Lou is just so damn strange. He's clearly highly intelligent, observant and extremely driven, but with his bug-eyed glare, greasy hair and gaunt exterior, mixed with an unnerving politeness, you wouldn't want to be caught alone in a room with the creep.Driving home disappointed but not deterred, he comes across police sirens and a grisly auto-mobile accident. It's not the blood and guts he's interested in seeing, but the collections of 'nightcrawlers' who emerge out of the night, cameras swung onto their soldiers, filming anything they can of the grim wreckage. Ever curious, Lou questions one of them, Joe (Bill Paxton), who explains the in's and out's of what they do before darting off to sell what they have to the highest-bidding TV station. Purchasing a video camera, Lou gives it a try. He employs Rick (Riz Ahmed) to listen to police scanners and direct him to the pay-checks, and forms a professional relationship with 'vampire shift' news director Nina (Rene Russo), who gets first dibs on any footage Lou shoots throughout the night.First time director Dan Gilroy, Russo's husband and writer of forgotten Emilio Estevez vehicle Freejack (1992) and the more recent The Bourne Legacy (2012), manages to keep the film a right mix of black comedy, neon-lit thriller, and biting satire. It's also a film about L.A., a city that, in Lou's eyes especially, only comes alive at night, where every corner could lead to another shocking story to spark fear into morning viewers, and bumping Lou up the corporate ladder in the process. Things are pushed to the extreme in Nightcrawler, but it's alarming to realise that we are bombarded with graphic images in various media outlets every day, but for what reason? Is it part of a bigger picture aimed at controlling a terrified and increasingly paranoid audience, or is it simply because, deep down, we want to see them?As Lou's thirst for recognition, respect and financial success becomes increasingly unquenchable, he begins to manipulate things for his own gain. From the opening scene where he may or may not have killed a man, we simply don't know what he is capable of. He first moves a corpse so he can get a better angle when he arrives at a car crash before the police, and things spiral outward from there. Whether it's Gyllenhaal's stunning performance (Oscar hang your head in shame) or the idea of if we are to exist in an evil world, then why not excel in it, I wanted this slimy opportunist, who represents everything I hate, to succeed. It loses it's grit and focus towards the end, but Nightcrawler is an accomplished debut, managing to be fun, repulsive and both beautiful and ugly to look at.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "\"Nightcrawler\" is an amazing directorial debut for writer/director Dan Gilroy. The film could best be described as a \"guilty pleasure,\" in that the film's protagonist, Lou Bloom, is far from what you would call a sympathetic paragon of virtue. Quite the contrary, Bloom is a sleaze-bag who you will still (to a certain extent), end up rooting for.\"Nightcrawler\" is more of a fable than a docudrama. I say this because in reality a character such as Bloom could not succeed in the real world of television news. His beating the cops to the punch at a triple homicide crime scene seems most unlikely but even more implausible is that the TV news show would ever broadcast his footage (c'mon folks, have you EVER seen such graphic footage appear on television news?). Let's face it, the station would never subject itself to the liability of broadcasting such carnage anytime of the day, let alone the prime time evening news. Nonetheless, Mr. Gilroy is still making a great point: there's a voyeur in almost every one of us and the powers that be in the media will capitalize on this, for any kind of buck. \"Nightcrawler\" succeeds as a rollicking entertainment due to its deftly plotted script. After Bloom finds his calling as a freelance video journalist specializing in accidents and crime scenes in affluent areas, we immediately see there's something a little different about this self-appointed entrepreneur: Bloom is much more aggressive than his rival Joe Loder, who has been shooting video footage for years.In each scene where Bloom plies his trade, Gilroy keeps raising the stakes. As a neophyte, Bloom gets in a little closer than Loder does while shooting footage of a carjacking victim; and later, Bloom re-arranges the position of a car crash victim, in order to get a better shot. In his personal life, Bloom raises the stakes with Nina Romina (Rene Russo), the morning news director: he'll give her exclusive footage only if she sleeps with him.Bloom has a momentary setback when Loder beats him to the scene of a small plane crash but Bloom then takes Loder out of the game by sabotaging his van (resulting in serious injuries to Loder when the van crashes). The penultimate, heart-pounding event occurs when Bloom (along with Rick Carey, the down on his luck assistant, Bloom hires) come upon a home invasion, just as the assailants are leaving the area. Bloom gets footage of the criminals and also videotapes the victims inside the house, all dead from gunshot wounds.Gilroy ups the stakes even higher when Bloom locates the criminals who were responsible for the murders during the home invasion. Instead of initially telling the police who they are, he follows them to a fast food store and then calls 911, intending to videotape the confrontation the police end up having with the bad guys at the store. When one of the bad guys escapes the shootout, Bloom and Carey follows him in a heart-pounding chase. Bloom's sleaziness is seen in high relief when he orders Rick to videotape the remaining criminal, who appears badly injured after his SUV crashes. Bloom insists the man is dead but throws caution to the wind, still ordering Rick to get in close for some good shots. Sure enough the bad guy is still alive and shoots Rick in the chest. As he lays dying, Bloom has no guilt feelings about videotaping his fallen employee, who he knows will bring in more income when he offers the footage to Romina.As it turns out, the footage that Bloom has garnered, is a big sexual turn-on for the now-impressed Romina. Bloom's desire to get ahead is in effect rewarded by society as he now purchases two new vans and hires a group of interns to assist him. While the police have no evidence to prove it, Bloom's unethical behavior is ignored by his patrons, who reward him for his brazenness.\"Nightcrawler\" is a most impressive debut for Mr. Gilroy, whose fairy tale/fable succeeds in its depiction of a charming rogue, who will stop at nothing, to succeed in the television news business. \"Nightcrawler\" manages to not only entertain greatly but in its satirical overview, it castigates a society much more interested in rewarding those who wish to get ahead at the expense of ethical behavior.",

Dan Gilroy wrote an excellent script and then finished it up with an equally impressive directing performance. But the real star, thanks largely in part to Gilroy's character creation, is Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role of Louis Bloom. From the moment we lay eyes on him we are hooked in and he never lets us go. Definitely his finest performance to date and I suspect an Oscar nomination could well be on the cards.There twists and turns left right and centre and never a dull moment. Everything feels original (how refreshing is that), yet I wouldn't be shocked to learn that 2012's 'End Of Watch' (also starring Gyllenhaal) had some influence on this because some scenes come across very similar. Both are very fine films. There's a nice touch at the end where we are treated to a shot of the Hollywood sign amidst an ending that's anything but \"Hollywood\".",

There's no \"aw\" inspiring moment you should have when you see a finished masterpiece, it lacked the moral of the story! To me it seemed like the end of Rocky minus the part where Rocky actually takes the risk of making something big with himself and moving from being a so called loser to the guy who took a shot and inspired everybody to get \"the eye of the tiger\" out of us all by getting what he deserved, it's like the Felina episode of BreakingBad minus the actual ending --no higher meaning...

            "content": "Although visually gripping at times, Nightcrawler lacks any real depth in story, character development, tone, and believability. Gyllenhaal's portrayal of a sociopath, Lou Bloom, is pleasantly eerie, and worthy of recognition by audiences. However, Lou is not your typical anti-hero, in that he has no redeeming qualities, and therefore, we cannot root for him or feel any empathy. Lou is somewhat destitute in Act 1, a petty thief who scrapes by. His \"big break\" comes when he is able to steal a bike and barter it for a \"video\" camera. Soon, he discovers a hidden talent: the ability to successfully arrive at accident scenes before other \"nightcrawlers\" and film gory footage. He sells his footage the only way he knows how; by bombarding a local news station and convincing Nina, the news director during the graveyard shift, played by Rene Russo, that his work is truly \"art\" and worth air time. And this is one sloppy metaphor and/or commentary on current broadcast journalism that Nightcrawler tries to hammer into your head. We have lost any semblance of decency as a TV viewing nation, that capturing video of accident victims bleeding or dying is fascinating and seen as art rather than tragedy. From here, Lou's business expands and he hires Rick, an unemployed, uninteresting guy with zero skills, to be his intern. This is all we need to know about Rick. To push the story along, the filmmakers decide to use an 80s style montage during which Lou and Rick buy fancier equipment, a new car, and develop an increased passion in nightcrawling. Though their business is expanding, Lou continues to freelance and sell his footage to Nina, and only Nina by directly handing her his videos in person. Feels like this was written to be made in the late 1980s. The film aims to be tense and story driven. Instead they interject comedy at inopportune moments, and lose a real chance to delve deeper into a potentially fascinating character study. The writing is sloppy and the characters are one dimensional. Lou's ability to interfere with active crime scenes, google search license plates, and cut the brakes of a rival's van (a tired and lazy movie trope)are all too convenient and without any conflict. Not stylistically aesthetic enough to be strictly a visual movie, such as the Ryan Gosling film, Drive, Nightcrawler just fails to deliver any story or message of substance.",

Also like Gone Girl, this is primarily due to the ending which, again like Gone Girl, has a character that the entire movie spends establishing as an unlikeable piece of **** winning. Now, with Gone Girl, I was also critical because said character won for stupid reasons. Here? There weren't any stupid reasons about it, but the ending was... the movie sorta just stopped. No major developments, not much happening in the aftermath of the climax, it just ends. It was the kind of ending that makes you think \"did they just run out of script?\" rather than anything positive. You can't do that! The ending is the note you're sending your audience home on! The impression the ending leaves is gonna be their impression of the movie!And you know what the worst thing is? THIS CHARACTER IS THE PROTAGONIST. I AM UPSET THAT THE PROTAGONIST WON. The entire second and third act, I wanted nothing more than for him to get his comeuppance, and that never happens. And it's not because he does immoral things, that's beside the point, I'm actually quite fond of the villain protagonist trope, but no matter what your protagonist needs to be likable, and if not he needs to get what's coming to him! Otherwise, you fail at storytelling! And besides that, the acting is \"meh,\" the dialogue is \"meh\" and while I will say it was shot really well, that's not enough to save a movie.

            "content": "Review: I quite enjoyed this twisted movie about a down and out, weird fellow who struggles to find employment and over hears a news reporter selling footage of a car wreck for quite a bit of money. He then steals a bike a buys some filming equipment so he can set out and get his own footage which he can sell to a news network. After a while he employs another cameraman to help him take his exclusive shots, and they turn up to a crime scene before the police arrive, which shows the brutal murder of 3 individuals. The movie had a original storyline which shows how far the paparazzi will go for an exclusive. In this case, Gyllenhaal does have a bit of a twisted mind and he was willing to go really far for his business but when you see the other people in the same career, they all seem the same frame of mind. He sleeps in the day and works at night and his hunger for exclusive footage, really does go to far. Anyway, it's an interesting movie which keeps you on the edge of your seat, but there are some sketchy parts of the storyline that wasn't well explained, like why he didn't get shot. Watchable!Round-Up: Its good to finally see Gyllenhaal play a role that's completely out of his comfort zone. His whole approach to this, very much troubled, character was convincingly brilliant and his expressions and mannerisms really did work. I also liked his friendly companion, played by the English Riz Ahmed, because he seemed to be the only person with any brains. I did think that the film was going to change into a psycho killer type of concept, which made it unpredictable and quite fresh throughout. Its also a very moody film, because it's mostly set in the dark, so you do have to be in the right frame of mind to actually enjoy it. After such a long time away from the big screen, Rene Russo played her role well and at the age of 61, she still looks like she did in the Lethal Weapon movies. Anyway, this is quite a good film with loads of material to keep you glued to the screen.Budget: $8.5million Worldwide Gross: $39millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/thrillers about a lonely, unemployed man who buys a camera to film exclusive footage to sell to a news channel. 7/10",

He also keeps his cool for most of the film and says kinda brutal stuff in that calm voice, making it sound more effective. The movie shows the lengths to which journalists go to (i.e. invading crime scenes) get stories and money. On top of that, Bloom (Gyllenhaal's character) is severely apathetic. Gyllenhaal definitely performed well as a desperate man turned desperado (in a way). This was also a rather simple movie (low budget, good performances and writing) and I like that (I hate overspending and then losing a ton of money). The music also fit the situations nicely, especially the montage of Bloom filming crime scenes, downloading video files and buying stuff (that particular bit was smooth and not too loud). Riz Ahmed (THE PILOT from Rogue One) later comes in and also fits his role as Rick, another desperate man, quite well - not having a lot of dialogue, but still having enough for people and Bloom to understand him. His California accent is also suitable. This movie's story is entertaining (proven by a nomination for Best Original Screenplay) and it's fun to see how much Bloom controls his world and the people around him, through whatever means necessary. I think my only criticism is Bloom's personal history not really being explained. Nonetheless, this movie's damn good.",

When he is first on the scene to a house invasion with three dead he gets the money shots but also withholds evidence in hopes of stage managing an even bigger exclusive.Gyllenhaal is annoyingly excellent as the creepy Bloom, a focused pragmatic, misfit void of empathy and compassion. He may lack social skills and border on psychotic but his self confidence and deductive reasoning remains dispassionately sound. In a strong supporting role Rene Russo's news manager may be more grounded but she is just as jaded and perverse as Bloom as she plays fast and loose with the truth for ratings.Writer director Dan Gilroy does a fine job of maintaining suspense while hammering home the theme of the media run amok. In addition cinematographer Dan Elswit's night shots and fractured hand held imagery inform and provide a suitable backdrop to Bloom's task at hand. It is the highly effective and disturbing performance of Gyllenhaal though that remains at the center of Nightcrawler, elevating it to an above average thriller with some hints of Network thrown in.",

Laser-focused and analytical in all things, he's amoral to the core. He communicates in long, precise sentences that cut straight to the point, strategically disarming his conversational adversaries before they even know they've entered a sparring match. If not for the obvious physical indications, one might question if he's human at all. The one exception might be his fondness for composition, an endless pursuit of sublime photographic harmony amidst the broken glass and shattered bodies of a fatal auto accident. The rescue crews and police officers, also present amidst the carnage, are mere obstacles between his lens and the natural beauty he finds, bleeding and gurgling, upon the asphalt.As Gyllenhaal grows bolder and more calculated in his nightly hunt for that next great shot, the stakes increase and his eye grows more selective. It all culminates in a masterful climax, a white-knuckle chase scene, that pulled me from my cozy spot on the couch to a closer seat on the floor, a few feet removed from the TV screen.

            "content": "Monomyth be damned! Who needs a hero when a villain's journey is as compelling.Jake Gyllenhaal, as Lou Bloom, portrays a sociopath with a survival instinct in high gear. He has the wits and intelligence to carry him through. After going through multiple trades (well, only one is shown in the movie, but I am assuming Lou does try his hands at multiple career choices) he finds his calling in free-lance journalism. With raking in the money and uplifting his business high on the agenda, and ethics pretty low down, we are set up for a drama, which is unexpected, and dark.This movie is unique in the sense that it really doesn't have a hero. Lou Bloom, make no mistake, is a villain. He is compellingly played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Not much back story is given about Lou Bloom. I have so many questions on how did Lou Bloom end up being the bad guy he becomes? Troubled childhood? Abusive Father? You know, the usual suspects. But not all stories can be told in 2 hours. So we make do with ones that are told. And the one told here, the present of Lou Bloom, is a gripping tale.While Jake Gyllenhaal steals the show with his stellar portrayal of Lou Bloom, the real star of the movie is the fantastic dialogue. Lou Bloom spews venom and menace without uttering a single swear word. His negotiations will make your blood curl, and you wouldn't want to be across the table from him, when he has the leverage. You wouldn't want to be his coworker, or boss, or competition, and certainly not his employee.The movie is paced pretty well, with not a dull moment in between. At times it feels hurried, because some plot points are glossed over, but nothing that wrecks the story. The climax is fantastic because of it's sheer uniqueness... it has the bad guy chasing the cops! When did you ever see that. Some might complain, that the story did not end. But you have to understand that in this movie, there is no hero who ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder. Therefore, there is no decisive victory to be had. But the tale, nonetheless, is captivating.",

We learn early on he also has the capacity to lie convincingly as well as possessing a capability for violence if pushed. There's really nothing else to him than that. When he chances upon the ideal profession for him, hawking video footage of accidents and crime to local news shows, his only path is to become ever more successful and duplicitous. When he stoops to increasingly greater lows it really comes as no surprise, given that Gyllenhal decided to play him as a general weirdo from the beginning, all starey eyes and toneless voice. He doesn't go on any journey, he doesn't change. As he's not remotely likable, and there's no indecision on his part, there's no real thriller element, either. Finally, he finishes as he started and we are where we started: square one. Imagine a Silence of the Lambs but where Lecter is the protagonist, not the antagonist, but with deliberately no charisma.Rene Russo, however, is fantastic as the News Director, Louis's main client, with whom he embarks on an abusive relationship, though you always feel she could eat him for breakfast. Russo's acting is a masterclass in nuance and sheer presence and you can see why Louis falls for her, despite the big age gap.One last major problem I'll mention is the plot holes - for example, Louis's story to the police at the end is indeed implausible and it would have been easy to come up with a better one. He could have said that the perps saw his car, tracked him down and threatened him not to go to the cops, he made his escape, circled back and saw them at the restaurant. Not \"I forgot I did see them after all\". The detective is rightly dismissive of this, but he nevertheless gets away with it.With a bit more work on the story and much more work on the characters this could have lived up to the promise of the trailer. It's a great premise, it is enjoyable in places, but it is not essential viewing.",

The film has him walking easily through police tape, wandering around on crime scenes - no questions asked, driving side by side with police during vehicle pursuits, standing as close to car accident victims as the emergency responders, etc. In reality he would have been arrested or kicked off the scene in about thirty seconds.Second is how the news channels quickly buy this graphic and mostly illegally shot footage and show it almost uncut on their next broadcast. When is the last time you saw (or heard) of a newscast showing dead bodies, blood, murder weapons while the anchors impromptu narrate it. \"Oh, that looks like a female victim shot in the face.

And I also have had a feeling the script was made by someone completely ignorant of the issue at hand based on some sensationalist blog post read sometime. And this is what Nightcrawler is: a statement against the evil media that holds \"us\" hostages. Because there is always an us and a them at the base of any conspiracy.I have enjoyed for a totally different reason: the good representation of someone who can break the glass ceiling. Surely, the script writer is disgusted and demonizes the character who is presented as a freak and certainly in need of a straight jacket. But up to the final point you can see the guy who works his a** off to succeed in a world of closed doors.Also the representation of the media is quite right up, again, to the end when there is the preach. It is a form of entertainment. White people have the internet, friends, money and time to travel, DVDs, books, things you need a few lifetimes just to index. There is a personal and direct choice to consume scary TV instead of a soap opera or an XMen movie. Each gives thrills, only different kind of thrills.And I loved the visuals. The HDRs are a sign of those new digital cameras that can \"see\" what humans don't. Probably many movies from now on will use this kind of images.

But every now and then, you need to do some of these stories to really understand the seedy underbelly of the world at hand. While some might state the stylized world of the paparazzi is a little over the top, is it really? Cultural osmosis is so prevalent in our society that I know things about people I would never give the time of day to and try my best to avoid on social media. But dammit, I still know about these vacuous mouth breathers who are popular only for the sake of being popular. So yeah, the paparazzi in the real world might not be as ruthless, but their dirty influence is still felt.Louis Bloom comes off as just another run of the mill wannabe in Los Angeles. Desperate to be something he is not, he stumbles into a world that is both ruthless and also exhilarating, getting video of the worst moments in humanity. While his descent into this awful and irredeemable character seems natural, the depths he quickly dives into seems a little rushed. I just didn't get the feeling he was desperate enough to go to the lengths he was reaching toward so quickly. Its mostly a pacing preference on my part, but oh well.Beyond that little hiccup, the story pretty much continues with the ultimate narrative. Instant gratification is not necessarily a good vibe to center yourself off of. It can be fleeting, and the extremes one eventually will have to reach for can become dangerous. I am somewhat thankful the writer did not try to utilize a lazy character subversion near the end, instead maintaining the darker and more realistic dive into Bloom's blackened soul.

This is the journey of a man who has a very unique way of looking at himself and others. His logic defies logical arguments, and you have to at least pay attention to the way he defends his actions and invalidates others' points of view.Your first impression is to dismiss him as a loser who is most likely to end up messing up whatever or whoever he becomes involved with. because there's an air of recklessness to his enterprises. Once thing he does have is the ability to use whatever resource is needed to get one step closer to his goals, and ethics are not going to get on the way. He's an opportunist, and he will crawl into any type of gutter in order to reach the top or the bottom, whichever comes first. He's fearless.He's introduced as a common thief, but he's a survivor, and eventually he finds himself working as a nightcrawler, a man who tries to get to the scene of the crime, of the accident, of the tragedy so he can shoot the most controversial and sensational footage, some striking visuals, and he's the man with the perfect eye, but that skill will only open doors, and now he appears to have found his niche because like some of those creatures of the night, he must be invited in, and then it's up to the others to survive his endless ambition.He needs help, so he hires a really desperate character who puts up with his abuse while they search and find their way to some tragic scenes. He becomes more daring, and soon he finds himself breaking the law and getting lucky breaks of his own, as his competition also becomes part of one of the scenes he's looking for. Of course, our \"hero\" doesn't have a problem using that footage.His luckiest break comes later when he confronts his source of income, and he realizes that he can also take advantage of some situations and the thirst for the type of material which drives the ratings. He gets to one of his scenarios before the law, and this is where he pushes every limit, putting himself in danger to get that exclusive footage that will gain him fame and recognition. What we don't realize at this moment is the extent of his plans, and when we see how h executes every step, we can't believe what we're seeing. He knows if he plays the cards right, he will find his way to the very top of this sometimes unethical mess.It's unfair to reveal the last act of the film because this is where the suspense becomes oppressive because we just don't know how everything is going to turn out, and we don't know who to root for. It's messy and horrible Whether he will be able to survive is what we are waiting for. We may not be rooting for him, but we certainly watch, just like people stop along the freeway to catch a glimpse of the wreckage, like we turn our ears to the sound of the breaking news because we know it's not going to be a pretty picture, and that it really shouldn't be something we should be watching, but we still watchGyllenthal is certainly incredible in his performance here. He has given himself a haunting look, and it complements the way his soul is probably is just a rotting and dying entity because there's no way in this universe than a healthy human would be doing what he does, and that he survives and turns into something worse is something that we can't help but stare in wonder. He has captured that process beautifully, though we certainly don't want to be around him or upset him because by this part of the story there's no stopping his unending desire to succeed whether it's right or wrong.",

But while Scorsese's film had the merciful release of Rupert Pupkin's final vindication, Nightcrawler is a film about darkness and dirt, and it rarely emerges into the light.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, a drifter seeking a job and seeking a purpose. After happening upon a road accident, and witnessing a team of cameramen record the events in order to sell the footage to a news station, he decides to become a freelance photojournalist. Of sorts. Starting out with a camcorder and a banger of a car, he builds his reputation and his wealth through a combination of ruthlessness, sleeplessness, blackmail, and some\u0085 well, 'careful' framing. Lou is hunting the ultimate tragedy, and in the end he'll get it.This is Gilroy's first directorial feature after writing gigs on the splendid The Fall and the not-so-splendid The Bourne Legacy. Nightcrawler has the marks of authorship throughout. Each frame is exactingly busy, spattered with artefacts and colour. There are, inevitably, hints of Michael Mann in this dusky depiction of L.A. \u2013 a comparison even stronger when composer James Newton Howard brings in the howling guitars.I greatly admire Gyllenhaal's understated work in Zodiac and Prisoners. His performance here is something else. No more skillful, perhaps, but more externalised. Louis is an irredeemable product of modern capitalism. Does it ring true that a technophile like he would bring along his tapes in person, rather than uploading them to the studio? I think so. Gradually we get the sense that this is lonely yet confident man who really can achieve anything if he's given time with the puppeteers, face-to-face.Riz Ahmed's role, as Louis's sidekick, is somewhat thankless, but it's another highly accomplished performance from the British actor, here adopting a note-perfect California accent. As Nina Romina, Rene Russo (Gilroy's spouse) embodies the fragile ambitions of a woman on a downward slide. Her outbursts are tinged with fear and sadness.This is a low down film in more ways than one. We're at ground level from start to finish. Even the TV studio resembles a bunker. A depiction of the city as an oubliette: somewhere from which people don't escape. Newscasters exist not to inform but to instil fear in the denizens of this segregated zoo. It's a chillingly bleak vision, chiefly because it's plausible.Nightcrawler represents bold, atmospheric filmmaking, with a script full of humour and clarity. It mines a rich vein of satire, which may not be to the taste of every viewer. A hero Lou is not. But as charismatic monsters go, he joins Dan Stevens' The Guest as one of the year's most memorable.",

He walked out as a free man after his interrogation about the incidents although he withdrew the identities of the killers whom he filmed before he filmed the three dead bodies in the house even before the police arrived. And then he set up the scene in the restaurant where the criminals got caught by the police upon his call. A few civilians and a cop were sacrificed but that didn't matter.

            "content": "This film is highly recommended. (\u2606\u2606\u2606 \u00bd)A nightcrawler is an ugly and slimy animal that surfaces at night and feeds upon live and dead organisms, a more than apt title for Dan Gilroy's riveting new film by the same name. In Nightcrawler, the creepy crawly creature in this case is one, Mr. Louis Bloom. The plot follows Lou (Jake Gyllenhaal), an amoral petty thief turned instant paparazzi. After viewing a grisly accident that becomes his inspiration for a new career choice, Lou follows a blood trail of dead bodies and injured victims by recording their crime scenes and hawking his footage to the highest bidder. He finds a willing partner in Nina (Rene Russo), an ambitious television producer looking for big ratings.Nightcrawler's central premise does seem a tad far-fetched by today's standards. While television has become somewhat lax due to cable and streaming services and the need for one-oneupmanship for that all-mighty ratings boost, the chance of actually seeing this bloody and gruesome coverage seems more the distant future than today. (Yes, one can see this type of journalism online, but regulations on television do limit that type of imagery. Perhaps it may be viewed on PCN (the Paddy Chayefsky Network), of which this film more than closely aligns.) Most recently, other films have taken to the subject of the news and its drive for sensationalism, as with Gone Girl, but Nightcrawler relishes in its own seediness.The film aims squarely at its easy target by shows journalism at its most tawdry and the human condition as mere fodder for the most sordid of extremes. Director Gilroy, who also wrote the screenplay, captures the right rhythms and atmosphere of L.A. at night, largely due to the strong camera-work of Robert Elswit and the adroit editing of John Gilroy, the director's gifted brother. (It appears to be a family affair as Tony Gilroy, Dan's brother, is one of the producers too.)Foremost is Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Louis. The actor physically sheds his previous screen persona as a sexy leading man with his subtle acting choices. He hints at Lou's crazed nature with fast-talking patter and twisted monologues as a persuasive tool, bugged-eyed glances and gaunt pallor to mask a wounded soul within, and a sudden snide smile to indicate a shrewd and cunning mind. These traits help to create an indelible character. The mercurial turns show the duality of a character who can be a sad and pathetic human being or a cold and calculating monster. His Lou Bloom is a memorable psychotic loner, part deranged inspirational speaker and part harbinger of bad things to come. This is Gyllenhaal's finest performance and one of this year's best.Strong support is also provided by Rene Russo, channeling the guise of Faye Dunaway into her career-driven mad newswoman, Riz Ahmed as Lou's partner-in-crime, Bill Paxton as Lou's video rival, and Kevin Rahm as one of the few characters in the film with a conscience.Nightcrawler builds to an explosive if somewhat predictable climax, but the film stays its course as a stinging indictment of the television news media. The film may be overlooked by many moviegoers and it might not win many awards this season due to its relentless disturbing view of American corruption and human squalor, but any serious moviegoer should see Nightcrawler for the sheer audacity of its subject matter, a powerful filmmaking debut of a talented director, and Gyllenhaal's break-out role. As they say in the trade: viewer discretion is advised. GRADE: B+Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",

As this character, Jake Gyllenhaal moves entirely away from any screen persona you might have expected of him. His physical appearance will remind some of Christian Bale's gaunt and grizzly turn in THE MACHINIST(2004), but his glassy eyes and his vulpine smile are all his own, utterly remote from Donnie Darko's puppy-dog peepers and Jack Twist's vulnerable grin.There is superb support from brilliantly cast Riz Ahmed, as broke and bewildered Rick, who gets swept along in Bloom's deadly wake, and Rene Russo is excellent as the TV news producer who finds herself in the same boat. However even Russo's considerable skills can't prevent the role from seeming rather functional.The script is well constructed, the dialogue - especially from Bloom/Gyllenhaal - is of a high standard, and there are some nail-biting set pieces (including a terrifying car-chase: kudos to editor John Gilroy).All in all, NIGHTCRAWLER is an effective, though ultimately bleak, evaluation of aspects of American society, albeit in the guise of mass entertainment. It's good to look these issues in the face, which this film does.Recommended.",

This film has one of the greatest plots I've recently seen; the story is very engaging, due to the eccentric situations characters get into. I also couldn't help mentioning how good is the character development, especially regarding Louis Bloom, Rick and the female anchor. The three of them began the movie in a way, and as the story went on, they revealed to be very different from what they were supposed to be. In my opinion, the story's main objective is to show how far people can go for money, and how our materialist society stimulates this kind of behavior. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal proves in here how good is his acting, albeit many of his previous works have been badly criticized. To sum it up, \"Nightcrawler\" is a pleasant surprise from 2014 and I feel very glad to have seen it in the cinema.",

This is one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen in a movie, I've never seen a character be so uneasy and so disturbingly entertaining at the same time. It's that empty gaze that does it, you keep wondering about the morality of a character that spends his time filming traffic/murder victims in their dying moments just so he can sell it to the news. We know he's doing terrible things, but does he? We understand that he treats everyone around him like garbage, but it seems like he genuinely doesn't. This powerful effect is very much helped by the absence of police interference until well into the third act. It really brings home the point that everyone's okay with Louis' wrongdoings, they even applaud them. Is Louis evil, or just a guy who really likes to follow and cash in on society's (disturbing) trends? The whole ending is just really awful (in a good way), but it's just based on Louis thinking he has a business to run. No lust for blood, no kick out of violence, it's just like he says: he's just doing his job. That whole concept is endlessly fascinating to me, and while I rarely speak for others: I'm sure it will be to you. This is one of the few movies that I just can't imagine anyone could hate.

            "content": "When few people we're talking about Nightcrawler, a film that was somewhat initially buried by its release date, I was lamenting that this masterpiece (one of the few American films that have banged my bells in the past decade) barely took home any hardware, while overpriced, badly acted and directed mediocrities were being regularly feted. Well, since the advent of 'fake news' as political jargon that's all changed as the streamers and the dvd crowd has caught up with a film not as shocking to me in its content, but in its level of excellence in almost every category of film making.\nNeedless to say, Gyllenhaal's noted performance represents the ne plus ultra portrait of the conflicted antagonist as protagonist, no easy feat. The guy is simply one of the best players of his generation, and yet, still remains somehow a bit under the radar, perhaps because he is far more artist than celebrity, unlike others, too numerous to mention.\nWhat does disturb me still however is what I consider to be a general misunderstanding, on the part of the United States of Amnesia's filmgoing public to what the film is really about. First, I do not see Nightcrawler as a psychological study. It is a crime film. But who's buying this stuff? The public.\nWhat Nighcrawler is theme wise is an on point dissection of the horrors of unregulated capitalism and the misguided ethos of of the one-dimensional desperate quest for profit (subsistence in the environment of radically inflated cost of living) as they spill down to the millennial generation through the internet, which becomes almost a character in the narrative, at once Lou's mentor and his alter-ego - like Lear's Fool leading him onto increasingly further depths of depravity in the wasteland of the world of the L.A. night. After all, this is what it takes to establish a successful business, from scratch no less, is it not?\nIn what is in many opinions the state of the art in scripts, this message is entirely driven home by the subtext in a tale that becomes considerably more than the taut specimen of L.A. Film Noir it presents itself as. Both understated and over-the-top, Nightcrawler deals with some of our most firmly entrenched and divisive social problems at a time when the fabric of our society is severely threatened and does not flinch in its facility for speaking truth to power. A great film, when there are few worth watching.",

At least that's how I saw it.Alien, that's the best way to describe how Lou Bloom interacts with people. Each conversation seems more like a wager on what Lou can take away from it. He doesn't ever have a normal conversation with someone. He always has an angle and he always gets his way. Case in point, the dinner scene with Rene Russo. At first this seems like a scene in which he is trying to score a date of some kind of her. He's a weird guy and we all know his advances will eventually be shut down, but he turns the tables on her and us pretty quickly and his ulterior motives are revealed. One of the best scenes of the film and of the year.His dialogue his fast and to the point. He doesn't ever waste a breath or a word on something that doesn't give him some slight advantage in some way. I so hope come award time, Gyllenhaal is given the recognition he deserves. The title serves the film perfectly. This movie takes place 90% of the time at night. Shot beautifully in a cold dark tone with bright lights that emulate the bright light that Lou wants to chase. His dream. Does he want to be in the TV business? Who knows. He's shown wanting a job, any job and this is just something that he's good at that people want. He has no problem crossing ethical, legal and moral lines to get the shot. Sometimes, shockingly, he will change the perspective of the truth to support his gain. With a memorable soundtrack, slick direction and a script that deserves awards, Nightcrawler is one of the best films of the year.",

Not that it isn't a good film and everyone in it delivers solid performances, it's just that it didn't surprise or shock me in any way. And given the subject and the \"look\" of the film I expected it to be shocking and surprising. I am not a big fan of gore or horror movies but this was just too gentle and tame considering the genre and the nature of the main character.

In 2001, Donnie Darko was an incredible psychological thriller that featured phenomenal talent from a young Jake Gyllenhaal. But we're talking about Nightcrawler here, a step up from Donnie Darko where Gyllenhaal delivers such a creepy, convincing and psychotic performance as our lead \"protagonist\" character.He plays a petty thief and con man named Louis Bloom who, desperate for work, discovers he can make a good profit from photographing and recording graphic crime scenes for television news networks. But to spice the intensity and narcissism up a bit, his character is a downright sociopath who will go to extreme lengths to get this content. Jake Gyllenhaal easily carries us through this film with his notable acting skills. He's always wide-eyed, never blinking, and we slowly get the idea of how much of a disturbed, manipulative individual he is.But just as important as strong performances is the storytelling and execution. There are several moments that give you the feeling that the plot is going to take a boring turn for the worse, but that never actually happens. Every single scene is highly entertaining, either filled with topics of business and convincing, to scenes of well-written dialogue, shocking betrayals and excellent edge-of-the-seat suspense.

I also expected the main character to go off the deep end and start engineering his own stories. This doesn't really happen and I am little pleased as it would have been a bit obvious.In fact this film is solely about the central character and his methodology, which borders on autistic, the other characters and events are only shown as stimuli for his reactions.

            "content": "Nightcrawler is one of those rare thrillers with more intelligent to offer than just a wind of heart-thumping thrills and atmosphere. As a matter of fact, this film directed by the likeness of Dan Gilroy, is less about delivering thrills than having something smart to say about the culture of mass media. In a world where mass media has taken some questionable measures on delivering the news of what is going around the country and around the world, there has plenty of wonder what goes on behind the curtains the news network, and very few answers. With the news media revolutionized over the last several decades and ethics twisted to mysterious measures, this film places actor Jake Gyllenhaal in a thought-provoking character study of a man tackling the enigmatic world of journalism. And the result of Dan Gilroy's thoughtful direction and screenplay is an unpredictable ride dazzled with plenty of food for thought. This film follows Louis Bloom (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a Los Angeles native stuck on the employment sidelines and making money off of selling scrap metal he steals from strangers. Before too long, he takes interest in filming crime scenes and selling his footage to a local news station run by the ambitious Nina Romina (played by Rene Russo). With her news station improving in business and Bloom's filming talent reaching new heights, he hires Rick (played by Riz Ahmed) as his partner. But with his charismatic talent growing, Bloom begins to cross the lines between right and wrong in an effort to deliver the news the city of Los Angeles is asking for. This film is a smart cinematic treat that has a lot to say about the what goes behind the scenes of television news networks, and it all begins with: The news is a dirty business. And thanks to Dan Gilroy's directing chops and intellectually engaging narrative, this film has a nifty way to supporting this claim. The central figure of this story is Jake Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom, an antisocial individual who strays on the wrong side of the moral compass the minute he is introduced on screen, and develops into a mysteriously corrupt entity on both the moral and ethical department upon entering the news business. He is significantly manipulative, and his partnership with Rene Russo's Nina Romina and Riz Ahmed's Rick accounts to some shocking and corrupt situations. Is he a likable person? Definitely not. But he's an interesting character who serves as an allusion of how mass media in our country is today. In an era where the news media has evolved with a bigger concern on garnering high ratings than feeding the truth of what's go around the world, the film fiddles with the message \"If it bleeds, it leads\" and places it into sharp perspective. The stunning outcome is a story with both an absorbing atmosphere and a brain. Jake Gyllenhaal in particularly, is another spot in his flick. Maintaining a gaunt figure and bugsy eyes, Gyllenhaal gives a sweeping performance that thoroughly suits his character's callous personality and mystifying nature. Nightcrawler is a thoughtfully engaging ride shining with plenty of wit and thrills from Dan Gilroy's direction and writing, along with a striking delivery by Jake Gyllenhaal that sheds light on his acting chops. It is an entertaining hit on both a narrative and visual perspective. That is of course for those who bother to take interest in the sociological subject matter.",

We can only guesstimate what he has been up to all his life, but it does look like we have a serial killer on our hands. It instantly reminds of a film such as 'Henry: portrait of a serial killer' (1986), but unlike that monumental film, this only partly develops into a character study. The story, or how Lou finally finds his true passion \u00e1nd talent and runs with it, is also very important here. Unfortunately, there seem to be some holes here and there. How is it that Joe survives his crash, but does not put the police onto Lou? Why wasn't that crash investigated at all, even? Why does the female detective not confiscate Lou's material? It shouldn't be too hard to convince a judge rapidly to issue a search warrant for his things and apartment, especially when there's murdered policemen involved? I found it all to be a bit too coincidental and contrived.But 'Nightcrawler' has some terrific writing to offer, as well. How Lou manages to corrupt and manipulate Nina and Rick, for instance. And how Gyllenhaal portrays Lou is a job well done (the rest of the cast do admirable work as well), although I am not entirely blown away, like some. His 'Droopy walk' when he leaves the police station in the end, for instance, seems a little too much - reminding me of the ending of 'The usual suspects' (1995), by the way. The whole film has a little of that retro '80s and '90s vibe going on, anyway. Not a bad thing.The direction is more than adequate, but the unclear focus of the whole (which is it; a character study or a suspenseful thriller and will the director make up his mind up about it already?) did not work terrifically for me.Certainly not a bad film though.

            "content": "A directorial debut from Dan Gilroy portrays the story of Lou Bloom, a determined media- fanatic with a keen eye for journalism, who crosses the boundaries between morality and selfishness to build a successful news business. Now, I know that the plot doesn't sound like a convincing pitch, but believe me; you would be wrong to assume so. Before we get started, there is a possibility for a few spoilers as I will be discussing the film in some detail, so here is your SPOILER WARNING.A well written script is paramount for any film to entice an audience, and Nightcrawler does exactly this. The dialogue from the outset is authentic, natural and intriguing; which remains consistent through the movie's entirety. We can also thank Jake Gyllenhaal for this, for his performance was truly sublime. Bloom is everything to like in a person; he's a talkative, enthusiastic, determined character, yet there is a very sinister side to him that lies within his nature. He is desperate, who resorts to theft and even murder to earn a living. He is unaware of where the boundaries between right and wrong lie, and if he does, he has no hesitation in crossing them. As the film progresses, Bloom becomes truly frightening, doing whatever is necessary to obtain the footage that separates the wheat from the chaff; and this is what makes him so interesting. Whether we are supposed to root for him or be disgusted by his acts remains ambiguous, but one thing we know for certain is that he is unique in his enthusiasm for being successful.Nightcrawler shows exceptional insight into the world of journalism, but has no hesitation in displaying the flaws of the industry either. There's even a quote from the movie whereby Nina (Bloom's footage buyer) states \"we find our viewers are more interested in urban crime creeping into the suburbs. What that means is a victim or victims, preferably well-off and / or white, injured at the hands of the poor, or a minority.\" And that's the harsh reality; quite frankly nobody gives a damn about poor or ethnic-minority victims, and to bring such a reality at the forefront of our cinema screens, I can't help but admire the movie. Any film could depict the wonders of journalism, but instead, Nightcrawler takes a more realistic representation of the news industry.The movie, however, can be somewhat silly at times. The shocking fact that Lou remains innocent and free to continue his role as an unorthodox crime-journalist is staggering. Throughout the movie he continuously tampers with the crime scenes and evidence to benefit his own cause, yet his involvement in these scenes remain non-existent in the eyes of law enforcement; despite his lack of effort to hide the fact that he was there. Yes it's a minor flaw, but it's hard not to wonder whether such circumstances would repeat itself in a real life scenario.Dan Gilroy's Nightcrawler succeeds in bringing an authentic portrayal of the world of journalism to life, with crimes that feel so real and shocking in which audiences can't help but admire. Every monologue that spills from Lou Bloom's lips holds a significance to the plot and his character's development; all of which go together nicely into a neat package. It's fair to say that Nightcrawler was one of the hidden gems in 2014, and a film to respect and talk about for years to come.",

He takes on an employee and together they nightcrawl all over Los Angeles.The writing in this is just fantastic. It is so well scripted and works well with all the characters. Almost all of the dialogue is quick and witty and works well with the tone.Jake Gyllenhaal, in my opinion, is one of the most versatile actors of our generation, he is just so good and so believable in this role. It reminded me a bit of his Donnie Darko role. He is just amazing and it was a huge snub that he didn't get an Oscar nomination.

He changes direction and turns to filming intrusive close-up scenes of violent crimes and sells the footage to a local TV station with the assistance of a young man Rick (Riz Ahmed) who is desperately unemployed.Director/screenwriter Dan Gilroy does a fine job in keeping the film filled with excitement and suspense. The script is praiseworthy as there is never a predictable moment. It's a tense ride throughout with only rare scenes of violence but many scenes of violence's aftermath.In \"Nightcrawler\", Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances as someone who is morally vacant with no humanity at all while being very adept and skillful at the creepy work that he does. It's a chilling experience to watch him go through the motions. His performance is well matched by Ahmed as well as Ren\u00e9 Russo as an equally amoral news director at the TV station.A subtle backdrop to this film is a cruel economy that sometimes encourages some people to grovel at the bottom of the barrel to get any kind of paid work. Lou is an obvious example. Rick could easily represent the many in his generation who are forced into unpaid/underpaid internships or something equally as horrible.The ending is satisfying though there seems to be perhaps a feeling of too much soullessness. However, if Gilroy's intention was to use this to show the hyper-sleaze of tabloid TV news and the bleakness of our modern culture, he succeeds hands-down.",

            "content": "Jake Gyllenhaal fits perfectly in \"Nightcrawler\", an intense, twisted and darkly comedic directorial debut by Dan Gilroy. The film starts with the premise of a young man struggling to find work, following the common idea: \"If you want something, go get it.\" While that may seem trite and uninteresting, the extra mile is taken here into making a very interesting and sometimes disturbing two hours.The film develops a distinct visual style, casting a lot of its characters into the darkness of the night, accompanied by all the bright lights of the city and the story - the cameras, streetlamps, TV studio lights. Along with James Newton Howard's score, it gives off a very eerie mood that fits the night life of the film. Throughout, we follow Gyllenhaal's character Louis Bloom, and right from the beginning we get a good sense of who he is, and what he will do to achieve his goals. He's brilliant and deranged, making for a very funny yet frightening character. As he delves deeper and deeper into his new work, the stakes get higher and higher, until the closing, which I personally enjoyed very much. Along the way, we are given intense action scenes and incredible performances by Gyllenhaal and the rest of the cast. If you want to something refreshing and engaging, \"Nightcrawler\" comes highly recommended. Gyllenhaal succeeds in playing a man so despicable yet likable, and it is thrilling to watch him progress through the film. RATING: [8.5/10]",

            "review_title": "Ambitious thief becomes sensationalist photographer",
            "content": "Nightcrawler targets something larger than TV sensationalism \u2014 the psychopathology of corporate America. It owes less to Network than to Death of a Salesman, which showed America abandoning character for empty personality.Of course the film satirizes TV news in several respects. \"If it bleeds it leads\" encapsulates the ethics of the medium. So, too, does the proportion of its content: a few minutes on the serious issues, with the bulk squandered on local mayhem. The medium prefers to titillate rather than to educate. \"It looks so real on TV,\" hero Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) muses on the LA local station's news set, where fantasies are sold as reality. The news team specifically sells the nightmare of urban crime, to engage its viewers in fear.To succeed as a TV news photographer Bloom graduates from recording a scene to creating the disaster. First he rearranges the family snaps on a bullet-riddled fridge. Later he moves the traffic accident corpse into a more photogenic position. He monkeys with a rival nightcrawler's van, causing his death. Ultimately he stages an arrest and shoot-out that imperils the police and kills his employee Ricky. But nothing phases Lou.And that's the point. Lou is a classic psychopath. He has no family background or life. As he later admits, his problem is not just an unwillingness to communicate with people but a dislike for them. He shows no feeling for any of the victims he sees, even as his intern dies. Lou's only motivation is his own advancement, his only emotion ambition.His remarkable glibness shows the self-help education he proudly got online \u2014 itself an emblem of insularity. When he tries to get a job with the junk dealer to whom he's selling stolen goods, Lou carefully distinguishes himself from the slacker youth of his day. He promises diligence, hard work, even offers to work free as an intern. Still selling himself as he exits, he salutes the man's refusal to hire a thief. The more we hear Lou the more he embodies the modern businessman. Failing to get an intern job he sets himself up as a company owner and hires a homeless young Rick \u2014 as his intern. Lou drills Rick with management slogans. Instead of conversation he talks like a manual. \"Why you pursue something is as important as what you pursue.\" He seduces the desperate news editor Nina (Rene Russo) with the vapid: \"A friend is a gift you give yourself.\" Underneath that fake sentimentality, however, he is blackmailing her into sex. She is older, more experienced, worldlier, more powerful, but he forces her to his will. We watch Lou grow from petty, violent thief into a corporation: his pretentious news photography company. From his Rick interview on we watch Lou act and sound like a company. His unscrupulous and even criminal conduct ultimately leaves him boss of the two-van company with which his rival had earlier tempted him. But Lou owns this company and has recruited three other bright young interns to exploit. Now when he comes to a fork in the road he can take both dark routes.The film seems most current hard upon the US election. There the wealthy companies and PACs essentially bought the election that would give the rich more tax breaks, deregulate the economy, repeal health care and further widen the gap between the small group of Haves and the huge mass of Have-nots \u2014 who voted themselves down the river. Bloom embodies the Republicans' corporate religion and total lack of empathy for the disadvantaged. If Lou Bloom seems to evoke the hero of Joyce's Ulysses, his more compelling echo is of the callous child-killing team of Leopold and Loeb, bereft of emotion and empathy.",

The plot flows in a perfect rhythm through the head of a messed up guy Louis Bloom, who takes you on a high speed ride behind an exquisite red muscle to shoot stories up close.Jake Gyllenhaal is hands down one of the finest actors in Hollywood. The heights he scales and the lengths he drives deserve a big fat ovation. A psychopath on the loose, Jake is something more than that, a perfectionist who does things that he is good at. A deft thief whose keen eyes fall on crime journalism. He crosses all human confinements and legal barriers to get stories that are still hatching. Every crime scene is his puppet. He beats even the police to it. An equally good performance by co-stars Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed who end up being manipulated by the devilry of the badass diligent Nightcrawler. Sitting on the hood of the car listening to every word that the static says, learning everything about police radio codes, manifest how dedicated the protagonist is to his work. In his words: \"I am a quick learner.\"There are shots that Jake perfects without dropping his calm demeanor, unhindered and incessant speeches that make you want to clap for his effort. The screenplay brings magic through his lips. The time he breaks the mirror screaming with frustration shows the perfection he has achieved in his acting. A great actor, with the variegation he has scoured, makes him one of a kind. I place him amongst the greats. Bravo!",

He's not above beating the hell out of a security guard in order to get free of him, but more to steal his pricey watch.Louis is clearly looking for something more monetarily rewarding. By chance he stops at a recent auto accident that might get worse if the car explodes before the CHP can get the driver out of the car. A freelance TV film crew (Joe Loder and his assistant) show up, as if on cue, and start filming. Louis starts the process of learning new skills. He observes the handling of the situation that involves cops, aggressive reporters, victim(s), the excitement of jeopardy, straight up corruption, electronic surveillance, and the hungry market of TV news. When he sees the incident on TV at home the next morning, he's hooked.Delineation of conflicts: There is competition among the freelance film camera crews (stringers), especially those who film crime oriented events for television. Louis enters that competition. He catches the attention of a morning news director at an LA TV station, Nina Romina. His relationship with her is stormy, but they both gain from it. As his success grows (better car, better camera, better access), Louis becomes impatient for more success. He moves incrementally from pure observer to active participant in the crime scenes. The jostling with other stringers continues, and his self-created legal jeopardy increases.Resolution: Character issues lead to consequences, but where do those consequences land?",

Jake Gyllenhaal is a great one for off-kilter films, and this one little disappoints.What we have here is one of the most amoral characters we have seen on screen for many a year (Lou portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal), who finds a niche to ambulance chase crime scenes to film graphic moments and sell on to a local news agency without any regard for the victims or the circumstances. The lead character is robotic in his manner, and even though we see him at the start as a criminal we surprisingly see him manage to sink lower. He will do anything to reach his goals, and it's often an uncomfortable watch.Rene Russo as a news lead for the media company is fabulous as we see her character find herself trapped in Lou's plans, and their interaction is thought provoking. Lou is the freelance news gatherer who will stamp over everyone in his path.This film is all about having a stab at many items: the media glorying crime porn for ratings, the insatiable demand from the public feeding off this and the graphic crime that is the fuel for this craze.You will still be thinking about this grim dark film long after. It is at times darkly humorous too, but it's not an easy one to digest.A very timely movie, but we are already aware of the issues, but the grim reality there is little we can do unless the demand is quelled.

There was no explanation as to why Renne Russo's character was so adamant about putting explicit footage on television while her boss had reservations about it, other than they needed more ratings. Sooooo.....? They need more ratings? That's the big scandal? And somehow the guy who is apparently a sociopath is willing to get the grisly footage for her? I don't really understand what that proves? That sociopaths can have a lucrative career in covering news stories?",

From the first few minutes in I had a feeling this was going to be a cut above the norm, it just had a confident assured feel, which if anything is exactly like the very creepy Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). Gyllenhaal himself after last years great, although deeply unsettling \"Prisoners\" adds a another string to his bow as far as I'm concerned with this larger than life sleaze-ball, because I've always considered him best suited in a more subtle role, but not any more, he really is award worthy. While it's nice to see Rene Russo back in a decent role which is something we haven't had in too long. In terms of the way this is shot it's nothing other than a real tour de force in non-distracting, yet still very cinematic sharp direction, and even though Bloom is a pretty awful man, he is still an interesting character, and his very seedy job is something never really looked into before at this level of detail by any movie I'm aware of. This smart, dark, well made/written thrill ride will easily make it into my top ten of the year, and as such it gets a full recommendation.",

            "content": "Screw this movie! Nightcrawler wasn't blue, didn't have a tail, Professor Xavier didn't show up ONCE, and Jake Gyllenhaal never even teleported! What the hell is this? Worst X-Men movie of all time... period. Just kidding. As awesome as a standalone Nightcrawler film would be, the actual film Nightcrawler starring Jake Gyllenhaal is a wickedly twisted social commentary that boasts, what I think, is the performance of Gyllenhaal's career. He plays Louis Bloom, the most polite sociopath you will ever meet. Hungry for work, Louis finds himself a lucrative career in what is known as nightcrawling. Nightcrawling, which has nothing to do with mutants or Charlie and Frank's nighttime shenanigans (for all you It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia fans), consists of driving around late at night looking for car crashes, robberies, murders, or anywhere blood is being spilled, and then capturing it on camera first hand as it happens. The candidly grotesque footage is then sold to news outlets for their broadcasts. Louis Bloom quickly finds out that there is a career to be made out of this strange and unorthodox activity, and he will stop at literally nothing to be the best nightcrawler out there. And, of course, stop at nothing means exactly what you think it means. It's been a while since I've seen a film that succeeds on so many levels. Everything about Nightcrawler is fantastic from the darkly compelling story line, to the expertly crafted dialogue performed by a slew of excellent actors, to Robert Elswitt's stunning cinematography that combines dark and brooding tones with beautiful color saturation that sucks us into Louis Bloom's comically twisted reality. From start to finish Nightcrawler is a brilliantly crafted film that snatches you up and menacingly drags you along through it's disturbing twists and turns, some of which are almost too devilish to handle in such a frighteningly realistic setting. When it's all said and done the person who probably deserves the most credit for Nightcrawler is the film's star, Mr. Jake Gyllenhaal. The character of Louis Bloom is one of the most well written characters I have had the pleasure of meeting on the big screen in a long time, but Gyllenhaal takes the character to a whole other level. On the physical side Gyllenhaal lost a significant amount of weight to give Bloom a lanky ghostly look that adds to the manic determination of his character. But it's the nuances in his character's eyes and face that are so telling of what this character is scheming or thinking. Yet at the same time it's never too much, always keeping the audience in the dark as to what exactly this unpredictable son of a bitch is going to do next. Then at the same time Bloom presents himself as this highly professional, highly determined young man with strong convictions and verbose explanation of his actions and goals that make it hard not to side with him or understand him, as much as you know you shouldn't. It's hard to put into words just how great of a performance this is, which is why I urge everyone to it see for themselves. I really loved Nightcrawler right up until the end. The story was paced excellently, the characters grew in a believable and compelling way, and the climax was nothing short of awesome. But when the credits started to roll I immediately wanted more. Maybe it's just me being greedy, but I felt like where the credits came in should have been the start of the third act. We're left on such an open note that hardly feels like an ending, but perhaps that's the point? Needless to say, I'm ready to watch Nightcrawler again.",

            "content": "Over the last several months after premiering at what I believe was The Toronto Film Festival, and/or various other festivals, I had been hearing a lot of good feedback about Nightcrawler. Critics seemed to love it as did the audience members who had a chance to see early screenings of it. When the film was given a wide release and all major critics reviewed it, it got very impressive reviews with some calling it one of the year's best films. While, I did like the film and found a lot to admire about it, I still did not love it and would not go as far as to call it a masterpiece, or even one of the best films of the year. Jake Gyllenhaal went to great lengths for the character he portrays here by losing a lot of body weight and muscle tone as well as the fact that his character seems to be on an adrenaline, or caffeine rush because he always seems ready and raring to go for everything and he hardly ever blinks his eyes and can go on long detailed conversations with a lot of big jargoned words and very detailed sentences. For the first half hour, or so of the film I found his character actually really irritating and I found he was getting on my nerves and I could not imagine watching a character like this for a whole two hour movie. Luckily for me, I soon started to grasp the point and the various ticks and mannerisms of his character and what felt like perhaps a forced, irritating, or over the top performance at first, I soon started to appreciate the great lengths he went to, to portray a character as nuanced and hard to pinpoint in exact words. The story and film itself is quite a disturbing and very unsettling one that did disturb me and gave me an unpleasant feeling while watching it, but I wont hold that against the film because I think that that is one of the feelings the viewer is supposed to feel during and after the film. The film is a social commentary and is in some ways a satire, but I personally didn't find anything to laugh out loud about, but I did appreciate it's social commentary about the desensitization of people today and their lack of empathy, or feeling towards others and just violent and despicable deeds in general. Also, I found it interesting and appropriate how it showed just how desperate television stations are to broadcast something shocking, sensational, graphic and just plain disturbing to capture the viewer's attention, not because they are great, dedicated, or even talented journalists, or broadcasters, but for the single fact that violence, sex and anything shocking, or cringe worthy will always draw viewers whether it is a good, or negative response and that equals viewers and money for them and the station they work for. All this satire and commentary I appreciated greatly and found it both to be insightful and a good commentary and sociological commentary of us and our times. The film primarily takes place at night time and has some of the best cinematography I have seen so far this year. With the lights of the homes and businesses lit up in downtown Los Angeles, it gave the film the perfect look it needed while being visually pleasing as well. I thought the supporting performances from Rene Russo (who I haven't seen in anything for a long time) as well as Riz Ahmed, were also very good as well here. The music was atmospheric and suited the tone and mood of the film perfectly while the editing which at some points was slow and yet other times was extremely fast paced was excellently done as well. I think one of my few flaws with the film was at times it did feel a bit cold and perhaps a bit too nihilistic, or isolationist for my taste. I can get why the filmmakers decided to go that route and while it certainly does suit the film, I just really found it hard to really have much connection to the film, or these characters. I guess it did affect me in some pretty powerful ways in certain aspects because I left the film feeling jolted with feelings of unsettledness and was quite disturbed by what I had seen as I mentioned earlier. It did have a profound affect on me that way, so in that regard the filmmakers did a very good job. This was the first directorial effort of writer/director Dan Gilroy, and I must say it was an impressive one and while the film did not win me over completely, I still found a lot to admire about it and I see a promising career ahead for Mr. Gilroy and I think Jake Gyllenhaal will continue also to do good work and having a good career as well.",

His character faces no repercussions, even though there was plenty of opportunities to give us something. I'm all for the bad guy getting away, but this seemed a bit underwhelming.

But it contains so many things that are simply not believable, it ultimately fails.Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job portraying a creepy/weird guy who decides to become a video news reporter. But people like him make other people want to run away, not grant them full access to whatever they want!After getting some closeup images of a few accidents, which he is able to sell to a local news station that is desperate for ratings, he begins to think that he is Edward R. Murrow and starts making demands. The problem I have with this is that in greater LA, the idea that for any one incident he might not be as much as an hour away, means that *no one* could guarantee that they would be able to get these videos regularly. It would not matter what your journalism skills might be. Yet the movie shows him essentially holding up the news station as if he could guarantee these types of results.Next, every time he arrives at a crash or fire, there are no other cars backed up. He drives right up to the actual scene! Next, although a few police tell him to get back, in the real world, he would never be able to do what he does in the movie! Next, when he goes in to the scene of the supposed home invasion, which he heard about on the police scanner, and spends 5 minutes there before the police get there is not believable. Once the police find out, it is not believable that he would not be put under interrogation for 12 hours... instead he just makes some glib remarks and walks out. Any true police show like \"The First 48\" will show you how wrong this is.Finally, the idea that the police know he set up the final scene where the policeman is shot, and that he is just able to go on about his life as a news moguls is ridiculous.Maybe it is because I am a true crime buff that this made me so crazy, but if you watch this, you will see what I mean. I would not recommend it.Finally,",

The production value is good too: the movie is very beautifully shot and what one sees on the screen, pleases one's eyes. A well-shot film it also should be, after all the movie is mostly about filming anyways...However, no matter how beautiful Nightcrawler looks, it cannot hide the fact that the story is very ugly, almost repulsive. The main character Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a sociopath for whom empathy towards human life seems to be totally beyond comprehension. He doesn't care if people lose their lives, he just wants to get them on the film. Actually he wants people to die so he could film them. The truth, however, is revealed to the viewer only gradually. Many signs fit to the diagnosis of psychopathy, though. I mean, Louis can be a very slim, clever and charming person when he wants to. He can also lie to anyone with a perfect poker face. This pretty much reminds me of another psychopath main character in film, Patrick Bateman (American Psycho).As the film progresses, the viewer sees Louis' progression from a courageous-seeming self-made-man to a psychopath with no boundaries. For me, this made the watching increasingly harder simply because I started to feel more and more scorn towards Louis. I guess that is a good sign, most likely I possess some sort of morale. This must also be the objective of the filmmakers and I must say that the film is truly impressive, it left its mark on me. I was very much sucked into the events of the film and for all the credibility and immersion I must thank the film crew. Nightcrawler is made very well and Jake Gyllenhaal delivers his role magnificently (he didn't even get an Oscar nomination?!). Also his counterpart, the main character's employee Rick (Riz Ahmed) is a big part of the film. Rick is, well, maybe a little pathetic and failed in life but he still has that morale and suspicion that the viewer wants to hear said out loud. He is the voice of reason. Too bad that his boss is too crazy to hear him. All the same, I love these two characters and how their performances complement each other. Once the viewer is done with the movie, he/she is probably quite anguished. This movie is dark and intense. At this point, some people may decide that they don't like the film because it \"didn't make them happy\" or something like that. Think again, my friend! I think a good movie makes a difference and IS provoking. Nightcrawler is a stand- out piece.9/10",

His sidekick (Riz Ahmed) also delivers as far as acting goes, though there could have been more chemistry between the two of them. This may well have been the intention of the director (Dan Gilroy), however, to underscore the discord of their radically disparate personalities.The opening score is mesmerizing; it does a beautiful job transporting the viewer to the place where Nightcrawlers thrive. The story seems unrealistic some times, but frighteningly real at others. The legendary Queen lyrics come to mind, \"Is this the real life; is this just fantasy?\" The direction is solid. There are several original ideas, which come off excellently.

Jake Gyllenhaal gives the performance of his career as a man trying to crawl to the top of his game in the dark gritty media underworld of news footage peddling,.Nightcrawler is visually striking, the night streets of LA have probably not looked this good since Drive thanks to fantastic camera work and an excellent directorial debut from Dan Gilroy. I've never been a fan of the news and media for twisting the truth, this movie accurately describes the seedy underworld of the evening news and the lengths at which these people will go to ensure there own success. You can spend the first half of this movie trying to figure out who is the antagonist of the movie, similar to Breaking Bads Walter White you will find yourself rooting for a man with clear moral issues.The dialog's so well written that it will grip you and capture your attention for the entirety of the movie. This movie has probably the most suspenseful end to a movie i have seen this year, the last 20 minutes is nail biting stuff. Although the competition this year is fierce, Gyllenhaal absolutely deserves an Oscar nomination.",

We all stare at it. Too much, I would say that from time to time bad guys make some crime just for us to watch the news. They do that from small crimes to big ones like 911 was.Everything is great about this film that I gave it a high grade, since it really deserves. It describes for us local TV news journalism, which is almost on the predatory level. It also shows well Los Angeles violent way of life of these days in history.Acting is excellent, to the level of creepy.I simply have no choice but to recommend this film for everyone who likes some action with brains. That is so rare to come by these days. This film delivers all what you need to be glued to the omnipotent and almighty TV SCREEN.",

I won't list everything however.I found myself sweating during this film, (and no my heating wasn't on full whack) it was just that engaging and emotive, filled with suspense and creepy moments of Jake Gyllenhaal pressuring and manipulating other characters to do whatever he wanted them to.The film is kept in one direction and doesn't deviate from that direction, not even to show sex scenes for example. The director really kept the footage focused on the key parts of the storyline. There is not too much back story, you are just there in the moment with Lou, the main character and his well thought through and ruthless plan to dominate life. \"Let's watch it unveil together shall we?\"You are in for a wild ride if you are about to watch this film, and if you have already watched it, you may now sit back in your seat, the edge is starting to get worn down.",

After muscling his way into the world of shooting footage of accidents and crimes around L.A., the ambitious and desperate Gyllenhaal blurs the line between observer and participant in order to become the star of his own story, all the while aided by TV-news veteran Russo. Much of the positive reception is thanks to Gyllenhaal's unforgettable performance; however, it's the spot-on criticism and satire of media sensationalism that really makes this outing count for something.

I found the ending very disappointing and lacking closure.

Not here, this was dire.No doubt some will applaud the eccentricities and mannerism's of this character and the films premise of viewer/participant/instigator.

            "content": "After 'Kill the messenger', another one shot on film rather than digital. A side note on this topic - I love both media, and I hate the fact that, like religion or politics, the choice to shoot on film (Nolan and his ilk) and digital (Abrams for one, Michael Mann, and their ilk) is divvying up audiences/nerds alike. I think the ones standing for each, and deriding the so-called opposing camp are complete idiots, missing the point of the other, and the film-makers who exercise their choices. To them - just go watch the damn movie first, and then go rant all you want. After making the note that I did, that this one was shot on film, and also noting that it looked (and sounds sometimes) like one of my favorite movies of a couple years back, 'Drive', I just lost myself in good ol' film-making. I couldn't care less if it was 3D, IMAX, film or digital. That's the power of film-makers such as Dan Gilroy, who helmed this one, where it's all about the flick, and the craft is just a tool he uses to narrate a good ol' tale.Everything else serves solely in narrating the tale. Did not know Gilroy had this amount of latent talent for directing hidden in him - I'm glad he got funding for this project, and was able to bring his vision to the screen without making too many compromises. His film- making style, also evoked memories of how his brother, Tony, handled the narration, as well as the build-up to each set-piece, in 'The Bourne Legacy' (a vastly underrated movie in its own right, for which Dan wrote the screenplay as well, so there). I confess enjoying the Tarsem Singh directed 'The Fall' as well, which is another underrated movie IMO.Back to Nightcrawler though - there is no shaky-cam, and though I have nothing against the Greengrass kind of film-making either, this movie is well-served by that choice as well. The tale, and each of its twists and accompanying turns imparts the sense or urgency needed each time, and additional style is not a necessity in manipulating our emotions to force us to feel the same. No mean achievement that.I could not watch Jake Gyllenhaal in anything. He was an absolute revelation in 'Brothers' to me, though that was a remake, it might actually have been the superior version for his presence, and performance. Then came 'Source Code', 'End of Watch', 'Prisoners' (\"then came\", in the sense of my chronology of watching a Gyllenhaal flick, not that he made that next), which was followed by 'Enemy' - each almost a role more difficult than the one that came before, or a peer in terms of how difficult it must've been to be cast for in the first place, work on, then successfully pull it off. He embodied them all with aplomb. It's almost like he can never, ever, choose to be any lesser material ('Prince of Persia' notwithstanding). A-grade stuff only. We're definitely lucky to be able to witness this streak of his, in these times. As to playing this character, he completely owns it, and the writing is of a class that you hang on to every word he's (motor) mouthing, even though you know he's (character-wise) not someone you'll feel comfortable empathizing with, or even sympathizing with (pardon the wordplay - but believe you me, it is very much contextual, and relevant). You also know that he's basically regurgitating stuff he read from various self-help books, and you don't mind, since he has a way of making those words count, and feel incredibly creepy at the same time that you're not sure what's gonna explode next. Rene Russo gets a rare chance, post Lethal Weapon 3, to really sink her teeth into something, and though I feel that perhaps 2/3 scenes with her have been left either on the editing floor, or in the censorship office, she manages to more than hold her own nevertheless, and that's no mean feat acting opposite our very own Darko. Riz Ahmed, known to audiences from his fantastic turn in the comedic masterpiece, '4 Lions', and to a lesser extent, from 'The reluctant fundamentalist' and 'Close Circuit', turns in another fantastic and earthy flawed character and makes it his own, and his character's complete arc is something to behold. Powerful stuff, and perfectly cast. It's been a while since I saw Bill Paxton (what a nice coupla years for him too - 'Edge of tomorrow', '2 Guns', 'Million Dollar Arm'), and he's the original Nightcrawler here (remember 'Near Dark'? or 'Frailty'?). His arc is quite possibly the most powerful of all, and is quite breathtaking to behold. I am leaving a lot of stuff out, since one should enjoy the movie and be surprised/shocked with each plot twist, otherwise it's like reading the last page of the book and then starting from the beginning again, and though it might work for some, it doesn't for the most of us.After a disappointing soundtrack on a movie of the stature of 'Gone Girl', it's refreshing to find a movie that has a strong soundtrack like this one does. Nic Ratner / Brian Ross, supervising the score composed by James Newton Howard, give one of the most eclectic scores, I've heard in a while now, and there's hope yet for crime noir.And oh, on 'Gone girl', compare the activities of the media in that one, to the same (kinda) elements that are front-and-center here. In one conversation that a lead character (all leads are morally corrupt and bereft of anything remotely resembling a conscience ) has with the sole voice-of- reason, you'll feel disgusted, disappointed and scared in turns . :-)Big screen only, folks.",

            "content": "I am very extremely pleased that a psychopath like lou bloom here found his life calling in something that, while ugly and at time disgusting, is ultimately a good service, instead of falling into becoming a killer himself or something.\nfor some reason, either due to misleading trailers or misremembering information, I was lead to believe this story was one about a \"nightcrawler\" who, in an increasingly obsessive bid for hot footage, begins staging crimes or manipulating crime scenes ahead of time.\nApart from one quickly forgettable shot, he does almost none of this. He is instead always after actual crimes, actual events to film, and he is on it with an intensity that is frightening.\nthis is a caliber of performance that is career-defining, the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio in The Aviator, or heath ledger in the dark knight, Daniel day-lewis in there will be blood. It is not just a complete envelopment of the actor into the role, it is a genuine realness to it that becomes almost frightening, as you begin to cringe and perpetually anticipate an explosion of anger or violence that seemingly never comes. And the very first scene of the film, seemingly throwaway, makes very clear that he is not above an explosion of violence.\nThroughout the film, he presents himself with a filmy, bug-eyed veneer of creepiness and discomfort that is played perfectly, never veering into unrealistic \"I'm a gross disgusting crazy idiot\" territory. He almost comes across as someone with Aspergers', or else someone very very sheltered who has essentially self-taught themselves in all aspects of their lives.Both in public and private he has the same flattened affect, slimy demeanor, and odd choice of verbiage that is just unusual enough to unsettle without it ever being too much. It's less like an alien mingling among hume-mons and more like someone in the 1990s talking like they're from the 2000s.\nThe best part about it is the character is essentially at home where he is. This is what he does and likes doing and is actually good at and it and it is literally his whole life. Nothing he does or says in the film is not in complete and total service to the job he does. And the most astonishing part is, as we see from the beginning, he had absolutely no interest or intent until he comes across a flaming car wreck and sees someone creeping on the police with a camera, filming the event. Literally the scene right before this he is pouring his intense \"is he autistic or a manic psychopath\" energy into getting hired at a construction site he just sold stolen copper to.\nIf the construction foreman had hired lou bloom at that spot, the ensuring film would very likely still be a incredibly wild and unsettling adventure.lou bloom is literally like a virus or a highly sophisticated parasite. He could've come from nowhere, been born yesterday, dropped by aliens last week, and he immediately fixates on whatever job opportunity he comes across, to the point of becoming a literal expert almost overnight, with competitors offering to partner with him.\nthis is why I say I am very glad that lou bloom latched onto the field of \"nightcrawling\" and succeeded beyond his wildest dream. If he had walked into a city council meeting while still unemployed, he'd be governor of California by the next election cycle, and he would be dangerous.",

            "content": "If you have wondered who are those people that bring the gruesome crime images to our current affairs then Nightcrawler goes a step ahead in explaining how? This movie encapsulates the modern definition and make of management and success. The interesting characterization of the main lead i.e., Lou Bloom, portrayed artistically by Jake Gyllenhaal leaves you fascinated. He becomes the character in a manner that there is no presence of who Gyllenhaal is and no shadow of his past work. Knowledge hungry, curious, fast learner and ruthless character of Lou Bloom leaves the audience so flabbergasted that by the time we realize his psychopathic tendencies, we are no longer certain what to feel. Until we realize two important factors highlighted in the movie, which are: 1. Gyllenhaal is the modern day characterization of many successful managers and executives. 2. News isn't about the truth but about the perception and ideals of those who broadcast it. Lou Bloom's sentence structure and tone is what is often found in management books and training. To a degree Bloom's behavior and language makes clear the elimination of the human or emotional factor when confronted by Riz Ahmed's character (Rick Garcia) that Bloom doesn't understand people. Was anybody surprised at the unapologetic nature of Bloom? The writing, directing and acting of this movie concentrated on perfecting the characters especially Bloom and Nina (the news director played by Rene Russo) while keeping the ambiance and use of graphics neutral. Many might look at the story revolving around Lou Bloom but to support the growth of this character requires Nina. They share a partnership that is dysfunctional but just the right combination to nurture the path to success portrayed by the movie. The movie never derails from its initial concept and every single piece used in the movie is done aptly to support its theme, its message while maintaining the thrill the audience is seeking. In conclusion, the movie feels like a sarcastic representation of success harnessed by capitalism but one thing for sure, you will leave with a personal awakening. Therefore, it's absolutely worth the watch.",

Nightcrawler is a fantastic film, to the point that it is dangerous. I would not recommend this to my friends not because I fear that they would turn into dubious characters such as Jake Gyllenhaal in this film but I fear that it convinces me enough to show this to them as a preview of what I can do to them. Nightcrawler's premise may be quite well understood by everyone in the cut throat media industry and a little bit of Lou is inside every one of them. I am afraid that this movie validates it and in fact justifies it with logic. I agree with every word of Lou Boom from start till finish and that is a deeply troubling thought.

You really don't know what to expect when you step foot into watching this film Nightcrawler, but it does give you everything (in a way) in this movie. Lou Bloom, (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a driven man. He's a petty thief and just trying to find work in Los Angeles. He does whatever he can to make a buck, until he comes across an accident and two cameramen catching everything on tape. It's where he learns, \"if it bleeds, it leads.\" He believes he found his niche and becomes a night crawler. A cameraman getting the brutal crimes across the city and trying to make money off of what he has. He starts off as an amateur until he slowly starts working his way up the totem pole of night crawling. He's very ambitious to get what he wants when it comes to his \"career.\" He even brings in an \"intern\" Rick (Riz Ahmed), a naive man, who's just trying to get money in his pocket to get a roof over his head. The two men journey out into the streets and getting what they can get, hoping to make it somewhere, but things turn for the ugly. Lou becomes power hungry and wants everything to be his and no one else. He wants to play dumb and has a dopey look on his face as if he doesn't understand, but he is the one who has the upper hand on everyone. He believes he can be the one to call the shots and not see any consequences in any of it. He goes as far as getting someone killed in the process just to have it all. I was a little disappointed with the ending. You were expecting more and got less. You wanted more to happen. There should have been something intense to end this film, but it fell flat. Other all, it was a good film. Gyllenhaal is amazing as Bloom. He makes you want to hate him, but then you want to see him success, but you like to see him fail. He pushed himself in this film. You could see it. You believed him throughout the entire film. In my eyes, I feel like this is his strongest performance in quite some time. (Even though, I did love him in Prisoners last year.) I can definitely see this being an Oscar worthy performance. If he isn't nominated for this role, I would be surprise.",

Writer/director Dan Gilroy crafted an amazing story and he showcased it perfectly.Once again, Jake Gyllenhaal completely dominates the character he is playing and proves that this dude is almost god-like in his acting ability. He was able to take this loathsome character of Louis Bloom and make him insanely interesting and captivating to watch. Not to mention he made him a bit humorous, partly charming but completely unnerving all at the same time. Sure, he was the main character but Gyllenhaal commanded attention in that role in a way that a lead actor is supposed to. Like so many characters Gyllenhaal plays, he made Bloom feel legit, believable, and completely realistic.Overall, I was just blown away with \"Nightcrawler.\" Aside from what I already mentioned, the film also contains a great supporting cast, provides excellent commentary about the state of journalism and the media, and Gilroy made the very city of LA feel like a character in the film that Bloom is prowling and hunting through.

The idea is nice: An answer of a neurotic and thief on how to be a license to print money. But it is a great lack that there is no display of thsubstructure of character's work that he was doing. I mean it is really that there is no basic detail about that on a movie which shows everything realistically. It looks surreal that the character tells that \"He learns everything on Internet\" even if he acts realistically. Therefore there are two main problems underlying the movie: First is the contradiction between the movie's realistic process and its unreal scenario. I mean it really worths nothing for a machiavelist man, who hates all \"empty career achievement words\" and his main goal is to become a media boss. However, the main goal of a man who makes all this masterplans in the movie, should not be as simple as that.Second main problem is the moral sentiment of the movie. The machiavelist type of the character is getting much disturbing with the great acting of Jake Gyllenhaal. However there comes a moral judgment in the eye of the watchers, with the intention of producer: There is only one man who is an utter machiavelist and this machiavelist makes his job best. Therefore, there comes a judgment that, \"i don't want this man to be successful.\" At the end of the first half of the movie i thought that, there are two possibilities for the ending of the movie. Either, this machiavelist, greedy man will obtain his goal or the ethical values and the moral principles will overcome the story's itself and everything will be upside-down and this greedy man will fall. So the ending is easy to predict but i wanted the second possibility at least but it did not happen ant it really distrub the viewer. Okey, it is the reality of life you can not achieve something, without stamping someone. Nevertheless, when i say that i \"generalize\" it. I know that it is wrong but i would have tied the ending to more psychological thing. At least i would have tied the ending, for the character who lives like a robot and does not have a background, to a more suitable and tangible thing which would have made it a good villain. The best thing about the disturbance of the character is the acting of Gyllenhaal.",

Although what Jake Gyllenhaal's, Lois Bloom does is far lower on the totem pole as a night crawler, I've seen mass murders portrayed nicer in films. Not to say it's not a great film,Because it is. Night crawler gives us a small look at a new type of Ambulance chaser, but since lawyers already have that nickname, we have to use night crawler to describe men like Lois Bloom who just grab a camera and go out and look for human suffering to film and sell to a news corporation. Only in Blooms case his determination turns deviant. This movie is all about Jake Gyllenhaal, playing a man willing to lower the moral compass to get to the top. Despite having names like Bill Paxton, who plays a fellow veteran night crawler and Blooms competition, and Rene Russo, who plays the producer Louis sells his footage and very interestingly himself too. Jake's vehicle is about convincing you he's a despicable person and he does that from the moment he steps on the screen. Would love to say more, but this website prevents me from truly describing the kind of selfish jerk Lois Bloom is, but it's worth watching him get less human as the movie goes on.",

A linear script, which contains some difficulties in guiding its acts and abuses at various climax, but what is necessary to take the monotony. Telling the story of Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man with an immense penchant and an insatiable desire to win in life, with difficulties of getting a job and living from petty thefts, he discovers a new market, selling accident videos And murders on local television channels, such a market becomes Lous's obsession, which does everything to stand out and does not put any effort or scruples. We can not judge so much Louis, a man with ambition and desire to overcome insatiable, we can not judge his work or even his coldness, only his crimes can be judged, the biggest villains are the public itself indulging in a basic human curiosity, Morbid curiosity, this interest generates the market that generates interest in exploiting it, this is a trade, and the criticism of the film is precisely on top of that, the despair of the television channels in selling death, and the little concern to understand or help Victims, what counts is the exploitation of its disgrace. The film has an extremely urban photograph, at times it remembers the great \"Drive\", with a palette of colors that always strives to emphasize the night, a good sound mix and a basic but competent assembly, the soundtrack is discreet, but When it appears, she talks to Louis, and the film seeks not to sell violence, other than the same shows, this is interesting, as it seeks to reach the public with its quality rather than pure appeal. The biggest highlight of the film for me is Jake Gyllenhaal, an actor who completely embodied himself for the movie, losing I0 kilos, not flashing, and even the way of walking is different, Jake is incredible, with a sociopathic face and really looking like A vulture, he completely steals the scene, not just the scene, the whole movie, you feel the desperation in his eyes, the despair of anyone who would do anything to achieve their goal, Jake makes the best performance of his career. Finally, \"O Abultre\" is a great and interesting film, it details itself in small details, but it is very well acted and has a very interesting morality.",

The critics said the same like, \"It's a flawless peace of entertainment\" or \"One of the best movie of the year\".- So I was looking forward to the movie by hearing all the good buzz from it, and after seeing it I can say that this movie is flawless.Jake Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performance he ever did in his career. He lost a lot of weight for this role and I can say it pays off so well. I love how he makes his character so creepy, but so interesting to watch on screen. I swear to god if he doesn't get a Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie, I will be angry and disappointed at the Oscars, because when I watch a movie and don't see the actor, just the character that right they is talent.The director of this movie (Dan Gilroy) and he was only a screenwriter for most of his career and this movie is his first time directing and my god his he brilliant. Dan Gilroy but a lot of effort in this movie and I heard that the director of the movie actually met some people who do these things that people call \"Nightcrawling\", and to me that shows that this guy should make more films in future, because he's the kind of director that movie need.The writing in this movie is some of the best writing I've seen since Boyhood, I mean every sentence in this movie glues me in it's story and character's. The move itself has that dark, uneasy and hash look to it, but that's life. The shots were good, the other cast member's were great as well.But as I said in my Interstellar and The Guest review, the movie isn't going to get the perfect rating of four out of four star's, but the movie is still brilliant.",

At the most basic level, you hopefully will not leave \"Nightcrawler\"unfulfilled from the lack of swerving action and investment in the result of the story. I found myself pierced viscerally by \"Nightcrawler\", its stark nature, and how far it pushes its issues. After the final round of scenes conclude, you are permitted to release your breath and feel exhilarated by what you just saw. The eerie tone is generated from the morosely marvelous visuals, photography that maneuvers through the darkness like second nature, and the disturbing directing from Dan Gilroy. \"Nightcrawler\" examines the news field but is emblematic of today's job market and the difficulty one faces when trying to maintain a decent wage and a fulfilling life. It's a harsh critique, but a subtextual critique that feels connected to the the times of today. Gyllenhaal has never been better in a role than here as Louis Bloom, sinisterly restrained and deranged like a clown. * * * * / * * * *Grade: A",

If you want to see a character study of a sociopath this movie is for you, if you want to have a good time watching a movie this one is not for you.So what is the point of the movie? I guess the movie can be seen as a critique of a society that is more interested in seeing violent crime scenes on TV than they are in being informed about the truth (e.g. In the movie, the triple homicide turned out to actually be a drug-related crime, not innocent rich and white people getting murdered in their expensive home. But the TV News does not focus on the drug part of the story because they know that their audience is only interested in the high adrenaline car chases and bloody corpses).All in all an interesting movie with a dark atmosphere, would neither rewatch nor recommend to others though. 7/10.",

He lack of empathy and blinking, the muscle car, the sudden outbursts, he just nails the real sociopaths who wander the streets around you every day. While slow to develop, the movie excels at asking some difficult questions about sanity, social mores and The American Way. Both Gyllenhaal (Lou) and female lead Rene Rousso's (Nina) characters succeed largely by being will to go farther than their competition. Certainly for Bloom he crosses the line into deliberate murder but Nina's morality is trickier. She gives herself completely to Bloom to get ahead at the television station where she runs overnight news. She manipulates the truth and enable's the initially small- time criminal Lou's unlawful behavior while showing no remorse or concern. So is just a career woman trying to get ahead by whatever means necessary and can't be held responsible for Lou's actions? Or is she guilty by association? The movie also raises questions about sanity. Certainly Lou's view of his \"business\" (Video Production News) as an organized professional firm is at first fraudulent and self-deluded. Or is it? Don't we celebrate people who built people who build major businesses based on some self-deception and that of others? Or does Bloom really see himself at the center of a thriving organization that just hasn't coalesced in the physical reality around him yet? The decided lack of morale to the story at the end of the film strongly recalls a 1992 Tim Robbins movie about the film industry called \"The Player\". In this busy as well (all businesses?) the dirtiest player who doesn't get caught wins. \"Nightcrawler\" delivers these starkly discomforting lessons in a slow-burn, too-real-to-life story. In short, if you want real scares, see this movie and realize these type of people are all around.",

He rises from a viscious non-entity to a 'successful\" entrepreneur,\nand like many engaging bad guys, like \"Joker\" or so many others, he becomes the focus and protagonist of this celebration of getting what you want at any cost, completely outside the law, but with the endless supply of wit to insulate him.He's created a unique character in this one, and that, we would think, is no easy task in film these days.

First I want to take a step back and state that based on the trailers, any viewer of the film should have been aware that they were going to be dealing with a psychopath as the main character. I thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance of this character was extremely well done. No one should have a problem with this. Furthermore, throw realism out of the window. The amount of obviously illegal things Lou Bloom does without getting caught is nearly insulting, so the ending didn't surprise me whatsoever. On the other hand, I'm getting frustrated by the amount of people labeling this as a \"brilliant satire.\" If anything, I suppose it could be a very poorly written satire. I would say that there are indeed satirical moments in the film, but I think it'd be more appropriately labeled as a thriller infused with dark comedy since the entire piece simply doesn't function as complete satire. I have another huge qualm with the score. I don't know how everyone isn't commenting on the corny score of the movie. A film such as this needs a powerfully ominous score, and while you could cite the score as being a catalyst for the satirical model of the film (for example when the triumphant music plays while Bloom moves the body), I could counter with the fact that this film is not wholeheartedly satirical. I'm a fan of satire, but I feel that if the film presented itself as a dark expose of what Lou Bloom does for work, with the satire being COMPLETELY driven by the script itself, then it would've functioned quite well. Otherwise, it was underwhelming, but worth giving a look for the sake of Gyllenhaal's performance and very gripping cinematography.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is an intense thriller set in the nocturnal of Los Angeles. Jake Gyllenhaal lead this movie with a tremendous solo effort, to create, to be honest the quite creepy character of Lou Bloom. Bloom, is rock bottom but is driven and will do anything to break into the world of high speed crime journalism. Bloom approaches Nina (Rene Russo) who is a station manager of one of the lowest rated stations and has a similar desire to Bloom. In this motion picture we see the cut throat and ruthless world of night crawling and what is stake to these freelance cameramen. Nightcrawlers capture intimate and exposed shots of crime and accidents, they race to capture this before the emergency services can move the scene away from the incident. Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant, Bloom is genuinely one of the most manipulative characters i've seen in a while, he knows what he wants and he will do anything to get it. Gyllenhaal captures this so well, with a cold detached ruthlessness which fits the job so well. Gyllenhaal is top class.Dan Gilroy and cinematographer Robert Elswit create a unique way of seeing some truly ugly human events in such a clear and and astounding way, the cinematography and production is really something. This a tough watch, the movie contains morally challenging content as we see the inner workings of journalism and how they can potential manipulate or hold information to bring an angle or anticipation to a story. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat with some some great scenes to look out for, people question the ending of it but i think that the ending finishes in a fitting way to relate to the movie, a great movie.Check out the rest of my reviews on http://russellviews.blogspot.co.uk",

            "content": "There's something very 70s about Nightcrawler, in the best way possible: an anthropologist's fascination for a difficult protagonist (played masterfully by Gyllenhall), a seedy world where everybody is, at best, a shade of grey, and a deeply concerning look at modern consumption.While it has one foot in the gritty past, technically and thematically, Nightcrawler is very much a creature of the times, from its fascination with gory breaking news, and the technical wizardry on display. Frequent PTA-collaborator Elswitt's nocturnal photography is both stunning and a perfect fit to the story. The supporting cast are all old pros doing their best work in years, not just Paxton as a condescending rival but Renee Russo as a fading news honcho. The latter will make you mourn her recent absence from our screens.It says a lot then that for all the talent on display and refreshingly unapologetic sleaze of the story, this remains the Jake Gyllenhall show. He gives his all to this weird creature, making him unique and real, but never judging him.Definitely one of the best films of the year, and a shoo-in for best performance.",

It is a great companion piece to movies such as \"One Hour Photo\".There's lots to talk about. Cinematography is excellent, editing and pace flawless, very solid direction and a good supporting performance by Russo. But what this is all about is the one man show by Jake Gyllenhaal. I have always been a fan of him, I actually was a fan of this talent even before it was cool to be his fan. This performance is the proof of every good word I have ever spoke about this man. It is brilliant acting from the very little details inserted in the performance to the amazing dialogue delivery and mesmerizing screen presence, don't be surprised to see Gyllenhaal nominated for an Oscar this year, yet I don't see him winning. He his certainly helped by an amazing script that other than offering a triumphant portrayal of such a despicable character, offers an inside view in some of the mechanics of news reporting that I found fascinating. There are some very tense moments too where I was totally conflicted in were my side should stand and I loved this so much. The movie offers a window from which the viewer can take away what he or she decides.Despite this offering, I think the movie falls short in doing what could have been the ultimate success. Yes you do get interesting \"bipolar\" situations, but that's were the movie stops. When I said the movie is a one man show I certainly meant it in a good way, but there's a shade of bad too. This film doesn't leave space for some higher statement or reflection. It's all about Lou and not enough about the all the rest and even though I was riveted throughout I didn't really take away as much as I wanted.Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie go see it as soon as you can! It is a great ride and a fascinating look at an aspect of our society.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a film that will do just that, Nightcrawler is the one to see. This movie exposes the perverse nature of human entertainment and competition right in front of us, and while you might think it's something that won't affect you, this movie makes it apparent that no one is truly safe from the hands of those determined to get what they want.Set in the dumpy outskirts of Los Angeles, the main character, Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), is a lone man who is tight on funds and looking for a job. One night he stumbles upon the scene of an accident, where he witnesses a news crew getting in and filming raw footage to sell to TV stations around the city. He is instantly intrigued. After purchasing a camcorder and police scanner and hiring a broke assistant, he sets out to get his own footage that he hopes he'll be able to profit from as well. Soon he learns that the news filming business is more competitive than it appears. The news stations want more and more dramatic footage for their morning broadcasts, and he will do whatever it takes to get higher and higher towards achieving that.But here's the catch; Lou is no ordinary man just looking to make his way in the world. It quickly becomes apparent that there's something off about this character. He may act friendly, but behind the mask of that creepy smile lies a person severely lacking in empathy and emotion. The perverse plotting and ultimatums he lays out towards anyone who stands in his way of success shines light into the disturbed mind of a very evident sociopath. The story spins further out of control as Lou demands more and more drama and action to report on, stopping at nothing to be the best in the business, even when it comes to breaking the law. He figures out that if he can beat the police to an area, he can modify the scene to make it look even better on film. Gyllenhaal does a remarkable job at showing the character of a cold blooded villain trying to convince himself and others that he's a normal part of society. The movie really excels at realistically portraying all of the different people and motives that make up modern society, even the less desirable ones.The downward spiral of this film not only shows the perversity of a sociopath, but of TV viewers themselves. We constantly crave more and more violence and on the scene drama, and the television stations will bring it to us as long as there's a demand. All sorts of ethical boundaries are overstepped for the sake of viewers' entertainment. While Nightcrawler's sociopathic character may be individually responsible for certain events on screen, this movie also showcases the more subtle problem that is society's fault at large. Just how far are we willing to go to see what we want to see?Nightcrawler is one of those films that's unsettling simply because it's so realistic. Everything on screen could and probably does happen in real life. News crews spinning out stories just to gain ratings, journalists overstepping ethical boundaries to build attention for themselves, all of these things are something that we as society are only fueling with our desire for entertainment. And apparently it takes a true sociopath to bring it all to the table for us.Overall, I'd give this movie 9 out of 10 stars. The whole plot was totally intriguing, but the end doesn't leave with much closure. Maybe that was the director's intent due to the nature of the disturbing storyline. It just left me wanting to see more. Nightcrawler ended up being a delightfully creepy film to watch, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mindboggling thriller.",

Although Taxi Driver was a far better movie, miles ahead of Night Crawler, yet Night Crawler aside from the thrilling story and the performance tries to convey a message about inhumanity in the media sector, how immoral this sector is evolving. Jake was THE Oscars biggest snub of the year. His weight loss is a dedication, his performance is CREEPY and that's the least description of that performance. The script helped Jake to reach the summit of brilliance. The movie was a thrilling adventure, The movie was smart, explored the life of a free lancer for the first time -I suppose-. The movie was good but Jake stole the show with his Jordan Belfort's quotes and Travis' insanity. Louis Bloom is the off-spring of Travis and Jordan.",

The story is weak and lacks natural story line and characters. An example is when Louis has a job interview with a young guy and exposes him as a male prostitute. This whole scene is so wrong. The whole relationship between Louis and Rick may look good on paper but it doesn't work in the movie, even with two actors that can pull it off.Although the character of Louis is certainly not a boring one, because it's so artificial it becomes tedious to watch. Add to that the many incongruities, I found myself wanting the movie to be over long before the end.",

            "review_title": "A brilliant mix of drama, action, comedy, horror and satire, anchored by Jake Gyllenhaal's lean, hungry performance - a career highlight for all concerned.",
            "content": "How often do you come across a film that's at once a horror movie and an incisive commentary on society? How about a psychological thriller that's packed with action beats, or a workplace drama weighed down by shades of the macabre? It's an explosive combination that has rarely been seen since Martin Scorsese's seminal Taxi Driver from 1976. And yet, Dan Gilroy pulls it all off with Nightcrawler, his frankly astonishing, remarkably assured first feature film as a director - one that benefits hugely, too, from a tight, dark and awkwardly funny script that he penned himself.Gilroy's words and camera revolve around Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), an unemployed man thirsting for a job in a parched economy that can no longer sustain the ambitions of its youth. However hard he tries, Lou just can't convince anyone to give him the opportunity to prove what a smart, good, dedicated worker he is. Finally, he stumbles upon a 'nightcrawler' - a breed of video reporter, or paparazzi, who prowls through the night shooting footage of crimes and misdemeanours that can then be sold to television studios to headline their morning news shows. Lou decides to get in on the game, working his way up with a thrift-store camcorder and no shortage of ambition. Soon, as he grows ever more comfortable in making money out of the misfortunes of others, one begins to wonder: is he capturing the news... or creating it?What's so impressive about Nightcrawler is how it shifts so easily and confidently between genres and ideas. Gilroy has found an electrifying premise that allows for drama, action, comedy and horror to share screen time, frequently in the same scene. In one moment, Lou seems to be a go-getting entrepreneur in a workplace comedy, as he reels off trite management tactics he downloaded into his brain from the Internet. In a heartbeat, the film spins him into the realm of psychological thriller, as he uses these same broad dictums to justify his increasingly criminal, morally questionable pursuit of success. From delivering yet another truism-laden lecture to his hapless intern, Rick (Ruiz Ahmed), on how to get ahead in life, Lou leaps into action - cutting corners and causing accidents to beat other nightcrawlers to the scene of a crime.There's plenty of room here for social commentary and satire, too, which Gilroy subtly peppers throughout his script. The film cheerfully skewers the unquenchable voracity of the 24-hour news cycle, while laying out the possibly dire consequences of feeding this hunger. Morning news director Nina (Rene Russo) may become complicit in Lou's efforts as she continually pushes the boundaries of what can be shown in a telecast, but, as consumers, we're no less to blame in driving up the ratings when bloody, broken bodies and raging flames are splashed across our television screens. Ours is a world in which Lou Bloom gets away with and, in fact, is rewarded for what he does - and so he keeps doing it.The relationships that form between Lou and the other characters in the film are also rich with darkness and detail. His dynamic with Nina morphs from one of subservience to control - when he has all the cards, he places a chilling offer on the table that she both can and can't refuse. It's a moment as terrifying as anything you'll see in a horror movie: a situation in which the victim plunges, eyes open, towards her doom. Rick provides comic relief and pathos in equal measure, as his failed attempts at navigation threaten to shatter Lou's resolutely unflappable exterior.Nightcrawler would not be half as effective as it is without the shiveringly good lead performance at its heart. Gyllenhaal, who shed over 9kg for the part, prowls through the film with a lean, singleminded hunger in his unblinking eyes, flesh stretched taut over his cheekbones. He slips easily and imperceptibly into character, whether he's playing Lou's grasping desperation when looking for a job, or his completely cool, unruffled stillness as he wends his way through a house still fresh with the taint of murder and bloodshed. It's not so much that he plays Lou without a heart - rather, he finds the odd burst of unyielding humanity in this lonely, strange, sociopathic creature, which makes for an altogether more unsettling experience. Unlike ghouls and ghosts and other supernatural creatures of the night, this is a monster who can walk unnoticed among us - recognisably human, and yet not, all at once.If there's anything amiss with Nightcrawler, it's that the film can come across as detached and analytical - it may blaze hot with its myriad ideas and themes, but never quite manages to raise its temperature above a chilly iciness. It connects with its audience through visceral shocks rather than emotional engagement. But that is, of course, almost entirely the point of the film. Gilroy wants us to watch through our fingers as Lou forces his career to live up to his expectations. He wants us to squirm, to flinch, to be repulsed, while never quite managing to tear ourselves away. This approach might alienate many viewers, but those who stick with Nightcrawler all the way to its bitter, bloody end will be rewarded with one of the scariest, smartest and most thought-provoking films of the year.",

What I mean by that is, take how a robot solves problems and stick it into a human. This movie always has you grinding your teeth and on the edge of your seat. You keep saying No! Don't do that! but the score says yes, this is good. It's unsettling. I found this movie very enjoyable. My small complaints are mainly with how the story is progressed. Louis seems to go from amateur to big shot in a montage. Also, I felt the climax of this film could have had a large build up. I wish that we got to see more behind what makes Louis tick.

In fact, it was both, which, for me made it a sinister masterpiece. Jake Gylennhall is Lou, an aspiring 'nightcrawler' (shoot and sell newsworthy video for a price) who will go to extreme lengths to perfect his art and, at the same time, increase his bargaining power. Riz Ahmed is his 'intern', who wants a financial break. To say much more would spoil it - but an absolute masterclass in genre dividing film.

I googled the question 'What is a Nightcrawler' and got the description......A person who is socially active at night. Our main character is not what you might call socially active, more like unsocially active. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, a man down on his luck who has turned to petty theft to make his money. Passing an accident on the highway one night he stops to take a closer look and observes a video news crew filming the wreck. After talking to the news crew he gradually realises that here is an opportunity for him to make some money. However Louis is one creepy guy and the lengths he goes to to get his film on the news is disturbing. Jake played Louis so well, I found myself almost disliking the actor as well as the character he was playing. As I said this film was mostly shot at night and portrays the real underbelly of news reporting in LA. As Louis Bloom gains in experience he starts to merge the true news with his own portrayal and what starts as a tale of a man somewhat down on his luck turns into a real psychological thriller. An excellent piece of acting from Jake. Not my usual choice of film but I enjoyed it immensely.",

We first happen upon him demonstrating his sheer disregard for confines of any sort by cutting through a fence to steal scrap metal. When he is confronted by a private security guard, he attacks the man and steals his watch. In a common theme throughout the movie, Lou gives no thought to consequences and none are forthcoming. Later, Lou watches a freelance videographer show up at the scene of a car accident seconds after the police, recording graphic footage that will fetch hundreds of dollars from local television news stations. Unencumbered by barriers that would hold back members of the audience, Lou steals a bike to pay for a video camera and begins shooting daring and aesthetic visuals at crime scenes. \"If you're seeing me,\" he says, \"you're having the worst day of your life.\" The film's antihero is played immaculately by Jake Gyllenhaal, who prepared for the role by losing 20 pounds and memorizing the entire script like a play. And it is a script worth memorizing, or at least reading. It conveys by itself the mood that will stay with you long after the story has been forgotten. Among the many fascinating details in the script are the scenes in which Lou Bloom pitches in the convincing fashion of a slick George Clooney character, but the scene is not so contrived, the screenwriter not so kind, and Lou's persuasion is not quite compelling enough. These conversations are unnerving and surreal in a way we haven't seen before. This movie has respect for acting and writing, but also for craft. It is well shot in understated noir, and the scenes that take place during the day are like a breath of fresh air, a break in tension, before we fill our lungs and submerge again into the night. The directing is atmospheric and obsessive, raw and minimal. Where it could degrade into mayhem, it is instead an elegant exercise in style.8/10",

But early on he develops a 'passion' for 'police reporting'; going to a police activity, filming it, and submitting it to an L. A. TV Station for cash. The newsroom producer, played by Renee Russo, provides that cash. And to keep the videos coming, she provides 'herself' to this loathsome creep. But here's 'the thing'. Louis Bloom goes over the line; his videos are manufactured, in full or in part. He has a hand in the filmed events and so is there earlier than any other video team.And that's the story. How he does it. With whom? And, of course, will he get caught? And, if so, how?Again, this film has no hero. Only a range of 'villains'. If you don't mind spending a few hours in this hellish universe, I can recommend 'Night Crawler' to you. But if not, I'd say, Stay Away. Far, far away.",

            "content": "Technically, \"Nightcrawler\" is more of a thriller, or a drama than it is a horror film, but that doesn't make it any less terrifying. If you're wondering what the title is about, this isn't a spin-off of the X-men, it's a job title. Nightcrawlers are people who spend their time listening on the police radios for bad news. They listen for calls reporting car crashes, home invasions, robberies or any other violent crime. Once something suitably juicy is found, they grab their camcorders and sound equipment, rush to the scene, film it and sell the footage to news programs. The more shocking, the more valuable the images. Our main character is Lou (superbly acted by Jake Gyllenhaal). There's no other word for it, he's a creep. When he finds out about nightcrawling, he gives it a shot and finds out that he's got a natural talent for it. That is when things begin taking a dark turn, and this guy was a scary one to begin with.I know what you're thinking already. Is this guy going to end up committing murders, filming them and selling them to the news reporters? Is this a movie about a serial killer that films his crimes? Quite simply, no it isn't. That's because this is a realistic movie. Frighteningly realistic. Here's how I can describe it to you without giving anything away. Imagine you were kind of a sensitive kid in high school and you noticed that there was one kind of weird guy that everyone picked on. You felt bad for him and held out your hand in a casual friendship, but the two of you never really hung out regularly and because he was such an outcast, the kid eventually transferred to another school. You never kept in contact. Years later you are getting off work at around 10:00 pm and you just happen to bump into him. Maybe out of a bit of guilt, you ask how he's doing and he suggests that the two of you sit down and have coffee to catch up. Not really having any plans, and feeling kind of hungry you figure it would be rude to say no, so you agree. You place an order and as you are waiting for your food, the guy confesses to you that he was really happy to bump into you. He's been thinking about you a lot recently, he's even been talking to his girlfriend about getting back in contact with you. You think it's kind of weird, but it doesn't really set off any alarms. As your food arrives, the guy leans in and confesses that the reason he's been thinking about you is that he's been looking for someone that he thinks might understand why he's been leaving poisoned food in the nearby woods for animals, or wandering pets to eat. That exact moment is what \"Nightcrawler\" is like. It's that chill that runs down your spine as your realize you've gotten yourself into a situation that you might be able to escape from, but one that's unsettling and frightening. Out of curiosity, you decide to stick around.This is one intense movie. As the film follows this truly unlikeable protagonist, I never became sympathetic towards him, but I also didn't want to miss an instant of the story. I wanted to know what Lou was up to because I was worried about what he would end up doing. I almost felt like maybe if I comfortably watched these events from the safe distance of my movie theatre seat, it would help me arm myself in case I ever encountered someone like him. It's a fascinating journey because you always get the feeling that something bad is going to happen, but you also think that maybe things are going to be alright. Realistically, I suppose that there is a need for nightcrawlers and it's not like the guy is doing anything illegal by shooting these videos. I mean yeah it's weird that he's so uncannily good at it, and that he seems to enjoy it, but it's not unheard of for people to work in a place you would assume would be traumatizing, like a slaughterhouse for instance, right? That feeling, that fleeting hope is what compels you sticking around to watch the whole thing. In a way, you're like a hostage, and in others you're like the people who watch the sickening footage of car crashes and murder victims on the news. You know this it might be a bad idea to keep watching, but somehow you area compelled to do so.This film is good. It's scary good. It's not frightening because of jump scares, or paranormal entities, or ghouls coming in to eat your brains. It's intimidating because the film feels so real. You believe that director/writer Dan Gilroy is trying to tell you something, about someone that he knows but he doesn't want to give away all of the crucial information, lest the person he is trying to warn us about find out about this film. I found myself completely immersed in \"Nightcrawler\". I didn't know if I wanted the movie to end quickly so I could get out of the theatre and get back home where it would be safe, or stick around forever and learn everything there is to know about this fascinating guy. I know that \"Nightcrawler\" is going to disturb and frighten you, but we could all use a bit of a spook, particularly when the piece that is doing the scaring is as good, as compelling as this.

He has changed his whole career around by playing more serious roles and different roles. This is probably one of the best movies he has acted in. Gyllenhaal's character is kind of like Patrick Bateman from American Psycho he's just creepy and scary. The story of Nightcrawler is very interesting and different. The film looks beautiful especially when scenes are taken place at night. There are some really cool shots in the film that have a point of view in the car. Now this film is not for everyone some people will like this movie and some won't like it. There's going to be people that will root for Gyllenhaal and some just want to see his character dead. The acting is fantastic but I think the most important character from this movie is Gyllenhaal because the movie just focuses on him. I really think Gyllenhaal will get a nomination for an Academy Award and I won't be surprised if he won. The screenplay of this movie is also fantastic and I think it will get a nomination for that. There are some very intense moments in the movie especially in the last 30 minutes. Nightcrawler is one of my favorite movies of 2014 and I hope everyone has a chance to see this movie.",

Both are must-see.Govern expectations accordingly, because it seems folks are hoping for more action-packed horror.Nightcrawler's a dark dramatic thriller.Expect twisted spookery, but in a more subtle and realistic manner.Overall, this film is very smart.It's a tale of moral ambiguity about the mysterious creepsters who provide found-footage for nightly television news.It's set in L.A and completely divorced from the creative filming industries.The very setting, albeit typical, is oddly off-type.Which is similar to the pacing and scene construction. Dan Gilroy, the writer/director, displays an exquisite proficiency at defying narrative conventions.Along with montage, time lapse and alternative credits sequencing, breaking clich\u00e9 is a cinematic theme of 2014.Another setting-based narrative strength is the relative lack of sunlight. The protagonist's eyes are never naked to unfiltered rays.The infrequency is certainly purposeful.Another example of the writing strength is the humor: Subtle, unexpected and consistent.This film's success is also due (in part) to the spectral visual style.The shooting, editing and cinematography is masterful.On the flip side of sense perception, the sound mixing and score is excellent.Nightcrawler owes a hefty portion of its success to the acting.Jake Gyllenhaal's unseemly characterization is fantastic.Jake is one of our finest actors working today. Source Code, Donnie Darko and last year's Prisoners are three of the best in cinematic history.Here he crafts an original antihero in Louis Bloom.(Quick side note: The similarity between the name of the protagonist in James Joyce's Ulysses, Leopold Bloom, must be purposeful, no? Especially if one considers the nickname antics involved in the two stories.)Louis Bloom embraces his role as an opossum, monetizing the carrion of human sophistication with the utmost efficiency.In the strangest way, his attitude is highly admirable.For example, his belief in honest negotiation and dedicated apprenticeship endears the viewer.On the other hand (which I won't spoil) some of his behavior may be considered reprehensible.Who knows?See it and find out.As a final note, Bill Paxton is terrific. He plays a completely different character from his role in Live, Die, Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow, a July release which still remains one of my top ten movies of 2014.Pax tears it up no matter what.With too many great movies in his filmography to mention (including a number of classics from great directors like James Cameron, Kathryn Bigelow and John Hughes) I'll just say he first debuted in 1974.So he's been killing it for forty years. Keep it up, Bill!Check out Nightcrawler if you dig smart flicks.By the by, there's an homage to The Usual Suspects.High-fives for those who notice.",

            "content": "\"Nightcrawler\" details the exploits of Louis Bloom, an emotionally disturbed and likely sociopathic yet highly motivated young man who takes up freelance crime photography after witnessing cameramen taking footage of a car crash. As he propels through the ranks at the local news station to which he sells his films, he becomes more and more directly involved in the crimes that he documents. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a highly disquieting performance as Bloom, in what is arguably his best role yet. Though Louis immediately comes off as friendly and charming, you can't help but feel that this is just a mask, and that something much more dark and sinister bubbles just below the surface. This becomes much more apparent across the course of the film, as Louis freely extorts and manipulates others to get to his desired goals, without a shred of remorse. Virtually no backstory is granted for him, making him, and all of his unique tics and traits, all the more enigmatic and creepy. Other key characters, such as Nina (Rene Russo) and Rick (Riz Ahmed) are forced to play into Lou's plans, with great dramatic effect. The majority of the crimes that Lou film are only clearly shown through the grainy footage that he provides to his go-to news station, making we, the audience, feel as if we are also perpetuating and participating in his depraved acts. This coupled with Lou's gradual transition from passive filmmaker to borderline crime instigator makes for an uneasy viewing experience. Like Nicolas Winding Refn's \"Drive\" (2011), \"Nightcrawler\" has a distinct 80's neo-noir vibe, with a stylistic use of minimal lighting and synthesizer-driven soundtrack, which all help contribute to the production's haunting atmosphere. The end result is a hard-hitting, compelling film that forces audiences to question their own obsession with violent media and sensationalist news production. This, combined with a bold yet brilliant performance from Gyllenhaal makes \"Nightcrawler\" must-see viewing.",

            "content": "Some movies inspire you and restore your faith in greater things. Some movies make you laugh long after you've left the theater. Others deliver a white hot adrenaline rush. And then every once in a while there's a movie that makes you feel downright angry and disgusted. Not because the movie is bad or exploitive, but because it's about people who are downright loathsome. Nightcrawler is one of those movies. Its central character, Louis Bloom, is one of the most reprehensible characters ever put on screen, and he is absolutely fascinating in the most twisted way possibleWhen we first meet Lou, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, he's a small time lowlife paying the bills by selling whatever he can steal, while desperately trying to get regular work anywhere he can. But then a chance incident convinces him that he should be working as a freelance news cameraman, a nightcrawler. And he's right. After an almost comically bad start, he makes his break and starts climbing his way to the top of the business. And really how could he not; he's the perfect man for the job. From the start it's clear that he's shameless, cares about no-one else, and is a champion at spinning BS. He'll say anything to get an in, and go the extra mile to shoot whatever sells, even when little things like ethics or the law would stop his competitors.He'll also do whatever- lie, cheat, threaten, blackmail- to get what he wants for his footage. And he doesn't just want money. He wants respect, power and certain\u0085 other things that should never have to be given unwillingly. He's not just a scumbag, he is an absolute sociopath. And it rubs off on those closest to him, the very same people he's manipulating. It doesn't take much time for his wide-eyed, na\u00efve assistant Rick to start silencing his conscience in return for a paycheck. Broadcast manager Nina on the other hand is nearly as selfish and just as cynical as he Lou is. Yet her need for his footage forces her to do things she never would have considered before. She should and does hate him for it, but like a battered housewife she can't give him up.It really is amazing that such a detestable villain could be played by an actor as nice as Jake Gyllenhaal. I mean this is a guy who's become famous by playing the earnest, likable hero. But he's perfect here. In every scene he inhabits the character so fully that you have to keep reminding yourself that this really is Jake Gyllenhaal. His character the kind of person you're unlikely to meet outside of a Grand Theft Auto game, and yet it's so believable. And his appearance. Though he's fully recognizable but at the same time he looks so different, so slimy and conniving. It's like he's channeling the spirit of Peter Lorre, or maybe Uriah Heep.Nightcrawler isn't just an excellent character study in moral bankruptcy. It's also a rather disquieting peek into the less savory aspects of TV news. Not that every station exec is as desperate and muckraking as Nina, or any cameraman is as rotten as Lou. He is a category of his own. But local stations really do fight like dogs over the latest footage of wrecks and shootings, the more shocking the better. The hard fact is that human misery sells and sometimes the story is more important than the truth. Watching this movie is like listening to Don Henley's Dirty Laundry. It will leave you very cynical about modern TV journalism, and not without reason.The one real issue I have with this movie is that so much of it is hard to sit through simply because its protagonist is so unlikeable. It's almost stomach churning to see him get away with the things he does. Yet you can't stop watching because you can't wait to see him get what he deserves. I kept waiting and hoping that Lou would get busted and thrown in jail, or take one too many risks and get shot or run over. But the ending I got instead was so much more shocking and unsettling, even it if it wasn't satisfying in the conventional sense. It may not be the ending I wanted, but it was undoubtedly the one this movie deserved.",

One day that opportunity arrives in the form of a burning car and a badly injured woman on the side of the highway. Taken in by the scene, Lou feels compelled to observe the incident and pulls over. This is when he notices a freelance TV crew attempting to get a shot of the tangled mess. Lou is intrigued by the notion that you can make a living filming the atrocities across L.A. Shortly after Lou takes up the career of investigative journalism, but starts to blur the line between filming crimes and starting them. Lou is a sociopath, unable to make a genuine human connection. Jake Gyllenhaal does a more than convincing job of playing the character with a dark, twisted view on reality. Lou sits in his house all day reading teach-yourself courses on his computer and ironing his various shirts. He is detached from the world around him and instead absorbs as much information he can find from self-help programs on the internet. Once he takes up the role of investigative journalism Lou will do anything to get a shot, including home invasion and evading ethical morals. Gyllenhaal is fantastic in showing that Lou is out to help only one person, and that is Lou. He does some of the most despicable things to further his career including manipulating a young homeless man, played by Riz Ahmed, as his new employee. Yet at the end of the day Gyllenhaal gives Lou so much charisma and passion that we still find the character likable. The story uses the despicable acts of Lou to take stabs at the decaying genre that is crime-investigative journalism. It shows the dark and twisted mentality that news rooms are only can concerned about two things: how violent the act is, and how well the neighborhood is that it took place in. As aging producer Nina (played perfectly by Rene Russo) tells Lou, the more suburban and bloodier the footage, the better. Lou is consumed by the need to excel in the field. He starts to do anything in his power to get the most gruesome footage and will stop at nothing to make sure it gets tacked onto the six o'clock news. Director Dan Gilroy, who is also the writer here, paints a bleak and gritty take on after-hours L.A. The cinematography is striking, moving from twisted bodies in car wrecks to grisly triple homicides. He presents the film as a character study on the surreal world of Louis Bloom. While the film draws heavily from different inspirations, most notably the parallels between Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, Gilroy draws on enough creative differences that he creates an original film to stand apart from his predecessors. Nightcrawler offers the viewer a look into the shallow and messed up world of investigative journalism, and is one of the year's best films thanks to Gyllenhaal's twisted performance.",

From the dimly lit streets that encircle L.A. to the darkness of the valley and hills to the darkened high estates. The music is used sparingly to keep the foreboding atmosphere.",

            "content": "At first I thought about just giving the movie the 10/10, without actually writing anything. However, I finally come up with something to write. I usually to these reviews to mainly remind myself of what I thought about the movie right after seeing it, something I get lazy and don't write anything, and sometimes I forced myself to it. I loved this movie, and it got me at the egde of my sit the entire runtime basically, but it was difficult to find a specific thing I wanted to remind myself in the future.I saw some videos analyzing the movie, and bringing up the best parts of it, and the one that hock me the most was the one by the YT Channel \"Lessons from the Screenplay\" dissecting the art of building a story throughout the eyes of an anti-hero (or what some people would say, a villain, in this case). The way the film builds itself, and the layers the screenplay has are amazing, but at the end, the main reason why at some point we get ourselves rooting for the guy in a certain degree, is because at the end of the day, he is a perfect example of a \"villain\" created by society, our sensationalists news shows, wanting ratings more than the true, or even covering the most relevant stories at all, and even more, the industry that rewards this type of person, not only in the news business in this case, but the rewarding of people doing bad things overall, it's something that's overlooked, and will continue to be so as long as it makes money. That's the most amazing thing I took from this movie's story. Keep it in mind, future me.The acting is kind of a silly thing to talk about it at this point, Jake Gyllenhaal is insane, every new movie I watch from him, I become more and more a fan. The dude is ridiculously talented, has an insane charisma, and it's clearly committed as f# in his holes (he lost 20 pounds for this role). Everyone in the movie is awesome, Ahmed is great as well, he is also really talented. Everyone is basically solid as a rock in the movie.The last 20 minutes of it are insanely thrilling, the build up to it is perfect, you feel the urge, you care for what's in stake. Amazing. I truly don't have a single bad thing to point out here, so, I can't do anything but giving it a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "This film plays on the reasoning behind why we slow down to see a car accident. The macabre draws us into the tragedy of someone else's life. Walking into the cinema... The only draw for this film was Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. He is an under-appreciated actor who adds value to most of his films. Nightcrawler looks like a new dimension for his acting and for cinema. Overall rating: 2.75 stars Cinematic value: 4.25 stars Family value: 1.5 star\"What if my problem wasn't that I don't understand people but that I don't like them?\" Lou Bloom Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the product of a generation that has been fed a regular diet of self-help psychology and motivational speeches. In his tragic life these empty words are the basis for how he expresses his life. His relative morals change based on how they effect the achievement of his goals. Nightcrawler is set in the dark recesses of contemporary Los Angeles and it's journalistic news world. Specifically in the competitive industry of freelance video journalism. Where people strive to get the best video footage by being the first on the scene of the latest crash, fire, or crime scene. The old adage, \"If it bleeds, it leads,\" is taken to new depths in Dan Gilroy's (Real Steal) nocturnal adventure. Bloom stumbles upon an opportunity to become a nightcrawler, which is the term for a night-time, freelance cameraman. He begins to see the potential of achieving financial reward, personal recognition and fame from behind the camera. Lou quickly learns the tricks of the trade and how to thrive in this ultra-competitive industry. After varied success, he begins to see the value of reaching into the tragic scenes and manipulating the scenes for the sake of money, influence and recognition. His insatiable need for attention is fuelled by Nina, a veteran news director who has as much to gain by Lou's video footage, who is played skilfully by Rene Russo. Nightcrawler contains action and high speed thrills, but the real story is found in the incremental glimpses into the mind of Lou Bloom. How far will he go to get the best video footage? Jake Gyllenhaal and Dan Gilroy have outdone themselves with Nightcrawler. This film was eerily brilliant. In this world of moral relativism, the story blurs the lines of right and wrong. Gilroy takes the story back and forth across this line of morality so many times that the line is worn away and leaves nothing but an uneasy entertainment experience. It does beg the question of where the characters find their ethics and morals? Lou Bloom is at the centre of this journey into the realm of morality or lack of it. Gyllenhaal gives the performance of a lifetime. Lou seems likable, but a dark narcissism is hidden behind his winsome smile. Like the response most have toward the scenes that he films, Lou's character initially causes revulsion, but pulls you back to the bloody scene that is left in his wake. The comparison of his the scenes he films and his actual life includes the different individuals that are introduced throughout the film. These people come into Lou's orbit and have to determine if they will circumnavigate around his world or be destroyed by his gravitational pull. Their lives are a metaphor of his manipulated video footage and Rick Garcia, Rene Russo and Bill Paxton add depth to this sorted tale. Like the many flawed characters, Gilroy manages to utilise the night of the city to be an extension of Bloom and the murky side of his life which is a psychological thrill ride. For all the brilliance of this film, there is an insatiable need to take a shower after leaving the theatre. The last thing you would want is the residue of Lou Bloom. He is masterfully crafted by Gyllenhaal, but in the end Lou does not have any redeeming qualities. The 'motivational speak' comes from his mouth like rapid firing bullets which inevitably find their victims. The brilliance of the writing and the acting manages to find the line of comfort and forces the audience to walk across it with Bloom. Each scene is directed effectively by Gilroy, who pulls back the curtain and reveals our voyeuristic need forU up to the minute news. The ethical lines of the news business and life get blurred throughout the film and the characters seem quite satisfied to stay in the ambiguous side of life. Especially if they benefit from the result of their actions. Nightcrawler is like a spectacular accident scene on the highway, exciting to watch, but in the end you might wish you had looked away. Rating: The film is filled with mature themes, language and images that should consider discernment. Leaving the cinema... This was Gyllenhaal and Gilroy at their best. Nightcrawler was creepy, but brilliant film making that did not make me want to see it again. Lou Bloom is one of the best written characters in film today, but there is a problem. There is nothing in Lou Bloom's life to cheer about and you do not want him to come out on top. The sheer reality of the film is what caused this bi-polar response. How little would it take for us all to be like Lou. That is what makes this film more disturbing than any horror film. Ask yourself, if you want anything bad enough, how long would it be until you were like Lou, too? I need a shower. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about ethics? (Isaiah 1:17-19, Luke 16:15, Romans 12:1) 2. Who can you trust? (Numbers 23:19, Psalm 89:34, Romans 8:28) 3. Do we have to like people?

There are no boundaries to what he won't do, and his conscience if he has one, is seared to the suffering of others.Filming graphic video of news events involving human loss (fatal accidents, fires, crime, etc.), especially at night (hence the title Nightcrawler), Lou sells his video to the Los Angeles channel 6 news director, Nina, played by Rene Russo. Nina is a seasoned veteran of the industry who has become jaded to the graphic display of shocking news stories. After all, this is lead story stuff to her news team's broadcasts and the stuff that leads to higher ratings. Nina has become a bit of psychopath herself, well suited for her weird relationship with Louis.Disturbing movie, but well done.",

Good Ol' Jake never gets his nod at the Oscars unless he's Broken-some-backs?\"Nightcrawler(s)\" is a term for freelance cameramen, seen here roaming LA after dark in search of lurid stories to sell to TV: as the dictum goes: \"If it bleeds, it leads.\"Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a venturesome beginner who demonstrates appallingly great at the exchange, being completely committed and hyper-composed, with the moral second thoughts of a moray eel.The experiences about the ethical opportunity of TV news are not really novel, yet what gives Nightcrawler its class is Gyllenhaal's alarming, now and then coldly comic execution as the beguiled screw- up, always vacantly gushing certifiable administration manual talk. Yet, underneath the enthusiastic beaver brilliance is a non domesticated soul, showed up \u2013 oil slicked hair, the thinness of a sleep deprived person austere and a glare that appears to be painted on to his eyelids, as though Lou is a recording gadget for all time exchanged on.There's solid support from Riz Ahmed as Lou's hapless en-roll, however the genuine shock is a show-taking Rene Russo as Nina, a hard- nibbled news manager on the falling flat station that offers Lou his reprieve. In an uncommon scene, Lou welcomes her to supper, consults for better terms and, as a major issue, demands this extensively more established lady laying down with him; the enthusiastic (and oedipal) fencing between the two is awfully convincing.Mental extravagance aside, Nightcrawler works adequately as an incline thriller, with the city night given a cool, metallic sheen by cinematographer Robert Elswit. It may not be pivotal, but rather Nightcrawler emerges as an appreciated peculiarity today, reviewing the kind of harsh dramatisations once made by executives, for example, Michael Mann, Sidney Lumet or James B Harris. Gilroy marginally blows it with a group satisfying climactic pursue, yet this is an appropriately grown-up excitement; and it contains the most critical new beast in sight, being the most miserably human.Louis Bloom is pretty much pure evil. Worse than that, he is the kind of pure evil that you might expect to find living right next door to you. Though ultimately just a man, Bloom has long abandoned any semblance of humanity in favour of pursuing any venture that will benefit him and him alone.This philosophy eventually attracts Bloom to the world of paparazzi-style news recording.The worst part is that \"Nightcrawler\" leads us to believe that Bloom will ultimately get his in the end, but that doesn't prove to be the case. At all. Instead, we come to find that Bloom will not only avoid prosecution for his various crimes, but that he's found himself a very profitable place in the world of violent news reporting. Things could not have gone better for this madman.",

            "content": "Jake Gyllenhaal is only as good as his material. In Nightcrawler he is excellent. His character, Louis Bloom, is like the accidents he films; he shocks us, but we can't turn away. Los Angeles is the perfect backdrop for the soulless art of the freelance news stringer. They are ambulance chasers with cameras; they scavenge off the body of human suffering. They look for the worst, most sensational, tragedies and sell pain to the highest bidder at the local news stations. Direct and writer Dan Gilroy lets the story speak for itself. There are moments of camera theatrics that match the drama of the story, but the only camera work we notice is that of Bloom and his competitors. Bloom films the gutter and goes into the gutter to get his stories, sometimes seeding the gutter to have get a scoop. Bloom does whatever it takes and has at best a twisted sense of morality. Like the ignominious photographers that let famine victims starve to not interfere with the story and to get their award winning photo, Bloom will do what it takes to have the best footage to sell. The relationships Bloom creates lack a real quality. In a surreal film such as Nightcrawler, that is a plus. In fact, functional relationships is the last thing we expect from Bloom. Renee Russo as the late-night news director Nina Romina is twisted and charming like Bloom. Nina puts on the trappings of social normality even if her work is morally questionable as well. Bloom's \"employee\" is cowed into work due to his desperate conditions. For all of Bloom's lack of news experience, he knows how to play people and take advantage of their vulnerabilities. He's a charming sociopath much like large hedge-fund managers on Wall Street. Rating: Pay Full PriceThe movie is direct, creepy, anxiety producing and entertaining. It has all the elements of a good horror movie in a drama. It's a critique of the media and news, and it highlights our individual isolation as Taxi Driver did for us nearly 40 years ago. Most of all, Nightcrawler entertains while making the audience very uncomfortable. It leaves us with more questions than answers without preaching to us. Peace, Tex Shelters",

I kept waiting for a plot twist but nope. Just the creepy guy filming more scenes in a loosely strung together plot. The main character is able to interfere with crime scenes, google search license plates with ease (in the 90's!!), and cut the breaks of a rival van without conflict. In fact, there really isn't any conflict. I've seen Disney films with conflict that was more solemn. Seriously, it's 1 + long movie of a weird sociopath shooting films leaving the audience on edge just waiting for the twist that never comes.

Lou comes with too much willingness to pursue violence to be termed a victim of society, but nevertheless he is what he is less because he was born that way and more because he was molded that way.The very first words out of Lou's mouth are quite telling:\"I'm lost.\"\nIn fact, at that particular moment in that particular place Lou is not lost at all. He knows exactly where he is. On a much grander scale, however, Lou is very much lost. This is obvious by the way he speaks. He doesn't speak like a regular human. Any time Lou has more than one sentence to say to something he slips into a cadence, rhythm and tone that sounds more like a motivational speaker or, even more so, like a guy in front of an audience force to sell himself because he knows the product he's trying to peddle is crap. But, they, America is all about the packaging, right? Because if you don't like what's beneath the wrapper, you can just throw it away and buy something else.Lou is lost because he has bought fully into the new America dream. Not the old one about finding a good job, buying a house, raising a family and not having to worry about class dictating the terms. The American dream Lou is pursuing is the bumper sticker dream. Lou is all about packaging. There is no core in there and everything he thinks is deep thinking sounds like something you'd see on a motivational poster or bumper sticker:\"Do you know what fear stands for? False Evidence Appearing Real.A friend is a gift you give yourself.Why you pursue something is equally as important as what you pursue.Good things come to those who work their asses off.\nMy motto is if you want to win the lottery you've got to make money to buy a ticket.\"That last one there is particularly insightful because Lou doesn't have a motto. If that's his motto, then you can bet he heard or read it somewhere else. (The one about friends being a gift, by the way, comes from Robert Louis Stevenson, but he meant it in a way completely opposite from how Lou exploits it.) What human being actually speaks like that on a daily basis in normal discourse with others? The answer is those who have taken the lessons the titans of American capitalism have been teaching them literally.Most of us know that kind of stuff is so vapid as to be meaningless and just laugh it off and go about living in the real world. But Lou caught on to something that rest of us haven't. The titans of American capitalism are vapid and they do it mean and, most important, they don't live in the real world. They live in a world where success is measured only by whether you have more money tomorrow than you did today. That's it, that's all. By that standard, Lou Bloom ends the movie as the embodiment of the American dream. By every other standard, not so much.",

This film takes us into the world of Louis Bloom, where logic is the key to success and no matter what you have to do to achieve it, reaching the goal in mind is paramount. What I enjoyed most was that at times I didn't feel like I was watching a movie at all because Bloom's character is too real; there are people like him who really do exist, which scary as hell! There were moments where a scene or two seemed to last forever, but that adds to what makes this film so real. The acting was superb, the plot nearly perfect, and almost every action that took place leading to the jaw-dropping ending kept me on the edge of my seat. This film is one for the history books for sure!!!",

Now, that made me sit up straight and quite admittedly made me think i am in for a treat. This is the point where the movie begun for me and sadly it ended there as well. There was no flow or character development. The guy goes from place to place in his car shooting gory stuff and at the end he is still doing that, only now, with two vans. That's about it. I am not that guy who would like to see a point in every movie. Movies are not made to make a point but money. But at least as a viewer I must be able to associate myself with some element in the movie. Sadly, there was no such thing in this movie.At its best ,the movie shows how a moderately ill-minded loner turns to a total psychopath. And seriously, whats the deal with Jake \"wanting to do\" Rene Russo. I felt that bit was totally out of place and added no value to the movie. And yeah, if i were to commit a triple homicide with my buddy,the Next thing I will do is to drive the same SUV in the same town and go eat chow mien in a Chinese restaurant.

The story is also quite unique, you also learn something about camera material which news on TV use and who that material produces. The music is also satisfying and underlines the dark atmosphere.

Given that this review is dated full four years since the movie was released , it would be farcical to pen down a detailed opinion on the more obvious aspects of the movie, such as , Jake Gyllenhaal's excellent performance or the lucid writing of Mr. Gilroy. Hence, I shall focus on the aspects that may prove adulatory to the direction of the movie.Given its fairly straightforward and no frills story-line, the director does a stupendous job in creating a gripping thriller. There is something reticent about the pace of the movie. However, the movie is very tense. The director has exploited the situational plot brilliantly, creating characters and sequences that keep one on the edge.This tension, that lingers in the background and slowly grows on screen, is given an explicit expression in a powerful scene where the lead character exhibits frustration before a bathroom mirror.The lead character has a menacing presence in the movie, because the character walks on the edge . There is not a single scene where one does not fear that he may lose control and not a single scene where the audience can relax due to predictability.Mr. Gilroy's other ventures have not been quite as gripping as this movie. The credit of course has to be shared with Mr. Gyllenhaal who may have rendered a post modern image of the eponymous creature.Unlike a few other thrillers, one can watch this film repeatedly because the suspense it holds is not just confined to sequences but also to the interludes.",

The editor played by Renee Russo tells Louie Bloom played by Jake Gyllenhaal and I quote, \"If it bleeds it leads.\" Louie Bloom is a thief looking for a job. When Bloom sees a car crash and police is helping the victim. Two men come close and start filming the incident. Then Joe Loder (played by Bill Paxton) tells him that this video is for news channel. Bloom asks for job. He denies. Bloom starts filming his own videos, he even hires a guy. He goes to the lowest rating news channel in LA. That is all, I can tell you about the plot.

Much like the film itself the thing I loved about Jake Gyllenhaals performance was how different it was, the formal way he spoke and the repetitive techniques he uses to talk to people made his character an interesting presence. This film also did something for me that very few other films have, it didn't bother me that it had a lot of awkward interactions between characters, it added to the unhinged and strange nature of Gyllenhaals character. The main character is the thing that carries this movie and he is most definitely not this films hero, I could just as easily describe him as an antagonist because he does such horrible things in this film that make you realise that he's not the \"good guy\" but instead a pretty horrific person. This film also has a really great atmosphere to it, it made LA night life feel gritty and violent. Meg Ryan was also brilliant in this film she felt like a real professional and the perfect opposing force to Gyllenhaal, she's also a very well written character that has clear vulnerabilities that makes her better rounded as a person. I only really have on flaw with this film and it's Riz Ahmed's character, Ahmed was brilliant in this film but the character was boring, he had no presence to him, he got on my nerves a lot and the scenes between them never really grabbed me like the rest of the film did. This is a truly original and different film, Gyllenhaal gives his best performance since Zodiac, the main protagonist is interesting to watch, it's got such a real life and gritty vibe to it and it was only aspects of Ahmed's character that got to me in an overall truly fantastic film. 9.3/10: A (Phenomenal)",

Aiding and abetting him is Nina Romina (Rene Russo),a TV-news veteran at a local station, who shares the same (lack of) values as Bloom.The movie has a lot going for it. A thriller could not have asked for a better setup; there are the crimes being filmed on the one hand and on the other, there are the actions of the protagonist himself as he hunts those crime stories. And there is additional horror for the audience in that the news they watch on a daily basis is the result of such depravity.The movie has a subject matter that has never been dealt with by mainstream cinema and a great cast with the lead actors sharing a particularly good (and foul) chemistry. In spite of all this the film only comes out as mediocre. It has a strong first-half; the characters are introduced well and it easily captures our attention. However the second-half comes across as stale; some of the scenarios feel repetitive, the ending is predictable and the characters too start to feel flat. The film also does some the mistakes other thrillers (I am looking at you Gone Girl) do; give unrealistic liberties to the bad guys and makes all the other characters, particularly cops, way too dumb and/or incompetent.The movie tries to be a thriller-cum-commentary on some of the journalistic practices but ends being a slightly below-average, pop-corn flick.",

However, I think this movie is just 'good', what is a surprise. No doubt the criticism of the media is something memorable and that will make most people who attended think otherwise in relation to journalism and the media.Surprisingly, the movie didn't captivate me. About Jake's job, it was really a great performance, snubbed by the Academy. I could make a link between his performance with Cumberbatch's in the Imitation Game, because both worked very well in a unusual personality, not just in the lines, but also with the gestures, the way they move, among other things (I am not being very successful in explaining what I mean). I would say that Jake's performance is better than the Michael Keaton's one in Birdman and it is probably better than Bradley Cooper in American Sniper (I still haven't watched the movie, but I don't take a lot of faith in Bradley Cooper in this movie). The performance of Rene Russo is also really good, even though I think that her character isn't very good. I also like very much the performance of the Lou's partner. Till just before the end of the movie, I would give six stars. But I really think that the final sequence, where the character Lou stalks the murderers, is EXCELLENT. The scene of the pursuit and what this results is, in my opinion, the best part in the whole movie and thanks to it, I give seven stars.

OMG Jake Gyllenhaal is a great find, he can act like crazy. From the way he talks, where he lives, his work style everything has been throughly thought out.The second most important point in this movie is dialogues, it was mind blowing, although sometimes you get the feel he is just talking like google, but that's the way people such as him talk. His rationale in everything his does is factual and you go along with it. If you are extremely career driven, this is how you will be. It will be great for your career but will make look and sound like a asshole The movie does not take much time in settling in, no back story or any of that to waste our time. It starts off with the thinnest of premise and just works way around it. This just shows anything that if you dream of, no matter how small it is, if you put complete hard work and be a crazy minded freak it will get you phenomenal results.Also i liked the fact the focus on movie was clearly confined and you will not have to make your own premonition of things. He wants to excel and he will do whatever it takes to do it. And when i say whatever, i literally mean whatever. You will get really uncomfortable with the character half way into the movie and would just don't want to root for him, but at the same time intrigued to find out how it turns out. That is how thick the character development is in this film.Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed have done their part really well. Again the dialogues were a selling point to their characters. In every frame they are in they contribute the right amount in the screenplay, they could have easily turned out to be extras in the movie who slow the screenplay, but thankfully they are not, they were absolutely perfect.Yes, it was great acting, wonderful dialogues, a simple and effective story line, but still i wouldn't want to watch the movie again, may be because am human and i still believe death is end of life and not just another scene to be shot. I agree people such as him would come to think of it that way, but some sentiments wouldn't have been bad. People such as him would but really successful in life, but will not have anyone to share with and that to me a total waste of your efforts. So, in many levels the movie was good, it lacked the basic human instincts, rather than just framing your speeches based on numbers from internet and data from your computer human beings are still in charge of machines only because we bring the emotion part into the mix. It may not be right at all times, but i still believe it is needed and this movie did not have anything at all.All in all, you will love the movie for what it is, but will not have one stand-out moment or would not recommend watching this movie to be a annual thing to do with your friends.",

However, this one here doesn't give us much. We have a burglar. A burgler who is a rational, win and success-oriented psychopath who piece by piece gets what he wants simply by being a \"quick learner\". We don't know why he is like that in the first place. We don't know why, for example, he didn't use his creative energy and his seemingly unlimited ambition and work ethic to get a decent and well-payed job; did he go to university? did he even finish school? where did he get his brainpower from? just by reading stuff in books or online? For some reason, the writers do not want to give us this information. Maybe we don't need to know it, but I think it could've helped occasionally, because every antihero / villain has a specific reason why he or she developed into the monster that they are now which can make certain notions relatable. All in all, the character Lou doesn't develop much throughout this movie, and usually, this is essential. Lou gets people killed for his own benefit. But we don't know if he hasn't done that before, so we can't really tell if he is developing or not. Yes, he fails at the beginning of his job and succeeds at the end but he never changes his attitude, he doesn't develop personally. To me, this is a little problematic, HOWEVER, I think Jake Gyllenhall plays his part brilliantly and the idea of the story is just fantastic. How far would you go for the perfect image / video material? I also liked how his situation within the storyline successively escalates: 1. Move dead body for the sake of a better shot, 2. Manipulate the car of his opponent causing an accident, 3. Actually stage a crime scene and be there before anything happens. ... so that is all great! I liked the cinematography as well, they really managed to build up thrilling scenes of high suspense by matching form and content. 7/10... Apperantly, movies can work without much background information on their main character. There are probably even tons of good movies that do that and I'm not even aware of it yet.

The way Jake depicts his character, his mania, his drive and perfectionist character, is immaculate. Even this weird look on his face and the moments he seems to be on the edge of freaking out but does not, were breathtaking. I found myself actually being frightened about what might happen next. The entire movie was a roallercoaster for the viewer. Being on his side, then wishing he is caught for what he does, then again not. His co-actor/helper was also brilliant.

            "content": "\"If it bleeds, it leads,\" a veteran news photographer actually says out loud in Nightcrawler, as if we've never heard that one before. I don't know if you happen to have noticed but sometimes our tabloid media panders to the lowest common denominator without much concern for professional ethics or human decency. In the wake of this shocking revelation, I'll give you a moment to un-clutch your pearls and get up from the fainting couch before we continue.Okay, so this directorial debut from screenwriter Dan Gilroy stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Louis Bloom, a wormy cretin on the fringes of Los Angeles making ends meet by stealing copper wire and manhole covers. Louis speaks almost exclusively in the kind of banal self-help slogans you hear at charlatan business seminars, but despite the go-getter lingo he still looks like a drowned rat. Following his daft turn in last year's prestige howler Prisoners, Gyllenhaal is apparently reinventing his career by playing aliens. He lost a lot of weight for this role \u2014 which is what serious young actors do \u2014 distorting his bland handsomeness into a cadaverous, sunken visage. Bug-eyed and unblinking, Gyllenhaal eschews contractions and cycles through a retrospective of the young Robert De Niro's greatest tics. It's an awful lot of acting but not much of a character.Louis has his \"eureka\" moment when he happens upon a grisly car accident and notices a free-lance cameraman shooting all the gory details. Played by Bill Paxton (in one of those nothing, expositional roles name actors sometimes take as favors to friends making their first movies) this \"nightcrawler\" hips our protagonist to all the exciting opportunities available to anyone with a camcorder and a police scanner. Before long Louis is out roaming the streets himself, gathering graphic footage he sells to a bottom-rung local television station's beleaguered news department.Being a fearless sociopath, he's quite good at this \u2013 earning the admiration of a ratings-hungry executive played by Rene Russo playing Faye Dunaway in Network. (So much of Nightcrawler is borrowed from other movies it should come with footnotes citing sources.) The alarmist \"satirical\" TV stuff here is adorably quaint, feeling as if Gilroy has had this script in his desk drawer since the Reagan administration and nobody had the heart to tell him that Dirty Harry already skewered these nocturnal, ambulance-chasing news crews to much greater comic effect twenty-six years ago in The Dead Pool.As Louis moves up in the world, Nightcrawler becomes a bent Horatio Alger tale \u2013 a logical end to self-improvement mantras unencumbered by conscience. Bloom gets a flashy car and an intern he can abuse, blurring the boundaries of acceptable behavior to increasingly sinister returns while Russo's stick-in-the-mud sidekick (Mad Men's Teddy Chaough) buries his face in his hands, ineffectually whimpering about ethics in journalism. Gilroy's film marches slowly to a foregone conclusion that feels like small potatoes given how many times we've seen this kind of thing before.I'm told the film was inspired by the 2009 case of a Brazilian talk show host who hired contract killers as part of a ratings stunt, but despite the look-at-me weirdness of Gyllenhaal's performance, Nightcrawler is far too staid for any such outre developments. It's a handsome-looking movie shot from boringly conventional angles, with the great cinematographer Robert Elswit employing 35mm for daylight scenes and digital video in the darkness. The iridescent, empty L.A. cityscapes at night and James Newton Howard's synth-pop score suggest everyone involved is a big fan of Drive.This curiously underpopulated picture is missing one crucial character \u2013 the audience. At no point are we complicit in any of the voyeuristic kicks Gilroy aims to indict. This stuff wouldn't sell if people weren't watching, but the movie seems afraid to wade into that particular muck the way, say Oliver Stone did with Natural Born Killers. Gyllenhaal's creepazoid theatrics are superficially amusing (he plays every interaction like Travis' \"Henry Krinkle\" conversation with the Secret Service agent in Taxi Driver, right down to the icky fake smile) but leave the viewer at a safe reserve. For a movie that tries so hard to be disturbing, Nightcrawler is actually quite comforting. It takes a societal sickness and blames it on a boogeyman.",

            "content": "If you're looking for an absolutely amazing character study of a sociopath, Nightcrawler is exactly what you need. This is the directorial debut of Dan Gilroy, and while you can see areas where he needs to tighten up his work, overall it's extremely impressive. Probably the most impressive part of this film is the performances and writing. The films characters are very well written, and the actors completely deliver it perfectly. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. He plays Lou Bloom, a man who is extremely manipulative and will do anything to get what he wants to be successful. But he isn't your run of the mill kind of guy. He's a total sociopath. We are given little scenes where we see him interacting with people or just doing things inside his apartment by himself that perfectly build up his character. Gyllenhaal is amazingly intense and completely believable, and I can't say enough good things about his performance. Rene Russo also gives a performance as a woman who is also quite demented in her own way. I also think Riz Ahmed did a good work as Gyllenhaal's side kick who works with him. Overall the cast is just great and is a massive strength for the film.I think the film has a very interesting theme being looked at throughout. It's essentially about the lengths people will go to get what they want, make money, and keep a job. We see it in Gyllenhaal's character because he will steal and lie to get what he wants, and we see it in Russo's character because she will use graphic footage and try to make a story seem more scary to the public than it is in order to keep her job at the news station where she works. Perhaps it's some kind of commentary on how the working world is today. People don't have job security like they used to, and people have to work hard in a cutthroat world. It all really works and is well thought out.Now one big issue I had was with the soundtrack. Now, during some moments it works and has a dark tone, but in other moments it doesn't work and is too upbeat feeling, such as the car crash where Bloom does a little \"fixing\" to get the shot he wants. What we are seeing is very dark but the music doesn't fit, and honestly I think it does a major disservice to Gyllenhaal's passionate performance. I think it would have benefited from a more dark scoreOverall I would highly recommend this film for Gyllenhaal's performance alone. It's absolutely amazing to see. I hope to see some more great work from Dan Gilroy because this film shows he has some big potential.",

Its about a disturbing guy who wants to 'be someone' and all he has is whatever he can scratch together out of whatever he can get his hands on even if that means stealing anything he can get his hands on. The main characters motivations are dark but never obvious unless you look a bit deeper. Nobody really does except for one cop who basically disappears from the flow of events as if she were no more than a fart. I doubt the main character would have been so seamlessly exonerated for his misdeeds as the film progressed because his misdeeds were of an ever mounting nature. There is no hero in this film-only a sad fade to black ending as the main character cinches himself a better position in the food chain through more realized trickery and false representation. All in all probably a new American classic.",

Reminds me of the famous Wee Gee who covered the police beat in NYC in the 1930s with his trunk full of camera gear and a police scanner. Coverage and the need for a 'bleeds it lead' story hasn't changed much.Jake really fills the role of an up and coming, 'wannabe' news night time stringer. His performance reminded me of the great performance of Robbin Williams in One Hour Photo. Truly stunning jobs by both of them. Bill Paxton was wonderful as the grizzled Nightcrawler.Lots of news satire in this movie and the great line of course is from Rene Russo (hot) when she says \"we are interested in the uptick in suburban crime and how crime is spilling out to the burbs.\" I just sent an email to 5 of my friends to watch this movie.However, I think the dialog was a bit too wordy and more like an essay at times and dragged the story down a little. Remember For a Few Dollars more and the man with no name and little to say. There seemed to be a little too much psycho babble by the character and his actions made a lot of the points anyway. I didn't think that at the end he needed to say to his partner who just died in a shoot out that he was just a story lead, it was obvious. So less verbosity would have really made a better movie, I think. Sometimes too much dialog is like hitting the brake on an Indy Race Car before it crosses the finish line.But all in all a wonderful cast, great visuals, good direction, great writing, cool subtle soundtrack, and current absorbing storyline.There was another film, Paparazzi, that viewers may also want to check out.",

Nightcrawler is a character study, a look into the mind of an already established psychopath as he delves deeper and deeper to the point of no return. You follow Lou Bloom, a man who goes from one payout to the next in a variety of illegal ways, until one night he discovers he has an unmatched talent for Nichtcrawling, which is the filming of crime scenes and violent acts for the seedy underworld of the late night news. Bloom becomes so obsessed with capturing the best possible crime on camera and goes to unspeakable lengths to achieve his goal. Gyllenhaal gives the performance of his life as the creepy yet totally gripping lou Bloom, with his wide eyes that never blink and stilted conversations that sound as if he's gone onto the web and looked up 'How to talk to people'. The whole movie essentially follows his journey up the ladder of the Nightcrawling profession, in fact I don't think there's a single scene in the film which he doesn't appear in, as the other cast members really do play supporting roles for the main even that is Bloom. The action sequences are done immaculately, with the last 20 minutes of the movie proving to be the tensest I've seen in a long time. I can't think of a serious issue I have with this movie. The acting from Gyllenhaal is Oscar worthy, the storyline is unpredictable and tense and even the directing, whilst not perfect, really portrays LA night-life superbly.

Dan Gilroy's work is so stunningly crafted that it's hard to believe this his debut. The film follows the rise of Louis Bloom (a truly transformed Jake Gyllenhaal). When we meet Bloom he is working as a petty thief, struggling to find a profession in the midst of a recession and unable to find work. He takes his setbacks in stride, constantly on the lookout for opportunity and a chance to move upwards. That moment comes at the site of a car crash. Slowing down his car to watch as two police officers struggle to free a woman as her car quickly goes up in flames, Louis notices some men aggressively filming the rescue operation. After pumping one of the cameramen for information he learns that they are free lance photographers, working to find the bloodiest most gruesome footage and selling it to morning news shows who keep looking for bloodier and bloodier footage to maintain what little viewership they still have. Stealing his way into obtaining a cheap camcorder Louis sets out to get his own slice of this gruesome pie and it isn't long before he begins to climb his way up the ladder, resorting to increasingly illegal and sketchy tactics to insure that he gets the perfect shot and the highest cheques. Literally everything about this film is flawlessly made. The script is tight, the cinematography, which captures L.A. at night, is dark and beautiful. Jake Gyllenhaal is the standout. There's just something slightly off and creepy about Louis's physicality but it never descends into parody or caricature. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Rene Russo is flawless as a cut throat news producer with little ethics. Riz Ahmed is great as Rick, Louis's intern/assistant who swallows his fears about what he's doing for the promise of cash. An auspicious debut by Gilroy, I can't wait to see what he does next.",

He's blown me away in more movies than I can name (some of my favorites being \"Donnie Darko\", \"Prisoners\", and \"Enemy\") and his latest role as the sleazy crime reporter Lou Bloom even further proves his genius. He manages to up his first-class standard of acting and single-handedly carry this thrill ride of a film. \"Nightcrawler\" is one of those movies that comes out of nowhere and astonishes you, proving that Hollywood can still widely release great films. It's a game-changer, and an entertaining one at that.The film centers around Bloom, a driven young guy living in Los Angeles that never quite operates on everyone's level. Desperate for work and looking for something to occupy his time, he comes across the fast paced world of crime journalism. Quickly forcing his way into the business and filming anything the news stations will buy, he begins to tow the line between observer and participant, all for his own favor. The more dangerous it is to capture, the more money he receives. And as you can expect, things get out of hand (much to the pleasure of the audience).It moves at an insanely rapid pace from one incident to the next and is one of the most captivating films I've seen in a long time. I never stopped to check the time once, which certainly says something, and was mesmerized by the mannerisms and dialogue coming from this peculiar character. Everything about this movie enchanted me: the darkly comic moments, dedicated performances, and dynamite writing. Add all that up and you have one of my favorite films of the year.

I'm looking forward to Gyllenhall's future projects. If he can keep this level rudimentary, the academy has no other chance to honor this man.\nAlso sensational was the directing debut from Dan Gilroy. The tight production, the interesting design of LA as well as the pleasant music were a very good combination. I'm curious what we will see from this man in the future.

For me it was not only about the dark and immoral side of human mind, but also about where that side often surfaces, in work. I hope I'm not alone with my interpretation.The story is about Lou Bloom, a smart and charismatic psychopath, who, despite of his obvious talents, is a small time crook. One night he crashes into freelance news cameramen who are covering crimes and accidents and makes a career choice at once.And it seems he does well for himself. He has exactly the right set of skills for the work. No consciousness, moral or sense of empathy and a talent to manipulate people. From there on, we can follow Lou's morally grotesque way to the top of the business.Everything he does is as succesfull as it is morally wrong. The things he does to his assistant, competitor and also to his boss, who by the way doesn't deserve any more sympathy either, are really beyond disgusting. It showcases the freelancer news shooter scene as very cold world where victims are seens as dollars and cents and the misfortune of others is the fortune of nightcrawler. People are really not people at all, just expendable assets.What brings the added extra intensity to Lou's character is phenomenal performance of Jake Gyllenhaal. He actually lost a lot of weight for this role, and his dedication to become Lou Bloom can be seen on the screen. This is definitely one of the strongest performances of his career, and that's a lot said when we are talking about actor like Jake Gyllenhaal. Rene Russo also delivers a solid performance in supporting role.What all the people surely get out of this movie is the painting of the mind of a utterly cold sociopath and the coldness and corruption of the sort of news business presented here. However, I'd like to add third aspect here, namely how people lose themselves in their jobs. Been reading lately Deadly Medicines And Organized Crime book by Peter C. G\u00f6tschze, that introduces the immorality of pharma industry. There the author mentions once that he knows some of the people in industry, and they would never do the stuff they do at job in their pivate lifes. Somehow it seems that when they enter the work, their morale changes completely. And it is quite often, than people who have what you could called green set of values, end up doing job that is harmfull to the environment and against their values, just to state an example.I mean, in this movie, Lou of course doesn't do his legal job very legally. But the point is, that when he goes from the world of crime to the world of legal business, he doesn't go more ethical, but a long way to unethical direction.So, the bad news is not that there're psychopaths among us, but that they are really succesfull in this world. It's not just few individuals that're corrupted, but more like the entire system, that drives people to be even more corrupted, what obviously is presented in this movie.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is among the most impressive directorial debuts I have ever seen. A razor sharp screenplay from writer/director Dan Gilroy, combining sharp and precise satire with a unique character in Louis Bloom. This character in particular is the film's primary draw, both in terms of performance and writing.Jake Gyllenhaal is spectacular as Bloom. His weight loss gives his face a ghoulish quality, and his huge eyes evoke an owl, constantly watching and calculating, purely in visual terms, Gyllenhall delivers a knockout blow. This ghoulish quality mirrors the characters complex, but undoubtedly deplorable, personality. A- moral, manipulative and megalomaniacal slime-ball at heart, Gyllenhaal also manages to add pathos and relatability to a character who would be totally unsympathetic in lesser hands. I do not wish to spoil this performance any further, other than to say it is one of the best all year and is entirely due to the commitment of the incredible actor at the helm, along with a top notch script.The other performances also deserve praise. Paxton is fun as always, a hugely underrated actor in my opinion. Riz Ahmed delivers a highly likable and naturalistic performance, managing to keep pace with Gyllenhaal in even the most intense sequences. I have high hopes for this young actor in future supporting roles. Above both of these performances however stands Rene Russo, delivering an intense and densely satirical portrayal of the manipulators of the media. It evokes Faye Dunaway from 'Network' and is a very well delivered supporting role. The screenplay itself is spectacular, probably one of the best in recent years. Every dialogue exchange is memorable and layered, with the excellent cast delivering the dialogue perfectly. It blends character, satire of the media, and thriller-ish elements wonderfully and feels complete and well thought out.The pacing of the film is also very strong, slowly building in complexity and instability, much like it's main character, however some may find the conclusion slightly jarring.Aside the acting and the screenplay, the camera-work is also great, utilising the subject matter, TV news footage, to deliver some wonderful visually unique sequences and shots. The lighting in particular was fantastic, emphasising shadows and the natural lights found in a city like L.A., giving the film a unique visual flavour and echoing the shady subject of the film.Overall, this film was amazing. I demand accolades for Gyllenhaal, and I hope this slick satire is recognised for what it is.",

While driving home, he comes upon a car crash where a van pulls to the side and a couple guys with camera's hop out and start to film it. He overhears them talking about selling the footage and whatnot. He approaches them for a job and the guy tells him to take a hike, not that politely though.This is where he gets the idea and wants to do this himself. He buys a camcorder, police radio and hires a guy off the street to be his gps so to speak. He learns the LA cop codes and only goes after the graphic accidents. He becomes so successful he's able to buy a new car.About half way is when you realize how terrifying this guy can be. When he beats the cops to a crash, he moves a victim so that he can get a better shot. What's most important to him, is him and his success and doesn't care about anything else. The ending will sum of the type of person he is. I hated the guy, but he was interesting and I was intrigued at how far he was willing to go. A solid 8/10",

I cannot stress enough the impact and intensity from Jake Gyllenhaal, his character Lou is terrifying, but not in a directly violent way, but in a way that he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals no matter what the obstacle. He is manipulative and in a sense, a genius, and that is what makes him so frightening, he's the smartest guy in the room. I loved watching him start small and then climb his way to the top by using people who are nothing more than pawns in his grand scheme of things. Aside from Lou, the plot in general is genius, it speaks volumes about today's society and our obsession with violence and media. It basically portrays the media as attention whores who will do anything for a leading story and television ratings. They lack morals & compassion, and exploit people at their most vulnerable. An industry perfectly fit for the cold and emotionless Lou, who is willing to take things one step further. But even with all these shining aspects from the film, there is one glowing problem, its abrupt ending. It wrapped up too neat and quick, it could have been either a happy ending or a dark ending for all I care, but something that would have featured more substance and story. It left the viewer with more questions and story to be told, but instead it chose to skip over all that and move on (taking the easy way out in a sense). The movie is 117 minutes long, which certainly isn't 'long', but it could have added an additional 30 minutes of story for a solid conclusion and I would have had no problem with that. But when all is said and done, Nightcrawler is one of the best movies of the year, regardless of its shortcomings.

Gyllenhaal's haunting performance is so compelling that, in spite of his character's dreadful actions and creepy demeanour, one actually feels just a little bit pleased for him when he succeeds. In spite of the murders, accidents, attacks and other violent acts committed throughout the film, it was that little spark of sympathy for the main character that frightened me most.Nightcrawler is a superb film that boasts a talented cast, wonderfully dark twists and electrifying tension.",

            "content": "Quickie Review:Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) while desperate for work crosses upon the world of crime-scene journalism. Finally finding his talent in the nightcrawling business, Lou is driven to rise to the top. On his path to success he makes questionable decisions and commit acts of crime just to aid his rise to fame. This is by far the best performance in Jake Gyllenhaal's career and one of the best of the year. You will not see the actor because you are so captivated by the character. Nightcrawler is suspenseful, brilliantly acted, well- structured, and gripping. Experiencing this man's psychotic nature unfold should not be missed.Full Review:When I first saw the trailer for Nightcrawler, I wasn't really sure what to think. Trailer didn't reveal too much but it seemed like it would at least be a suspenseful movie. Also I was surprised to see Gyllenhaal's change in look. However, I was glad to find out that the transformation went beyond the physical appearance.Gyllenhaal disappeared into the role completely, fully embodied the character of Lou Bloom. There are moments where Lou is actually quite charming, then all of sudden he becomes terrifying and intimidating. He plays that drastic switching in personality really well, it feels like a very natural transition despite its abruptness. Even though he is committing crimes for capturing the perfect crime scene footage for news, you are somehow still rooting for him at times. It is strange how you will see him as both the antagonist and the protagonist, and I think the vastly different personalities of the character helped a lot in making that effective.To me there is nothing scarier than a crazy person who doesn't think he/she is crazy, because at that point there no moral line to hold them back. You get to see that lack of morality throughout the movie. It is more obvious in the footage capture of the crimes and accidents, but more interestingly it is also present in the way Lou interacts with rest of the cast. These were some my favorite parts of the movie. It is completely apparent that he will do and say whatever is needed to get what he wants. This when the supporting cast excelled, because they mirrored how the audience felt. They, like the viewers, know how manipulative Lou is being and yet they still want to believe him and trust him. So even a conversation between two people was just as intense and enticing as a high speed road chase with the cops.I am certain this will be one of the top movies I will remember for 2014. It has stuck with me even after I left the cinema. It's a shame that it's only out on limited release (at least in EU), so it's not accessible for everyone. But if you have chance, go to the theater and support this movie, if you can't then don't miss it when it's release for home video.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "The following review will contain spoilers.Nightcrawler is a fun film that you can sit back and enjoy for nearly two hours. While some may not find the subject matter all that interesting, what the film makers and actors bring to the big screen is something truly special. The plot keeps you zoned in throughout the film, and the intensity builds throughout the film. This is sure to be one of the better films of 2014. The following is my review of Nightcrawler.The film was written by Dan Gilroy(also director), who recently wrote films such as Real Steel and The Bourne Legacy. None of those two films that I mentioned blew me away, and I was surprised to see how enjoyable this film was overall. The story follows Louis Bloom(Jake Gyllenhaal) who is trying to find work anywhere possible. He even starts the film out stealing fencing and man hole covers for some quick cash. He happens onto an accident scene driving home and runs into a \"Nightcrawler\" who catches these accidents and other news worthy stories and sells the footage to the local news outlets for cash. He asks the Nightcrawler Joe(Bill Paxton) if he is hiring anybody right now. After not being able to land a job, Louis decides to start his own Nightcrawler business. After stealing a bike cycle at a local beach, he sells that for a video camera and a police radio so that he can hunt down these news worthy stories. The heart of the story comes later when Louis arrives to a home killing of three people even before the police show up. Not only does he capture footage of the criminals, but he gets first hand footage of what happened inside after the events. This leads Louis to withhold evidence from detectives so that he can gain credit for stopping these criminals later on. I won't go any deeper into detail other than that, but the story is gripping and it keeps your interest for the entire length of the film. With a fantastic behind the scenes look at what it is like for those who get the footage for our local news, Dan Gilroy delivers a great film and story.Dan Gilroy also directed the film as I mentioned above. This is his first film he ever directed, and I must say the film looks fantastic. Set in Los Angeles, California, Gilroy delivers some fun and exciting views of the city, and even delivers on more intense action towards the end of the film. While there is nothing flashy that the general movie going audience may enjoy, people who enjoy a nice gripping story and some nice added depth from the director, should very much enjoy this film. The acting is also a fantastic aspect of the film. Jake Gyllenhaal dominates the role of a smooth talking man who will do anything for a job. Including taking things too far. With a nice secondary cast of Bill Paxton, Rene Russo, and Riz Ahmed, this film has nothing short of fantastic acting. Having Gilroy this perfect on his first outing as a director makes me really excited for his future. Gilroy delivers this intense thrill ride perfectly, and his efforts should not be overlooked.James Newton Howard scored this film, and he is one of the bigger composers in Hollywood having recently composed the score for The Hunger Games and Maleficent. While you shouldn't expect any bombastic score in this film, Howard is still able to effectively deliver a nice deep score that adds onto the thrilling aspects of the film itself. The score is overall very good, not great, but it does add a great deal of much needed depth.In closing, Nightcralwer is one of those films that creeps up on you, and then surprises most of the viewers, as the film is simply wonderful. After watching so many movies in 2014 so far, I can honestly say this is one of the better films of the year so far. Fans of a good thriller, with amazing acting, shouldn't think twice about seeing this movie. Dan Gilroy offers up a great film that should be considered one of the better films of the year, and it eagerly makes you want to see what he will do next.8/10",

Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job. I'm not sure I can ever see him as a leading man after this. He's so real, or maybe that's just acting.

            "content": "Finally an original story. Nightcrawler takes the audience into the world of a business that few of us know very much about. The world of nightcrawling, aka recording brutal and terrifying scenes of accidents and crimes in order to sell the footage to news stations. That is the premise of the film, which doesn't sound that appealing when you first hear it, but there is a twist to the story. The twist is our main character, Lou Bloom, played flawlessly by Jake Gyllenhaal. Lou is what makes the story interesting. He is a very stubborn, focused and hardworking young man who is trying to discover what he is good at in life and make money off of it. After witnessing a camera crew shoot the scene of a horrific car wreck, Lou decides to take a crack at the business himself. In a business that already borders on the line of what is ethical and what isn't, Lou takes it a step further. Without spoiling the film too much, I will just say he manipulates everything and everyone around him in order to get an edge on the competition and get to the top. Jake is superb in this role. In my opinion, it is his finest work to date. I always find myself awestruck when actors are able to transform themselves for a role. Frail and gaunt is how Jake pictured Lou when he read over his character, so he decided to drop 20 pounds by working out 8 hours a day and eating very little. I think it worked because Lou's appearance very much fits his character. And what is even more astounding about Jake is that for his next film, Southpaw, where he plays a boxer, he transformed himself again by gaining 15 pounds of muscle making him virtually unrecognizable. I find that amazing and I sincerely hope to see a Best Actor nomination go to him this awards season.Dan Gilroy really caught my attention in his directorial debut. The scenes are stylish and creepy, just how I imagine the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles looks at 2 AM. He also filmed one of the best car chases I have seen in a movie in years. Very impressive work and I look forward to seeing what he does next.Nightcrawler is easily one of the best films of 2014.",

            "content": "Jake Gyllenhaal plays a sharp-minded, amoral, small-time criminal and hustler, who aspires to something more. This happens, through a chance encounter, which brings him into contact with TV news.Jake Gyllenhaal was born in LA, and is the brother of actress Miss Maggie Gyllenhaal. Mr Gyllenhaal has appeared in a couple of really exciting films in recent years; the time-travel SF film 'Source Code' (2011), and the LA-based cop drama 'End of Watch' (2012). In both of those films Mr Gyllenhaal played, with much poignancy, a sympathetic, and somewhat tortured, character. This film is equally exciting, but Mr Gyllenhaal's character in this film is different. Always intense, in this film, Mr Gyllenhaal lost 20lbs in reality, to give himself a hungry-look.Rene Russo co-stars in 'Nightcrawler', she plays a news-executive at a TV station. Thus her role is somewhat like that of Faye Dunaway in 'Network' (1976), and the two films are somewhat alike as they expose the seedy underbelly of the morality of TV news gathering. This thus, is a serious role for Miss Russo. This film is made in the shadow of Hollywood, but it is a world away from the glitzy Hollywood portrayed in 'Get Shorty' (1995), a comic film-making gangster-caper, in which Miss Russo played the romantic love-interest. This is of course not to say that Miss Russo cannot do serious. That same year of 1995, she gave a tremendous performance in 'Outbreak', followed up the next year by her equally well acted role in 'Ransom'.In real-life, Miss Russo, is married to Dan Gilroy, the writer and director of 'Nightcrawler'. This is the debut film of Mr Gilroy and he should be applauded for his creation. The story is good and the filming too. All 'news-footage' had an authentic look to it, similar to the found-footage of 'End of Watch'. It should be noted that Mr Gyllenhaal is a producer of 'Nightcrawler'. Thus both films have Mr Gyllenhaal's character filming in the film, and both films are LA-based too. Actors Bill Paxton and Rick Garcia in the supporting cast, also give strong performances.The only thing wrong with this film was the trailer run to promote it. The recent 'A Most Wanted Man' was partially ruined by it's trailer. Here too, some severe editing of the trailer, by Jake Gyllenhaal's film character, would not have gone amiss in this regard.Ultimately, this film is a depressing look at the cynicism and immorality of TV news-gathering.Exciting and tense. 9/10.",

He was great last year in both 'Prisoners' and 'Enemy' which were both excellent films. The same applies to Nightcrawler which is my current favorite among these.Jake plays Louis Bloom (Lou for short) who is a very disturbing and psychopathic character. He doesn't have a job, makes living on theft but seems highly motivated and shows great commitment in whatever he does. One night he sees a film crew shoot a road accident. These crew film crimes and accidents at night to sell the footage to News Channel at a hefty price.The News Channels use those footage for their morning news. Finding it intriguing, Lou tries to find out more about this occupation. He buys a camera and police scanner and starts a new job becoming a Nightcrawler!! He is aided by Nina (Rene Russo) whom he sells the footage, gets an assistant Rick and soon gets a competitor. The story is the portrayal of the extent to which Lou goes to become best at what he does.Dan Gilroy has a dream directorial debut. He brings out the best out of his own script and also the cast especially Jake. Wow! That was one heck of performance by Jake. May even win the Oscar for him.His eyes always with a cold stare and a devilish grin on his face will be remembered for a long time. He transforms a highly dis- likable psychopath into a star. While the way the character of Lou is committed and uses his talent is inspiring but you wont forget the kind of monster he was.Also you Riz Ahmed's performance as a young likable amateur assistant is worth a mention. His innocence is a nice break in the dark strokes of Lou. Rene Russo as Nina the news station manager desperate to increase the standards and ratings of their news agency brings out a splendid supporting act.Also in a smaller role is Bill Paxton, Lou's competitor. The entire main cast was delight to watch.The pace is slow in the first half an hour. You need to patient but you wont be bored. The camera captures the night in L.A. beautifully and the music was also awesome. James Howard Newton's score is one of the year's best. Once you are set get ready for a thrilling ride. There are moments were suspense reaches epic level that you cant even breath peacefully for some time. The score adds to the effect. The climax was a shocker and was like icing on the cake. Its all a nice pay off for the patient wait. Overall Nightcrawler is one of this years best having an interesting and original premise, with even better execution and outstanding performances.RATING: [4.5/5]",

With his crazy eyes, skeletal features, scuttling movements, and natural affinity for the night, Lou Bloom has always been a giant cockroach \u2013 trying to pass for human by living according to the self-improvement and HR-speak clich\u00e9s he's learned off the internet. He joins the pantheon of American movie crazies with Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin, but his crazy is different than theirs. Lou doesn't dream of violent catharsis or celebrity. He dreams of good, old fashioned American entrepreneurial success by finding an unmet need and doing whatever it takes to fill it. The better parallel is with Fincher's fictional version of Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network.Lou is a genius at what he does, much less sophisticated than Zuckerberg but just as single minded and brilliant at his bottom feeding place on the food chain. He is uneducated, or rather self- educated, but he has plenty of native intelligence and a sharp analytical mind to go with his energy and determination. Having learned that the customer wants not reality but a certain image of reality, he sets out to provide that image by any means that come to hand. Because he's intelligent and analytical, he knows how to adjust reality to what the customer wants. Because he's inhumanly focused on the task at hand, he has no compunction about making the adjustments. And he's as talented a businessman as he is a technician. The high point of the movie is the scene where he shows the customer, an aged-out news chick who has become the night shift news director on the lowest rated station in LA, exactly how well he understands the market, his place in it, and hers too. Lou is a very fast learner indeed.Nightcrawler's third act goes a bit too far over the top. Let's just say that someone in Lou's business needs the good will, or at least the acquiescence of the police in the long run, and he does something that should get him on the LAPD's permanent blacklist. At the very least, it seems to me, the cops would have gotten a warrant to search his hard drive, but he just walks with impunity. That's not credible. Everything else is far too credible",

But what is more disturbing is the way he talks \u2013 it is fluent, relevant but strictly business like. The monotone though relatively high pitch is almost like a computer generated business textbook which stress teamwork, communication, striving for excellence and all those BS. He seems to take it very seriously. He is observant and is a fast learner. But he does not have a heart. Or morals. I would not want to be his friend. In fact, he does not seem to have any friends, perhaps because he is so manipulative. I cannot say he is selfish because he was using his business as a shield. But he is sick. Even his smile is haunting. A very strong character development and smooth direction.It is also appalling to see how sensational some TV news can get. With the advancement in technology, we can easily achieve an abundance of graphic images. But in this process, we seem to have lost sight in in- depth analysis and background research, let alone applying ethics in reporting and checking facts. It is horrifying how some paparazzi type of freelancers are out there doing their job and ruining professional journalism. But that would not have happened if TV stations buy their work. And TV stations would not have bought them if it did not help the ratings. After all, certain type of audience drives certain kind of news. It is disheartening the news director pushes for these graphics which gradually jeopardizes an otherwise would-be tasteful audience. That in turn could shape our society into a heartless mess. Great wake up call.",

His drive to become a rich entrepreneur while being the best he can be at what he does is very strong.

The thing with the script though, is, I think only some people will understand what is really going on ..This is a story about the most evil person you know. But when you try to describe him, you can't. You can't convince anyone else how evil he is. They have to experience him to understand it. Real evil is intentional, it's greedy, it's always disguised as virtue, and always embedded in lies. It can never be described . Another thing about this movie. Although it seems on the outside totally preposterous , it's not. I think this sort of man, and this sort of thing, happens all the time. And that, of course, is the real fright. That everything your seeing, is almost, almost, a reflection of the reality we are surrounded with, on a daily basis.

While walking the fine line of creating more fiction than news, he almost successfully turns the game in his favour by playing a diminutive intern, and an experienced news director by sheer connivance. Nothing can surely stop him because he beats competition - fair or unfair - whatever it takes to be ahead in his game.Writer-Director Dan Gilroy makes it a little disgusting, at times with the heartlessness involved in the complete lack of empathizing, sympathizing spirit of the protagonist (or the antagonist). This film speaks about the human nature's selfishness taking one to the limits of what one is truly capable of doing, or not doing; for inhumane is not just the action, but initiating and supporting the same.",

Honestly, his performance was disturbingly great; it was so easy to believe him as sleazy, repulsive Lou. I was also very impressed by supporting actor Riz Ahmed's portrayal of Rick, and look forward to seeing him again.

There's an abnormality in the lead character that makes you question the existence of such people in real life. Generally, in thriller films, you'll be forced to connect with the lead character (usually female) who gets stuck up in a really complex situation and we'll all be expecting a 'close enough' escape but in this film, the lead character shows no signs of humanity and as he says in the film it becomes, 'our choice' to watch the film or not.What amuses me is this way that they've written a script that would perfectly fit into a short film into a feature film because the entire film is in the format of a short film explaining the life of the lead, in a suspenseful way. The climax too was not a shock or something, anyone could've guessed it. Thus, I've reviewed this film successfully as optimistic as it's tone. 6 out of 10.",

Once in the movie, when Bloom give his first film to Nina Romina (Rene Russo) she advises him and gives him some instruction. She says what they looking for is \"a victim, or victims, preferably well-off and white, injured at the hands of the poor or a minority,\" and continues \"The best and clearest way that I can phrase it for you, to capture the spirit of what we air, is think of our news cast as a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut.\" Well, Bloom takes his lessons well. He learns everything necessary for doing his job and at a point, the \"capture\" of what the studio needs, is not enough, so when he has an opportunity he starts to \"build\" a scene, a real and excellent scene that make him a real manager and a successful man in his business. There are lots of people like Louis Bloom who build their scenes and they don't care if this takes them beyond morality lines.

            "review_title": "Jake G is creepy and it's awesome",
            "content": "Jake Gyllenhaal stars as \"Lou\" Bloom an aspiring \"nightcrawler\" who hunts down accidents and crime scenes for footage to sell to news stations. Gyllenhaal's doll-eyed expression has flashes of Donnie Darko in them but is made even creepier by the broad faced grin which rarely leaves his face. Gyllenhaal is captivating in this role and shows a level of intensity he had not previously exhibited. An early example of this intensity, which he maintains throughout the film, is the scene where he fails to catch a fire on film after speeding wildly and talking at the rate of a coke addict. We see this same intensity man when Gyllenhaal is able to talk about Mexican food while Nina asks him twice about blood on his shirt. Gyllenhaal is careful not to play this role over the top but maintains his credibility as an unsympathetic psychopath.DirectingDirector Dan Gilroy makes great use of close-ups to focus on Gyllenhaal's doll-eyed face and upper torso, insuring that Gyllenhaal's acting is the focus of the movie which, given his acting ability in this performance, he should be. A very unique element of this movie is the insight Gilroy provides as to how a news team operates and manipulates the news. The camera-work done by Gyllenhaal's character is a clever way for Gilroy to show how effective camera-work is, particularly in the scene where Gyllenhaal and Rick are filming the two murder suspects and we see their filming through both men's camera lenses while the rest of our screen around their lens is blurred. We see this technique used again during the car chase scene in which Gyllenhaal and Rick pursue the police chase of the remaining murder suspect and much of the scene is shown through the lens of Rick's camera. StoryThe story begins as an almost clich\u00e9 depiction of cutthroat journalists but quickly evolves to show these journalists possess a new level of emotional detachment from their stories. This is made clear when Nina tells Gyllenhaal to \"think of our newscast as a woman running bloody down the street with her throat cut.\" A few times the limitations of this detachment are stretched, especially with the reporting of the home invasion, but ultimately we see that the manipulation of fear and lack of sympathy wins out as again and again Nina encourages her anchors to scare the public.Another main theme of this film is the relentless pursuit of success. Gyllenhaal tells the audience that \"why you pursue is as important as what you pursue\" while also promoting the idea of hard work being the only way to attain success. This keeps the audience wondering whether the success of his business is really his motivation or if there is something else motivating him. His collection of his successful stories more resembles a mass murder keeping a display of trophies than a businessman driven to succeed. We see the beginning of Gyllenhaal's psychopathic tendencies when he turns down Paxton's offer to run a second van and the chance to make more money while also bluntly telling him that he feels like attacking him (the kind of matter of fact observational speech that sounds like a serial killer.) He repeats this process when he meets with Nina whom he bluntly tells which of her physical features he likes as well as threatening her job in the same meeting.There are also several pivotal moments that mark the exposure of Gyllenhaal's true nature. The first of these Pivotal moments transpires when Gyllenhaal realizes that he can move a dead driver's body to create a better shot. This leads him to become fully invested in his work as a nightcrawler and gives him the arrogance that brings about much of his frustration which pushes him over the edge when it comes to finding increasingly gory stories and competing with Paxton. While a few of the other journalists maintain their lack of sympathy for the death and violence in the world, we see this lack of emotion taken to another level with Gyllenhaal when he films Paxton being taken away in an ambulance and Gyllenhaal refers to his accident as \"profit\" and again when he enters the home where a murder has just taken place in order to film the crime scene victims and all.Another pivotal moment comes during his negation with Nina in which he refuses to bargain for a lower price\u2014a complete role reversal from the beginning of the film when it was the construction manager who refused to lower his price with Gyllenhaal.The final pivotal point happens when Gyllenhaal allows Rick to be killed by the second murderer telling him he \"cannot jeopardize the success of his company for the sake of an untrustworthy employee.\" This scene screams Godfather's \"it's not personal, just business\" and reinforces how psychopathic not only Gyllenhaal is but also Nina who represents the media as a whole. \"You're just like Lou\" is the true message of this film, telling the audience that what so obviously bothers us and we so easily recognize as wrong in an individual, Gyllenhaal, is also going on in the media where these same psychotic tendencies are harder for us to detect but are equally reprehensible.Gyllenhaal's performance was easily the highlight of this film and without it I think this movie loses most of its entertainment. I found the themes in this film about journalistic manipulation to be presented in a unique and clever way as well as being a refreshing message from Hollywood. This movie could have been a little faster paced as towards the end the plot began to drag a little, but I'm equally glad Gilroy resisted the urge to have some ridiculous plot twist at the end which might have compromised the integrity of the story and Gyllenhaal's character.

But this movie is just a one-tone poem of depravity, so it has nowhere else to go.Before watching this film, I saw a piece on TCM about Frances Marion, an early screenwriter who wrote such classics as \"The Champ\" and \"Dinner at Eight.\" In the piece, one of the interviewees quotes Frances from the 1970's saying, \"...it's what people 20 to 30 years from now will think of these films.\" The only conclusion one could make about this film is what a sick society we are.Movies like these are designed (obviously) to make money, but they also beat the drum about how helpless we all are to do anything about the sea of depravity in which we swim. But that is true only so long as we believe it.

Gilroy constructs the psychology of the character as a representation of society and its taste for morbidness. This criticism directed not only to the consumer society but also to the television media becomes especially relevant through this story, which in the first instance seems to lack a boost, but which in the third act shocks and horrifies.\nThere is an atmosphere of constant unease, not only visually, but also narratively, as the director strikes the viewer head-on with situations that cause discomfort, but at the same time you cannot stop seeing. In this way, the viewer becomes one more accomplice of this consumption system, where disturbing images and situations flow like a river.\nThere is no doubt that 'Nightcrawler' is a gripping and dark debut for Gilroy, which cannot be overlooked and pleased while causing concern.",

The world of watching television news, and wondering who goes in and shoots the aftermath of accidents, crime, and violence? In NIGHTCRAWLER, the audience gets an up close look, personal and even harsh at times the world of videography for the news.This film is a spectacular thriller. Its setting is in the city of Los Angeles and its night life. Jake Gyllenhaal (Prisoners, The Day After Tomorrow) plays the character Lou Bloom. He is a very driven young man, desperate to explore and work in crime journalism. He works with a camera, filming crashes, fires, violence, and other types of dangers. As the film goes on, Lou Bloom becomes an even stranger individual. He was so strange and crazy, I thought he would make a good joker for an upcoming Batman film. On the other hand, he has what the news team looks for. Someone who is dedicated, a quick learner, and has a positive attitude. Such as, willing to work with them, and bond.Furthermore, the films acting and directing were awesome. Jake Gyllenhaal's character really does come off as a strange yet driven and intelligent young man. Even though he isn't physically threatening, like other characters in films. but psychologically he is a crazy creep. He has greasy slick back hair, and he stares at you with those big eyes. The writer - director, Dan Gilroy did a great job of directing. I really enjoyed how at first he made Lou seem like an underdog and a new comer into this business, and then how Lou transforms into the man he is by the end of the film. Also, the director made you feel like you were in the car with Lou, up and close. Getting to know him, and his intentions.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts. Overall,this film has numerous things that are well done. Everything from the acting, writing, directing, and world of being a \"nightcrawler\" in a crime-scene videography for the evening news. It has good moments, and I believe it is definitely worth your time. I believe NIGHTCRAWLER earns a...9/10 !This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading, and viewing.

It's not business, he has that already. Altogether Jake G doesn't convince me of anything except that he was miscast. And while I normally love Rene Russo's acting, in this case she played tough well, but not vulnerable and desperate. She can--it's in her range, she just didn't carry it in this movie.

The part depicting the situation of the hero at the beginning is very effective. Because of that, the man's action, which is moral destruction, is somehow acceptable. The thrilling part where the driven protagonist behaves like a hungry wildlife is amazing. The absence of a family at all accelerates the mysterious and wild atmosphere.\nWriter Dan Gilroy is a very successful writer and has written some interesting screenplays. He supervise it himself, as he find it particularly interesting I think. He had done a great direction so movie became a masterpiece.",

His portrayal of this down on his luck loner, desperate to make a living is extremely convincing, a crossover between Taxi Driver and Collateral. Nightcrawler ramps up the tension until the very last minute and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. A great follow-up to End of Watch and Prisoners for Gyllenhaal ! He proves once again that he's decidedly one of the most talented actors of his generation. Giving it a ringing endorsement.",

Nightcrawler has some slight humour in it I found some of it funny how reckless and disconnected Lou is from reality. However it does have some seriousness & darkness in it I thought the ending was shocking and just outlined the point the film is trying to get across the harsh realities of journalism of this generation.

            "content": "In this movie a Nightcrawler is a person, who with video-camera-in-hand goes to disaster sites such as a drive-by, vehicle accident, house or car fire, a home invasion, and well anything that will show human loss, suffering, and gore that will play well on nightly TV newscasts. These TV stations hope for better ratings as they believe those are the things the public wants to see. Really? (sad, but true)Normally, I shy away from incidents of the type described above on the nightly newscasts. I do not like to see human suffering regardless of the cause. But here we are and this is what small time thief Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) realizes is a good way to make a lot of money. So with video camera in hand he sets out to strike it rich so to speak. He hires Rick (Riz Ahmed) as an intern to navigate the GPS to get to disaster sites quickly. They become part of the new TV journalism that I call the Disaster Paparazzi. Lou has learned many business terms, tactics and philosophies by going online and absorbing all he can. And it works for him. He is good persuasive speaker spewing business tactics and strategy at the drop of a hat. He can give one heck of a pep talk as he does with Rick.. No matter what Rick's objection is Lou has the perfect answer. And yes, even I bought some of his reasoning. (I'm shocked.)Rene Russo plays Nina the TV News Director as she is perfect in this role. The scenes between Lou and Nina with the the quick back and forths are pure gold. Both Russo and Gyllenhaal should have gotten Oscar nominations, but were overlooked. Pity. Near the end you will see some fantastic driving stunts. The editing for these shots was spot on. Production- wise this is well done with a good supporting cast rounded out by Bill Paxton as Joe Loder, Lou's main competition. But it is Gyllenhaal as Lou who is the relentless driving force throughout. My question is this: why was this movie made in the first place? Are some of the video shots staged or the crime scenes violated by these Disaster Paparazzi who may rearrange bodies to get a better shot to sell to a TV station looking for shock value? Is this what the movie is trying to say? Something to think about. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Bloody Gore: Yes. Language: Yes.",

Upon the culmination of the second act you can't help but feel that Gilroy had written himself into a corner. What is produced is a second attempt at a third act. It's result had not been established in any formal way. What's left is something seemingly ludicrous and somewhat ill fitting. At the core of this issue is a script that's a small bit too self satisfied and an inability to layer it's elements together in a satisfying way.Overall, a decent effort from first time director Dan Gilroy but I can't help but feel that it could have had been something really captivating with more skill and strength of conviction.",

Lately, I've found old movies such as this where the villain wins and I absolutely love this movie Nightcrawler. I believe this is the first movie I've truly ever seen from Jake Gyllenhaal and my word is he a terrific actorNightcrawler is another perfect representation of what our society has become which is through the glorification of violence from car accidents, violent crimes involving murders, home invasions and so on all carefully packaged by mainstream and local TV station news to be presented for us to enjoy. We know it's awful to look at and yet we can't find ourselves turning away from it. The TV news stations and mainstream media don't care about the victims or their families involved in horrific crimes, not really. They exploit it to boost their ratings every dayThe movie also represents how the media will make false narratives for certain crimes or any stories to push through onto their platform to scaremonger the viewers and when they are presented with real evidence like in one scene in this movie, it is immediately ignored. That is exactly what is happening today with COVID, it's all fake and false narratives including what our Governments keep telling is as well everyday crime and so onJake Gyllenhaal stars as the villainous protagonist and sociopath, Lou Bloom. Lou is unemployed and is desperate for work. He comes across as anti-social, a fast learner, manipulative and driven. He has no regard for human life or empathy towards others, he feels entitled to everything society has to offer. When he discovers by chance he can become a nightcrawler who is prowling the streets at night looking for any accidents, murders or brutal crimes to film on camera, film and send to the local TV stationAs he continues throughout the movie and learns to improve his editing, filming, and visualization, he crosses lines by getting innocent people killed including his own assistant, breaking into crime scenes to film everything all for the sake of his business and his own personal satisfactionThere's also a scene where I feel as though as Bloom becomes more powerful and authoritative, he becomes a Devil of sorts as the TV presenter he works with, by the end she has become completely smitten with Bloom whereas before she only used him for her career and ratings, even disliking the idea of an off-screen sexual relationship has now come to really like and embrace Bloom. It's like he sold her soul and humanity for ratings and money through Bloom's brutal exploitation of others' sufferingBy the end and even through an interrogation, Bloom gets away with it in the end and manages to grow his business continuing to cover crime and cross boundaries in his own twisted way.",

            "content": "Set in the dark, gritty, neon-soaked world of night-time urban America, Dan Gilroy's Nightcrawler features Brokeback Mountain's Oscar nominated Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom, a sociopath who buys a camera and a police scanner and goes out hunting ('nightcrawling') for crimes to film and sell to local news stations. The fact that Gyllenhaal was the only actor I mentioned above, despite the considerable supporting cast, tells you all you need to know about how incredible his performance in Nightcrawler is. The fact that there's even a question about whether or not his is the best acting performance of 2014 shows how good the year was for acting. His Lou Bloom is an absolutely unforgettable creation, with an extraordinary body transformation (especially given his beefed-up turn less than a year later in 2015's Southpaw) that renders the anorexic-looking character unsettling and almost inhuman. With a gaunt face that makes his eyes seem to bulge out of his head, and his posture, reminiscent of a praying mantis, Gyllenhaal steals all of his scenes in his unrecognisable role. Which means he steals the film.Not that the rest of the film is poor in comparison - a pulsating, uncomfortable soundtrack invades the ears, and supporting turns from Rene Russo (The Thomas Crowne Affair) as Lou's morally ambiguous news contact, in addition to The Reluctant Fundamentalist star Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton are solid, though this is Gyllenhaal's film through and through. What makes his character so good is the complexity - is he just a mentally deranged sociopath anyway, or is he, like all of us, just suffering from the consequences and fallout of The Credit Crunch and the economic downturn? Bloom's method of speech, each word carefully measured and brimming with buzzwords is straight from hours looking up how to talk like a successful person on the internet, adds to his near- terrifying persona. A fantastic script, with Gilroy deservedly Oscar-nominated for his sharp, Sorkin-esque screenplay, always compelling and rendering every scene a real interest to watch. I really struggle to think of anything bad about Nightcrawler - does it count that Gyllenhaal's performance is simply too good? It may just be the best film of 2014. 97/100",

His Louie Bloom is this paradoxically charismatic and repugnant character, giving unnerving, wide-eyed, unblinking glares straight into the lenses of the camera as he looks through his own. Intelligently, the director never shies away from staring straight into the beast the script created. He is cold, calculated, and every moment he is on screen, his facade for the audience begins to chip away. Gyllenhaal does marvelous work, transforming himself into this solitary pack-animal, this night crawler. I'm surprised the Academy took no notice.The script also deserves commendation. Bearing enough intricacies to make it believable as normal conversation, and yet giving the main character enough ticks to make him seem just the least bit...off. The dialogue flows out of Gyllenhaal perfectly and it is one of the reasons he can succeed so well.Unfortunately, the film loses steam after the climatic action sequence. Without spoiling it, I felt it left too much unresolved or unexplained. It lost some weight there. However, those narrative moments were edge-of-my-seat and thrilling. The picture it painted of LA, and criticism of media and its consumers, was great food for thought.",

The film has this uneasy, creeping feel to it, and Jake Gyllenhaal gives an absolutely incredible performance as what can only be described as a sociopath. It gives you a glimpse at the ugly side of the human condition, and has a storyline that is anything except predictable.I'm a complete sucker for the neo-noir genre and I've got to say, this is the peak of neo-noir. Somehow, Dan Gilroy created a horrible story about a character you absolutely despise, but at the same time captivated you in some twisted way. It's really, really unsettling but you just can't stop watching it.There's a sort of darkly funny tone throughout the movie, and the entire thing will always keep you on your toes. The way that this movie is written will make it one you will not forget in a while. It's to the point. Nothing is sugarcoated. It shows the good, the bad, the ugly. It has all the elements of the perfect psychological thriller, and the way that the tension builds to the incredible climax is simply stunning. There's never a slow moment, and even when there isn't a car chase the tension builds and builds, making you feel constantly uneasy. Oh, and when there is a car chase, you can't peel your eyes from the screen.Highly recommend. It is the epitome of psych thriller movies, crime movies and the neo-noir genre.-Sasha.",

            "content": "The fact is that motivation to succeed can be a powerful drive to make something out of ourself in this life. In America, the land of opportunity, in densely pact, excessively rich and extremely poor population of L.A, divided only by neighborhoods that sometime resemble ghettos, especially in downtown area, some people will go an extra mille to put themselves in the position to succeed at all cost. That ambition can be truly dangerous whenever the individual lacks a moral backbone. Add to it, a sociopathic personality disorder and you've got a recipe for disaster. Louis Bloom the protagonist of the thriller the \"Nightcrawler\" displays all above mentioned characteristics. He is extremely ambitious and morally distorted which allowed him to pursue one of the most looked down up on professions in news broadcasting industry. He becomes a Nightcrawler mixture of paparazzi and investigative reporter which investigates all the major crime scenes in search of the footage, that can be sold to TV news companies that are interested in this sort of material. \"Louis (Jake Gyllenhaal) starts a freelance camera crew who film crashes, fires, murder and other mayhem, he muscles into the cut-throat, dangerous realm of nightcrawling -- where each police siren wail equals a possible windfall and victims are converted into dollars and cents. Aided by Nina (Rene Russo), a veteran of the blood-sport that is local TV news, Lou thrives. In the breakneck, ceaseless search for footage, he becomes the star of his own story\"\"Nightcrawler\" is a directorial debut of the screenwriter husband of Rene Russo, Dan Gilroy. Being born in L.A, Gilroy clearly understands this town better then most people. The amount of people who come to Hollywood to become famous at all cost is staggering. I use to live in Los Angeles and being a night owl I liked driving through the empty streets of L.A without a traffic at night. During the night time there is a sense of peace and calm that usually turns in to chaos and traffic jams during the day. Of course there are neighborhoods which are dangerous to drive around specially at night and it takes someone with a death wish to really push their luck. Apparently Jake Gyllenhaal lost 20 pounds to play Louis Bloom and this might have been bit of a marketing ploy by the producers to give an extra attention to dramatic weight loss which was not really needed for the development of the character. Watching his performance another great character comes to mind Travis Bickle played to perfection by Bob DeNiro in Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver\". Both character are lonely individuals that want to do something with their life. Perhaps Louis Bloom has a better vocabulary and is able to express his thoughts well in sort of intellectual vocabulary diarrhea that gets him often the things he wants. Taking the gimmicky weight loss aside I must say Jake delivers one of his better characterizations full of moments that make his character transform in to a sociopathic individual who want to succeed at all cost. The relationship between him and his news producer played by still beautiful Rene Russo is full of sexuality which often is a driving force behind most successful performances. I don't know if his performance is good enough to receive a nomination for an Oscar next year, but it is captivating and entertaining enough to justify the price of the ticket. In \"Nightcrawler\" writer/director asks a lot of interesting moral questions about why our society is so focused on negativity and drives us towards stories of murder and tragedies that are shown on TV. Apparently the negative type of news take upon the highest amount of screening time in every TV station. Why do TV stations compete to bring the most vicious crimes on to out TV sets? Are we a part of the problem? Is our society so desensitized that the only thing that can interest the mass audience are bloodthirsty tragedies that most people fill up their heads with? Sadly the answer might be resounding YES whether we like it or not. Our morbid fascination with crime, does not put forth peaceful future for our children, but for the time being might become a source of entertainment whether we want to admit that or not. Precisely that is what Dan Gilroy explores in his movie and by identifying with the protagonist he forces the audience to think deeply about their moral compass and willingness to succeed at all costs. \"Nightcrawler\" is a good thriller which can be recommended for the lovers of a fast paced thrill seeking cinema.For more of my movie reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",

That's not to say that the other actors weren't just as good, because they were.In my reviews I like to look at the acting, production quality, the storyline, what I really like, what I didn't like, what they could've done better, and the worthiness of spending time actually watching it and as a further disclaimer there are no spoilers here.Actors: As I said the acting from an overall point of view was great and on point with Gyllenhaal giving one of his best performances to date.Production quality: this film was beautifully shot and you can tell they spend a lot of time and money getting it right, definitely not a low budget film and it is aesthetically pleasing to say the least.Storyline: the storyline was original, haven't seen too many movies that highlight a rogue cameraman who takes videos of what's going on in town and selling it off to the local new stations. The title of thriller/mystery is definitely earned and shows through. The movie has some twist and turns and the things that you think will happen don't happen and the things you'd never expect do but I won't say what, you'll have to find out for yourself. Jake gives a very convincing performance of being that weird neighbor who has too many video cameras and is overly nice to the point where you'd think he was up to something. A lot of blood and gore at times so if that's not your style you might want to shy away from this movie, however, the scenes of such are few but graphic when they occur. Probably don't want to watch this with kids around but it could be worse. The movie starts out kind of slow but picks up the pace as it goes along until the find hour or so when you won't be able to keep your heart rate under 100 because it's just that thrilling and edge of your seat type of movie...eventually. But how it plays out is worth the wait.What I liked: the acting, the overall quality, the original story that does have plot twists and makes you grip your chair and keeps you on edge What I didn't like: the way it started out because it does start out pretty slow and pretty boring, at least as far as I was concerned that's how I felt about it. Also I didn't like that some of what happens in the movie doesn't have it's loose ends tied up but you could probably pretty accurately how things play out, I guess.What they could've done better: like I said if they tied up some of the loose ends it would have made the story a little more complete. A little more of a back story of Jake's character wouldn't have hurt either.Worthiness: there are a lot of crappy movies out there that I've wasted time on that I'll never get back I didn't feel that way after watching this movie. It was worth the near 2 hours that it went on for.To close, watch this movie! I was glad that I did and you will be glad you did too! One of the best movies of 2015, so far!!!",

            "content": "I loved Nightcrawler, probably my movie of the year(tagged with Interstellar), that said, I feel like with just some tiny changes it could have been something much more. This is a character driven movie, indeed its also a performance driven one and Jake Gyllenhaal does a fantastic job bringing the character to life. Its almost like the theme of the movie is evoked in the way we feel about Bloom, we are disgusted by him but can't help but wonder what he will do next. Seeing protagonists who are this complex and sadistic is a fresh of breath air among the linear and goody two shoes we see on screen. Acting is great all around and the characters are all interesting, developing in interesting ways, more or less every major character has an adaptive role. Plot starts out a bit random, seemingly Bloom is stealing and selling but its not very clear if he is also a murderer or just commits battery(he attacks a police officer in the beginning and we don't see what happens). He then randomly stumbles upon a scene where he finds his calling. However once the plot picks up, it holds a good pace, with him upgrading his equipment and archiving his achievements. He has a truly one track mind and the way the story evolves is perfect for showing this. There could have also been a little more done to link the ending to our world, while its interesting that its subtle, perhaps a more chilling reminder of the ruthlessness of such people rather than just a quick showing of their rise through the ranks would have helped me take this movie home with me.The shooting in this movie on one hand does a great job at making us feel close to Bloom but there are some missed opportunities with the way his deeds are shot. Especially Ricks last scene, it was possible to pull off a much more wide angle with Bloom and Rick fully in the picture to better capture the manipulation. In general giving the viewer a few more distant shots would help us better feel the distance Bloom feels from other people. Despite some lost opportunities, this is a great movie depicting the vicarious nature of news, highly recommended.",

Yet 'Nightcrawler' was not a study that went deep enough into either the thwarted mind of Lou Bloom or even the violence that engulfs the city and is manipulated by television stations to boost ratings. There are so many ideas in this movie yet none of them were adequately explored. The script relies entirely on one of the most gifted actors the silver screen has ever seen; Jake Gyllenhaal. He delivers an edgy and chilling performance as a freelance journalist who becomes consumed by his own ambition and macabre that surrounds the city at night. Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed are great but Jake's performance is on par with Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, as he brings his sociopath character to life in so many ways. However the film itself is overrated, and how it has a higher IMDb rating than two other more superior Jake Gyllenhaal starrier 'Enemy' and 'Zodiac' is beyond me. Maybe this is in itself is evidence that perception is everything. (@zulfmanauthor)",

Another 15 minutes could have structured a more fulfilling ending.

            "review_title": "Nightcrawler Review",
            "content": "Nightcrawler is a dramatic, crime thriller directed by Dan Gilroy. The film follows Lou Bloom (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a man desperate for work, as he enters into the business of filming crime scenes for money. Nightcrawler's director Dan Gilroy does a fantastic job at both creating a unique character, Lou Bloom, and then showing this character off to the audience. It becomes abundantly clear in the first 20 minutes of the film what kind of person Lou Bloom is and how he's going to carry himself throughout the rest of the film. The film strongly emphasizes the manipulative, sociopathic qualities of Lou Bloom. This clear characterization of Lou Bloom is what makes Nightcrawler so entertaining to watch. Transparency is a clear theme to this film. Dan Gilroy wants the audience to see the characters, setting, and mood of his film for what the really are. There is no confusion about the character's motives or personality, the setting, and mood of the film. A lot of the characters themselves reinforce this theme. Lou Bloom is clear about his objective and will not sugarcoat anything. The story captures and holds the attention of the audience from the very start of the film to the ending credits sequence. Two of the most apparent ways that Gilroy has created this interesting story have been through action. There is both a mixture of physical and psychological action. There is a duality of action throughout Nightcrawler. The physical action scenes compliment Lou Bloom's psychological changes. Bloom progressively does more and more risky things to get more money. Through his physical actions it can be seen that he is also changing psychologically. Dan Gilroy also employs suspense to maintain the maintain the audience's interest in the film. The story portrays Lou Bloom as a risk taker. What separates this story's risk taker from other risk takers is how quickly Bloom's risks escalate. His risks exponentially become even riskier to the point where a viewer is wondering \"What will he do next?\" This risk taking nature of the film adds a ton of suspense as Bloom arrives at each crime. \"What will he do this time to make more money?\" are the questions that come across a viewer's mind throughout the whole film. His risks reflect his apparent lack of morality, which allow him to not care about his well-being or the well-being of others. \nThe film has a clear structure which makes for a more enjoyable viewing experience. The film follows a linear approach to telling a story. The three acts which are: exposition, complication, and climax, are very apparent in the film. The first act, exposition, introduces Lou, the main character, and the people he works with. Their characters personalities and motives are clear. The film does great job of putting these characters, along with their traits, in positions that make sense to the audience. The next act, complication, introduces a conflict and grows that conflict. The conflict is clear and so is its importance to the story. The final act, climax, is the highest point of emotional action in the film. At this point, the story's tension, mainly regarding the conflict, are so high that the audience can feel it. The viewers know that something big is going to happen, but they don't know what. This brings suspense back into the film. Overall Nightcrawler does a great job at holding the attention of the viewer and it provides an very interesting and unique story. Jake Gyllenhaal did an amazing job at becoming a character that is almost villainous but like-able at the same time. This movie is a much watch for those who are into films that are suspenseful and dramatic.",

Nightcrawler is about such a character that will do whatever he can to make it to the top. Nightcrawler stars Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Zodiac) a down and out on his luck guy who has finally had enough and willing to do whatever he can to dig himself out of his rut and make it to the top. One night while trading stolen metals for cash Lou Bloom played by Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty much told he is nothing more than a criminal and as such unemployable even at a sheet metal yard. On his way home Lou is stopped by a road accident where he witnesses one of LA's Nightcrawler teams filming the aftermath of an accident. Nightcrawlers are siren chasers who get footage of fires, stabbing, thefts, and murders and sell them to a local news station for hopefully big bucks. Lou trades a stolen racing bike for a camera and police scanner and sets out on his own to follow the sirens and film the events that are to pass in the midst of the LA night. He quickly discovers how much money can be made from these events and sets out to be the number one Nightcrawler in LA no matter what! After shooting the aftermath of a carjacking gone horribly wrong he goes to the local news station where he meets Nina a morning news director played by Rene Russo (Thor, Ransom) who agrees to continuing buying Lou's footage if it's good enough\u0085 By far one of the greatest characters Jake has ever created, this is Jake Gyllenhaal's film from begging to end, he has created one of the creepiest characters to come to film in a long time for me and in my opinion his definite best character to date. Jake was born to play this role, he is so memorable with his lines, his stares and his passive aggressive attacks on his workmate and associates, I found my skin crawl with some of the things he said and did, and anyone who can do that is well deserving of an Oscar in my book. Rene Russo is also amazing in her role again she was given great lines and she has such a talent. This is a twisted tale of how far one man can go when pushed far enough; the director in his directorial debut Dan Gilroy not only directed this masterpiece but also scripted it as well. He is definitely a man to watch in the future. He has such an amazing eye for detail and his dialogue is outstanding. There were a few slower scenes but something that is so intense can't be all edge of your seat from beginning to end. I personally think he has created an amazing piece of art something that should be spoken about not just forgotten. Not one for the little ones and then again perhaps some of the big ones may find it a little too disturbing as well. So be warned it is a very confrontational movie. So worth seeing though!",

Gyllenhaal's physical transformation into the gaunt and creepy Louis who never, ever wants to be called Lou is impressive as well.

Anthony Hopkins succeeded in \u02ddThe silence of the lambs\u02dd. Mr. Gyllenhaal captures the viewer and pulls him into the world of a psychopath- where there are no emotions, no rules and no restrains and refrains except the ones that the individual makes for himself and everything is the other way around- the world should obey your set of rules and the opposite. It is, for most people, a strange and unknown world which is hard to demonstrate to a normal person. Mr. Gyllenhaal has achieved to make this world more near and familiar to us and what is frightening is that those kind of flawed personalities exist in our world and moreover they are successful individuals or at least some of them are.

            "content": "Dan Gilroy's version of American Psycho has Jake Gyllenhaal moving from fringe social outcast to a powerbroker gaining a foothold in TV broadcasting.It is quite clear that his character, Lou Bloom, fits all the parameters of being a true psychopath: highly intelligent, analytic, narcissistic, completely lacking both empathy and conscience ---yet by dint of these very \"talents\" he is able to ascend on the social ladder.This movie succeeded for me because it made me so, so nervous....so anxious...even when almost nothing was happening on the screen action----it was Gyllenhaal's character that triggered this reaction in me.From the first time we see his smile (eerily reminiscent of the smile of Malcolm McDowell's \"Alex\" in \"A Clockwork Orange\"---containing superficially an innocence but masking the murderous snarl beneath) when he is approached by a security guard, smiles at the guard, sees the guard's fancy wristwatch.....and in the next moment suddenly attacks that guard and we see Bloom then wearing that watch, now \"his\"--- there is menace written all over Bloom. At any given instant in this film there is that conveyed risk that the heartless animal caged within Bloom will emerge. . .yet all there is to this is innuendo. Threat. The possibility looming at all times.I believe this is where the movie derives its power. All is based on suggestion...as I watched the movie my discomfort increased. I didn't know where it was going, or how it was going to get there----it didn't matter: just the fact that this character was among us was enough to keep me on edge.As monsters go, this Lou Bloom one is very understated. Where Easton's character in \"American Psycho\" committed the most horrifying travesties against his fellow humans (whether in deed or thought---and the most of which were omitted from the movie version of AmerPyscho because it would have been far too graphic for normal sensitivity) this Bloom psycho has more to do with the transmission of his social deviancy to society ...of finding ways to convey that sense of mayhem and gore that ignites his inner flame. He is both voyeur, and salesman of the dark side of humanity macabre, and delights in successfully spreading this gospel to the masses.And of course it is tied to profits. To say that his character is the corporate personification of the network news, and to corporate personhood in general---in which all that is human is subverted to business profit---- is to state the obvious. Dan Gilroy's gift here is to reveal through his character of Lou Bloom how he perceives the insanity of the broadcast sensationalism TV news that has replaced the checkout line shock-selling tabloids that mainstreamed pulp fiction to the more innocent consuming masses.That society is being changed, being rendered less shocked and more enured to the savagery isn't openly stated, but undercurrent as we gather that ratings have increased to the display of gore.Only in the screaming female detective do we see a realistic reaction to what this character represents and is doing....to others he is perfectly acceptable, a charming success.Bloom's character has no feelings toward anyone, even though he looks as though he is earnest and serious--- which we hear in one small speech he gives menacingly to Nina (Rene Russo, Gilroy's real life wife) who has thoroughly whored herself against her better judgement to Bloom ----when he tells Nina angrily he expects her to do whatever he wants unquestioningly (\"...not like last time in the bedroom\") as his power and persuasion grow beyond all reason.Great acting by Gyllenhaal....I hope he wins awards for it.A masterful production. A metaphor most powerfully captured. My hat's off to Gilroy and company for this wonderful----if difficult to watch----homage to corporate psychopathy.",

            "content": "Last night I saw NIGHTCRAWLER! Jake Gyllenhaal stars in this character study/thriller as sociopath Louis Bloom who sets his sights on becoming an independent news gatherer, which is pretty much a guy who chases the flashing lights of emergency vehicles looking for stories to sell to the local news. What lengths will he go to get the story? Well, let's just say that a man born without empathy or fear can go pretty damn far.There's a lot to talk about with this movie but let me start off by saying just two words, \"Jake Gyllenhaal.\" MAN! This guy is something else! He really shines in this movie. The way he portrays Bloom without an ounce of empathy is just unlike anything I've seen before. He's like a bizarre cross between SpongeBob SquarePants and the T-1000. It's really unnerving watching him in this role and every moment you spend with him makes your skin crawl but at the same time you're drawn in to wanting to see what he'll do next. Also noteworthy is Rene Russo who plays a veteran news anchor desperate to increase her ratings. I really liked the whole vibe of this movie which plays kinda like a retro John Carpenter film in some respects. It's got a style and a brash quality about it that has been largely unseen in film beyond the 1980s. The art direction and the cinematography are another triumph of this film. It manages to marry both hand-held and steady-cam shots in a fluid way that keeps the differing styles uniform and easy to follow despite some scenes that have quite a bit of action in them. Speaking of which, the driving sequences in this film are amazingly well shot and really interesting to watch. There are a few sticky moments that don't really make too much sense as far as the way the police are portrayed, letting just anyone hyper-close to dangerous crime scenes in a way that you know they would never do, but overall it's alright.On the whole, I really liked this film. If you're a fan of films like Taxi Driver or Drive or any number of John Carpenter films, I think you'll like this too. It's not super heavy on the action like some of the other films but you will definitely get a thrill from it. Nightcrawler gets a 4...out of 5.",

This movie is one other beautiful addition to Jake's long list of great movies, which probably started from 'October Sky'. However, that said, you'd probably love to see him in different roles. Even though the characterization of most of his characters are different, they still have a lot of similarity; and Nightcrawler does not do much to change that perception of a lot of people. Jake plays the role of Louis Bloom, a misanthrope trying hard to make it big in life, and his one shot at it is crime journalism. He crawls up the ladder in his field with some help from Nina (Rene Russo) and also hires an assistant to help him with his job. The movie is well written and directed by Dan Gilroy, who does great in capturing the uncertainty and creepiness of the movie, especially Jake's character. All in all, it is a great movie that leaves you clinging to the edge of hour seats.Final Verdict:awesome movie that is bound to impress you if you like thrillers or Jake Gyllenhaal.",

It isn't before long until Bloom's demented job overtakes his life, making him colder and colder the deeper he goes. The film plays like a twisted bloody version of Network and has the satirical wit to back it up. Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly fantastic in this film. Lou Bloom is a role that he is completely submerged in and it oozes through every frame as our dislike for Bloom intensifies throughout the film.

Gyllenhaal's depiction serves as a vehicle to show how this shell of a man can succeed in our society, and in fact does better than others. Walking away from the film I understood a few main messages it had addressed, 1. that media is manipulative and callas, being a factor how we, as people feel about issues such as death; as displayed in the film; without care at all if it impacts an unknown.2. society doesn't truly care about ethics, we prefer money; demonstrated well throughout the film by the character arcs of Rick and Nina.3. The corrosive elements of poor mental health; I definitely believe Lou was a sociopath, he treated his plant with more care than any other character throughout. His cruelty escalated more and more throughout; resulting in blackmail and essentially murder. Overall this film pulls many, perfect punches that had me wanting to analyse and re-watch it over and over. Props to the director and writer Dan Gilroy who managed to create an engaging and meaningful film, also to Gyllenhaal for the convincing and menacing performance.10/10",

All other actors are doing very good too, especially Rene Russo as the cynical newswomen. Another thing that I really liked about the movie was the camera- work. It was beautifully executed and make Los Angeles look both beautiful and creepy at the same time. Even the music was great and used in a exact manner so it was not something you miss and not something that was irritating.

The writers and directors had a huge opportunity to take that path and turn a good movie into an awesome movie. I gave it 4 stars, which may be a bit harsh, but I really had my hopes up when I saw the trailer for this. I bought the DVD and I am notorious for watching movies multiple times.

The movie is led by a sturdy, cold and dark titular character, the ambitious and sociopathic Lou Bloom played by The Academy Award Nominee Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, End of Watch) in his careers best performance, a strong supportive role by Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed. Directed and written by Dan Gilroy. The movie narrates the story of stringers who preys on news in the city of Los Angeles.The movie draws its focus onto the night crawlers (a euphemism for the stringers) and the competitive mass media. The news waits for no one. It's all about the agility. The stringers pry on the police radio frequency, compute the route to the crime scene on GPS, and hit the gas. In the busy city the night is an ally to all sorts of accidents, crimes from assault and battery to murder mayhem. Each news worthwhile and \"if it bleeds, it leads\". The stringers negotiate their price to the news corporate and make their living.Lou Bloom is an ambitious and eccentric character who by chance discovers and come into freelance journalism. In a city where there is no shortage to bleeding news, Lou Bloom makes his way to the top with his coyote-esque character. Gyllenhaal lost around 30pounds (10kg) for the role and jettisoned his charming boyfriend attitude and typical lopsided smile for a utterly grotesque and disturbingly creepy look accompanied by a smart and flawless delivery of well- crafted dialogue and body language.Lou Blooms survival politics is his focus and passion to the profession. The sociopathic behavior comes to his advantage to follow the bloody path with discretion and survive and flourish in an equally challenging draconian atmosphere. Gyllenhaal portrays one of the most sophisticated sociopath in movie history whose one and only aim is the call of duty. He neither desires fame, promotion nor seeks a fortune out of his work. A whiz-kid; he is twisted, he is self-centric, he is self-made. And he won't hesitate to jettison those who jeopardize his mission. Like a predator preying to hunt down its prey he waits patiently listening to the police frequency for good news and won't mind to go a bit extra mile to decorate an accident to create a better TV experience.Nightcrawler has an original script written by Gilroy. It explores the media ethics and morals, the attitudes of humans in a challenging world, the measures people advertently or inadvertently takes, and their selfishness.Nightcrawler is a high octane crime thriller set in the dark suburbs of Los Angeles. A powerful and electric, simultaneously creepy and driven performance from Gyllenhaal. Jake G is the epitome of a sociopath as the character Lou Bloom. This is a performance one doesn't want to dare miss by any chance. A magnum opus without any doubt.",

At the same time the movie doesn't go far enough to it really achieve it's goal of being a satire, everything stays on a maybe extreme, but still somewhat realistic level that just leaves you empty handed as a viewer, because what was the goal here? To show the media is bad? How, eh, original?Also Gyllenhalls character is just not believable or even interesting. Of course there are very manipulative psychpaths that do everything to achieve their goals, but he isn't manipulative, he is just blunt and gets away with it for some reason. Or to put it in a different way, he gets away with it for a specific reason, but in that case there is no manipulation required and he is just extorting other characters in the movie. Which sure is ruthless, but, again, not very engaging or interesting on a psychological level. There is just no nuance at all to his character.I think what this movie desperately needed was another perspective, maybe follow the police Investigators around as they try to find out what Gyllenhall is on about and have them put pressure on the Nina character, so there would be more of a dilemma for her, because as it is, noone really seems to have to loose anything on real consequence, maybe she looses her job, put apparently that has happened before and it's not really clear whether that would mean much. Again, expanding to another perspective could really help here, as it is we just don't get enough development in the story I feel, just watching Gyllenhall do everything for fame or money isn't enough.Or maybe the story needs to have a twist that really puts the story in a different context, but as it is the story is very predictable and again, just not interesting enough to carry the movie.In the end, as a character story it fails because the character isn't interesting enough, as a media satire it fails because there is no satire and as a story it fails because it is too predictable and linear, which leaves some very nice cinematography and great music wasted on a boring movie.",

The rest of the cast is OK, but no one else really stands out. There is Gyllenhaal, then a bunch of supporting roles. The development of Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) really makes this movie great. He moves from being a petty thief to an extreme criminal to fulfill his obsession. The story is dark, with a terrifying feel throughout the movie. This is a thriller in every sense of the word! Make sure you see this immediately. Gyllenhaal had a performance of a lifetime, and the story is dark and suspenseful. Definitely worth a watch; 9/10",

            "content": "Nightcrawler stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Louis Bloom, an eccentric and sometimes psychotic sociopath looking for work. One night he stumbles upon a camera crew headed by Joe Loader (Bill Paxton), who explains the world of gonzo style freelance news reporting, Nightcrawling. A kind of blood and guts crime paparazzi of sorts. It's not long before Louis gets a camera and starts going out doing his own videos and selling them to Nina Romina (Rene Russo). Nina is a night shift news director who pays for gory news footage. She takes a liking to Louis and his ability to get such up close and daring scenes. Eventually Louis starts getting too involved in crime scenes, beating police and rescue teams to the locations and going way too far to get the perfect shot. Nightcrawler is easily the best performance of Gyllenhaal's career. I feel he was cheated for not getting an Oscar nod for this role. His overall appearance in Nightcrawler is just haunting. According to IMDb he lost about 20lbs for this role. The whites of his bulging wide eyes glow evil as he delivers an absolutely transcendent performance. Imagine if Donnie Darko (2001) grew up evil. Louis is like a demonic Don Quixote, with Rick Garcia his \"intern\" (Riz Ahmed) as his Sancho Panda. Louis has delusions of grandeur with a total detachment from reality. Wild-eyed and determined to get as up close and personal with death and carnage. The movie feels like a high octane Drive (2012). This is one of those great movies set in Los Angles, where the city is almost a character unto itself; much like Collateral (2004), Heat (1997), Training Day (2001) or End of Watch (2012). This is a phenomenal freshman effort for Director Dan Gilroy. The screenwriter, turned director also wrote Nightcrawler. I am glad the academy gave him a nod for this powerful action drama for the story at least. I think Nightcrawler easily makes my top 5 movies for 2014, along with Boyhood, Birdman, Whiplash and Grande Budapest. Dan Gilroy has a real unique visual style and has me anticipating his next effort. It reminded me a lot of Nicholas Winding Refn's Drive which I found to be ground-brakingly cool. Of course after Only God Forgives (2013), he kind of lost my interest. Maybe Giroy can pick up where Refn left off. I highly recommend Nightcrawler if it's your turn to pick a movie, its purchase worthy. If you enjoyed this review, please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is like the Network (1976) of news footage. It brought me into a world I didn't even know I wanted a movie about. It shows just how easy it can be to sell a manipulated reality to the public to serve an agenda. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Louis Bloom, nicknamed Lou, a man who has finally found his calling as a journalist of sorts, filming footage that he sells to the news each night. \"I'm thinking\", he says, \"that television news might just be something I love as well as something I happen to be good at.\" Close to tears, he looks at a newsroom backdrop of the city at night. \"On TV, it looks so real.\" He goes on to take that televised reality to many extremes throughout the film. Gyllenhaal's performance is a wonderful character study. How can Lou be so determined to film what he does at the cost of people's lives and his own human decency?Riz Ahmed who plays his assistant Rick gives a really good, natural performance of a guy with clear motivations in their relationship. It starts out with Lou talking about skipping the \"bad\" neighborhoods while Rick himself is clearly a minority and he laughs along. He watches what he says and films things that turn his stomach. He puts up with some frightening glimpses of a darker side to Lou who always seems to be on the verge of actually doing something scary. Eventually, Lou's demands get to be too much and Rick needs more compensation to be okay with everything that's going on. In the daytime, Lou stays home, archiving his work, watering his plant, watching his footage from the night before on the morning news like a husband watching their wife give birth. Always there alone, he never has friends over. There's nothing to indicate that he has any. \"What if my problem wasn't that I don't understand people\" he asks, \"but that I don't like them?\" Are all crime journalists as cold and reckless as Lou? Of course not. That's not the point. It's the kind of stories he exploits and twists with the help of the local news that is so rampant all around us.In another movie, a character would make a decision that could later lead to trouble for them and we'd think \"okay, how can they not see what's going to happen?\" This movie is smarter. On a 911 call, Lou gives a very detailed description of two suspects whom he earlier told detectives he didn't get a look at, but, the reason he's doing it here, and why it works, is because of the tension and the importance of the situation he's in. It's not that what he's doing can't still be trouble for him in the future, it's that he has a real reason for doing it. He cannot afford to mess up the situation by having the cops confront the wrong people. He's orchestrating an explosion between the cops and criminals and he can't leave any loose ends. A great thing about his character is that he seems to figure out what his plan is just before we do and when we figure out where he's going with something, it's not because the movie gave him clunky expositional dialogue telling us what was going on. He tells the cops he sees a gun and we figure out ourselves how that's going to help him.One night, at a dinner with Nina, the news director, Lou reminds her just exactly why somebody in her position, one bad rating away from unemployment, needs him. \"I recently learned (that) most Americans watch local news to stay informed\" he tells her. \"I also learned that the average half-hour of Los Angeles television news packs all of its local government coverage\u0085 into 22 seconds. Local crime stories, however, not only usually led the news, but filled 14 times the broadcast.\" Nina, played by Rene Russo as a news director who knows exactly what she needs to sell, knows his threat is one he can carry out, with ease. She knows what the viewers want to see and that Lou is the best at finding it. \"We like crime\" she tells him when they first meet. \"Not all crime. A carjacking in Compton, for example, that isn't news, now is it?\u0085 think of our newscast as a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut.\" He's a fast learner, like he says.One minor detail which I don't mean to nitpick is the search engine he uses a few times for research. It looks pretty bad, like something out of the 90s. It would've been more immersive had they just cut to shots of the websites, which had all the information that the search results had anyway. I get that they didn't want to use Google but there were better ways to handle it.It felt repetitive to have the same sequence happen twice with Rick wasting time messing up so the exact same guy could get to the scene first and taunt Lou, sirens already flashing, victims all gone. The repetition could've been more effective if it was cut down to just show that he was too late and it would still display the rivalry and get him in trouble later. Of course, such minor flaws were pretty much forgotten by the end of the film and didn't affect its overall power or quality.\"Do you know what fear stands for?\" Lou asks. \"False Evidence Appearing Real.\" Nightcrawler is definitely saying something about the way the media manipulates what we think is going on as well as what and who we should worry about, and how much. Throughout the film, I noticed a few ads, playing on the TV or the car radio in the background. Another way to sell something to the public.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is without doubt one of the best films I had seen from 2014, if not my favourite. Personally stealing the limelight from any other films released in that year, Nightcrawler is a film that when you see on the shelves at a store you get that exciting tingle through your body to buy it before realising you already have a pristine copy locked away in your Holy Grail of films cabinet. Honestly... it's that good. On first viewing of the trailer, I was intrigued, but only enough to keep the film in the back of my mind knowing that one day I remember to eventually go to see it. Upon hearing mixed reviews from friends, I decided I wouldn't waste my money. I let a few months pass before seeing the film appear online. I had an evening free and decided to watch it on my laptop with headphones which I would later come to regret not seeing on the big screen. To put it into simple terms: I WAS BLOWN AWAY. I really struggled to find any flaws and seriously doubted the reviews I had heard from friends. This was a film that made me experience something I haven't felt as a kid. That power to completely draw me into a film and leave you forgetting the reality of which you're actually in.I personally believe this is down to a number of different things: 1. A truly original and gripping story. Who would think that a simple story about a freelance video-journalist would make a great film; Dan Gilroy, thats who. This script is an absolute Gem of the film world that tangles in with so many different representations; the anti-hero and the American dream. 2. Cast Jake Gyllenhaal as Louis Bloom is just phenomenal that I forgot that Gyllenhaal was a real person outside of this film. Gyllenhaal provides exceptional acting for character with an unbelievable strange character arc. 3. Composition There are many shots in this film which upon pausing any frame could make a gorgeous photo. A lot of care and time has obviously gone into getting each of these shots perfect for the screen. Beautiful lighting throughout. 4. ScoreA score that never takes from the movie but always, always adds infinite amount of tension. I can be very picky about scores in films, in particular I believe sometimes it shouldn't have one fro example Dallas Buyers Club. This was an amazing exception and a lovely soundtrack to listen to. Overall for these qualities and generally on how much i enjoyed the film, I have rated the film a 10. I hope you find my review helpful and I have only recently started writing these reviews as a student still in education. Nonetheless - GO WATCH THIS FILM NOW!",

The protagonist is someone devoid of any emotion and has a laser focus on his end objective while all the people he works with are completely expendable. He has no soul. All his knowledge is theoretical and has been acquired through self taught study via the internet as you will learn early in the movie.I probably wouldn't go to the cinema for this.

If you were wondering where the real movie stars have all gone, this guy is up there with the greats.Nightcrawler is a dark and brilliantly made film which perfectly satirizes American culture and society. Through the flawless creation of a monster: Lou Bloom - a relentless and dangerous sociopath - we are taken on a breathless journey into the madness of capitalist society's worst characteristics brought to life.This work is an heir to 'Taxi Driver' but is a better film in many ways. They both share the conceit of following a mentally and socially dysfunctional central character, who literally drives his way through the darker side of American urban life.I was reminded of Kirk Douglas's character in 'The Bad and The Beautiful' and the evil which drives some people under the guise of ambition.This film is about voyeurism in many ways, but also simply about evil and how it can seep into people's lives without them expecting it until it is too late.From a technical point of view Nightcrawler is outrageously good, surely in time its true worth will be acknowledged, neither a small indie art-movie nor a big-budget action film, this is undoubtedly one of the best films to ever come out of Hollywood.",

            "content": "Pretty much as good as it gets. I was at once compelled to look at and be repelled by Jake Gyllenhaal's character - a sociopath - and Los Angeles' representation of a city crawling with pathologies. The photography seemed to demonstrate the city L.A. itself as simply an onlooker, just a witness of crazed traffic and social indifference. Gyllenhaal is certainly one of the best of the young contemporary actors - Edward Norton, Johnny Depp, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey, Jr., the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman, a few others. Never disappointed in what they do, even if the film is of less significance. From the start you have, at least in a few scenes, a sense of where this is going, perhaps a bit more than necessary - I'm not keen on figuring out in advance what might be happening next. But the sheer audacity and sociopathy of his character is riveting. I've rarely seen him - but Brokeback Mountain was enough in and of itself to warrant him acclaim. Rene Russo is always interesting to see and she has moved into her older years beautifully. As his hapless \"associate\", Riz Ahmed may very likely find his way to the slim list of excellent actors. Too, Kevin Rahm, who appeared as a gay neighbor in Desperate Housewives and as Russo's cohort here, one of the conscientious few, showed in the few scenes he was in, a talent to disarm. When I left the theater - a very respectful, large audience - I wanted to go right home and take a shower, as if I could wash out of my mind the wantonness of the cast of characters we don't only witness but we play.",

I thought the Acting by Gyllenhaal was superb in this film, one of his greatest performances yet. I loved him in Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' as well as Heath Ledger, but i think he shone more in this film, as it was his sort of come-back film since David Ayer's 'End Of Watch' which i also loved him in. Since then, he had been in Denis Viellenuev's film 'Prisoners' which i thought was such a powerful film, and Gyllenhaal really shone as Detective Loki. And he also starred in a lower-key film 'Enemy' to which he played two characters. This film is definitely worth a watch, it also co stars Reno Russo and Bill Paxton. It is mainly worth a watch to see how great Gyllenhaal is, plus the film is also very entertaining i thought. It was a lot better than expected, sure i watch every Gyllenhaal film that is released, because he always makes it great, but i am not big into cinematography, but even then, i think this is one of the best films Gyllenhaal has ever done!",

I was expecting a boring color palette of blues, reds, and blacks. However, they used a wide variety of colors to bring the night of California to life which was very important to the tone of the movie. The characters were very well written, but it was hard to be relatable to them. The characters we can relate to were too static with not enough development to care about them, but either way the acting was outstanding. Gyllenhaal portrayed a side of genuine acting that he carries with him, and in Nightcrawler, its above his other performances. His acting is used as a tool to cary suspense throughout the movie and it was highly effective. Even if the character wasn't relatable, it was made very easy to be stressed, and anxious for him. Shot composition was great, and the director of photography clearly knew what he was doing. Some parts of the movie felt cliche (like most of the driving scenes), and there was a lot that just would not actually happen if this situation was real, but it still felt real. The director made the character's desires extremely focused and I really appreciated that. What makes this movie so amazing are the characters, and the acting performance. Overall story is very well done, and dialogue is great. This movie is a must see, but by no means perfect. 9/10",

We always see those \"on the scene\" videos used for news reports but we never give it a second thought. \"Nightcrawler\" gives us a deep, if perhaps exaggerated, look at this process and how these people are the guns for hire that we never know about.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a socially awkward loner who is self-motivated and determined to find his place in this world and be a success. We learn very early on that Lou will go to great lengths to find success and will almost do or become anyone to do that. He spots a car accident on the highway and stops as he sees a van park alongside and two men with video cameras get out and start filming the police officers vigorously try to rescue the woman in the burning vehicle. Lou inquires about a job from the head filmer Joe Loder, classic work by Bill Paxton, but is turned down. Another thing on Paxton, so great to see him getting work again and he delivers the line of the year\u0085\"Welcome to the future\u0085.BRAH\". OK, it might not seem that funny now, but when you see it and listen to his delivery of it\u0085priceless.Lou decides to take things into his own hands by getting his own camera, a police scanner, and meticulously learning all of the meanings of the codes on the scanners so he can arrive on the scene and get the best material to sell to the highest bidding news station. That bidder turns out to be Rene Russos' Nina, an over the hill former news anchor who is now a material editor and desperate to boost her ratings. Her and Lou strike a deal that has him exclusively getting first hand material and selling it to her station\u0085a relationship that quickly becomes one sided as we really start to see the kind of person that Lou is.As far as the performance goes, Gyllenhaal is dynamite here, a dark and brooding loner isn't necessarily new material for him but there are few other leading men out there who could pull off a low-key character that can scare the life out of you. Very Ed Norton in \"Primal Fear\"- esque. However, I would have liked to discover more about Lou and his past. He mentions that it might not be that he doesn't understand people but that he doesn't like them. I get that, but why then is always trying to get their approval? He is after money, sure, but he seems more concerned at being noticed and wanting to be loved and respected by others around him.In the end, this is one of those movies that you will miss if you don't see it quickly and is destined for a future as a diamond in the rough in your Netflix selection. It is dark, Gyllenhaal is creepy, and his eyes are really bulgy (that might not seem significant but wait till you see them\u0085they look like they're falling out of his face!) and I mean, what else are you gonna see this Halloween?...Ouija?

But I was let down.Apparently, Jake lost 30 pounds before doing this movie. I liked the buff look better. His body and face looked like a skeleton. His eyes looked massive and he lost all his cheekbones. If that wasn't enough, he would have looked better in a beard. This was one of those characters that would look better with the actor having at least a stubble. But no. He doesn't.Anyway, keeping the physical aspect of him away, he doesn't exactly fit the role, or do justice to it. The acting's good and all, but he doesn't exactly look creepy or scary, or DARK, basically. This character was supposed to look dark. Instead, he portrays it like a drug addict, who doesn't quite know who to react to what situations.Besides that, the movie is great. A 9/10, even.It's funny how Jake was supposed to make me partial towards this movie, but instead he took away the 1.5 and was the only thing I didn't like in this.Ryan Gosling did it better in Drive (another good indie film similar to this in genre, watch it) and he wasn't even supposed to look that dark/evil/mysterious considering how he was one of good guys. But he nailed it.",

I know he's weird but I can't explain why? It was too unsettling and it made me feel uncomfortable.I don't know why Lewis hired someone to do navigating. Why can't his map app tell him? I find it weird the news would even want to buy his footage. It's too gorey for TV. It just seems like a bad job filming too. That the lady at the TV station turned a blind eye to the lack of morality, it's too unrealistic.I don't like how everything in the movie feels void and vacant and hollow and expansive. I'm waiting for something. I finally get something in the end. I start to understand why he's weird.

Both times, I was reminded of the terrible potential of human callousness.All I knew before my first viewing of Nightcrawler was that it was a highly rated thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal. His character, Lou Bloom, is reminiscent of Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle; he's a distrustful, angry outcast. A major difference, perhaps, lies in Lou's commitment to the holy dollar. I won't say more than that.The soundtrack to this film is chilling. The cast is spectacular. Actors like Gyllenhaal and Bill Paxton play unconventional roles that showcase their impressive ranges. The cinematography is oddly gorgeous, but still appropriately unsettling. Dialogue is cold, clever, and believable.I don't want to say more and risk spoiling such a film. I found Nightcrawler to be a believable psychological thriller that surprised me and even stressed me out. It embraces its setting so fully, makes it so much a part of its own identity, that I can see a certain kind of timelessness in it. Its emotional themes certainly appear to be universal.",

At a point I believed he was going to take a step ahead and beyond the crime itself, committing one himself on a bigger scale just taken into the inevitable down-spiral {Nine Inch Nails would be so appropriate!} of his own actions, in an escalation of disasters.

As one might expect, the movie has car chases, gunfire and fights, but it is very much not an action movie. Instead, it confidently focuses on the study and evolution of a very interesting and well-crafted main character, and does so without compromising on action, intensity and emotion.The visuals are lovely, and the depressing sight of a dark and brutal Los Angeles creates a truly special feeling, and accentuates the madness of the world Gyllenhaal's character lives in.\"Nightcrawler\" is a truly great film, filled with memorable scenes, and one that will most likely stick with me for a long time.",

Hand-held footage pulls us into characters, slight shake simply building our adrenaline and leaving car crashes feeling even more real. Editing is slick during moments of action but also allows slow pace to mimic the start-stop nature of the job. But above all this film should be praised for Gyllenhaal. Channeling the autism- spectrum character of A Curious Incident, he is totally believable as the madly driven, manipulative videographer.

Gyllenhaal is brilliant as the psychopathic lead, who sometimes exhibits moments of calculated exploitative warmth towards his vulnerable employee to make him do what he wants. He is a cynical manipulator, only interested in absorbing any information he can to get ahead and make money. He has no scruples. There are several moments where one expects him to do something human, but he never quite gets there. Some of the directorial and acting magic here is in making you think he might get there.Rene Russo is scorching as the beautiful but cynical TV director. When I was watching I didn't realise it was Rene Russo, and I was curious as to who this fantastic actress was. I was surprised when I read it was her because she owned the role so effectively, I just saw her as a unique character. The relationship between the two leads is the best part of the film. Just as Gyllenhal manipulates his employee in a two dimensional way, Russo uses Gyllenhal in a much more subtle way. The power dynamic between these two excellent actors is tense and smouldering throughout. They are an excellent couple.Everything else is great. Cinematography, sound, atmosphere are all bang on, The world that this film is set is our world, but it feels darkly dystopian due to the way the story unfolds and the subject matter.This is a story about our society and about us. It's about what we are willing to demand, then observe and consume. In a free marketplace of ideas where we can absorb any information that we wish to, no matter how extreme, it explores how that environment can be ruthlessly exploited and indeed manipulated for gain by those with no morals, no scruples and no humanity. There are lessons in this story for law makers, counter terrorism practitioners, police and academics. Do you ever feel manipulated by what you watch? Then watch this film.",

The \"goofs\" in this movies may be many in terms of the minutia of how a television station works, but in terms of of plot, character and cinematic imagery, it is practically perfect. Nothing is extraneous, from the props to things that seem illogical initially. The movie opens with him cutting through a fence right next to an opening in the fence and it proceeds from there. BTW, I remember the last shot of the watch and it isn't plastic.In some respects, this movie fits in with movies about artificial intelligence, as the main character has logic and learning, but his empathetic function is severely damaged. Usually, these people come to the attention of authorities at an early age because of their anger. However, the film makers let us know that this guy has managed to separate himself from the people who knew him as a child and has been using the internet to learn to modify his behavior and affect in order to appear more normal. Ironically, many of the things he teaches himself to do are things a therapist would advise, usually to no avail.Margeret Mead had a theory that different societies favored different personality types, although the individuals in those societies would still show the usual range of personality type. This movie is a bildungs roman of a man learning how to fit his pathology into a perverted society where antisocial personality disorder with something mild on the Asperger's spectrum gives him advantages. It isn't just the news room, either. An internet that encourages people to manipulate their way to personal power fits him like a glove. The role of lieing in his psychology and the psychology of a certain prominent con artist makes this a truly relevant movie, powerfully prophetic. No, I am not thinking about Martin Shkreli, but I could be. A number of studies have shown that as people gain personal power their empathetic function diminishes, and we live in a time when that dynamic is being normalised and politicized. I wanted to see this movie because the trailers reminded me of an ex- boyfriend. This person had a highly developed empathetic function and took care of everyone around him, as in making sure they had a place to sleep and something to eat, because those were the people who were his friends. The earnest literalism, the manic energy, even facial expressions continued to remind me of my friend for the whole movie. Ironically, he had been a man with a plan that was going to keep him firmly in the middle class, when he decided that he didn't want to be that person and reorganized his life so he could hangout and help people he liked. In a world flooded with movies about evil falling from the sky or popping out of a box, this is a real movie about real evil.",

            "content": "2014 has been a year dominated by independent films. Not in box office numbers; In quality. And the trend continues with this modest little investigative noir from Dan Gilroy. Making his directorial debut, Gilroy has shown immense potential with this Los Angeles set thriller. Much of that credit is due to a once again fantastic performance from Gyllenhaal, who turns in perhaps his best work to date. This is a character that seems to be a culmination of all of his previous work. Lou Dobbs (Gyllenhaal) is a neurotic drifter. And he's in no way a good guy. We're introduced to him as he is stealing copper wire for petty cash. Lou is a vulture in the city of angels, desperate to find his niche and eager to succeed. He is very well spoken, but persistent to a fault. One late night driving on the hectic Los Angeles freeway, he comes across a traffic accident and his curiosity grabs hold as he pulls over to investigate. In the midst of officers rescuing a woman from a burning vehicle, he notices men with high tech camcorders filming the scene from multiple angles. This heavily intrigues Lou and he learns from one of the camera men Joe Loder (Paxton) there's money to be earned for the juiciest videos that can be sold to local news stations. So off Lou goes, stealing his way to buying a camcorder and police scanner. He is now in the beginning stages of 'nightcrawling' and the learning curve is steep. However Lou being the obsessive learner he is catches onto the game quickly, becoming better and better each night. Soon he hires another drifter as an assistant. Lou forms a partnership as well with a struggling news director Nina Romina (Russo) at the cities lowest rated station. This is no coincidence. As the film picks up speed, our 'protagonist' reveals himself as nothing more than a savage man that will stop at nothing to manipulate and deceive his way to getting everything he wants. And it's a fascinating ride. Gyllenhaal is a man possessed by Dobbs. The dramatic weight loss aside, this is the year's best performance outside of Scarlett Johansen's haunting role in 'Under the Skin'. In the spirit of Patrick Bateman, it's the kind of character you hate to love. Yet you can't help it. Dobbs is a psychopath. But he's freakishly intelligent. He has every angle pre-thought and every exit strategy in place for whatever may come his way. The only weakness I noticed within the film is that nobody is even approaching Gyllenhaal's level here. Who can blame them though? For me the most key player in the film is cinematography wizard Robert Elswit. In my opinion, he's amongst the absolute best working today, and nobody shoots Los Angeles quite like him. Of course shot on 35mm, the night time streets of LA are alive and very dangerous. The screen is crisp at every moment. No doubt that Gilroy knew what he was doing recruiting Elswit. This will be the second film this year featuring his phenomenal work behind the lens in LA (Inherent Vice coming in December) and once again he creates a Los Angeles that's familiar yet mischievous. The city is the strongest supporting character in the film. Nightcrawler doesn't warrant repeat viewings, because it fulfills all you expect in the first go around. Gyllenhaal is a revelation. His character is one of the most intriguing we've seen in years. It's as much a satire of the disgusting business of news reporting, as it is a night time thriller. Throw your money to the screen. This is a hardworking film that deserves it for a change.",

To the uninitiated these words sound reassuring, however, when spoken in 2014's psychological thriller Nightcrawler, it encapsulates the discreet horror which makes it a contender for the best film of the 2010s. Jake Gyllenhaal (Prisoners) stars as Lou Bloom, a hard-working psychopath who discovers the urban world of nightcrawling, where stringers and journalists film crime scenes and sell the footage to the highest paying news outlet. As his profits grow, so does his desperation to film stories, increasingly pushing moral and legal boundaries of news reporting whilst also providing a deeper message that criticises the consistent fear-mongering and sensationalist stories generated by the news today. Everything in Nightcrawler, from the screenplay, to Dan Gilroy's direction, to the actors, including Riz Ahmed (Rogue One) and Rene Russo (Thor), culminates in a truly riveting, terrifying and occasionally comedic cinematic experience. However, the greatest praise owed to Nightcrawler is that of it's lead, Jake Gyllenhaal. Snubbed for any major award nominations, he gives his best performance as a villain we love to empathise with but also makes us shiver whenever he succeeds. Despite a hauntingly unnerving character study that chips away at the audience's sense of safety, Nightcrawler unfortunately represents a dying breed of film. However, paired with its' standout lead performance, impeccable script and one of the most intense third acts put to film, Nightcrawler, like Lou Bloom himself, manages to excel above and beyond anyone's expectations and become a true dark horse when considering the best film of the decade.",

In the opening sequence Bloom violently beats a man without hesitation for literally a wristwatch. This is how the film approaches. It wants to make us uneasy from the start, keeping us on the edge of our seats throughout.How can I describe Bloom? He is like a new variation on Patrick Bateman to be one of those cult icons, he's deliberately like he is so that from American Psycho. Bloom is psychotic and driven in equal measure, he is a man who's ends always justifies his means. Bloom is carved out people will like him more for it, and somehow it works. We are given one of these about once every 2 or 3 years, Bloom is just the latest. He is man without the need for morals or empathy. He is like a black hole moving in the world.Gilroy is a director who wants us to react to his product, he doesn't care if it's positive or negative, he just wants us to react. That's how the entire film is carved out, with the intention of our reactions.Nightcrawler doesn't have any hero's, so each of the characters are as vacuous as the last. However I think it is how Bloom prays on the depravity of those around him that makes him the central character; he is poison for the people he meets as he drags each of them down into his world, the world of a Nightcrawler.I think that to give credit for Nightcrawler to Gyllenhaal alone would be foolish, It is as much the people around him that contribute to Nightcrawlers success, Riz Ahmed for example is a man who has truly come a long way since his days in Four Lions. This film is a team effort.Nightcrawler has enough going for it to be successful, but lacks something to make it the indie classic it craves to be.",

One only can see that he progresses in his trespasses of the law *He is a type such as the ones portrayed by Jim Carrey in his movies: at times naive looking, smiling often, doing simple things such as watching comedy or watering a flower pot. Can such a personage become a multiple killer? Maybe I am wrong, but it is kind of improbable, though theoretically possible. One reason he does he does is the attraction for Nina Romina and the desire to be likable to her. *The main reason I watched is to get some insights into media inner workings and in this sense the film delivers finely. For example, you learn that the crimes suffered by upper class people have priority in the news. *Not only Bloom lacks empathy but also the top journalist Nina Romina - in a last scene with her we see her congratulating him, after cursorily acknowledging death of his partner. In this sense, they found each other and I think this is a point of the movie - possible desensitizing of media workers.",

I would not be surprised if he wins the Oscar for best Actor. There are more than a few scenes in this movie that will give you chills. The story was very good as well, very well written movie. The acting from each role was good, but Gyllenhaal stole the show for sure. One thing I have to say about this movie was the cinematography and the lighting. It was AMAZING. For this being Dan Gilroy's first directing job, he killed it.There were a few things about this movie that were not exactly believable, but that is the beauty of it being a movie. Gyllenhaal's evil grin and manipulative nature in this movie blew me away. Also, he rarely blinks while he is on screen which is interesting. His character development and transformation is great and captivating. Go see Nightcrawler, you will not be disappointed.",

Much like the picture's scathing depiction of modern-day mainstream media, filmgoers find themselves glued and unable to look away from its at times grotesque and confronting imagery, thanks to some slick filmmaking from first-time director Dan Gilroy, alongside real wife Rene Russo, and his tight screenplay's smart social commentary permeated with a sick sense of humour, not to mention an intensely moody atmosphere and teeth-clenching sequences. Audiences have prayed to never cross this sort of cold stringer haunting Los Angeles by night since 2014, even if riding shotgun as Riz Ahmed's understated Rick or working alongside the legendary Bill Paxton seems like so much fun.",

            "content": "What an experience \"Nightcrawler\" is, and what a delight to watch a movie centered on an incredibly fascinating character. Lou Bloom is one of the best embodiment of today's generation, encapsulated in this extremely paradoxical character: during the whole movie, you are just as fascinated with him as you are disgusted, you both root for him and want him to be caught or stopped, you despise his actions but want to see how far he'll go, you want to slap him but can't help but love his soliloquies. The movie manages to broach several themes, and where I have read a lot of comment on how it was a movie about the media, I tend to see it far more as a critique of a whole system, enabled by the audience itself at first. The viewer is as much guilty as the news reporter for producing Lou Blooms in this world. The notions of success and what it really means, holding the power, compromising oneself, and, in general, what \"the American dream\" means now are central to this movie, but desperation also is. Almost all characters in this piece are desperate: Nina with the requirements of her bosses, Rick with needing a job, and Lou, of course, to success at a big scale. It is a real view into what people are told they should run after and that they are failure if they don't. The picture is beautiful, and L.A. hasn't looked that good for a long time, which only enhances the quality of an already great the screenplay. The dialogue is excellent, even hilarious at times. I must admit that I laughed a lot while watching, cause here is some of the best dark comedy I've seen in a long time.However, it is impossible, really impossible to dissociate Nightcrawler's brilliance from Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. That he wasn't even considered for an Oscar is a real head-scratcher for me (I wonder who he p*ssed because I don't see any other explanation). The weight loss is only a minor part of his performance, even secondary, although necessary to emphasize Lou's hunger, literally and figuratively: this guy is a scavenger in every aspect of his personality. No, what haunts you in Nightcrawler are Gyllenhaal's eyes: soulless, cold, determined. They pierce through you and he \"sees\" all your weaknesses. The way they glitter with excitement when he repositions a body to get his \"perfect shot\". How hard they weigh on you when you are at then end of one of his monologues. the complete absence of any form of empathy... Second to the eyes is this ferocious smile that is both infectious and terrifying. Lou will stop at nothing to eat you and satisfy his \"hunger\". And finally, his lines delivery is simply riveting. This is a flawless and mind-blowing performance of Gyllenhaal, who doesn't go into huge display of emotions, but on the contrary, provides an incredibly charismatic abhorrent scumbag you can't help but watch. The rest of the cast is excellent, especially Riz Ahmed as Rick, to support him. Definitely one of the best movies made in the past years, and a must- see",

            "content": "Nightcrawler surprised me, I thought I was getting a creepy disturbing film, it was still that, but it was actually way more interesting than what I expected, it's funny, smart and electrifying, with of course a mind-blowing performance by the brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal. This film tells the story of Lou Bloom, a very persistent man who is looking for a formal job. After selling some supplies he stole (he is a rascal from the beginning) Lou happens upon a car crash and learns of \"nightcrawling\", a profession where a person films crime scenes and sells them to news stations to broadcast. Lou starts filming ambitiously, with the goal of getting money at first, despite not really knowing what he is doing (these scenes are hilarious!) , but he eventually becomes obsessed with his job to the point of manipulating crime scenes in order to get the best footage he can. This obsession turns him into an even worse person, and that's the success of Nightcrawler, this character study of Louis Bloom, played so wonderfully by Jake Gyllenhaal. Riz Ahmed and Rene Russo round up the supporting cast as Rick, Lou's employee who helps him in his nightcrawling efforts and Nina, a TV-news veteran to whom Lou sells his footage.Now, Jake Gyllenhaal's performance in this movie, mind-blowing, spectacular, amazing, seriously I have nothing but praise to say of his portrayal of Lou. He kills it! To start, Lou is already an incredible character, such a disturbing guy, he made me cringe for a good part of the film. From the start of the film, you see him with the light in his face, you can feel there's something really unsettling about the guy, he's just off, intriguingly creepy, and everything he says sounds like something you would get from following those self-help books. This creepy charisma was achieved due to Gyllenhaal's noteworthy dedication to the role, you can really tell the guy was into it, from his weight loss to breaking the mirror. Bloom is not the most likable guy, he is a scoundrel, everything he says he says it so that he can optimize every situation in order to get what he wants, without caring about the consequences that it may bring those around him. He may laugh a lot, make small talk, but there's a scene where you see just how different this facade is from his real self, you can also see that a lot in his exchanges with Rick. Despite all of that, the way the movie tells his story you just root for him, that said, eventually Lou crosses a line of morality, and at that point you don't want him to win anymore, just like with how I felt about Walter White, from Breaking Bad, another incredible character. After seeing the movie you begin to morally question yourself for having rooted for such a horrible guy, dark stuff, man.An outstanding character played by a brilliant actor. To put it bluntly, you don't see Jake Gyllenhaal in this movie, you see this slick, gaunt, and creepy bastard roaming the streets of LA in search of a good crime scene. That's how incredible Gyllenhaal is in this movie. He's not the only one who gave a great performance here though, Rene Russo was also really great, she drifts between anger and gratefulness towards Lou, and she's exceptional when portraying both emotions. The only problem I had with the acting here was Riz Ahmed, he wasn't very good in the movie, he just seemed way too scared and awkward all the time, it seemed like it was the character's only emotion, to be fair though, I didn't think Rick was a memorable character. My only flaws with the movie were something in the final act, something happened that made no sense and Riz Ahmed's acting and character. However, everything else makes up for it. And what an ending to an already great film, not very satisfying but very smart and coherent with the rest of the story.Dan Gilroy did a great job directing the film, Los Angeles looks glazed and intimidating at night, with the evening light highlighting Jake's emotionless expressions, creeping up his character even more. His script is at the same level, getting a hold of the audience and not letting go, making us tense with excitement, wondering what Lou will do next. Superb soundtrack, as well, every song accentuates the tone of the scene, the main theme is riveting, augmenting the thriller feel of the whole movie. Add in a thrilling car chase and Jake Gyllenhaal's exquisite performance and you get Nightcrawler, an incredible character- driven film that offers even more than its already great study of a terrific character. I strongly recommend you check it out, at least once, it's the type of film you see once and that's good enough for you, seeing it too much will spoil the feeling you get when you watch it.Like I said, I only saw one or two flaws with the movie, but both are compensated by the rest of it and then some. Nightcrawler is truly a jewel of a movie.",

The lead role of Lou played by Jake Gyllenhall was great, some people complain a his lack of emotional depth but that is a stupid argument when Gyllenhall plays the role of a sociopath (someone who cant truly feel emotion like the rest of the human race).My only issue I would say is the trailer i'm not sure if this was only in my cinema but his motto in the start of the film and trailer \"to win the lottery you need to make the money to buy a ticket\" which is said allot in the trailer (even screamed) only appeared once in the film in fact Lou only screams in the mirror once making me think that it was recorded purely for the trailer (False Advertisement).

I think to laugh at this like one would laugh at a comedy, one would have to be somewhat disturbed/sociopathic just like the main character.I myself laughed several times during the movie, but only in a disgusted/shocked manner. That's the kind of movie this is.Nevertheless, the movie is excellent, and well worth your watch, because it portrays a very common problem in our societies today, in that we view and capture news in a sort of thrill/fear-seeking light, as though we're expecting to ride a rollercoaster or watch a scary movie. This is not what news is supposed to be about. There are legitimate reasons to pay attention to disturbing or violent news, especially in one's local vicinity, but one can tell just by looking at the news stories available and popular today that it goes far beyond that, in a sort of glorifying and sensationalizing manner.If you have a conscience, you won't be perfectly comfortable while watching this movie; some may even want to shut it off, understandably. However, I believe that sometimes it is good to pay attention to evil under the spotlight (though obviously, in this case, fictionally so), in order for one to learn from it.The movie also has merit in having a good script, good acting, good POV, etc. Mainly the only reason I don't give it a higher rating is just the nature of it not being entirely something that makes you happy, even if you don't regret watching it, if that makes sense.",

Credit where credit is due, regarding Gyllenhaal's performance. He did a great job playing an intriguing character who develops as the film unfortunately barely scrapes along. The plot as a whole leads you to believe you're watching a gritty L.A. crime thriller, which it essentially is; however, the whole thing was executed poorly and I felt like it wasn't even taking itself seriously at times. It kind of revives itself a few times but then leaves you thinking the writers could have done a better job. On a lighter note, the film was shot really well with some gripping scenes. I would have liked to have seen a more insightful look on the life and past of Gyllenhaal's character. It would have been interesting to have fully understood his motives rather than saying \"oh, he just needs a job\". As for the events in the film, it's difficult to get a grasp on when everything is happening. As you're watching, it seems all these horrendous crimes are being committed night after night. If this wasn't intended by the writers, they should have added more scenes of the demise of Louis Bloom's mind.

(this shows, for example, when he used to steal things because he didn't have a job, then he stopped stealing when we got one) so he is not the thief per say, he just would do whatever it takes to survive. although what he did might seem extreme for the viewers, i think we all knew someone who is just like him, a shark. a lot of the top people in this world made it to the top by sacrificing some of their morals. if its not killing, it stealing or cheating..etc. this doesn't make it right, but it is the sad truth. and this movie portrays this in a very thrilling and exciting way. we got to see the story of a broke man who made it to the top by doing any think we could do even if it is not quite moral.",

            "content": "In this self proclaimed psychological thriller, Jake Gyllenhaal plays the loathsome unemployed Lou Bloom, who with out a lack of better words reminds me of the charismatic yet wicked Ted Bundy, looking for a quick trip to the fast lane and will do anything to get there. With the help of his newly hired assistant Rick, played by Riz Ahmed, they speed through the city of L.A. looking for bloodstained crime scenes that they can monopolize on for a paycheck. Unfortunately they find more than just a few obstacles along the way. One being seasoned nightcrawler Joe Loder, played by Bill Paxton, who also will do whatever it takes to be the next big opening story in local news. Bloom soaks up journalistic advice from Nina Romina, played by Rene Russo, to get ahead of the game, doing so by any means necessary and the goal is the more gore, the bigger the score. This movie had great potential, but did not follow through to the end...or even from the beginning for that matter. While the action and sadistic nature of this movie were top notch, it was overshadowed by an anti climatic supporting cast and script. Gyllenhaal was superb to the point of award worthy, but there was nothing else in this story to write home about. He made me appreciate the non remorseful fast talker with the incessant need to succeed that he was drafted to portray. Russo attempted to do her part, and while she has some commendable scenes, she just did not fit the entire bill for me. Paxton couldn't even bring me the joy that necessary for me to thoroughly enjoy this film and he is among my list of favorite actors. If you are a Gyllenhaal fan, then this movie may just be for you. The role of Bloom was interesting and engaging, but with a slow start and a less than desirable crowning point, this movie did not keep me on the edge of my seat. I give this movie 2.5 stars. Let us hope that the next time director and writer Dan Gilroy decides to put out a potential blockbuster that he surrounds his well qualified protagonist with those that will allow him and the movie to radiate the silver screen.",

He strikes gold when he arrives at a crime scene even before it is reported to the police & in fact the criminals are just leaving the scene when he enters it.He manages to capture everything & gets a deal of 15000 USD for it.From here on he gives his agency a name (NHP) and starts doing the professional way.I recommend this to anybody waiting to a thriller.......!!",

I was more interested in the development of the character than the actual plot (which wasn't bad at all).

            "content": "Local news stations live and die by the ratings. Whether it's the royal wedding or a high-speed chase, reporters toil around the clock for the next big story that will increase the viewership and advertising revenue of their stations. When however, does the next big story cease to be news? \"Nightcrawler\" highlights the broad line between good journalism and morbid entertainment, and what can happen when that line is crossed. Despite being credited as the film's lead, there is no trace of Jake Gyllenhaal in \"Nightcrawler.\" Losing 30 pounds to play the part, Gyllenhaal immerses himself into the role of petty thief Lou Bloom both physically and psychologically. From the opening shots of the film, you can tell that something is off about Bloom. After stealing chain links from a fence on private property, he assaults a security guard, delivers the stolen materials to a Los Angeles construction site and tries to sell himself as a potential employee to the site manager. Noticing a car crash on his drive home, Bloom pulls over to investigate. Two freelance videographers arrive at the scene shortly after and film police officers pulling the driver from the burning wreckage. When asked by Bloom, one of the cameramen reveals that he and his partner drive around LA, filming anything and everything to sell to the news station that will pay the most. \"If it bleeds it leads,\" the cameraman tells him. Inspired by the encounter, Bloom pawns a stolen bicycle, purchases a camcorder and a police scanner and begins working as a stinger. Bloom presents his first clip of footage to local TV news station director Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who describes her station's newscast as, \"a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut.\" Bloom adheres to this ideology in his work, exposing his darker nature to the audience. Infatuated with his growing success, Bloom pushes every moral and legal boundary imaginable to get the perfect shot.Gyllenhaal's performance is enthralling. Despite the disturbing and sociopathic nature of his role, his character intrigues you. Bloom is passionate. Bloom is driven. Bloom is wickedly smart. He has an eerie charisma about him that seeps under your skin.Rene Russo is also exceptional. Unlike Bloom, Romina fully comprehends the magnitude of her choices, sacrificing her morality for television ratings. When the thrills of Bloom's nocturnal crusades are sucking you in, Kevin Rahm's character, Frank Kruse, serves as the conscience to bring you back to reality. Despite his efforts, the concerns of the honest journalist sadly get swept under the rug by the prowess of Bloom and Romina.The cinematography and editing by Robert Elswit and John Gilroy fuel the intensity of the acting. Whether Bloom is recruiting his partner Rick (Riz Ahmed) at a diner in the late afternoon or he is pursuing a high-speed car chase in the heat of the night, each scene is an exhilarating experience. The film's many shining qualities are only a testament to the thought-provoking script of Dan Gilroy. The scenes and dialogue bring to mind recent events such as the shooting of reporter Allison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward in Virginia. In the shooting's aftermath, there were news websites and stations that chose to run the footage from a video posted online by the shooter, which showed the victims being shot at close range. The ethicality of this has been questioned, as it shows little respect for the victims' families. Sadly however, footage of this magnitude engages our morbid curiosity, and Gilroy explores this truth as the basis of Bloom and Romina's actions in the film.In a 2014 interview with LA Weekly, Gyllenhaal humorously remarks, \"There is a Lou in all of us. I don't know if that disturbs you!\" While I think this is far from the case, our culture as a whole contributes considerably to the \"if it bleeds, it leads\" mentality. Next time you see a brutal or disrespectful video, don't support it. Don't promote it. We can change the rating trends. We can rise above the culture.",

Little things about his performance, from his mannerisms to odd turns of phrase emphasize that Louis Bloom is a stranger to normal human interaction.

Props go to his portrayal which really carries the film, and whether you sympathise or criticise him, he truly brings a sadistic, yet believable, Oscar-worthy performance.Rene Russo also stars as news-station head, whom Lou gives his tapes to, and the chemistry between them, while trying to sassy and seductive, is very tongue-in-cheek at points. Bill Paxton also makes an appearance as rival news gatherer Joe Loder. But, even with these other names, Gyllenhaal really steals the show.You'll be shocked at the things that Lou will do in order to get a good tape, and this makes you wonder 'are there people out there really like this?'.The whole mood of this movie is very dark, with a thick, depressing atmosphere to endure.

I suppose we already had a look into the sometimes corrupt practices of news and documentary - makers as well as journalists in the late seventies with the stunningly chilling \"Cannibal Holocaust\".Although Nightcrawlers is not remotely as graphic or scary as the likes of CH, it is fast paced and dissects the moral dilemma some may face when wanting to make a name for themselves. I specifically refer to the powerful performance of Rene Russo as Nina Romina, who eagerly turns a blind eye to the obvious fraud that is Louis Bloom (Portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal) In the case of Bloom one has to wonder though, if he has any form of morality or conscience, as he digresses rapidly into a frenzy of voyeurism and a lust for sensation, fame and notoriety. This ultimately leads to a spectacular and chaotic conclusion that left me stunned for hours.The acting is superb, and Gyllenhaal is at his best in this thrilling film. Without really wanting to give away too many spoilers, I was rather intrigued to see how the seedy Nightcrawler managed to keep his career going, and what horrific stunts he will pull after the already shocking final scene. I know sequels usually bombs out, but in this case I can actually imagine myself how much worse Bloom will become as he gains further notoriety in the news industry.An excellent watch!",

He literally becomes Lou, he adopts posture, face gestures (that awfully creepy smile) and throws himself into a complete embodiment of this meticulously written (and way original) character. He just blew it off; looks like Method Acting at its best.So let's talk about Lou: what a sociopath, opportunist, human-life-insensitive being, Travis Bickle-style wacko. For real, he is a 21st-century Travis Bickle. Also, I can relate him with Leon (The Professional - 1994): it appears that the only friend he has (and only life form he cares about), is a plant. A man desperate to be someone in life, or at least make one, who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, NOTHING. I'll die to see a prequel (as good as this movie) about how Louis, became Lou. A soft level psychopath, it is one of the most complex and dark characters I've seen in years. He's also mind- gifted, you can see it in his way of treating information. He's like some sort of savant genius with social disorder and contempt for human life.The movie is scary, thrilling, sick, and most than anything gripping. You just can't stand to go to the bathroom, feeling eager to see what will happen next. It's an atomic bomb of emotions for viewers, not knowing if to sympathize of hate the protagonist. Dan Gilroy delivers a miraculous script and a sinister direction. From close-ups, perfect placed cameras and angles, taking advantage of everything the night can offer. It is amazing how this movie feels like a mix of \"Network\" (1976) and \"Taxi Driver\" (1976); with all the nocturnal scenario, broadcast news manipulation and crazy unstable protagonist. Last, but not least, the soundtrack. Both score and original songs are excellent and help create the right tone and atmosphere for the movie.FINAL CONSENSUS: Taxi Driver Meets Network, a dark and thought-provoking non-stopping thriller with the right amount of energy and glorious central performance for turning it into a must-see.",

Here's what's good though: fantastic performance from Jake Gyllenhaal (who nailed his character to the wall, amazing); very good filming; a suspenseful climax. Now, why is the score so low then, you may ask? It is because of the fact that they make us try to relate to the main character who is completely unrelatable, and unlikeable. The humor can be good at times but it also makes light of some very serious events, which some critics praise but I disagree with. Overall it was just a waste of time, I could've seen another movie that's better for the same price or stayed home and played video games till 1 AM, either would've been a better use of my time.Now, the plot itself is boring and you sit around waiting for something interesting to happen, and when something finally does happen you realize the movie is now almost over. There's also a minor sub-plot that is opened involving some detectives (that I won't get into, no spoilers) but I feel like it isn't even resolved in the end and sort of just disappears.

This is something that I don't think the average viewer picks up, understanding that the media is this film is twisted looking to make money without principle nor wanting to inform people, the purpose of news (or rather what it should be...) \"Lou\" is this twisted monster, a personification of today's media. What I did notice was how Kevin Rahm (playing Frank Kruse) acts as the opposite this, standing up for these traditional principals and what news should be. The film does well to make this comment, something that I think most films should try to do, and it hits a fine line in regards to it, something that I think \"The Imitation Game\" didn't do in regards to homophobia and completely missed the boat on in regards to women rights (see my review on it). What I can criticise, and its worth noting I only do so because there always has to be some criticism with any film, in regards to \"Nightcrawler\" is how I found Riz Ahmed's inclusion (playing Rick) a bit unnecessary, the same with the film's ending. I find this in most films and I can never put a finger on it but in some ways I sympathised with the bastards next to me whispering \"why hasn't this film ended yet?\" Its finally worth noting that Dan Gilroy makes his directorial debut with \"Nightcrawler\" and that explains some of the films flaws, but I'm not going to criticise him. I mean it his debut, and a bloody good one at that.\"Nightcrawler\" is a fantastic film and for me, Jack Glyenhaal was the highlight. 100% deserved of an Oscar Nomination, perhaps a win. What \"Nightcrawler\" made me realise though was how twisted our media is.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler [2014] is the neo-noir crime/drama/thriller that stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom, a petty thief that is drawn to a career in L.A crime journalism. Driven by determination 'to make it' into being a supplier of crime footage for news networks, Lou blurs moral boundaries in order to succeed in his new profession. Disturbing character motivations. Its thoroughly unnerving yet entirely fascinating to view characters put success and self-interest above all others. This is a tall-order to achieve in cinema, as they can appear as villainous subjects from a separate reality altogether. Morning news director, Nina Romina (Rene Russo) plays a complementary role to Gyllenhaal's facade. Nina is absolutely necessary for the narrative, as she is exposed to Lou Bloom's detestable Machiavellian way of viewing the world. The subtleties of the great direction, score & script. Direction and script is courtesy of Dan Gilroy. It's his directional debut and great one at that. The score is engaging and instrumental to the narrative, and adds to the macabre atmospheric qualities of the script and direction. Good show, creepy Gyllenhaal. He is terrifying as an eager to learn and grow sociopath. Striving to reach his dreams, we're taken on a journey to see this underdog try to make it in the crazy world of LA crime journalism. But damn, Lou is just so unnerving to watch. Gyllenhaal accomplishes a careful balance between trying to act like a sympathetic human being while being completely aloof and insincere. His body movements, line delivery and facial expressions all perfectly portray Lou in his true (character) form: an imposter. It's a shame that he missed getting nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in the 2015 Academy Awards.",

Soon enough Bloom's new job becomes an obsession where he is not only doing it for the money but however enjoying his work and never really learning anything about his background story except maybe that he is a witty fellow who is tenacious at anything he learns doing, and does it well plays well to focus on not only how empty his life is but also how empty he is that he becomes his work, maybe for the first time he is actually doing something people like and are willing to pay money for, for him it never gets better than that, and that obsession progresses on to the point of manipulating some crime scenes he shoots to make them more enjoyable and watchable by the viewer and hence gets him more money for it. More money, new car, new video equipment, new police scanner, Bloom becomes a full-fledged business man who will stop at nothing to become big. Underlying Bloom's business wittiness and sharp business mind is his sarcasm that is majorly emphasized in his rather long fast monologues which project smartness and messages criticizing maybe the actual employment world nowadays, when he cynically shows his good hardworking manners and attitude towards working his way up and learning and being a good employee and that should get him success, he is actually mocking the conventional way or what this world is trying to convince us with and saying no, you won't get anywhere with an education , education won't get you money, but being an asshole with no heart and giving people what they want at all costs, gets you success, and his success story is the perfect example and proof of that. Selling people what they want brings me to another theme portrayed beautifully by the towering satellite poles we see throughout the movie even contrasted with 'small' \u2013shot towers for they are the controllers of people's mind today, the media, TV, radio, movies, it's what controls their minds and desires so Gilroy shoots them low to give them power and domination, like some horror movie Gothic castles up on some mountain and particularly in one scene they are drowned with fog which gives them the appearance of stationed alien spaceships who have invaded our lives and minds and won't let go. The story definitely employs psychological themes of viewers liking to watch real life tragedies while the media at the same time manipulates it with the editing and order of shots and music, clearly evident in the scene introducing Russo's character, Nina working with the editor on some piece of news. Gilroy has certainly upped his stories after the hearty Real Steel and the action-packed The Bourne Legacy with a raw, biting, social life commentary on media and how it affects our lives. Gyllenhal graces us with another remarkable performance which adds beautifully to his list of great performances the likes of Donnie Darko, Jarhead, and Prisoners.",

The strongest point of course is Gyllenhaal's performance : he really drives the movie. He succeeds in portraying a sick, cold and manipulative man. His impeccable articulation and charming smile slowly make you more and more uneasy as he becomes more calculating and even menacing. The film is not perfect though : they are a few unrealistic scenes in which the police are completely incompetent. My main issue is with the ending : Gyllenhaal's character is so utterly despicable that I couldn't help but wish that he got caught! The fact that he got away with it and is seen achieving success echoes the perverted nature of today's news media and the state of our society.",

It is gritty and real and creepy and then it all goes down hill. He commits a bunch of very serious crimes, gets them on film and the cops simply pay him a visit. At the very least they would have brought a warrant for all of his electronics. He would for sure have been arrested for break and enter and evidence tampering. Also would have been prime suspect for the triple murder, but they just have a little 2 minute chit chat and let him go. Then the final scene just blows that out of the water. He breaks so many very serious laws I lost count. And of course he's just let go. I'm sick of movies that don't follow their own set up rules. This movie is supposed to be a very real and dirty look and a disturbed mind.

Jake Gyllenhaal is an actor whose career I've been closely following ever since the release of End of Watch in 2012, one of my favorite films of that year. Usually, I'm much more attentive to the writer/directors of films as opposed to the actors, but Gyllenhaal is someone whose talents I take an active interest in. With that, I'm excited to say that he may be at his very best in Nightcrawler. He stars as Louis Bloom, a freelance video journalist who specializes in filming bloody crimes that take place in LA and sells them to a news station directed by Nina (Rene Russo). Bloom's business success is by far his top priority and he will literally do anything to get the footage he needs, even if that means tampering with crime scenes and unlawfully entering private residences. It's obvious by his actions and general lack of emotion that Bloom is a sociopath, or something close to it, which makes him a very interesting kind of anti-hero to spend a couple hours with. The audience roots for him simply because he is the most fleshed out character in the film, but it seems Dan Gilroy's main objective is to make the audience hate Bloom by the time the credits roll. Yes, he's socially stunted, and many of his exchanges with Nina and his assistant are quite awkward, but therein lies the surprising humor of Nightcrawler. Bloom can make you laugh, which goes a long way in keeping him within the realm of audience association. Gyllenhaal is truly brilliant as Bloom, and not just because of his weight loss, hair, and haunting eyes. He plays a sociopath like a champ, and doesn't deprive the character of a personality like many actors may. Jake, with Nightcrawler, Enemy, Prisoners, and End of Watch as his latest movies, is on a hot streak that will hopefully continue for years to come. Rene Russo, who just happens to be the director's wife, is also the best I've ever seen her. Her strange chemistry with Gyllenhaal is one of my very favorite parts of Nightcrawler. Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton also give memorable turns as Bloom's assistant and competitor, respectively. This is Dan Gilroy's directorial debut and he impresses with very good looking visuals, dark and grainy, that are reminiscent of a 70's crime drama. Gilroy had the privilege of working with cinematographer Robert Elswit, who is PTA's frequent collaborator as well as a DP for a couple films directed by Dan's older brother, Tony. The film was also edited by Dan's other brother, John, so I guess that he got quite a bit of help from his family and their connections. Nightcrawler is an excellent, tense piece of filmmaking, but it does have a few faults that keep it from being a straight-up classic. The score simply does not fit the movie. The atmosphere of the film begs for a soundtrack similar to Drive, something droning and meditative to fit the material. Instead, we get of mixed bag of distorted guitar, and what sounds like songs by Thomas and Randy Newman. I'm actually upset that Gilroy didn't capitalize on the amazing potential of a somewhat ambient score. The other flaw is the very ending. Up until the very last scene, Nightcrawler is edge-of-your-seat intensity. Then they tacked on a scene at the end that just feels out of place and unnecessary. If that one scene was dropped, and the music was changed, I'd consider giving Nightcrawler a perfect score. But as it stands, it's just a great film itching to be a classic.",

I feel that the character of Louis Bloom is robotic, that he doesn't express very much emotion besides the do-or-die behavior he has while working and the anger for his rival nighcrawler, who occasionally beats him to the punch. This movie, again is unpredictable, mainly because of situations Louis gets himself into. His job drives him to do evil things, which gives the audience many great, memorable scenes in the film.

            "content": "NIGHTCRAWLER \u2013 JUST WOW \u2013 WHAT A MOVIE. Jake Gyllenhaal is my pick for Best Male Actor Oscar this year and the movie deserves a nomination, as does first time director, Dan Gilroy. In the words of Lou Bloom \"A friend is a gift you give yourself\" \u2013 this movie is your friend! Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a loner, a dedicated and passionately driven loner. He has absolutely no friends and spends his time by himself, learning a vast amount of skills on the internet or stealing items to sell. He desperately wants love (or his idea of love) and a job with a steady income. His social skills are based on what he has learned online, as such, he has no social graces or knowledge. He speaks like a text book and is void of emotion and a path to live on. He tries asking for jobs and selling himself to various places but he has no luck, until he sees a fascinating and bloody piece of inspiration. He could become someone who works for himself and gets a reward if he does the job well, that of a nightcrawler, overnight freelance trash journalism. The stuff that trash TV news wants a piece of, the darkest of society at its worse. You all love seeing a train wreck, you know you shouldn't watch but you can't take your eyes off it. Lou films it and sells it to TV for you to watch over your morning breakfast. But as a freelancing job there are other freelancers and if you want your item sold you need to have the best footage, what would you, or in this case, Lou do to get the best sellable footage?Lou is a vampire, a manipulative murderous vampire, he is terrifying in his matter of fact speak, unpredictable and unstoppable, could it turn into a serial killer movie? Lou is another train wreck you can't take your eyes off, while his delivery is humorous his belief in himself and the world is beyond freakish, the worst part, people like him probably exist.Lou meets KLWA night news editor, ruthless, trash TV editor, Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who he sells his footage to exclusively. Romina is at the end of her career tether and knows that train wrecks will sell and get people viewing. In Nina Romina's own words describing the ideal footage \"a screaming woman, running down the street with her throat cut,\" she says, and Lou is willing to go the extra distance to get it for her. It's a match made in television hell.At the start Nina views Lou as a simple determined guy, the new kid on the block who may have some good footage. But their relationship grows into much more.Russo's husband, writer/ director Dan Gilroy has delivered a fresh and nuanced screenplay and delivered it on a golden platter with his debut movie. The unintentional wit and candour of Lou is reminiscent of Norman Bates and Frank. Gyllenhaal provides a dedicated tour de force with his performance. He was so dedicated to the role, he worked out eight hours a day and rode his cycle to set to lose weight as he wanted to be a \"hungry coyote,\" he also was so involved in the \"mirror\" scene he ended up in hospital getting his hand stitched, he then came straight back to set.The supporting cast of Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton is the icing on the cake for this movie, they were all perfectly cast and perfectly delivered their characters. All of these characters have a small but pivotal piece on Lou's chessboard and it all comes through on screen, there is never too much nor too little delivered. That being said I always want more Paxton on screen, he plays such a great character in this, he could have his own movie. And Russo is still one woman I would turn for, ever since LETHAL WEAPON 3 I have crushed on her, I never thought she could do a trashy and desperate look, an aging and needy power woman, and she does, while slowly falling into Lou's world of insanity.Academy Award Winner Robert Elswit's cinematography is the cherry on top of that icing on this glorious cake of a movie. It has a definite Scorcese look and feel to it. The seedy undertones and dark moodiness of Los Angeles created by Elswit have never felt so unappealing, it literally is a hunting ground for Lou. At the same time the colours are all striking, to match the increased sight by Lou's large \"all-seeing\" eyes, eyes that Gyllenhaal rarely blinks - he did the same thing in DONNIE DARKO.NIGHTCRAWLERS' satirical dark comedic thrilling look at paparazzi styled freelance guerrilla journalism is at times hilarious and at others terrifying. This is the closest film to Scorcese's BRINGING OUT THE DEAD I have seen. It is an amazing piece of cinema for film lovers, this is not for the family or date night.

But that is about the only positive thing I can say about this title. The acting is boring but decent, Jake Gyllenhaal is not a favorite, but he has done some really good acting, such as Detective Loki in Prisoners or Donnie Darko in Donnie Darko. It might just be me finding the character he plays annoying and that makes me feel like his acting is not as good as it can be, or maybe it is just that I don't really like him. Either way I would not say it's among his better parts.Then there is the storyline. This is the thing that really ruins the movie for me. It sounds like a great story and it starts out pretty well I guess but it gets so boring and predictable.It's really a shame that a movie that is so cinematically beautiful has to go to waste because of a bad storyline.",

Within the constraints of this being a \"it's wrong, so wrong, but somebody's gotta tell us how wrong it is\" kind of story, and a \"man gone wrong but just trying' to earn an honest dollar\" the momentum of the story strands on the lack of complexity on the main character itself - shallow, Hollow, the only purpose being survival - and for what...? Dog eat dog? Survival of the fittest? With Gyllenhaal so obviously lacking in aspects hard to number, the farthest I would would be venturing is survival of the worst, which is hardly breaking News - which pretty much screams out the most troubling part of this Movie; WHY NOT GIVE THE MAIN CHARACTER A MOTIVE?? By deriving him of his chief motive as a human being, the Movie in itself looses focus, point, and, in the end meaning, for a tale of the blind leading the blind is in itself pretty Close to pointless.

            "content": "\"Nightcrawler\" is an intense and riveting thriller, with a neo-noir style and and some dark social commentary of today's news media. Death and destruction becomes headlines, \"each police siren wail equals a possible windfall, and victims\" are merely \"dollars and cents\" in the film \"Nightcrawler\". Lou Bloom is a hard-working man, a perfectionist, a fast-learner with a can-do attitude and an uncompromising work ethic. He's quite eloquent, articulate, and knowledgeable. He sounds like a nice guy, right? However, some people just don't know when to stop--when things have gone too far, out of hand, or crossed a line. Lou Bloom is one of those people. From tampering with crime scenes, to pressuring a co-worker for sex, to blackmailing and sabotaging others, to withholding information from authorities, to manipulating events to his advantage, Lou is an example of an opportunist who never stops pushing. He \"blurs the line between observer and participant\". Lou pursues the American Dream like countless other US citizens/residents--but he's simply willing to do anything to get his payday. The movie shows just how screwed up media can be. It's competitive and ugly, with people fighting over the most gruesome footage. Nina primarily represents the ugly objectives of a cutthroat industry. %%%% MILD SPOILERS %%%% When Nina discovers that a home invasion massacre was a drug deal gone wrong, she decides not to release that info (as it doesn't go with the fear-instilling message she's trying to tell). Nina also tells Lou to focus primarily on getting footage from wealthy, white neighborhoods, because that's what the people want. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent performance as Lou. He's convincing as the socially awkward, demanding, and unsettling man. Jake shows effort, and he even lost weight for the role (which is evident with his gaunt cheekbones). Renne Russo is also great as Nina, a woman who also has little moral qualms with the faults of her work. Riz Ahmed's supporting character (Rick) could've had more of a backstory. I also happened to like Bill Paxton in his small role (as Joe, rival cameraman to Jake's character Lou). Dan Gilroy does a great job as director, especially considering Nightcrawler is his first movie. Despite this praise, because Lou is presented as such a sociopath from the beginning, the movie has slightly less suspense toward the end than it could've had (in hindsight). However, the tragedy at the end is still unexpected to me. I have reviewed 38 other movies on Metacritic and IMDb, including the 2014 and 2015 films: Taken 3, The Interview, Exodus: Gods and Kings, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, The Equalizer, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Giver, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, Blended, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, The Lego Movie, and more.

A guy I know who knows as much or more about film than I do was explaining how he thought this was a bad movie. For the sake of this, we'll call him Bartholomew. I'm going to refute Bartholomew's points while praising this gem of film-making. This was a well-paced, well-written screenplay that was only helped by the acting and directing. I told Bartholomew that he was wrong and I hope that Nightcrawler can be as well appreciated as the Hollywood behemoths that it went to the Oscars with.Bartholomew said that he thought Lou getting a nice red Dodge was pointless and he thought it was weird that the car was always clean. Superficial things like this don't really change my thoughts on a movie. Honestly, I feel movies should have cool cars in the way that some guys feel porn should have women in it.The movie had a great look to it and looked polished while still being gritty enough to be about crime. The addition of a chill, clean, electric guitar to the score was a good tonal bit to put in that furthered the whole vibe of the protagonist: calm. He's doesn't feel for the murder victims he sees. We're not meant to have sympathy for him. He's the catalyst screwing over all the other characters who we DO care about. It's okay to have a character without feelings because people like that exist. It's okay because he has objectives that play out in an interesting way.Bartholomew's main point was that he felt Lou had no real character arc and his being a sociopath wasn't clear. Lou was a sociopath all the way through. He was manipulative in most scenes. It was kind of like a Walter White character journey, showing the audience what happens when someone's only goal is success at any cost.Now, to play devil's advocate, I have to say this. The ending scores a few points on the predictability scale. Well, it's not so much predictable as it's not too far out of what you may expect. Is this an inherent knock on the movie? No. I still loved the ending, and if I think about it, there's not really another fitting way for it to conclude. The climax is still exciting and tense and feels right for the movie. The one real complaint I can have about this is Lou's partner. A character I felt infinitely sorry for. His partner was very present in the third act, but wasn't consistently there for a lot before that. This doesn't ruin the movie for me or anything, and it could even be argued as a good thing for the story. He's not important to Lou, so we only see him when his presence is in Lou's interests.I enjoyed this movie in the way that some serial killers enjoy their work. I could find something to appreciate all the way through without trying too hard and each scene was great to see. We don't often see sociopaths as main characters, but our boy Jake Gyllenhaal is given that kind of role in Nightcrawler. And he completely kills it. Damn, that's some solid acting. I loved this movie to the point of giving it a 9/10.",

            "content": "Attempting to gather my thoughts during the last few seconds of Nightcrawler was an entirely mind-boggling experience. The film is saturated with different moods and commentaries that letting it settle felt almost uneasy. It is, without a doubt, a hauntingly provocative film. Every layer of the film slowly unfolds with ominous and grippingly dark events, and it is a spectacle to watch. Nightcrawler is a success as a dark tale of greed, psychological disconnection, and the morally questionable state of our television news. Furthermore, it is masterfully filmed in the dark and foreboding Los Angeles nightlife, adding to the film's corrupt but honest themes.Nightcrawler follows the pale, long-haired Louis Bloom, played with chilling exquisiteness by Jake Gyllenhaal, as he struggles to live without a stable job. He is a highly intelligent yet morally depraved man, who can sell his positive demeanor along with the best business plans to anyone in under five minutes but could care less about anything but his own interests. We begin Nightcrawler by learning that Louis has been getting by as a thief, stealing and selling to make a living. One night, he happens upon a car crash, where he discovers a camera crew headed straight toward the accident to retrieve footage of the burning car and a severely injured individual. Louis is immediately drawn to this prospect, and after a brief discussion with a video journalist, Louis learns he can sell footage to the news\u2014something he sees could potentially solve his monetary issues. He soon gets a hold of a camcorder and a police radio scanner (through theft, of course) and begins his journey into \"nightcrawling,\" the act of catching the best and most gruesome footage of the nighttime for the local morning news channels. Louis evolves from an amateur to a professional videographer before our eyes, always doing his work with precision and never hesitating to air his sour yet intellectual thoughts. He hires an assistant, Rick, to aid him with navigation and additional camera footage. Louis becomes cocky and highly manipulative as he becomes the best in the business. He commits entirely immoral acts to further his career, and yet, everything he does is so expertly presented that it is impossible to look away. He represents a part of the social scale where dollar signs mean more than friendships and graphic deaths equate the value of television ratings.Nightcrawler is a film that feels as though it should not sit well with audiences, yet reviews have been raving, and with good reason. It is a film that forces one to contemplate the boundaries of morality, social media, and the fine line between sociability and manipulation. Jake Gyllenhaal is transcendental in his role as the keen and sociopathic Louis, who will overstep every boundary and break every law to further his own self-worth. Ultimately, Nightcrawler is a film that stays seeded in your thoughts long after it is over, which has been rare for films to accomplish as of late.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)",

A guy who apparently has no real education, no proper job, yet we never learn why. He has a huge vocabulary though and is a great negotiator. Why he wouldn't further his education we'll never know.He stumbles upon an opportunity to make money, consequently becomes obsessive. That's really all there is to this movie.I have yet to understand what the point is other than obsession can be become dangerous and journalism is sometimes borderline unethical? Yes, I knw that before. So what?3 stars for the acting fo Lou and his assistant.",

The styles are almost one in the same. The fact that both believe so much in what they are doing, that the mere notion of wrongdoing is simply laughable. Also, I believe this movie was probably listed as a drama, but its true deserts would be much more forthcoming as being a black comedy. If you have a twisted sense of humor much like I do then this movie will be a real treat for you. Not to mention that in between the guilty pleasure laughs (that are a plenty throughout this film), the action sequences are filmed with a Bourne-like intensity. I am a writer and often times I get work done while I have a movie playing on my TV. Needless to say, with this movie I did not get a lot of writing accomplished. In a word, this movie is \"FANTASTIC\"!!",

It is amazing how he personified a corporation. The sheer heartlessness of every single on of his actions depict the reality of the numerous corporations around the world. I love how it began with the audience not knowing what was going on. We were left with a blank sheet of paper for us to start jotting down details of who and what Louis Bloom is all about. Halfway through, I still had no idea who he was or why he's chosen his current path. But by the end, you realize that it doesn't matter. All that matters is what you see.The ending leaves you a little dazed and rather awestruck. It is a great movie, and will not be forgotten anytime in the near future.",

            "content": "There's so much of New Hollywood in this picture, and that's no small compliment. Firstly you've got the white male loner who believes he's destined for greatness - Taxi Driver (1976) - who channels his energy into supplying graphic content for the local news station to buck up its ratings - Network (1976), with Rene Russo doing a pretty decent Faye Dunaway from the same film.Nightcrawler takes as it's inspiration the real life Arthur 'weejee' Felig, a Jewish photojournalist whose premeditated talent for arriving at crime scenes often before even the emergency services arrived gave him his nickname (as in Ouija board). Portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, Louis is an intense portrait of wannabe celebrity in a world already drowning in pretenders. His skills are opportunism and a keen lack of morality: the subjects he films are often dead or dying, all the better for the graphic desire for content by Russo's controller of a TV station currently mired in a collective struggle for viewers in a city where death and violence are valid currency. As Louis' keen eye for a headline story garners him both notoriety and success, so does his increasing need for control of his content and a desperate need to belong which echoes Travis Bickle's lone avenger in Taxi Driver. This even extends to manipulating Russo into a would be sexual arrangement to go alongside his increased embellishment into the station's hierarchy. The film's set pieces - and particularly where Louis and his hapless employee (Riz Ahmed) stake out the perpetrators of a previous home invasion that Louis 'broke' - are masterpieces in tension and execution. The moral of the story is that if you want something enough, and you're willing to do anything to get it, then being a sociopath in modern America isn't exactly a career requirement, but it certainly won't harm you in the absence of hard work, dedication and scruples. Louis is a modern day Peeping Tom, but one whose obsession with the image is monetised into a career seemingly going from strength to strength from the closing frames. Nightcrawler may take a moral stance that Louis is neither willing nor capable of adopting, but the cold hard truth is that grabbing somebody's attention in the multichannel media landscape requires neither morals nor accountability. Just a decent camera, a fast car and full access to the emergency service radio bands.",

It gives you a sense of unsettling and tense feel as the film starts introducing us to the main character, Louis Bloom(Jake Gyllenhaal). He is a person who is well educated, appreciated, however, one who is professional acting nice and showing signals of appreciation, as it differs in the inside of himself. He lives an unusual life, a thief who always wonders to find a career to achieve his goals. One day, he comes across some people filming crime scenes as a sale for news footage as for their career, also known as 'nightcrawling'. And so, Louis Bloom involves as a curiosity into this business. As the film progresses, he gets very good and professional at the job, in fact.. he gets way too good at this job as he, himself commits crimes and acts in illegal actions. First off, Jake Gyllenhaal gives his finest role and performance throughout his career. He is absolutely courageous and self-conscious. He is fully engaged with that character, he withdraws himself and becomes fully the character Louis Bloom, which makes us the audience frightening and terrifying as we see him burst his way of performance. Also, it is so frightening how our main character Louis Bloom starts off as a protagonist, and as the film progresses, becomes an unexpected and fearful antagonist. However, so riveting and outstandingly written dialogue makes certain situations so exciting and realistic, adding unsteadiness which makes us sweat in thrills. From these amazingly written dialogues, even though Louis Bloom transforms into an antagonist, we root for him, and we want him to succeed in every possible way, after all, he has committed crimes and taken illegal actions. Additionally, the last act, the last 15 to 20 minutes are the most suspenseful and hand-gripping finales that additionally decorates this film more beautifully. The streets of L.A look immaculately beautiful and flawlessly colored, which contains solid eye candy visuals. Overall, this film depicts the realism of the society as well as illustrating the character, Louis Bloom perfectly flawless. It is most certainly one of the best films of 2014 as well as the best- written script forms of this decade. For writer Dan Gilroy's first directorial debut, it is very impressive and unbelievable of what he accomplished.",

The film starts with him stealing a metal fence and then bargaining a sale to a man who is in charge of a metal scrap yard. Subsequently Lou is obviously turned down after applying for a job at this same yard. Although a weido, Lou is apparently very smart and ready to do anything to succeed. Thanks to his determination, mixed with coincidence, he finds himself at the site of a horrible car accident. There he observes Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) in action, but he is a nightcrawler; monitoring a police monitor at night in order to find newsworthy material, and then selling the photos to the highest bidding news station. Lou becomes very interested in this line of work and gets himself a camera and an assistant, Rick, played by Riz Ahmed, who is extremely convincing as a thick-witted and basically homeless local resident. The first parts of the film feel a little scripty or so to speak, a little bit boxed in a general script. We have the protagonist, who doesn't have much, he steals stuff and sells it to not-just-survive (life doesn't seem to be too hard on him). He isn't successful in his search for employment, but this only makes our man more willing. What makes this film good is how nuts Lou Bloom is. From the start, you know that it will get him into trouble, but still his journey is so unpredictable. Gyllenhaal's performance is amazing as the crazy, unpredictable nightcrawler. Furthermore, the film is also very well written and Gyllenhaal's performance elevates an already good script \u2013 he has some great monologues through-out the entire runtime. After the story has been set up in the parts act, Lou Bloom leads the audience into a thrilling second part, which includes some of the most exciting scenes in a film this year. What makes the film even more interesting character even more life and it is easier to get invested in what ishappening. One of the main drawbacks however, was the soundtrack, there were a few times when I was drawn out of a scene where the music felt very strange, and didn't fit to what was happening at all. Furthermore I would have wanted a little more gore and filth \u2013 I wanted to feel a little bit worse while watching the film. Instead the film takes a turn into the dark comedy section, not that it's a bad thing, I just feel that it could have been more disturbing. I don't know news stations' method of work but I highly doubt that they would accept all the footage Lou Bloom offers them and air it. That however, totally worked in this film, just as most other parts of it. Nightcrawler is highly entertaining and thrilling but if it had direction from someone like, for example, Nicolas Winding Refn and score done by someone like, for example, Trent Reznor it could have been an exceptional film. I certainly recommend this one to everyone \u2013 8/10",

First film I see in which he is the protagonist and I can't wait for more!\nAs for the film itself, I thought that the script was simple but very good. A film with relatively few characters which made it simple to watch, making it no less interesting for that reason. On the contrary, it is extremely well done, especially considering that it was the first film produced and written by this director.\nSumming up and concluding, FANTASTIC FILM!",

            "content": "This is an incredibly involving piece of cinema, following a very driven and ruthless character as he realises his ambitions and follows the American dream. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, an opportunistic thief who drives around at night stealing copper and metals. He is desperately seeking a route to success and after seeing a camera crew capture a few minutes of film and earn $500, he is determined to pursue this as a career. Lou Bloom is a complex and very intriguing character, though in the grand hall of fame of these sociopathic loner characters, Lou's is possible one of the least plausible. He is frightening though and carries the pace and intensity of the film with the bulbous glare of his eyes and his unhinged but smug and calm smile. Sometimes it is difficult to look at the screen as he delivers his ice cold monologues staring into the camera burning through the eyes of whoever he is talking to. The problem with the character though is that he has been constructed for effect, rather than fleshed out and developed. Lou doesn't descend into immorality he simply has a strong work ethic, a knack for research and an unstoppable determination, which allows him to be immediately successful in this field. His lack of ethics and ambition then catapult him to the top of his game. There is however, no explanation as to his drive, no hint about his background and no real insight into his motivation. The closest comparison in terms of this type of sociopathic character is Daniel Plainview in There Will be Blood, but Daniel Day Lewis' character is far more nuanced, with a level of detail and believability that Nightcrawler lacks. As a result Lou Bloom is an excellent villain but falls short of being anything more than that. All in all a very well made thriller though. Supreme acting all round, original premise and great score. Nightcrawler has incredible pace and is as disturbing and frightening as it intended to be.",

While there is violence and gore, what is refreshing is none of it feels the least bit gratuitous. Nor is it the ultimate creep factor. Mr. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is actually what kept me, literally, on the edge of my seat. Was Jake Gyllenhaal in every scene or did it just feel that way? His character is a monster\u2014the kind of mad fiend who succeeds in today's society.There are many implausibilities, things glossed over, and holes in plot and development. However, the premise and underlying tone, as delivered by Jake Gyllenhaal and his supportive cast, never falters or fails to stay glued to its sick and twisted point. Sadly, dark sardonic comedy is such a lost art in cinema that I found myself to be the only one laughing in the theater on a Saturday night.Look for Mr. Gyllenhaal to excel in lesser awards shows for this performance. The academy could nominate\u2014it's the right release date to be taken seriously. But he will not get Oscar. Not for his lack, but the director is just too green filling out all the little things that would have raised up \"Nightcrawler\" from my-goodness to Greatness. No offense to Mr. Gilroy.

            "review_title": "Worth a look given Jake Gyllenhaal's mesmerizingly creepy performance and Gilroy's tightly rendered story",
            "content": "One of the trademarks of a smart film is that the audience doesn't know that it's being smart. Or at least they don't realize it at the time. Dan Gilroy's LA crime dramedy Nightcrawler isn't necessarily the \"smartest\" film of the year, but Jake Gyllenhaal's mesmerizingly creepy performance and Gilroy's tightly rendered story make succumbing to a convenient myopia about Nightcrawler an easy pitfall. That it is about an ambitious sociopath's descent into and subsequent rise through the reprehensibly bloodthirsty cesspool that is the nightly TV news industry is obvious from the trailer. But to the filmmaker's credit and the audience's benefit, Nightcrawler has a bit more than that going on beneath the surface.Filmed across dozens of LA's shadiest street corners, the movie follows a young smooth talker named Lou Bloom (Gyllenhaal) as he discovers a passion for capturing local tragedies on camera and selling the footage to crime-obsessed TV news studios. At first, he's just one of a cadre of nocturnal freelance photographers looking to profit off of the city's nightly carjackings and homicides, but gradually Lou develops a knack for the job to the point where Nina, a local network's news boss (Renee Russo), starts crafting the daily broadcast around Lou's consistently shocking videos. With the specter of ratings season looming just a few weeks away, Nina's desperation grows and her dependence on Lou's material puts her in precarious positions. When Lou's competition finally catches up to him (embodied by a husky Bill Paxton) and his comparative advantage in being the first guy on the scene dwindles, Lou deems it necessary to create the stories on his own, both to realize his dream of growing a successful business and to maintain his chilling influence over Nina. Journalistic integrity and ethical questions get raised\u2014although only by one of Nina's peers (played by Kevin Rahm)\u2014and the cops suspect Lou has more information about an especially savage crime than the footage he sold to Nina. The story crescendos as Lou sets a plan in motion to capture his most astonishing\u2014and dangerous\u2014video yet that blurs the lines between documentarist and subject while revealing Lou's true colors in the process. Nightcrawler's release this past weekend was aptly timed, what with the recent backlash against mainstream media's sensationalist fear mongering over cases of Ebola in the United States. To a lesser\u2014but still relevant\u2014extent, Nightcrawler's themes of privacy invasion and the bastardization of an individual's sense of self at their most vulnerable moment conjures the similarly complicated sentiments that tend to accompany celebrity nude photo hacking scandals. No matter where a shooting/structure fire/car crash occurs in the film, Lou Bloom's camera manages to find its way right in front of the victim's face like an ominous proboscis. He enters homes, films emergency surgeries and manipulates crime scenes before the cops arrive, all without the faintest sign of remorse. The resentment audiences will feel towards Lou and his behaviour is part of Gilroy's intent, and probably tells us something about his worldview regarding a currently developing culture of the anonymous public exploitation of other people's private lives, seemingly with impunity. The manner in which Gilroy chose to tell his story is as compelling as the message he tried to convey. Sharp, deliberately manufactured dialogue highlights one of the year's stronger scripts that succeeds in both weaving a fascinating high-stakes narrative and piquing an unsettling interest in a character that resonates with the audience until the final shot of the film. Aside from a couple of alienating scenes that take you out of the movie, Nightcrawler preserves momentum even when we're just watching Gyllenhaal and his homeless employee (Riz Ahmed) monitor a police scanner in Lou's gas guzzler. No doubt, the film lives and dies on Gyllenhaal's portrayal of a recession- battered millennial poster boy looking for his calling in life. In interviews, Gyllenhaal has likened his character to a coyote, the unofficial SoCal mascot. The comparison comes through in the film, where Lou is scrappy, hungry, often unaccompanied, and a survivor (the actor's physical transformation into a slender sunken- eyed creep amplifies the metaphor). Scene after scene for nearly the movie's entire running time Gyllenhaal doesn't so much add depth to his character as much as methodically peel back the curtain to reveal what we already know to be true about the archetype he represents. Lou is self-interested, obsessive, lacking in empathy, and\u2014above all\u2014overtly charismatic. Most of his lines read like mantras pulled right out of Seven Habits of Highly Successful People, as if the self-educated loner had found it necessary to conduct extensive research on how to fit in with normal people (think if Patrick Bateman attended the University of Phoenix). It would appear Lou is so used to being alone that every interaction has degraded into a business relationship: people are assets to be used and negotiated with, while work, friendship, sex and everything in between have become points about which to be negotiated. When it's all said and done, Gyllenhaal's nightcrawler isn't all that different of a person from the enterprising novice we see in the very first frame. If anything, it's more likely that Gilroy and Gyllenhaal (who also co-produced the film) wanted to use Lou as a sort of stress test for evaluating the ratings driven TV news business where sensitivity, compassion and discretion are career limiting attributes. The film's core narrative then becomes how far a soulless alien like Lou can go without anyone stopping him or calling for reason. For some, Lou will be too one-dimensional and lack the almost always unnecessary complexity audiences have come to expect from the typical cinematic sociopath. On the other hand, Gyllenhaal's subdued quasi-realistic depiction of an antisocial charmer with relatable motives is much more terrifying of a concept. No mommy issues, no master plans. Lou is just a morally flexible opportunist who happens to excel at exploiting the fear and suffering of others. The disturbing part is that he's finally found somewhere he fits in.",

Surely a shining example to thirty-somethings everywhere. Unfortunately, Lou is also a sociopath and Scary As Proverbial.Lou's the central character in NIGHTCRAWLER, a brilliant, tonally pitch black exploration of How To Succeed In Business Without Really Caring. Bloom runs a small independent news team, cruising late night Los Angeles whilst trawling his police radio scanner. To win in this game, you have to be the first camera on a crime scene. Get the footage - as bloody as possible. \"If it bleeds, it leads.\" notes one of his competitors and he's not wrong. The local TV companies will pay handsomely for grade-A footage. And Bloom will do whatever's necessary to get the exclusive and the sale.Jake Gyllenhaal has turned in solid acting work for years but this is something else - a \"sit up and take notice\" situation. Trust me, this is a performance that demands your - and Oscar's - attention. Gyllenhaal is mesmerising as Lou Bloom, whether it be inducting wary new employee Riz Ahmed or relentlessly coming on to tough newsroom boss Rene Russo. In lesser hands, Bloom could easily have been a joke - a stereotype psycho, cranked up to 11. Not here. Gyllenhaal brings the crazy when necessary but delivers it with laser focus and burning intensity. You don't laugh at Lou Bloom. You daren't.Writer Dan Gilroy doubles up as first-time director on this film and makes an auspicious debut. He paints Los Angeles with neon colours on a black nighttime canvas - a nod to the imagery of THIEF and DRIVE. Two set-pieces stand out - firstly, a tense sequence when Bloom manages to beat even the cops to a multiple homicide. He hurtles around the victims, shooting as much footage as he can before the police black-and-whites arrive at the murder scene. There's also a good old-fashioned car chase in the third act, a refreshing change after the recent CGI-enhanced stunts of the FAST & THE FURIOUS movies.NIGHTCRAWLER's uncompromisingly dark and cynical heart may be too much for voters come Oscar time. No matter - this will surely end up as one of 2014's best movies.",

That is, until he becomes all too comfortable, and the monster starts to unravel beneath the smog-filled night sky.This is a bleak, shadow drenched affair, bringing us front and center to what is, to my knowledge, a not often catalogued aspect of the TV news circuit: the man behind the camera. The ones who watch.This film brings us to the doorstep of an ill-adjusted man, seemingly haunted by a deep nothingness in his core. He stumbles upon a new path which empowers him to a terrible degree, enabling him to bend (and later, break) those around him according to his will, through casual cruelties, subtle manipulations, and whisper-quiet violence.Nightcrawler mostly excels as a commentary on our collective addiction to voyeurism, how we consume the televised tragedies of others without a second thought. Our main character, Lou, is birthed from this notion, among others, a weird creature scraped from the walls of a darkened television studio, nourished with late night news binges and TV dinners, with a heart wrapped in the hollow laughter of a worn out talk show host, and with eyes filled with the cold light of a dead channel. Sickly, empty, and dangerous. He is effectively unnerving, and Nightcrawler, as a whole, is wonderfully unnerving in a way that makes it hard to look away.Overall, this is a well-crafted thriller, with lovely cinematography and a fantastic lead performance, paired with a script that knows when and where to strike, shadowboxing with our expectations, with the final punch landing on a satisfying (yet understandably worrisome) conclusion.This is a film that skillfully presents a particular mood, and with this, it shines, all the way through its deviance and darkness. There is nothing revelatory here, but the craftsmanship on display is second to none, making it absolutely worth your while. Skip the trailers - watch the film.",

And that's the interesting Jake Gyllenhaal fit this role so good that you can't even take eye off the screen in waiting of his next psycho move or idea.That's probably the best role of Gyllenhaalhe is utterly disturbing at one point, hilarious at another, and horrifying at others.You can see that he was work hard for that role and give his best and i think that made the movie so good to watching the performance of one single actor make this movie soo good .",

It is a shame that the Academy did not select him as one of who deserve the Oscar.",

Jake Gyllenhaal made sure that the character looks witty, sharp and scary at the same time. He just delivers an outstanding performance with his head held high. Not only that, the director Dan Gilroy gives a superb thriller and you feel attached to it at each moment. He has unfolded some hard hitting realities of the news television and how they are becoming more of a finance industry then being just a reporting news channel. He clearly shows how ethics of the news channels have changed and how are they affected more by the viewer ship rather than the truth. We all love theatricality and we only listen to something if it is sold well. The NIGHTCRAWLER is just that kind of movie which hooks you from start and you want to see more of it.

He is awkward enough to inspire pity, smart enough to impress, and evil enough to repulse. The film takes a brave dive into the behind-the-scenes drama of modern TV News that should make an impression on audiences as to never watch the their local news the same way again. Many who watch this will be disappointed about the end of the movie, as typical stories usually tell us that \"everything will work out in the end,\" but \"Nightcrawler\" hits audiences with reality and is extremely unapologetic about it.Dan Gilroy's directing debut is sure to impress. The movie wastes no time on background, or subplots, but instead thrusts viewers directly into a story that moves downhill quickly. The low-budget special effects and makeup are also equally impressive, serving as a breath of fresh air for viewers tired of their screens being filled with a mess of nearly incomprehensible CGI effects.

The rest of the cast is also great from the surprisingly awesome Rene Russo as news reporter, that does eveyting for money, to Riz Ahmed as Rick . The cinematography is beautiful and the color-palette makes the night one of the most visually sleek scenarios you get. The characters are also great and are well-developed.

The showdown with the cops in the end was rushed an anticlimactic. If they had extended that scene a bit to really show how manipulative and clever he is (like how he completely got away with attempted manslaughter earlier?

            "review_title": "The (Anti) Hero's Journey",
            "content": "Nightcrawler is a gloriously dark journey through night-time Los Angeles, where Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is making a name for himself as a \"stringer\" - a freelance journalist who captures graphic footage of crime scenes, turning a profit by selling it to TV stations. Unlike many journalist protagonists who came before him, Lou doesn't endeavour to walk a tightrope between legitimate reporting and exploitative intrusion; instead, he shamelessly scavenges for the most provocative - and therefore most profitable - material, going so far as to engineer crime scenes to create the grisliest effect. Lou's manipulation of the world around him is not limited to the crimes he stages; rather, it extends to all aspects of his life, which he is able to manipulate to his advantage. Nightcrawler is a fantastic film because it delights in Lou's capacity to make his desires manifest, and depicts his tenacity and nerve with humour. It succeeds because it never defers to its audience with obligatory scenes, such as explaining away Lou's behaviour or doling out the justice that many audience members yearn for.Nightcrawler attests to the power of cinematography to support characterisation and sub-text. A wide-angle lens is paired with shallow depth of field throughout the film, often rendering everything on screen out of focus except for Lou. This serves to reflect Lou's worldview, in which he is the only thing that matters. Lou's isolation from other people is reflected in the framing of shots, which frequently position him on his own rather than in over-the-shoulder or two-shots which would signify intimacy with other characters. Even when sharing the frame with another person, long shots are employed to suggest distance. As a result, Lou's aloneness in the world is palpable, his separation from society conveyed through visual techniques.I found the scenes where Lou is capturing footage on his camera to be the most visually interesting. While the crime scenes and dead bodies that comprise Lou's subject matter are presented as blurry and out of focus through the film's lens, we can simultaneously see the images depicted with clarity through the viewfinder in Lou's camera. This demonstrates how Lou's interest in reality and the world around him is contingent on its purpose within the media, and ultimately his own success.Nightcrawler could not have succeeded without Jake Gyllenhaal's fantastic portrayal of the voracious Louis Bloom. It was satisfying to watch Gyllenhaal cast against his usual type of wide-eyed ingenu here. His expressive eyes, usually employed to fawn over women in romantic comedies, are disturbingly repurposed in Nightcrawler to express his fascination with the suffering of others, and how it will serve his lofty ambitions. Gyllenhaal simultaneously conveys emotional detachment towards the world around him and emotional intensity towards that which is incidental to his success.A reading of other reviews regarding Nightcrawler suggests there is a multitude of ways of reading this film. Some view the film as a commentary on the exploitative nature of the media, which capitalises on selling human suffering as entertainment. This perspective condemns the media for motivating behaviour such as Lou's. This is a weak argument, given that Lou's deviant behaviour is evident before he is rewarded for it. The media didn't create Lou, it is merely a convenient platform for him.Nightcrawler has also been interpreted as a satire of millennial entitlement and the cultural adage that one can achieve anything as long as they try hard enough. Lou references the importance of hard work throughout the film, and even states \"I was raised with the self-esteem movement so popular in schools\". Further, Lou projects an exaggerated image of himself and his company (Video Production News) in a manner not dissimilar to the embellished social identities projected by millennials on social media platforms. The marketing campaign for Nightcrawler played on this concept by setting up Twitter and LinkedIn profiles for Louis Bloom, as well as posting a video resume on YouTube, thereby reflecting the bootstrapping ideology of millennial culture.\nI take issue with the above interpretations, as they suggest that the film is condemning Lou's behaviour. In watching Nightcrawler it is clear that the film delights in Lou's tenacity and nerve, revelling in the absurdity of his behaviour. Thus, I prefer to read the film as a comment on embracing one's true nature rather than conforming to the social norm. The journey of Nightcrawler sees Lou progress from attempting to fit into a traditional lifestyle at the beginning - where he attempts to get an unpaid internship during the daytime - to accepting that he is at his best when separated from societal expectations. Lou discovers the world of stringer journalism, where his natural inclinations are rewarded. As a result, Lou is more powerful and more authentic when he exits the film than when he enters it. As such, Nightcrawler is ultimately a film about coming into your own and finding a path to expressing your true nature. It is about the triumph of authenticity over conformity, the triumph of the individual over society.",

We have Lou, a newly self-employed camera man with a cheap camera and police scanner , who consistently is pushing the limits to get first-hand photos of crime scenes. The whole movie you are waiting to see if he has any kind of conscious and if there is a line he wouldn't cross. The whole movie Lou is working against other people to get to the scene before they do, so he can get the first shot. Watching it you're wondering, if this about his dedication to his job or is this becoming a sick obsession? *POTENTIAL SPOILER* An example of this \"obsession\" is that at one point in the movie,, he managed to have another photographer and his crew to be killed so he could be the \"top dog\" and to eliminate his competition. Another example is when he witnesses men kill a family and instead of calling 911, he goes into the house and takes the first pictures of the dead bodies. This movie has a mixture of a Gothic and noir feel. It is dark, unsettling, and just plain scary. A lot of the movie takes place at night, when the crimes occur so there isn't a great deal of lighting.

There's no background information to warrant his behavior. And why he walks out of the police station near the end, without his computer and cameras being confiscated is simply silly. If the police suspects you of murder, I think they would at least investigate properly. You are left with a film that only superficially portrays a deeply troubled man, but there's no attempt at proper character development that would engage the audience in the tragic fate of this man. He ends up being a successful entrepreneur in his vulgar field and the audience is left with a film that is mildly suspenseful, and heavily disrespectful of proper filmmaking - not to mention the dignity of human existence.",

            "content": "Like with many films now days I keep finding myself getting more excited and enthralled by the actual trailer. Saying that, this dramatic horrifying thriller did provide an entertaining level 7 out of 10 for viewing pleasure. It touched me personally and deeply like most films do with seeing how someone shows such enthusiasm while pursuing some form of employment only to keep getting his soul destroyed. The main character in this film was both likable and unlikeable at the same time presenting us with a sociopath personality. What struck me most was how Jack Gyllenhaal was visually presented to look unkempt, wild, greasy and hungry for success. The film reminded me very much of the End of Watch film also starring Jack Gyllenhaal due to it exploring a more raw realistic perspective of urban life and crime. The way in which this film is presented visually seems the cross between found footage and the more traditional method of filming which works much better than relaying on pure shaky amateur cam that often irritates me the viewer. Saying that I didn't like the way the film was visually filtered and would have liked to have watched a more saturated colour scheme. Something about it all seemed very 90's and washed out, something about it visually felt off. I also had a feeling that the director or others in the film crew wanted to make this film slight Gand Theft Auto in how certain scenes really did feel like the game which for me was a good thing without drifting off into why and reviewing GTA alongside this film. Rene Russo looked sexy, beautiful and curvy in this film and I so wanted to see more of the seedy adult like romance exposed. I think the whole sexual tension thing disappeared to quickly. That added taste to the mix would have made this more dramatic and titillating allowing for a more voyeuristic experience. I did enjoy seeing Rene's character being put in a position of looking exploited and vulnerable. Being myself interested in videography and photography, I loved it how it shows that its never about expensive equipment, but having that artistic eye and desire to delve into places often taboo and unacceptable by today's social standards. I loved how it presented an artist so willing to break certain rules of decency alongside taste. The way in which Louis crosses the line to get footage thats daring gets its audience to ask what it is we have to do in order to succeed in life in all aspects of the media and journalism. After all of that the film for me was something I would only watch every so many years if it just happened to be on view on some boring non eventual day which for me would most probably be a Sunday evening or night. If it had been made in the 1970's for me it would possibly have had more appeal. Even the name Nightcrawler seems very 70's. Overall a 7/10 based on entertainment valueCinematography 6.5 out of 10 Acting 8.5/9 out of 10 Story 7 out of 10, could have been deeper and more revealing",

            "content": "Nightcrawler, is a metaphor for Americas ever increasing need for social media. Jake Gyllenhall plays an out of work, loner named Lou Bloom. The first scene Lou is stealing scrap metal, when a security guard walks up on him. Showing the type of character Lou is, he beats up the older man and steals his wrist watch. Upon completion of a night of roaming the streets, Lou stumbles on a car crash. Where he notices a freelance cameraman gathering what footage he can to sell to the local news. \u200bInspired, Lou quickly swipes a bike to pawn for a police scanner and cheap camcorder. His first shaky, yet gruesome footage of a car-jacking is just what a late-night news producer, Nina, is looking for. She encourages Lou to come to her first with any news worthy footage that he might have. \u200bLou quickly gets addicted to the rush of being one of the first to see the gore of these horrible crime scenes. His business grows and so does his production. He adds new equipment, a new car, and an assistant. His personality comes out more with every event. When he arrives first to a car wreck, he stages the scene by moving a dead body, to appear more news worthy. It gradually shows his true sociopath of a character. \u200bHe is completely bare of any human emotion, when he watches his assistant die in front of him. He offers him no assistance but films the last moments of his young life. He then pulls the camera away from his lifeless body and quietly leaves the scene. \u200bThe film ends with Lou being questioned by the police, leaving the viewer wondering if Lou will go down for being a part of the real life, everyday drama.",

Cinematography was a visual delight.. The Performance by Gyllenhaal is so effective you feel as if it's someone you passed on the street and, or had a casual conversation with, saying to yourself that was weird ..Wonder what that person does for a living , how do they live ? Rene Russo does a great job.. made a bit difficult by the scenes with Gyllenhall ..He is so captivating; you lose sight of Russo.. When not paired with Mr. Gyllenhaal , she is excellent. Film stayed with me for weeks .. Only issue I had was the ending ..Think it could have been different.. wasn't bad just seemed a bit commercial ?",

            "content": "Jake Gyllenhaal is simply astounding, his performance in 'Nightcrawler' is one of the best performances by an actor I have ever scene he truly knocks this out of the park. The acting by every other character in this film is great but they are all completely overshadowed by the beauty of Gyllenhall's performance as Louis Bloom, a sociopath who films injuries, accidents and criminal events for the news. Set in La, which is an excellent setting for this film perfectly portrayed by the vision and direction of Dan Gilroy. This film is excellent at telling a story and it does this without relying solely on an end goal and the characters journey towards that which I thoroughly enjoyed seeing a great 'plotless' film, but. Towards the end the film became crime story. For me, this became a hindrance to the overall quality of the film it almost feels as if they ran out of ideas and turned it into an action movie. Here is where the similarities between \"Baby Driver\" come to fruition. Baby driver is another film similar to nightcrawler in the sense that it is a story about a characters life relying on acting, writing and direction to turn it into masterpiece this is true for both films for around 75% of the watch time. Until to watch the end of the films where it turns into a needless and sloppy action movie where where what was required instead was simply the characters and the relationship between them and the audience throughout the rest of the film whereas the ending for both of these films put a damper on on the the overall enjoyment to the film creating a sense of disengagement between the rest of the story and the ending both of these films which I loved but cannot appreciate it to the best it could have been as it is almost as if the filmmaking team threw the easiest way out of the story on at the end and hope that would be alright unfortunately this is not true for both in nightcrawler however, you'll see more of Louis' character and how he will do what is required for his own personal gain which does increase the character development of Louis and show is true nature right there for the audience to see. Overall I believe that this is an excellent film and would recommend to all.",

To Lou as to Gordon, greed is good, and self-interest as a way of life is not one of many options but is in fact the only reality.In many ways, he is an even more damning indictment of the worship of Mammon than Gekko ever was.For as the Coens and Bardem did with Anton Chigurh, (See No Country for Old Men, 2007) in Lou Bloom, Director Dan Gilroy and Gyllenhaal succeed in making the character not merely grotesque, terrifying... and believable, but also in making him a nearly supernatural personification of something more intangible.If Chigurh could be viewed as the heartless spirit of deterministic fate and our inevitable deaths, Bloom is the heartless spirit of our darker nature; our lust for petty monetary gain, pointless material items and useless power and dominance over other creatures. He is the personification of self-interest at the expense of all else; the personification of capitalism itself.He also has disturbing hair and a sallow complexion, as Chigurh does. But I digress.The movie is impeccably shot, paced, plotted and performed by all concerned. I find no flaw in it.Take heed: each and every time you put your own baser interests before all else, you take another step- a step that cannot be retraced, no matter how small it is- on the road to becoming Lou Bloom; a soulless, worthless husk of a human being.If this excellent movie has a message, that is surely it.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler, aka 'in TV news if it bleeds it leads' all takes place in a beautifully photographed nighttime Southern California, from Venice Beach to the Valley to the hills, much of it in a car navigating familiar street names with a map app. Jake Gylenhaal is an anonymous monster from \"somewhere in the north end of the Valley,\" chasing crimes and crashes in the city and surrounding. It is all LA, all the way.And much of it is wonderful. Gylenhaal plays a video news freelance monster who is except for his Valley ref, completely without provenance or background or any emotional structure or reactions at all, a personality that works well in his spooky skill at non-zero sum bargaining. Every scene contains him haggling, he bargains with every single other character, from the news director (Rene Russo, great) to whom he peddles his videos, to the dim assistant he ruthlessly exploits, to a competing video peddler, to cops. Always with the same grim half-smile pokerface, as he moves from nowhere toward his new ambition: an LA news king and seems likely to achieve it.It's so well paced and drives so fast and so unpredictably that three quarters of the way through you seem to be watching a great movie. But then, unfortunately, the film refuses or fails to get through the Gylenhaal's character armor, and we leave him exactly as we found him - and it needs more.The problem may be that we're in the wrong genre. Gyllenhaal's Lou Bloom would be an absolutely perfect Marvel comic movie character, a villain perhaps like the Joker; or maybe, with a little adjustment of the Rene Russo character, a kind of demon Clark Kent. As it is, the creepiness that begins chilling becomes irritating, a bell that won't stop ringing; you don't just dislike Bloom, you wind up disliking the movie, despite its great execution.",

Gyllenhall delivers another in a series of stand-out performances as one of the creepiest and most unnerving characters I have seen in a film. The cinematography was well done, but nothing too noteworthy, and James Newton Howard's score (one of my favourite composers) was rather unnoticeable. That said, the story and the performance (along with a few seat-gripping moments) are enough for me to recommend this movie to you, and hopefully the ending will leave you as shocked as it left me.",

What a world we live in and what kinds of people nighttime in a big city breeds. Riz Ahmed, as his partner in crime and Rene Russo as a TV producer are perfect collaborators. The director, however, should have ended the movie about 30 seconds earlier with Gyllenhaal hearing the parked police car radio broadcasting about a horrific crime scene and him speeding off in his car yet again in a perpetual race to be first.

I walked in expecting a neo-noir, dark, gritty film, with characters that were layered, but it lived up to none of those traits.Firstly, think the whole \"hard-core-capitalist-; loyal-to-my-job\" bit was severely overplayed. We get it. People get weirdly obsessed with work and jobs that are extremely unrewarding. It's not that deep. The writer must've expected it to play out as some amazing social commentary, but it really just seemed overused and stale.Secondly, if the aim was to sell it as brilliant 'satire' it severely missed the mark. The actors were extremely out of place, and the casting could have been different. Gyllenhaal's over-the-top charm just looked out of place and the sociopathic, oh-so-sinister bit really did not fit him well; he just looked kind of- stupid??(Also- was it just me or was Riz Ahmed just there for brownie points?) You could tell that the actors did not find their characters believable and looked out of place.Maybe if it were marketed as an action film and the story was told in a non-linear way then it would have been a lot more digestible - and actually enjoyable. Lastly, there's a lot of things that can make a film worth watching, even if the story misses the mark. It could be the atmosphere, cinematography, score, the build-up of tension, or as everyone kept suggesting this film to be - its thrill value. It was extremely lukewarm in all of those categories, and I just couldn't help myself but ask every ten minutes whether we were at the good part of the movie yet?",

The things I am about to point out, for me, really killed the previously mentioned message they were trying to send. Disclaimer: the very things I am about to discuss could be argued as what makes the movie great. But not for me. Matter of perspective. Extra warning, *SPOILERS AHEAD*The build is slow. So slow. Right off the bat we are introduced to Louis as a criminal. A lot of reviews are mistakenly calling him the protagonist. No, he's clearly the antagonist, he just so happens to be the main character. We never get to understand his motives so throughout the movie I found myself asking \"Why is he doing this?\" Even more, I started asking \"Why is he getting everything he wants?\"The score annoyed me. It's this guitar riff that sounds like it should be used at some peak inspirational and motivational moment. Instead, it is played when Louis is doing the most corrupt things. The music swells so much it is distracting.Eventually, Gyllenhall's performance of Louis starts to feel flat. This may have been done on purpose. Louis is so methodical but he uses the same exact tactics every time. Since Louis never switches things up it becomes unbelievable that the people around him would continue to fall for his tricks every single time. This especially applies to Nina (Rene Russo). Speaking of Nina, it is not believable that any News Director or news broadcast would choose to air footage so graphic (the home invasion) for so long.Here's when the movie completely looses it. Why wouldn't the home invasion suspect shoot Louis like he shot Rich? Both were filming. Then, proceed to walk past Louis to shoot at the cops. So he clearly had bullets left. It literally made no sense.Out of chronological order, but next on the level of what bothered me the most. He gets a fleet of vans and employees. No filing to become an LLC, no getting and EIC number, nothing that goes into being an actual business. Just suddenly has a fleet of vans.FINALLY, the most annoying, he just walks out of the police station at the end? Come on now! He's a suspect to obstruction of justice and accessory to murder. Why wouldn't they get a warrant on his computers and equipment? By the climax of this movie I was hoping that Louis would be killed. Instead, this character suffers absolutely no consequences. NONE! THAT is what killed this movie for me.I give it a 7 for the way it was shot. And because it lingers with you, which means the character was executed correctly. That's what a director would want. Also, it's not the worst movie. It's not the best either.",

Just not of the caliber I was expecting. Don't go into this movie expecting a graphic, realistic look at the criminal underground is my advice to you. The best thing this movie has to offer is the acting and while it does have some good storytelling/writing aspects don't expect too much from this film.

            "content": "The character of Louis Bloom in the 2014 film Nightcrawler, played impeccably well by Jake Gyllenhaal, lives in a world not unlike the real world we live in. Lou belongs to a generation of hardworking people who have made up their mind to find a career that they can learn and grow into, they're hard workers and they set high goals. Having been raised with self-esteem movement in schools that used to make them expect their needs to be considered,they know that today's work culture cannot cater to the job loyalty that could be promised in earlier generations, instead they know that they need to work their asses off and people who reach the... top of the mountain didn't just fall there by chance.^ In fact, everything after the first sentence is precisely something that's coldly uttered by Gyllenhaal's Lou with a stolid face every chance he gets to impress anyone who can employ him. His character starts to take actions that become more and more sociopathic and later border on psychopathy. And let's be honest here. Lou exists in a world not unlike ours, a world which celebrates people like him or the things he does, seen as positive traits. \"Go-getters\" that are persistent, hell bent on climbing the proverbial ladder. This is a gem of a film that will always always be an amazing piece of cinema for me.The film never feels rushed or slow, thanks to the way the story is written, with Jake Gyllanhaal's Lou and Riz Ahmed's Rick finding themselves in increasingly precarious and dangerous situations as the story proceeds. All stellar performances here. Also. this is actually the first film of Riz Ahmed that I'd seen, and it made me want to keep an eye on everything he appears in from that point on. And for me personally, this is actually one of the most important films ever made. It's also the kind of film I can rewatch and still enjoy as much as I did on the first watch, or perhaps even more.",

However, for me this movie doesn't make any sense on the beginning. How come a smart man like Lou need to be desperate for finding a job and must ended with that profession. At first, I'm thinking maybe because this was based on a true story. I know, at the ending finally he's got some little respect with successful career plot, but still, the earlier scene did not enough for me. Overall this movie is pretty dark, but I feel the story didn't explore deep enough into that direction. With such a sharp character like Lou, I was expecting more psychotic intense climax or a Hannibal thriller experience, what we still missed in the 2010s, Like in the middle of movies, my prediction was Lou would finally make himself a murderer to create a cinematic crime scene, instead a flat boring ending.",

Unfortunately it wasn't to be.I really enjoyed this film right up until the end. Gyllenhaal's character was disturbingly likable. He wasn't a nice guy at all really and it's no surprise that he was a loner, but I couldn't help but like him and find him quite funny. That really sets the tone for the film. It's a bit dark but quite humorous at the same time.It had some good tension and I was looking forward to seeing how each of the branching sub plots would pan out. In the end though it seemed like the directors didn't know what to do with all the sub plots or how to tie it all up so they just decided to end the film without a real conclusion. I wanted more, I wanted to see what happened next, then it just ended. I turned to my girlfriend and my exact words were; \"Seriously, they're going to end it there!\" and she agreed.I'd still say that it's a good film and it hovers around 6.5 or 7 out of 10. If only it was around 15-20 minutes longer and had a proper conclusion, then I'd be saying 8 or 8.5 out of 10.

The manner in which the story unfolds, the way it portray's the night's walks of life and the way it depicts media as the vulture's in the wreckage is all tied in brilliantly to the minutes and hours we spend following and observing Bloom. It has been created in such a way that you feel guilty or even panicked as you watch and do nothing...Nightcrawler is one of those films that'll leave you thinking and questioning your own morality and that's a good thing.

            "content": "Yes Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job of playing the sociopath thief turned morbid local TV nightcrawler Louis Bloom, but the movie also shows how things haven't changed as much as we think they have over the last two or three decades.Not only does the movie highlight that people still watch and rely on an \"old medium\" (local TV news), it also shows that despite having the world at your fingertips on your phone or computer, you still need someone to go out there and get, or sometimes in Lou's case - make, the content.You rarely see much of the modern technology we're accustomed to in the movie. Lou doesn't get the latest and greatest gadgets, and even at one point shuns them when offered. He doesn't need them, as he's found his calling. To be as good as he is, you have to lack what others have: a moral conscience.The excellent retro 80's inspired soundtrack from James Newton Howard makes heavy use of distorted reverb guitar and synth, which continues to blur the lines between decades.The story itself is one that borrows from stories we've seen. Louis Bloom is a sociopath similar to Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. While he knows what sounds good, and even what people want to hear, he has a hard time initially convincing people to do his bidding.Nina(Rene Russo) is the cutthroat TV producer(ala Faye Dunaway's Diana Christensen), who herself is likely fighting for her own internal relevancy as she ages, as well as that of the TV station she runs. Her willingness to push boundaries and manipulate news to succeed handily parallels Louis' motivations. The two have more in common at the end of the film than differences, even if the romance between the two is a forced farce.Overall the movie keeps things fresh enough and moves the story along without getting stale. While we've yet to see quite the levels of extremes on a regular basis that Nightcrawler presents, perhaps this stylized pseudo-retro-modern look at local TV news is really foreshadowing what's to come.",

And this is really the strength of this movie: literally ALL of the actors and actresses in this movie deliver powerful award-winning performances, that really makes you go like 'WOW!'. A special kudos to Jake Gyllenhaal who deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of a psychopath, he has really proved himself to be a fine artist of our time. Another really good thing about this movie is that it - besides containing an important message for our society - provides the viewers with food for thought without making any clear judgements. This movie really makes you THINK, but at the same time keeps you entertained and surprised. On a side note, this movie also contains good visual effects, with the car racing scene being really good.

Gyllenhaal's performance is flawless and terrifying. His benign demeanor is a perfect foil for the madness he hides inside. The rest of the casting was exceptional as well with Rene Russo as a veteran news producer whose moral compass was completely spun out. And Gyllenhaal's hapless partner Rick is just a kid trying to survive and gets drawn into something he never expected. All in all, a great film.

Later he sees the footage on TV, realizing he may be able to do this too. Thus begins Bloom's adventure in building a \"succesful TV news business.\" Why does this movie slay? Because every line bites with irony and wit. It blends genres and themes. It asks questions and prods the viewer to look inward and reflect as producers and consumers. To what extent, if any, is the audience responsible for actors like Bloom working in a capitalist economy. What accountability can be placed on the viewer who demands, values, and consumes the product Bloom delivers? Does the viewer have any interest in curbing that demand or consumption? Should Bloom's actions be regulated, restricted, or shamed? Maybe they should be praised and celebrated?Answers to these questions fall in a gray area. And the movie does well to stimulate introspection and discussion by focusing on difficult questions instead of leading the viewer to form knee-jerk judgments and conclusions. Although the story brings out Bloom's sociopathic qualities, where the storytellers stand on preventing people like Bloom from thriving is not clear. Maybe a solution would include more protections, regulations, emphasis on family values, better law enforcement, consumer restrictions, censoring or limiting the media. Maybe Bloom is just a necessary evil that we should accept, a byproduct of the human condition, industry, and capitalism. Who knows...",

It seems to me that the latest movies are very similar to each other, nothing really outstanding. This movie is about a different topic - the night crawlers. Usually when we think of psychopaths we think of serial killers and what not - the obvious kind of psychopath. This story is about a psychopath who expresses his psychopath tendencies in a very different context. I t is not stated or implied that he is a psychopath, that is my conclusion of his personality after watching the movie. It wasn't just ambition, it was beyond that. He certainly lacks empathy! The acting itself is enough of a reason to watch this movie. If you are a true movie lover who devours good acting, this movie is for you. Jake was amazing! He was really involved in his character, he was really creepy. There were a couple scenes in which i was really scared of him. Riz Ahmed, who played Jake's partner, was amazing too! His delivery was so natural, so genuine and authentic!!A MUST SEE!",

The main focus of the movie is not as much on the plot or the action but on the characters and environment thus the plot takes a supporting role. The movie portrays an unemployed man named Luis Bloom making his way to a life of fame and fortune in the news business . Although one might say that this is a classical American success story , it is surely not.Luis Bloom is not your average American , he is a psychopath who lacks empathy and morals. He does not dream nor create he uses the data he collects to satisfy his own selfish purposes whatever the means. He knows people better than they know themselves and uses their weakness and environment to better his own goals. From start to finish the main character does not evolve or change , he just gets more tools to work with and even goes so far as to using people as commodities. Nightcrawler wants us to understand that's it's not the intelligence of the main character or his charisma or any special attribute which helps him advance this far but the environment in which we live. The same environment which puts more importance on the purpose than on the means of achieving that purpose. The questions it raises and the world it reveals are very debatable but one thing is certain , this movies gets its message across.",

Jake G in his best career effort, it appears Donnie Darko was just practice for this role.

Bill Paxton jumps back in the van from Twister in another role he hits right on the pole.COLLATERAL or TRAINING DAY's LA style now appears aged and dated compared to this DRIVE-esc action combined with an innovative LA look we haven't seen since the Rodney King beating.The underlying tones are spot-on, the NETWORK like revolt screams at the system, shattering mirrors in the process.I loved this flick.",

Throughout the entire duration of the movie, I was extremely uncomfortable, watching everything that unfolded on screen, and this is where I believe the makers of the movie succeeded, and how! Gyllenhaal was virtually unrecognizable as a pallid, scrawny (I first brushed off this move as awards bait after Matthew McConaughey's success in True Detective) and shady character who steals without remorse but has the gift of the gab which he wields, unfalteringly, to get people to do his bidding. And it very possible that in his mind, there exists no moral compass to tell him to where to back off. So when his Lou finds an opportunity, he runs with it, landing up in a dysfunctional partnership with a nervous homeless youth (Riz Ahmed). The duo crawl through the night gathering up 'footage' of violent crimes and accidents for news channels. As the story progresses, so does Lou's delusions, and the viewers are dragged into the death spiral of his moral degradation as he embarks on one 'victory' after another. The film's final moments, albeit, the most spine chilling, affirms the fact that this might just be the film that will be the career defining for Gyllenhaal. The film is stylishly shot, with a background score that is sometimes jarring, but which adds to whole dark and gritty mood of the film. But the hero, I believe are there performances. This year's dark horse on the awards circuit. Don't miss this one.",

He got so into the movie, that he lost 20 pounds to create Lou's gaunt appearance and he also suffered an accident during the mirror scene. It is, definitely, the best role he has ever played. With a small budget of $8.5 million, Nightcrawler did what other big-budget movies couldn't. After Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, this is my favorite debut.

            "content": "I'm gonna keep this short and simple. If your expecting a film that's full of action and constant on the edge of your seat thrills...don't waste your time. I gave this film an 8 simply because of the fact that not one minute passes where Gyllenhall does not hold you in a tight grasp with perhaps one of his most fleshed out, stellar roles to date, however I feel that it could have been slightly shorter and perhaps that's what led to me dropping two marks off the score. I feel many films today pack in as much as possible to Create long overdrawn films but maybe it's just because I was at a later showing. The film follows Lou Bloom (a somewhat sociopathic, borderline psychopath) on his journey to fulfil his own somewhat twisted journey to fame and fortune. Gyllenhall along with a superb cast including Rene Russo, take us on a journey that explores just how far humans are prepared to go in order to exploit and earn money off those who fall victim to the many crimes of today's society.. A combination of stellar acting alongside the director's slick visuals and thought provoking script ensured that I left the cinema with plenty to discuss. All I can say is see this film, it's sure to see Gylenhall at least receive a nod at the upcoming Oscars and will no doubt leave you questioning the fine line that lies between what is morally correct and what isn't. This film plays to every humans sick curiosity, we all can't help but watch the horrific images and videos that we see on the news and internet every single day but we do we stop to think of the people that have been exploited for our entertainment and shock factor? Nightcrawler touches upon all of this and presents us with a film that leaves an uneasy and lingering question in the air....how far would you go to get the break you have always wanted?",

When the movie ended, it seemed like it was just getting to the good part. We see Louis develop into the bad guy we suspected he would be, but we don't see any of the consequences of his acts. The movie plods along too slowly for the first hour and then ends abruptly just as his villainy is really hitting its stride. They could have done a lot more with the story line.

            "content": "Dan Gilroy brings us an amazingly well-executed satire and character study. Let me preface this by saying, if you get information from a single media outlet (mainly Fox news) you will not enjoy this film. To start, this movie always has the main character in mind, whether it be the cinematography, the score, or the performance, you're essentially seeing the movie made by Louis. A couple examples are the depth of field is sometimes manipulated to change what the focus of the character is, at first chatter on a police scanner and then a restaurant across the street. The most hilarious example of this is the score, the track that plays when the main character is taking pictures of a fatal car crash what plays is the most cookie cutter cheesy scattered percussion and clarinet as if it's some kind of triumphant moment for the main character. That's just not something you see a lot and I appreciate it. Jake Gyllenhaal does a phenomenal job as the main character, I never once believed he wasn't the character he was portraying, he brings very subtle yet delightfully blunt nuances to his performance. Rene Russo did a pretty good job, I don't think she was given an amazing amount of material to work with like Jake but I did feel she was giving about 65%, it wasn't noticeably bad but not miraculously outstanding, it didn't really affect the movie or my experience but it's worth noting. The political aspect of the film I think was executed amazingly, there was one line that was so on the nose I rolled my eyes but that's one line. I liked the role the internet played in the film, however, I wished there wasn't the bootleg google 'search' and I would've really appreciated they used a real editing software like sony vegas or windows movie maker, something cheap or free. Despite some of the small things that bothered me it's a fantastic movie, go watch it, it's great, tell ya friends, tell ya chilldans, get your pet to watch it with you, guaranteed fun time, no refunds. After the second watch, I'm confident in giving this a 9/10.",

All of these tendencies, with sociopath traits added, lead to a man who will stop at nothing to succeed. The other characters are necessarily two dimensional, only there to show how Lou reacts around others. Although this would normally be seen as a bad thing, by half way through you begin to see what the writer and director are giving you: the more you find out about this man and the more you live in his skin, the more uncomfortable you feel.

Directed by Dan Gilroy and starring Jake Gyllenhaal \"Nightctawler\" is a character-driven crime thriller. It sheds light on the cold and inhumane news world. So Who is Gyllenhaal's character Lou Bloom? Do not be fooled by his personality nor appearance. He is both a professional and a genius. Like Robert De Niro's character Travis Bickle, from \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), \"All the animals come out at night\" in this film . It is among these slithery shadows where Lou Bloom finds his home. The thieving misanthrope captures and exploits dramatized, edited and staged stolen moments of victim's lives to climb the ladder of success. And, he will get the shot no matter what the cost. Lou Bloom is a true artist and a brilliant businessman. To Lou Bloom the world truly is a stage... and it plays the way he sets it. Jake Gyllenhaal is on a roll. From \"Prisoners\" (2013) to \"Enemy\" (2013) and now to \"Nightcrawler\"(2014) ... I think, through the help of Director Denis Villeneuve, he's found his niche. However he will be switching it up again soon in Director David O. Russell's new film \"Nailed\" (2014), a Romantic Comedy.

This movie takes you on a journey through the eyes of a sleezy yet cunning, confident yet humble hustler named Lou as he gradually advances up the ranks of LA's crime scene journalism for news channels.Lou is a very fast learner with plenty of ambition. We see him constantly negotiating with various people he barely knows, always in an effort to maximize his potential at any given moment. The development of Lou by Gyllenhaal is superb. He found a balance between creepy and cringy, with self-assured and driven. Thus making him somewhat relatable to people who wish to hold themselves to a higher standard. He's the textbook definition of an online learner so his communication style with characters throughout leaves us uncomfortable. Yet he's so articulate and sharp you have to respect his knowledge. The story focuses entirely on Lou and his dealings, and because it's a character who you never quite know what's going on in his head, he's capable of shouldering the weight as a certified sociopath on a mission to make a name for himself. It's hard to have a singular feeling about Lou the entire film which plays to Nightcrawler's edginess.Aside from Gyllenhaal's performance, something this movie does well is the linear progression in action and scene intensity. That isn't something unique to movies but I think Nightcrawler nails it given the story arch of Lou. He transitions from the naive and clueless rookie all the way into the savage veteran willing to blur the line between innocent bystander and active player, and we're shown every linear step along the way, which is satisfying as a viewer. From car crashes to shootings, with everything taking place from inside Lou's speeding sedan as the settings winds through all of LA, the director deserves praise for capturing that \"under belly\" sentiment we all know LA to have. To that note, there's no movie stars, or walk-of-fame, or love story in this. Only a failing local news station director desperate for a revitalized channel, and a persuasive night crawler hungry for a chance up the ladder, with plenty of victims along the way.If you're tired of the happy endings where you feel great about the hero and their victories, step into the passenger seat of a red Dodge Challenger SRT and visit the world of Nightcrawler. You won't regret it",

He keeps the *line of normal vs. crazy* as tight as can be! Edge of your seat movie. Dialog is brilliant and his performance is what makes it so very suspenseful. He has never been a favorite actor of mine *but* this role was made for him! Long way from his past roles! Rene Russo is perfect as his mirror image of defects as LOU. Great casting! The fact that Jake could be so creepy and brilliant at the same time *and* make you believe it is well worth the ticket! Some have said there are a few critical errors in some of the scenes as compared to real life. It's possible, but what movie doesn't have a few of those. I overlook that kind of thing because I choose to keep the entertainment value going rather than let a few things like that take a way from the entire movie. My husband and I had a lively discussion in regards to just how far paparazzi are willing to go to *get their story*. This film can't help but raise that question. We are all *lookie-lu's* at one time or another, but this was something far beyond that! Glad we saw it!",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is written and directed by debuting director Dan Gilroy and stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo.In the luminous city of LA, a creepy lunatic named Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is desperate for work and discovers the world of LA crime journalism. He starts his career as a photographer, who goes to crazy lenghts to get his perfect shootings while pissing everyone off. This guy would do wonders at TMZ! Bloom starts becoming very good at his new job and hires a poor lackey (Riz Ahmed) as his driver. He begins selling his shootings to a local news station, run by Nina Romina (Rene Russo). Bloom shootings gets crazier as time goes, while Romina continues to buy his shootings, even if she finds them too morbid at times. How far does it take for Bloom to break the line between being the observer or the participant of the crime scene?This movie is absolutely amazing and my favorite movie of 2014. Not only is Dan Gilroy's debut movie a good commentary on crime journalism in the media, it is a fantastic character study on one of the most memorable movie characters in recent memory.Louis Bloom is mysterious, creepy and unsettling, but first of all, he is a complete nut-case, who at no point is supposed to be a good guy in any way. We are literally introduced to this character as he is about to commit two types of crime! Now you may think that watching a entire movie about an unlikeable villain can be a chore to sit through, but this is where Louis Bloom is even more interesting. Bloom is completely unpredictable, as you really do not know how far this man will go to receive his paycheck.''To win the lottery, you got to make the money to buy a ticket'' is said at the beginning by Louis Bloom and it is this quote that perfectly describes his character. Bloom has already been interpreted by many kinds of people, each with their own unique view on the character. Is he mentally unstable? Is he a tragically misunderstood person? Is he the devil? Whatever the case, the character of Louis Bloom is what carries the viewer's interest from beginning to end on a thrilling, jaw-dropping ride. The climax of this thriller is the most intense climax of 2014, my stomach hurt from pure excitement while watching it.Of course, being primarily a character study, the main character needs a good actor to make you not feel bored or indifferent towards the character. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers the best performance of 2014, as he truly deserved the Oscar for Best Actor (Keaton did too, screw Redmayne) as you at no point see Louis Bloom as Donnie Darko or one of the cowboys of Brokeback Mountain, or even Bobble Boy (if anybody remembers that movie). He is simply amazing as Louis Bloom, as he keeps showing his creepy and psychotic side.One of the best scenes of the movie is when Bloom moves the body of the car crash to get a great shot. There is no dialogue, just a good soundtrack and a the look of Louis Bloom as you see how much he enjoys recording these tragedies. A wonderful scene of marvelous directing and acting.The supporting cast is also good. Russo is very good as Romina and I especially like Ahmed's character. You really feel sorry for him, as he is simply a desperate poor guy, who is looking for any kind of work. Sucks for him to stumble upon Louis Bloom. Oh and the cinematography is marvelous.If there is anything I would have wanted more of, it would be having an even deeper look at the dark sides of media, but I guess there is only so much you can do with a well-planned running time of 117 minutes.Nightcrawler is a dark, yet wonderfully twisted character study on an amazing character, played by an amazing actor. I am now very excited for Dan Gilroy's next movie, and Gyllenhaal is my current favorite actor. I recommend everyone to take a look at one the weirdest, but most marvelous movies of 2014.",

First of all this movie is for the most part carried by Gyllenhaal's performance/character. This is arguably one of his best performance to date (up there with Zodiac and Prisoners). Gyllenhaal/Louis is for sure the best quality of the movie. The pace of the film was good, cinematography was good and couldn't help but think of Grand Theft Auto 5 from some of the scenes that showoff the LA scenery. The concept of the story, at its roots is pretty interesting but as far as entertainment goes, i feel thats where it gets underwhelming for me personally. As far as the other characters go in the film. Didn't really care for them at all, but that's probably intentional on the directors part, since this movie revolves heavily around Louis Bloom.",

Lacking the emotional character and moral boundaries of his previous roles, Jake was nothing short of spectacular in his portrayal of Louis Bloom, an ambitious and morally bankrupt individual that finds his niche in the grizzly world of news media. The acting was so compelling, that it was difficult not become immersed in this enthralling ride that pulled back the dark curtain of the industry. Gyllenhaal embodied a sociopathic kind of heartless detachment necessary to excel in providing for the public's consumption of the macabre.This movie was meticulously thought out, the primary & supporting roles were about as close to being perfectly done as it gets, and the content had me traversing a varied landscape of feelings as I watched the story develop. Would I say this was my favorite movie of all time... absolutely not, but it was a well-crafted story which caught me off-guard and pulled me in. I'm not sure what else I could ask for. Bravo.",

            "content": "https://freeglader.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/nightcrawler/Nightcrawler is director Dan Gilroy's debut on the big screen, and he's made quite an entrance. It tells the story of Louis, acted by Jake Gyllenhaal, a former thief who becomes a crime journalist, or more accurately, chases crimes to film the gory aftermath \u2013 selling whatever he gets to a local news station. As someone who seemed initially lost in direction, Louis takes to this with concerning vigour and manages to quickly rise in reputation among both the newscasters and his peers, seeking larger and deadlier crimes. As it goes, this would be a fairly interesting synopsis for any film, but it is Gyllenhaal's masterful performance as Louis that pushes this film one notch up \u2013 his blank, placid stare, his unnatural interaction, and almost inhuman amorality together create a creepy atmosphere, consistently unsettling throughout.This psychotic performance is supported well by Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed, who play Nina and Rick respectively, the former a morning news director at the news station and the latter Louis' assistant. Both manage to showcase different elements of Louis' character, revealing that beyond the very thin veil of humanity there lies a very dangerous man, but he enchants them both with his strange skills and the promise of more, with a fair bit of manipulation on the side. In one particular scene, Louis is telling Nina how he loved to learn from the internet, and as the conversation plays out it seems more and more that even his most basic interactions are learnt from somewhere artificial \u2013 that he lacks something innately human, and Russo's very organic acting creates a tenable contrast between the two.Perhaps the most impressive feature of the movie is its neo-noir aesthetic, beautifully framing Los Angeles in day and night, and complimenting the themes and feel of the film efficiently without fail. This, too, is augmented by James Newton Howard's soundtrack, its ambient guitars and spacey tones setting and reinforcing the mood on screen. Though it dips and wavers, at its best it could be considered one of Howard's more interesting soundtracks, and even if the various soundscapes work more as accompaniment than standalone musical pieces, noticing a soundtrack mid-film without being distracted by it is often the note of its strength (a la Drive).Overall, Nightcrawler is a thrilling, if alarming, story that retains a strong pace and constantly ups the ante, resulting in a fantastic sequence towards the end which could almost belong in a Bourne movie (and I mean this as positively as I can), and yet even then does not compromise the constant sense of being on edge whenever Louis is on screen. If Drive was the former benchmark for the neo-noir genre, Nightcrawler is definitely the new one.",

From mugging the guard's watch to manipulating the scene of crime so that he gets a juicy angle. He says all his beliefs with so much conviction that it gives you the chills. This film reminds me of the tragic murder of the news anchor Alison Parker where the shooter posted the whole killing on twitter and face book in the US in summer 2015.Night-crawler is a wake up call to how much manipulation there is in today's social media and the worst thing of all is how much the public is hungry for it, the more brutal the better.",

We are told the story of Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) , a sociopath who starts to work as a freelance journalist, and starts to go every night in search of violent incidents to record and sell it to a TV channel.The direction is very accurate and the writing is magnificent. The story and atmosphere absorb you from the beginning. Dan Gilroy makes a great job in character development. The interactions between the characters are great, especially between Louis and Rick (Riz Ahmed), and Lou's relationship wih Nina (Rene Russo), which evolves in a really dark way, showing what a person is capable of doing when being desperate.Finally, I have to say that this may be Gyllenhaal's best performance. He masterfully dives into the character and penetrates the viewer so we can even get to understand his way of thinking. The film doesn't leave anyone indifferent.",

            "content": "The mystery is why people are so fascinated by human suffering. It is worth at least recalling the gladiator fights in the distant Roman Empire, which were considered a favorite spectacle among the people, or even boxing today. This is reflected in many ways in popular culture, from cartoons, where a mouse constantly torments a poor cat, to Stringer, where Jake Gyllenhaal goes to great lengths for the sake of any kind of career.Stringers are called independent journalists. They usually roam the streets at night in search of reports until they find material for themselves, which they film and then sell to news agencies. The protagonist of the film named Louie, a desperate young man in search of a job, decides what an occupation is for him, and begins to travel around the city in a bright red car, soon going very far in his passion for profit. Perhaps too far.From Gyllenhaal's bulging eyes on a thin face to furious chases through the night streets of Los Angeles in a gloomy range of yellow-green flashes of lights, you can call it intimidating in the film. Sometimes it's impossible to call what is happening on the screen otherwise than madness, but, leaving the hall, you vaguely realize: after all, no one guarantees that such Louis will not turn up somewhere in the wrong place at the wrong time for you. After that, I just want to stay overnight at the cinema.Dan Gilroy, screenwriter and debut director, diligently squeezes a lot out of the topic raised, even if he never answers the questions raised. He graciously gives the audience a chance to figure out the moral for themselves, much like Martin Scorsese. He also has a style that is quite consistent throughout the two hours, which is why the film rushes on the same wave of ever-increasing interest. What Gilroy lacks is the love for the city he shows. If Scorsese has it, then here Los Angeles remains cold and faceless. It must be admitted, however, that this very well fits into the general atmosphere of the film.Jake Gyllenhaal does magic on screen. His crazy bewitching game intrigues immediately, he literally attracts attention. If his weight loss (which, by the way, he himself insisted on) was caused by the unbridled thirst for Oscar, then he skillfully transferred this very thirst to his hero on the screen. Louis is an unpleasant type, but Gyllenhaal manages to make him more or less understandable, to reveal him as a victim of the modern world and the people who somehow rule it. Rene Russo, playing in a sense the boss of the protagonist, just perfectly showed how duplicitous such people can be.\"Stringer\" constantly teeters on the edge between thriller and drama. For the former, it is very thoughtful, for the latter, it is surprisingly intense. And this, to some extent, reflects the realities of today's world of news. You never know how many reports shown on TV were filmed by people like Louis Gilroy juggles various problems of modern society, testing the viewer and puzzling.Rene Russo in an interview said that in every person, in her opinion, fits a piece of a psycho. But aren't we ourselves sometimes forcing others to give free rein to this part? Is it possible to survive in today's reality otherwise? Many will consider \"Stringer\" a film not for everyone, in order to justify their fear of what is shown in it. It's still worth watching though. In the end, it is this kind of movie that encourages everyone to look at the world a little differently. This is a brilliant multifaceted creation about the drama of a person who has been raised by the Internet and is largely isolated from society.",

Everything from the jolty, erratic, and shaky movements when he moves a corse during an accident so that he can get a good shot, to his beading sweat and jumpy demeanor when he had just filmed three corpses was outstanding. You can see him always calculating his next move to get more money and to expand on his current business. There's the other nightcrawlers who, while they're no angels themselves, they have some kind of conscious while they record things. They didn't move corpses or go into someone's house while a man was dying. A film like this definitely brings into question the morality of filming and selling it for profit, even going so far as to make a business out of filming death.",

Give him a camera and he will find the drama to capture or extend the drama over time to claim a bigger pay check. He exists to capture drama that translates into cash from the news station and that's all that matters. Rene Russo plays the news producer who is just as jaded as Gyllenhaals character. They are very fascinating to watch. Bill Paxson, who was great in the movie twister, plays seasoned veteran in the field of work Gyllenhaal is entering. He chases news with the same passion he chased tornado's in Twister. His relationship with Gyllenhaal magnifies how bad of a person Gyllenhaal is. He is just purely sadistic. Riz Ahmed plays Gyllenhaals nearly homeless employee. He is a great actor and really reminds me of Dustin Hoffman as Ratso from Midnight Cowboy. This movie is great and it gives a good moral assessment of news gathering and making a buck out of other peoples tragedies.

Not only had it won many prizes, so was critically acclaimed and gained good reviews from leading film critics, but the trailer also added to this excitement. In the end, I was positively surprised, but also disappointed in some aspects.Watching Nightcrawler feels like watching the account of one person's somewhat tragic life. Jake Gyllenhall is more than convincing in his role as the lonely cameraman of a lowly rated TV Channel, Louis Bloom, in a sinister and GTA 5 like Los (Santos) Angeles. The cinematography is especially striking. With most of the scenes shot at night, its the perfect movie for the night. Gyllenhaals character, Louis Bloom, makes us feel very uncomfortable. He seems to be this robot-like persona, so eager to make it on the big stage and gain respected, that he forgets about himself and has no respect for other human beings. We are searching constantly for flaws or a touch of humanity, but are unable to find any in the end. Even though some scenes feel very much inflicted by dark humour, in the end this is still a very much saddening movie best watched on your own, in bed and with the early hours of the day lurching around the corner, just like Louis Bloom does while listening to police signals of murders, robberies and other crimes",

The whole first act really builds his sense of helplessness and drive to help lift himself out of his financial hardship. This drive is built upon throughout the entire story as with each step Bloom's morals and societal lines drift farther and farther from the norms. The entire theme of the story really resonates with common day America, as you are told to work hard and pave a path for yourself no matter the cost to those around you. Dan Gilroy did an outstanding job with the direction and writing of the entire film. The unsettling nature of dialogue and characters actions/motivations is incredibly eerie as it is indicative of society today. Each scene feels real as if it is a retelling of true events. I believed every second of Lou Bloom as a character, and that is largely due to Jake Gyllenhall's best performance to date.\n\nGyllenhall does such an excellent job of putting on this outcast persona. As a loner, he spends most of his time learning on the internet and due to that he does not really understand the nuances of everyday life. This is done tremendously well as every line delivered by Gyllenhall is so sharp and awkward, but the source of the words is tremendously powerful. The sense of emotion displayed by the lead is fantastic as well, he swings from being incredibly upset to quickly turning into a calm put together businessman. It demonstrates Bloom's extreme passion for this work as his emotions blind him to not only his speech but slowly morality. Every aspect of Gyllenhall's performance was incredibly visceral and every bit deserving of an Oscar. I touched a lot on the main lead here, but the supporting cast was all around spectacular. Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed did excellent jobs in their parts. They were able to mirror the audience's reactions to the unhinged nature that is Lou Bloom, this aspect really resonated with me.\n\nOverall, Nightcrawler was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It was able to capture me in the world and had me completely engaged with the story Gilroy was attempting to deliver. The film ends with a bang and has left me thinking about it hours after viewing.\n\nGrade: 97%\nVerdict: Masterpiece",

We're never truly let into his mental state until one great scene later in the movie, that answered so many of my questions in the perfect way. Everything he does seems logical in some way, but more messed up than anything. He's grounded by his \"employee,\" another great character played by Riz Ahmed. Gyllenhaal was able to portray the perfect catalyst the film needed to provide takes on greed and human connection, and how those two can feed each other. The ending, also the most polarizing part of the film, was in my opinion, great. However, there were small scenes that aren't very important to the story, that just don't tie in with the rest.

            "content": "It might well just be me, but I feel that to a certain extent at least, Jake Gyllenhaal is somewhat underrated. His performance in Nightcrawler is a career highlight, and it's a career that's strewn with repeatedly excellent displays. His portrayal of oddball Louis Bloom, a thief who decides to turn his trade to nightcrawling after witnessing the late Bill Paxton grabbing footage from a late night car crash to sell to the media, is nothing short of genius. The brilliance of Gyllenhaal is to deliver such lunacy with total calm, combining possible sociopathy with well read sense, making for a dangerous and off the hook individual, willing to go to any lengths necessary to get his story. Some of you may have seen Gyllenhaal recapture some of this manic calmness in Velvet Buzzsaw (2019) a film that was serviceable but held together by his performance. In Nightcrawler, Gyllenhaal is supported by others on the top of their game, an early performance from the brilliant Riz Ahmed, as well as Rene Russo, whose news director slowly loses control over her own  self confidence thanks to Louis' calculated calmness. Dan Gilroy's debut feature is littered with brilliance, and he went on to bring those features to Velvet Buzzsaw, it's just a shame it doesn't hit the heights of Nightcrawler. Another thing that the film does so well is to address a small area of American culture that is somehow perfectly legal (admittedly not the lengths that Louis goes to) and it tackles these discussions head on in the newsrooms, albeit briefly. But that's not what the film is about, although it covers these topics. Its subject matter is about the ability and accessibility of a troubled individual with the means within his grasp to wreak physical and emotional havoc, and to be far too close to the bounds of legality for comfort. One of the best films of the decade, with a behemoth of a performance from Jake Gyllenhaal.",

The moment when you most need a tense / dramatic music, there it comes a sound that you'd expect with a happy ending. The dialogues are poorly done, as is the plot: half of what happens in the movie is not credible.

            "content": "Jake Gyllenhaal stars in this character study/thriller as sociopath Louis Bloom who sets his sights on becoming an independent news gatherer, which is pretty much a guy who chases the flashing lights of emergency vehicles looking for stories to sell to the local news. What lengths will he go to get the story? Well, let's just say that a man born without empathy or fear can go pretty damn far.\n\nThere's a lot to talk about with this movie but let me start off by saying just two words, \"Jake Gyllenhaal.\" MAN! This guy is something else! He really shines in this movie. The way he portrays Bloom without an ounce of empathy is just unlike anything I've seen before. He's like a bizarre cross between SpongeBob SquarePants and the T-1000. It's really unnerving watching him in this role and every moment you spend with him makes your skin crawl but at the same time you're drawn in to wanting to see what he'll do next. Also noteworthy is Rene Russo who plays a veteran news anchor desperate to increase her ratings. I really liked the whole vibe of this movie which plays kinda like a retro John Carpenter film in some respects. It's got a style and a brash quality about it that has been largely unseen in film beyond the 1980s. The art direction and the cinematography are another triumph of this film. It manages to marry both handheld and steady-cam shots in a fluid way that keeps the differing styles uniform and easy to follow despite some scenes that have quite a bit of action in them. Speaking of which, the driving sequences in this film are amazingly well shot and really interesting to watch. There are a few sticky moments that don't really make too much sense as far as the way the police are portrayed, letting just anyone hyper-close to dangerous crime scenes in a way that you know they would never do, but overall it's alright.\n\nOn the whole, I really liked this film. If you're a fan of films like Taxi Driver or Drive or any number of John Carpenter films, I think you'll like this too. It's not super heavy on the action like some of the other films but you will definitely get a thrill from it. Nightcrawler gets a 4...out of 5.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler - 10/10. Dan Gilroy's directorial debut is a severely underrated film which is a mix of classic movies like #network and Taxi Driver. He shows the story of Louis Bloom, a loner and loser, he dreams of achieving of something big in the field of media. What he ends up doing and how he goes down an extremely dark path of filming news footage in an exploitive way is the movie's story. Its extremely sad that Jake Gyllenhaal never got an Academy Award for this role (and not even a nomination!). He dives into the insanity and drive the character goes through when trying to achieve his dreams. He manipulates and exploits situations, and Gyllenhaal transforms himself physically and mentally when becoming the character. The rest of the cast, which includes Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed, and Bill Paxton also deliver some really solid underrated performances. Outside of the acting, its the way Gilroy writes and directs thats super impressive. He creates a slick and dark look for the city, and treats the media world as almost a battleground with no rules whatsoever. You watch and hope that the character will turn into a better person, but as you see their descent, you realize that they will not change. Its an antihero subject, and Gilroy doesn't glorify the character at all. He shows how selfish he is and how slimy his tactics are. When I watched the film at TIFF14, I remember thinking about the movie for the whole car ride back home. An excellent film that needs so much more attention!",

And _Nightcrawler_ takes it to the limit.\n\nDark as it may be, this is one of the best films of 2014. It belongs on the all-time classics list. That''s how good it is.\n\nLouis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) invokes the whole \"how to be successful in business\" trend that was popular in the 80's. Although that movement is cloaked in motivational blather, which Louis recites constantly throughout the film, the bottom line, in reality, is in \"Make the sale at any cost, step on anybody you need to step on, forget about ethics, and treat your employees like dirt, so you can BE SUCCESSFUL.\"\n\nLouis' recitations of business cliches are comedic at first, until the film descends into real darkness. Louis decides to make his living as a \"nightcrawler,\" a freelance cameraman who rushes to the scenes of horrible accidents and murders, films the most grisly footage he can, and sells it to the local news channels. It's distasteful enough in the beginning of the film, but believe me, it gets worse.  He starts orchestrating and setting up camera ops, including the ultimate shooting death of his assistant Rick (Riz Ahmed), a homeless young man who helps him out for $30 a night.\n\nThroughout the film, Rick speaks for us, the audience, who can't believe what Bloom is doing. He can't believe it, either. So his death is a real tragedy. Ahmed turns in one of the best supporting performances I have ever seen.\n\nRenee Russo is excellent as the greedy news TV director who buys the footage from Bloom.  In one scene, she tells Bloom that what she wants is footage of crimes committed in upper class white neighborhoods by colored people and minorities. Makes you wonder about the TV news business.....?  And Bill Paxton is perfect as a veteran nightcrawler who ends up a victim of Bloom's deviousness.\n\nBut the prize goes to Jake Gyllenhaal. His performance is incredible. He never blinks. He dispassionately does his thing, meticulously planned and calculated.  It's the creepiest performance I can remember since DeNiro in _Taxi Driver_.  Gyllenhaal was in his mid-30's when this movie was released in 2014. His acting in _Prisoners_ (2013) was impressive; the same goes for _Enemy_ in 2014.  It will be interesting to watch him as he ages.  He may end up as the next DeNiro. I hope he stays on track and turns down stupid movies when he gets older.\n\nTo me, the most disturbing scene is the final one. Bloom has made so much money that he has bought two news vans. and he's hiring several more assistants. He gives them a Tony Robbins motivational talk about climbing the ladder of success,  and he concludes by saying, \"I would never ask you to do anything I wouldn't do.\" It's chilling.\n\nDo not miss this one!",

Typically included with Zodiac (which I gave a (90)) and Prisoners (95), as thriller-like, neo-noir-ish films in which Gyllenhall plays a/the protag, he gives his best performance here as Louis \"Lou\" Bloom. What he does with the character, which easily could've been played a straight-laced creeper with a dark side, blew me away. Even cruising 100mph through L.A., Bloom keeps his composure while simultaneously lecturing his intern, Rick (Riz Ahmed), on maintaining a positive attitude in the face of adversity, establishing goals, and increasing your value when salary-bargaining, amongst other tidbits of life advice you'd expect to hear in the conference room at the Sheraton by the airport. You see, Lou works as a \"stringer,\" or a photojournalist who arrives at the scene of any news breaking story, and in the Los Angeles of 2014, as is the case in every city or town across America, the more violent, the more cultural overlap \u2014 the phrase \"urban crime spreading into the suburbs\" is used a few times \u2014 the quicker it can make it onto the air, the more lucrative the clip. Lou forms a business relationship that soon shifts into a sexual-control relationship with Nina (Rene Russo), the morning news director at a local station. \"How much can we show?\" \"Legally?\" \"No, morally. Of course, legally.\" Pretty much sums Nina. A single scene shifts the tone of the film from one of sleazy and unethical to downright criminal: Lou moves a bloodied body from a car crash, where he had been the first to arrive, even before the police, so he could block it better for the recording \u2014 the entire time music like something out of Friday Night Lights plays, as if he were the star Quarterback scrambling for the pylon. The best line of the film and the one that finally offers some insight into why Lou is so\u2026idiosyncratic comes after rebutting Rick's statement that Lou doesn't understand people: \"What if my problem wasn't that I don't understand people, but that I just don't like them?\" I was late to the game on this one, so I won't detail the climax, but man o'man is it shocking. One small thing I would've changed is a detail about the ending. Lou has grown from a 1\u20132 man operation to a small crew assembled of four interns, clad in matching uniforms and vans. However, a huge part of Lou's success was due to his upgrade from some crappy clunker to the Dodge Challenger that graces the movie posters, which offers him speedier access to the scenes. It would've been a more impactful final scene had the crew departed together \u2014 after Lou's \"I wouldn't ask you to do anything I wouldn't do myself\" line \u2014 in badass muscle cars instead of the vans. Nevertheless, Nightcrawler is a must-see and has been one of the most enjoyable viewings of the year.",

            "content": "Probably I am one of the few that didn't like this film and didn't find this as appealing as everyone else. Firstly Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Lou Bloom, portrayed a character desperate to be someone and be successful. (we never knew his motivation/background) Lou becomes a freelance TV news cameraman overnight with a nose for graphic tragedy and actually began as a weird petty thief. The problem here is there was no character background. The audience unaware become manipulated in a way as with the majority of the film they're quickly thrown into a tense thriller believing this to be about the media, fake news etc. It was actually about a creepy guy who, like so many, wasn't born rich (I assume) and wants a lot of personal success. Instead, we see fake news after fake news and the lengths of which people go to get the news. Fake news is still a very strong discussion and to me clearly it wasn't Lou's patronising smile that sold the movie, it was more that the creators focus mainly on something that's discussed every day, fake news. \nSecondly, Lou seemingly goes around filming incidents he learned about on a police scanner. (It is not that simple believe me) and points a Black Friday value camera before he sells this to a news company. (Oddly enough Lou was able to just casually stroll into the newsroom and sell his stories)\nI found the entire film strange. You claim this to have been profoundly very well written and shown and yet if the character has been doing this for three months earning in excess of $1000 a night or whatever we still never learn much about him, nor do we see him spending his earnings or anything. \nAlso the police do not seem to be very good at investigating crimes. There's never any cctv footage even in a mansion? \nThere's just too much unbelievability with this movie. I know people are easily persuaded by similar characters like Lou but there's far too little in regards of actual reality. The police or anyone else do not mind too much when a strange looking guy points a camera at a dead persons face. \nWhat was quite obvious to me and not to others was Jake himself slipping up so many times with his accent. At first he played a deluded, somewhat mentally unstable slow person (let's be honest) yet within a few minutes he's a fast thinking dreamer with an education. Not long after he's a posh accent with manners. Then not long after he's an American roaming around talking like he's a top businessman very prim and proper. Not much consistency in his dialogue. Yes Jake of course is a brilliant actor and really carried this film but much of this movie his performance was certainly not anything to blow you away.",

I remember seeing this film in theaters in 2014 opening night. I am a fan of Gyllenhaal\u2019s work and the trailers definitely intrigued me. I cannot day enough about how great this film is. This is the best performance of Gyllenhaal\u2019s career still to date. This movie builds on suspense and just keeps escalating to points you will never expect. It\u2019s a twisted psychological thriller that surrounds the topic of how far will you go to get a good news story. Rene Russo as they news station manager delivers a scene that still to this day that gives me chills. Bill Paxton & Riz Ahmed deliver great performances in the supporting roles as well. The music and cinematography in this movie is simple and really drives the suspense as the movie starts to unfold. The script is classily written and still one of the smartest scripts of the last decade in cinema. Nothing in this movie feels out of place, it all serves a purpose.

He's won a lot of acclaim for his roles in other films but he's unbelievable in this one. Not only in his performance but for how he must have prepared for the role. He lost a shit load of weight in preparation to play Lou Bloom and it makes him so much creepier in his performance. I mean the character is a pretty disgusting guy and usually Jake is a heart throb in Hollywood but in this film he's skinny and so creepy looking. Obviously his features are something we're used to being filled out but here he's indistinguishable from his previous roles as he's so gaunt and drawn. \n\n\nNot only is his performance amazing but the film itself is bloody brilliant. It's so unique. We all love a fresh story. Not one that's not been done to death or remade over and over. This is a completely different story and we're here for it. I don't know if the murder news cycle in America is as hotly as contested as this but if it is then I feel sorry for the people in that industry. What you must have to see must be truly disturbing. \n\n\nNightcrawler offers us so many twists and turns. The main reason we get so gripped is because we wonder how far Bloom will go to get the perfect story. With each passing tragedy he stoops lower and lower. His poor assistant is literally thrown into situations he never thought he would be in. You wonder whether he will finally see Bloom as the evil man he is and report him or whether Bloom will continue to get more depraved. This is truly a great film. It has great performances all around and a constant building tension throughout it's runtime. I have to watch this film at least once each year as it's so brilliant. Definitely one you can revisit again and again. \n\nCheck out my site LifeLowdown.com for more Film & TV news!",

Both characters are nice enough that you can have a pleasant conversation with them, but you know that they could strike at any moment without warning. Both also do things that are very illegal and look for careers that suit their passions. Even though the acting is great in this movie, the overall message and theme in this movie really confuses me. The movie overall feels like it's trying to teach you something but it's not. This movie could have been a lot more complex and have more depth than it did. During the entire movie we see Lu getting his way and doing illegal things that benefit him and we, as an audience, expect to get what he deserves for doing all of these wrong things. Then in the end, he gets exactly what he always wanted. His own video news production company. I was really dumbfounded by this. I guess the theme or message is that the world is unfair and sometimes horrible people get what they want without consequence? Even if that was the message this movie was trying to say, this movie could have been a lot more complex in this area as in how the news media can manipulate situations and control peoples lives without them realizing it. This movie also needed a better score. The music didn't really give me the feeling of tension or anything for that matter. But overall it is still a great movie with great pacing, directing, and acting.",

When it comes to intimate character studies of unhinged individuals, 'Nightcrawler' unquestionably ranks high alongside 'Taxi Driver' and the incredibly divisive 'Joker'.  Along with its airtight screenplay which never wastes a single moment on anything not pertinent to the central story, Gyllenhaal easily gives a career-best performance as an admittedly persistent individual with a laser-focused ambition and drive to do any and everything to succeed, morally or immorally.  The conflicting thing about Lou (Gyllenhaal) is that, he has that drive, that craving if you will, to achieve more and move up.  However, his means of doing so is nefarious, illegal, and in some parts inhumane.  He is no doubt an antihero; his motives are clear, but his ways of navigating them to reach his goals are what make him ultimately evil.  I feel like 'Nightcrawler' conveys more than just one thing about society and people.  Among these are the very plausible idea that, perhaps to individuals as sociopathic as Lou, succeeding can be a breezy no-brainer; after all, what's stopping them?  The wellbeing of others?  No.  A conscience?  Nope.  Empathy?  Uh uh.  Sympathy?  Try again.  Lou is the embodiment of corporations who will do whatever it takes to stay afloat, grow bigger, and relentlessly expand even at the expense of other people.  It's hard to believe he is a human being, what with his extremely calculating, razor sharp precision and machine-like way of getting what he wants.  I will no doubt be revisiting this in the future.  The cinematography is great, the score complements the dark tone, the performances are of the highest caliber, the pacing is bang-on thanks to a superb script anchored by phenomenal dialogue, and of course a mesmerizing performance from Jake Gyllenhaal.  'Nightcrawler' is entertaining, visceral, intense, creepy, thought-provoking, and all around robust filmmaking at its best.",

Laser-focused and analytical in all things, he's amoral to the core. He communicates in long, precise sentences that cut straight to the point, strategically disarming his conversational adversaries before they even know they've entered a sparring match. If not for the obvious physical indications, one might question if he's human at all. The one exception might be his fondness for composition, an endless pursuit of sublime photographic harmony amidst the broken glass and shattered bodies of a fatal auto accident. The rescue crews and police officers, also present amidst the carnage, are mere obstacles between his lens and the natural beauty he finds, bleeding and gurgling, upon the asphalt.\n\nAs Gyllenhaal grows bolder and more calculated in his nightly hunt for that next great shot, the stakes increase and his eye grows more selective. It all culminates in a masterful climax, a white-knuckle chase scene, that pulled me from my cozy spot on the couch to a closer seat on the floor, a few feet removed from the TV screen. I can't remember the last time I was so invested in a story.",

            "content": "I was disturbed by this film but in a good way as it commented on the shallowness of current media coverage and had a clear perspective on the events that unfolded without seeming too po-faced. Director Dan Gilroy made the film in the 2010s, a decade when crime had evolved significantly since the gritty 1970s, but he updates the style of a film like Taxi Driver (1976) for the modern age effectively. What the film received particular notice for at the time of it's release was the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal who went from handsome leading man to scary psychopath with a positive response coming from critics and audiences alike.\n\nPsychopathic thief Lou Bloom, Jake Gyllenhaal, is inspired to become a freelance journalist after witnessing others being successful in the position and realizing that he can sell footage that he captures to local news stations for a large amount of money. He is initially a failure but eventually records a carjacking incident and has his footage bought by the calculating executive Nina Romina, Rene Russo. She informs him that they want extra gruesome events to be recorded and if these take place in wealthy parts of town audiences are titillated and excited by seeing it. He begins to stage accidents so that his footage looks more presentable and has enough money to hire assistant Rick, Riz Ahmed, to accompany him on his trips at night to capture accidents. He forces Rick into compromising situations so that their videos are more impressive and forces Romina to offer him sexual favors in exchange for him continuing to provide her with good footage. He then almost kills his competitor Joe Loder, Bill Paxton, when he disables his car and tensions arise between himself and Rick as they become involved in a serious crime.\n\nBloom's total disconnect from humanity and selfishness in all situations could make it hard to relate to him but the film is still mesmerizing as we are horrified by the nearly dystopian world he appears to live in. The city he wanders through at night is a world of the morally bankrupt and tortured but the few innocent people who just happen to be caught in the crosshairs are those who Bloom takes advantage of. As they bleed out in their shiny cars or crawl along the pavement he is there tracking their misery and to him this is not immoral as he has no idea what it is like to be one of them and their suffering is simply something to sell through his eyes. The only person that he seems to really understand is Romina and yet he still feels the need to manipulate her in order to have her sleep with him and there is a confrontational tone to all of their interactions. The final scene they share together in which they stare into one another's eyes and excite over the gory footage he has taken gilds the lily too much but for most of the film's running time the weird romance that develops between them is fascinating to follow.\n\nGyllenhaal does give a chilling performance in the lead role and despite the fact that he may draw too much from a young Robert De Niro you can't really blame him when he is asked to play a psychopath in a 1970s style thriller. He has those famous bug eyes and a smile that seems genuine when delivered in real life but that can easily be twisted into something disturbing. Russo, given one of her first great parts in years, matches him as the cynical executive who views everything in terms of money and has a disconcerting glint in her eye when she meets somebody who is as ruthless as her. The film really belongs to the two of them as they are the two actors who make the most impact and while Ahmed is fine as the squirrelly assistant he is no match for Gyllenhaal.\n\nScorsese devotees will have seen all this before and will be unimpressed by the way it plays with the form ever so slightly but for an effort at recapturing some of Scorsese's early career brilliance it is better than a film like Joker (2019).",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is a gloriously dark journey through night-time Los Angeles, where Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is making a name for himself as a \"stringer\" \u2013 a freelance journalist who captures graphic footage of crime scenes, turning a profit by selling it to TV stations. Unlike many journalist protagonists who came before him, Lou doesn't endeavour to walk a tightrope between legitimate reporting and exploitative intrusion; instead, he shamelessly scavenges for the most provocative \u2013 and therefore most profitable \u2013 material, going so far as to engineer crime scenes to create the grisliest effect. Lou's manipulation of the world around him is not limited to the crimes he stages; rather, it extends to all aspects of his life, which he is able to manipulate to his advantage. Nightcrawler is a fantastic film because it delights in Lou's capacity to make his desires manifest, and depicts his tenacity and nerve with humour. It succeeds because it never defers to its audience with obligatory scenes, such as explaining away Lou's behaviour or doling out the justice that many audience members yearn for.\n\nNightcrawler attests to the power of cinematography to support characterisation and sub-text. A wide-angle lens is paired with shallow depth of field throughout the film, often rendering everything on screen out of focus except for Lou. This serves to reflect Lou's worldview, in which he is the only thing that matters. Lou's isolation from other people is reflected in the framing of shots, which frequently position him on his own rather than in over-the-shoulder or two-shots which would signify intimacy with other characters. Even when sharing the frame with another person, long shots are employed to suggest distance. As a result, Lou's aloneness in the world is palpable, his separation from society conveyed through visual techniques.\n\nI found the scenes where Lou is capturing footage on his camera to be the most visually interesting. While the crime scenes and dead bodies that comprise Lou's subject matter are presented as blurry and out of focus through the film's lens, we can simultaneously see the images depicted with clarity through the viewfinder in Lou's camera. This demonstrates how Lou's interest in reality and the world around him is contingent on its purpose within the media, and ultimately his own success.\n\nNightcrawler could not have succeeded without Jake Gyllenhaal's fantastic portrayal of the voracious Louis Bloom. It was satisfying to watch Gyllenhaal cast against his usual type of wide-eyed ingenu here. His expressive eyes, usually employed to fawn over women in romantic comedies, are disturbingly repurposed in Nightcrawler to express his fascination with the suffering of others, and how it will serve his lofty ambitions. Gyllenhaal simultaneously conveys emotional detachment towards the world around him and emotional intensity towards that which is incidental to his success.\n\nA reading of other reviews regarding Nightcrawler suggests there is a multitude of ways of reading this film. Some view the film as a commentary on the exploitative nature of the media, which capitalises on selling human suffering as entertainment. This perspective condemns the media for motivating behaviour such as Lou's. This is a weak argument, given that Lou's deviant behaviour is evident before he is rewarded for it. The media didn't create Lou, it is merely a convenient platform for him.\n\nNightcrawler has also been interpreted as a satire of millennial entitlement and the cultural adage that one can achieve anything as long as they try hard enough. Lou references the importance of hard work throughout the film, and even states \"I was raised with the self-esteem movement so popular in schools\". Further, Lou projects an exaggerated image of himself and his company (Video Production News) in a manner not dissimilar to the embellished social identities projected by millennials on social media platforms. The marketing campaign for Nightcrawler played on this concept by setting up Twitter and LinkedIn profiles for Louis Bloom, as well as posting a video resume on YouTube, thereby reflecting the bootstrapping ideology of millennial culture.\n\n\nI take issue with the above interpretations, as they suggest that the film is condemning Lou's behaviour. In watching Nightcrawler it is clear that the film delights in Lou's tenacity and nerve, revelling in the absurdity of his behaviour. Thus, I prefer to read the film as a comment on embracing one's true nature rather than conforming to the social norm. The journey of Nightcrawler sees Lou progress from attempting to fit into a traditional lifestyle at the beginning \u2013 where he attempts to get an unpaid internship during the daytime \u2013 to accepting that he is at his best when separated from societal expectations. Lou discovers the world of stringer journalism, where his natural inclinations are rewarded. As a result, Lou is more powerful and more authentic when he exits the film than when he enters it. As such, Nightcrawler is ultimately a film about coming into your own and finding a path to expressing your true nature. It is about the triumph of authenticity over conformity, the triumph of the individual over society.",

Of course, his psychological issues are going to push him to cross the line, which he does without hesitation.\nThe movie is very slow to get going.  The first hour was a yawn fest.  Louis is clearly not the hero, and very obviously a creep, leaving the audience wondering what we are hoping for - Louis to succeed or fail?  Things kind of pick up in the second half as he starts manipulating everyone around him - cops, co-workers, criminals.  By about the 90 minute mark, I was hooked.  It was obvious the whole scheme was going to go south, you just couldn't tell exactly how yet. Most crime thrillers at this point would focus on the cops making the bad guy squirm in his guilt, but Louis walks out of the police station like he was buying a pack of gum.\nThere seems to be a bunch of commentary about the callousness of the media, and I guess something about how psychopaths who run companies abuse their employees while smoothing it over with business jargon.  The end of this movie is compelling, although it is neither fun nor enjoyable to watch.",

This film may be more appropriate today, 2019, when there is so much horror in politics and so many decrying \"fake\" news. People in show business as well as in journalism, politics and other fields should really relate to how people are used and abused for money and position. While the focus here is strictly on journalism, it applies to a great many fields of endeavor. Renee Russo also shines in this picture as she usually does. She and Gyllenhaal are an even match in good acting and play off each other very well as overly ambitious people who have chosen or simply never had, ethics or morality. There's quite a bit of dark humor to keep it from bringing the viewer down watching the leads acting out the worst of their character. The ending is sad and dark but realistic.My only hope is that it doesn't parallel where our current society ends up. I prefer to have more hope and faith in people.

Everything to Lue is so dark and out of focus, that it seemingly makes you beg to know more about Lou's next move and why he's acting the way he is.\n\nEven though the movie didn't set up an answer for all of these questions about Lou's personal life and what controls his motives, it seemingly interacts with the audience to connect with the character's mix of awkwardness, the rather systematic unhuman approach to the society, and at the same time, you get really attracted to his charm.\n\nThe film puts the events in their right places, you never feel there's something out of place or there's something that's added just for that to happen, or act as a plot device. Everything the movie sets acts as the essentials for its conclusion and message, nothing ever feels too much or too heavy just for the sake of nailing that roughly 2-hour runtime like most heavy-budget films do.\n\nThis movie is not a heavy-budget project, and that's not the case, but the case is its purpose and the message it delivers through the end of its final act. \n\nThe movie is not from a horror perspective, but its thrilling setting up of events makes your heart beat and makes you wander about what is to happen next, it simply makes you care.\n\nLue is clearly shown from the beginning itself as a criminal, in disguise of a man looking for a job but yet a hard-working and polite one. Due to the film's incredible focus of detail and fantastic pacing, you get thrilled to the building up of events and thus, provokes your thoughts which intensifies your hype and care for what's to happen next.\n\nLue is amazingly polite, full of charm but the slow build of events and character building allows you discover the flaws with his disturbed self once put in play near the ending of the film. Inspite of knowing that Lue is completely wrong and using what he calls \u2018employees' just for the sake of his success and greed, we still get to empathize with the character which is why Lue simply doesn't have a character arc, adding to the fact that the main protagonist of the movie is yet the villain himself, which the society seeks to accept and build up upon, decieved by his hard-working character trait to just serve their need for money, entertainment etc.\n\nThe film's cinematography also expertly lines with its message and the protagonist's goal.",

There is a great feeling that you get of Lou's antics becoming more and more extreme. The film lacks humor and I think it plays to the style of Lou himself, a person that barely seems to know what humor is. The downside of this movie is too me it seems very plain. The point is to see how others interact with Lou as someone who very calmly and professionally responds. Lou does not evolve as a character only evolve in business, professionalism, and in relationships with others. Overall very interesting film with a dark tone that works well for the subject matter, but as a movie it seems that the 2 hour runtime plays against it seemingly wearing out the audience by the end.",

It is a gripping and unnerving suspense film depicting the profile of a sociopath. We see Lou's shallow motives built up by manipulation, threats, and even violence. Nightcrawler is a demonstration of society without ethics fueled by a moral depravity. It is captivating from beginning to end.\n\nGilroy's critique of the media's process of obtaining raw footage unethically is scathing. He puts up the idea that the news will show anything regardless of the tastelessness of the material as long as it gets them ratings and viewers. The moral void of Nightcrawler is chilling. Even the decent editor of the newsroom that suggests what they are doing is wrong is shutout for the sake of ratings. What we consider good news is as reviewed as immoral without value. Nightcrawler even depicts another unethical cameraman with Bill Paxton's character Joe, so that the audience knows there are other men like Lou who think there is no privacy. Nightcrawler is a depressing state of the media as a business bent on entertaining rather than informing.\n\nAdditionally, Nightcrawler is primarily a heart stopping character study of a man without a conscious. Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as Lou Bloom. He depicts this freelance cameraman as a morally reprehensible, criminal mastermind without boundaries. Gyllenhaal is supremely creepy and horrifying with increasingly unethical line stepping. Nightcrawler opens on Lou killing a security guard and stealing his watch, then it goes downhill from there. Gyllenhaal kills it portraying Lou with a vocal pathological liar persona and a cold calculating manipulative front to all around him. Gyllenhaal captures Lou's quiet hate and inner rage just on the surface. He will go down as one of cinema's greatest villains.\n\nReno Russo and Riz Ahmed are fantastic in Nightcrawler. Their supporting roles are the perfect foils for Gyllenhaal's character. They speak out and suffer for it, all while being victimized by Lou in one fashion or another. They feel normal and natural to their world and portray people that could really exist. In Russo's case, we see her lack of ethics in that she appreciates Lou's madness all for his exclusive footage. Russo does a great job depicting Nina's darker side. On the other hand, Ahmed is endearing as the everyman dragged into a horrid situation with no out as his character Rick is so impoverished.\n\nLastly, James Newton Howard's score is pounding and unsettling with every note crawling under your skin. Howard is the perfect accompaniment for this twisted thriller.\n\nNightcrawler is the highly underrated psychological look into the mind of a madman who will not stop at any cost. Gyllenhaal's subtle performance filled with boisterous venom is worth the price of admission.",

This is extremely unusual for me, but I have immense admiration for this passion project, and it is without a doubt one of my favourite pieces of filmmaking.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nEverything in this movie I love, to say the least. It seems crazy for me to think about having seen it so often, yet still it all works so well and fully gets me.\u00c2\u00a0\nGoosebumps, laughter, utter shock... all over and over again.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWhat Dan Gilroy has crafted is impeccable, not just for an debuting director, but overall.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nI believe if you truly give your whole attention to Nightcrawler, you will find endless details in it, that will make you fall in love with it deeper and deeper.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis is a film that has so much to say without ever being judgemental.\u00c2\u00a0\nIt is simply stating facts about our society and about what can happen when you leave your empathy and morals alone in your apartment.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nI would like to mention that I liked Roman J. Israel Esq. as well and have seen that once so far. In a few days or weeks I will rewatch that, partially because I want to prepare for Dan Gilroy's third outing, but also 'cause I wanted to see it right after my first viewing of it anyways.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThere's really something about the honesty and the delivery of it all, that so far just glues me to the screen of a Dan Gilroy movie. It is thanks to his vision and thrilling but knowingly underwritten scripts, it is thanks to John Gilroy's great editing, and of course to mention one important name out of many also thanks to the genius of cinematographer Robert Elswit.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe score is also very important and masterfully done by James Newton Howard. It all takes you right into the mind of the main character.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nI almost even forgot to mention the stellar performances in here. To my mind all of the three performances that the movie focuses on are easily Oscar nomination worthy and in Jake Gyllenhaal's case it's needless to say he should have won it that year.\u00c2\u00a0\nI am blown away each time by his portrayal of Louis Bloom, who as a matter of fact, is the character I am most fascinated with, in all of cinema history. There is so much to interpret into his words and no need for any backstory, it's amazing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nI am very excited to see what the crew has done with Velvet Buzzsaw, which is apparently coming out in February of next year.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThese films are like rare animals.",

A chance encounter leads him to set himself up as a freelance cameraman who spends his evenings listening to police radio messages in order to get to the scene of accidents and murders so as to film graphic footage to sell to a local TV news station. His desire to get bigger and more salacious stories is encouraged by a ruthless news editor, Nina (Rene Russo) and by his rival cameraman Loder (Bill Paxton). Bloom is a truly disturbing character who will stop at nothing to get his way and is devoid of a sense of morality. Gyllenhaal nails this role perfectly, even seeming to blink in a cold hearted, reptilian manner. The tension that Dan Gilroy notches up and up makes some of the scenes very uncomfortable to watch and there are a fair few heart thumping car chases thrown in for good measure. This is a kind of blackly comical psychopath story which is a damning assessment of the lengths that a poorly regulated television industry will go to in order to chase ratings. Nightcrawler is a really skilful, horrifying movie with a good plot and excellent cast.",

It's another thing entirely to see the dark underbelly, the very people that provide the media with those bloody images and horrifying tag-lines.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Louis Bloom is astounding. Creepy and unsettling and downright loathsome - yet absolutely captivating to watch. Bloom is an excellent example of the type of sociopath that would be drawn to nightcrawling, to making money off the suffering and misery of others.\n\nThe script, performances, soundtrack and cinematography come together to form an incredibly tense and quietly ominous film. I held my breath throughout the entire scene where Louis calmly explains to Rick (Riz Ahmed) that he will hurt him badly if he doesn't cooperate. The almost uplifting music during the scene where Louis drags a man's corpse for a better shot is downright disturbing.\n\nNightcrawler also does an excellent job of creating and capturing the atmosphere of Los Angeles at night. The film pulls you in and makes you a part of that world. The incredible cinematography does a lot in this regard, with beautiful shots of the city at night and fast-paced driving sequences.\n\nNightcrawler is a fantastic film, but it certainly isn't for everyone. Some may be put off by the honest and brutal portrayal of the ambulance-chasing media coupled with the cold, manipulative, and completely unlikable character of Louis Bloom.",

When he discovers he can make a career in videotaping traffic accidents and selling the footage to television stations, his ambition grows, and his concern for humanity diminishes.  He soon transforms into the most unsettling sociopath in film, since Patrick Bateman in American Psycho.\n\nDirector, Dan Gilroy's love for the city of Los Angeles is evident in his camera work, but filmed in such a dark and uncompromising way, the film brings forward the horror we take for granted every night on the local news.  We have desensitized ourselves, and though most people won't go to the extremes Louis Bloom will, Rene Russo's character fittingly has one rule for what makes it to air. \"If it bleeds, it leads.\"\n\nAt the very least, Nightcrawler is an interesting commentary on modern society and where our priorities lie. Full of moments that stick in your craw and some incredible performances, Nightcrawler is one of my favorite movies from 2014.",

Academy Award winning worthy and equally responsible for the films magnificence was Jake Gyllenhaal in what I truly believe to be his greatest performance yet.  Gyllenhaal's impeccably gripping, sadistic, restless and unshakable performance of sociopathic loner Lou Bloom is considerably the most pristinely portrayed sociopath of all time.  Yes I will say it, even dethroning \"American Psychos\" longtime number one fan favorite sociopath Patrick Bateman whose needless to say was played by the amazing Christian Bale.",

            "content": "Local news stations live and die by the ratings. Whether it's the royal wedding or a high-speed chase, reporters toil around the clock for the next big story that will increase the viewership and advertising revenue of their stations. When however, does the next big story cease to be news? \"Nightcrawler\" highlights the broad line between good journalism and morbid entertainment, and what can happen when that line is crossed.\n\nDespite being credited as the film's lead, there is no trace of Jake Gyllenhaal in \"Nightcrawler.\" Losing 30 pounds to play the part, Gyllenhaal immerses himself into the role of petty thief Lou Bloom both physically and psychologically.\n\nFrom the opening shots of the film, you can tell that something is off about Bloom. After stealing chain links from a fence on private property, he assaults a security guard, delivers the stolen materials to a Los Angeles construction site and tries to sell himself as a potential employee to the site manager.\n\nNoticing a car crash on his drive home, Bloom pulls over to investigate. Two freelance videographers arrive at the scene shortly after and film police officers pulling the driver from the burning wreckage. When asked by Bloom, one of the cameramen reveals that he and his partner drive around LA, filming anything and everything to sell to the news station that will pay the most. \"If it bleeds it leads,\" the cameraman tells him. Inspired by the encounter, Bloom pawns a stolen bicycle, purchases a camcorder and a police scanner and begins working as a stinger.\n\nBloom presents his first clip of footage to local TV news station director Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who describes her station's newscast as, \"a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut.\" Bloom adheres to this ideology in his work, exposing his darker nature to the audience. Infatuated with his growing success, Bloom pushes every moral and legal boundary imaginable to get the perfect shot.\n\nGyllenhaal's performance is enthralling. Despite the disturbing and sociopathic nature of his role, his character intrigues you. Bloom is passionate. Bloom is driven. Bloom is wickedly smart. He has an eerie charisma about him that seeps under your skin.\n\nRene Russo is also exceptional. Unlike Bloom, Romina fully comprehends the magnitude of her choices, sacrificing her morality for television ratings. When the thrills of Bloom's nocturnal crusades are sucking you in, Kevin Rahm's character, Frank Kruse, serves as the conscience to bring you back to reality. Despite his efforts, the concerns of the honest journalist sadly get swept under the rug by the prowess of Bloom and Romina.\n\nThe cinematography and editing by Robert Elswit and John Gilroy fuel the intensity of the acting. Whether Bloom is recruiting his partner Rick (Riz Ahmed) at a diner in the late afternoon or he is pursuing a high-speed car chase in the heat of the night, each scene is an exhilarating experience. The film's many shining qualities are only a testament to the thought-provoking script of Dan Gilroy.\n\nThe scenes and dialogue bring to mind recent events such as the shooting of reporter Allison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward in Virginia. In the shooting's aftermath, there were news websites and stations that chose to run the footage from a video posted online by the shooter, which showed the victims being shot at close range. The ethicality of this has been questioned, as it shows little respect for the victims' families. Sadly however, footage of this magnitude engages our morbid curiosity, and Gilroy explores this truth as the basis of Bloom and Romina's actions in the film.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with LA Weekly, Gyllenhaal humorously remarks, \"There is a Lou in all of us. I don't know if that disturbs you!\" While I think this is far from the case, our culture as a whole contributes considerably to the \"if it bleeds, it leads\" mentality. Next time you see a brutal or disrespectful video, don't support it. Don't promote it. We can change the rating trends. We can rise above the culture.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, it s time to crawl out of your hole and write a review with me tonight.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Im out of the hole and at my keyboard. Time to review Nightcrawler, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. You first, Gregger.\n\nGREG: Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a disreputable young man who makes ends meet by stealing chain link fence and manhole covers for the money he can negotiate from the smelters. He is scraping the bottom of the barrel when he happens upon an accident where he witnesses some professional videographers who crawl the night looking for stories to film and sell to area newscasts. Louis decides this is an easy way to make money and steals a bicycle which he hocks for a camcorder and police radio receiver.\n\nSCOTT: Lou first films the scene of a fatal accident and takes the clip to a local TV station whose new director, Nina (Rene Russo), welcomes his gory footage. She encourages him to bring her videos of violent accidents and crime scenes with white affluent victims. Lou hires an assistant, Rick (Rick Garcia), and the two men find some success hunting down bloody car collisions and murders to put on film. To obtain better videos, Lou alters some crime scenes and arranges dead bodies to create better images. He even sabotages a competitor s van so that his competitor suffers a gruesome accident for Lou to film. One night he and Rick arrive at the scene of a horrific mass murder before the police have arrived. This sets in motion more graphic violence for Lou to orchestrate (and videotape) with the goal of earning more money from Nina.\n\nGREG: Scott, Nightcrawler is an intense look behind the scenes of local news. It s not enough to show the events as they happen, but Lou is advised to find events that show the urban world encroaching on the suburban world. Or, to show people of color robbing or killing white people. These are the stories that garner higher ratings. And higher ratings garner more advertising dollars. Lou realizes this and starts to manipulate not only the crime scenes he s supposed to be reporting on, but also the people around him. He convinces his  intern  Rick to work for peanuts and even gets Nina to sleep with him so that he will continue to feed her these high-value videos. Lou is an unusual hero for a movie. He has many of the characteristics we look for in a hero. He s resourceful as he finds a way to make a living. He is intelligent - he studies the internet and reads up on all things having to do with network news and how it works behind the scenes. In his own way, he is charismatic as he uses his motivational speaker skills (which he learned from the internet) to induce people to do things they really don t want to do. He rises from a position of low social status to running his own business. But he severely lacks any empathy for how other people feel. He is completely self-absorbed and manipulates people into doing things that are illegal and ultimately even life-threatening. He will do anything to get what he wants, no matter the cost to others. Scott, Lou Bloom is a textbook definition of the anti-hero. He is a villainous person cast in the role of the lead character of the story. Unlike the more likable anti-heroes (like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, or Bonnie and Clyde), we learn to fear and even despise Lou Bloom.\n\nSCOTT: For me, Nightcrawler is a disturbing look at a disturbed man. Lou is a classic sociopath who lacks a conscience and has no empathy, remorse, or moral core. He uses people and hurts people to obtain his goals. We ve seen characters like this in the movies before, of course, but usually they are secondary characters, i.e., the villains who occupy limited screen time. But in Nightcrawler, we re subjected to Lou s heinous character for two solid hours. He appears in just about every scene. Although this film was extremely well made, I was uncomfortable being exposed to pure evil for such an extended period of time in the form of Lou s psychopathic personality and escalating malevolent behavior. It was relentless. As you point out, Greg, we know villains share four of the Great Eight attributes of heroes. Lou is smart, strong, charismatic, and resilient. But Lou is lacking the most telltale signs of a hero: He has no heart. It was repugnant watching him deliberately ignore suffering people, harm others, and even kill them, in order to sell his videos at a higher price to Nina. Nightcrawler makes us think about the ethics of paparazzi and ambulance chasers. It even raises ethical issues about television news journalism and where they can and should draw the line between morality and legality.\n\nGREG: With Lou already playing such a villainous role, it s hard to identify any villains in Nightcrawler. Lou s arc of going from harmless gadfly to devious mastermind is the epitome of the Villain s Journey - which is the mirror image of the Hero s Journey. So, I look for the more heroic characters to offset Lou s villainy. Nina is already a pretty cut-throat news director. She ll do anything to advance her career - even put clearly illegal source material on the air. She doesn t offer an impediment to Lou s advance. In fact, she aids it. There is a minor character in the form of the station manager, but while he is the voice of morality and reason, he offers little in the way of opposition to Lou. The rival video company owned by Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) is Lou s only opposition. He s a good guy, plays by the rules. But he s a tough businessman. At one point he see s Lou s abilities and tries to hire him. But instead of taking Joe s offer, Lou tampers with Joe s brake line and causes him to be in an accident that heartless Lou films for the morning news. And that ends any opposition that Lou might have.\n\nSCOTT: Really, the only decent character with any screen time is Rick, who plays the role of the sidekick who repeatedly questions Lou s actions and character. Rick is in such desperate need of money that he looks the other way while Lou engages in awful conduct. Rick s also such a weak character that he is no match against Lou when the two men eventually collide over morals. If there is an oppositional force at work against Lou, it exists mostly in the form of the ineffectual Los Angeles Police Department, who appear at the scenes of accidents and murders, and who also try to keep Lou from getting in the way of emergency personnel as well as their investigations of what happened at these scenes. The LAPD may be the type of villains that we call institutional villains -- a large bureaucratic entity that lurks in the background as the main impediment to our main character s goals.\n\nGREG: Nightcrawler is more frightening than any horror movie for its vivid portrayal of the realities of mainstream news. The thing that makes it scary is just how real and current the story is. This could be happening now. This is a tale about how we are being fed stories - and how they could potentially being crafted - to titillate and spread fear in the name of news and money. It begs the question - what is news? I give Nightcrawler 5 out of 5 Reels for showing us a very scary reality. Lou Bloom is a terrifying anti-hero cast in the world of network news. He frightens us not for any super powers that he might have, but for how amazingly ordinary he seems to be. He seems in every way an under achiever. He is not handsome, overly intelligent, or even athletic. But he is a cunning villain in the way he manipulates his prey. We are witness to a complete Villain s Journey here. I give Lou Bloom 5 out of 5 Villains. There are no strong heroes in this story for Lou to combat. You ve already pointed out that the LAPD detectives were completely ineffectual against Lou. And rival Joe Loder was no match for Lou. A stronger hero for our anti-hero would have made Nightcrawler a completely different movie. I can only give these side-heroes 2 out of 5 Heroes.  Movie:  Villain:  Heroes:  \n\nSCOTT: Nightcrawler is an extremely well made movie but you won t catch me watching it again. The movie is two relentless hours of the devil in human form at work on the streets of Los Angeles. I was disturbed by the main character (notice that I cannot call him a hero) and his wanton disregard for human life, and it was disheartening that no heroic character in the film could even come close to combating him. I don t know what good can come from making such a movie or even watching it, other than the possibility that it can be used as fodder for ethical reform for the ways TV networks solicit film clips for their evening news. I give this movie 4 Reels out of 5 simply out of respect for the filmmaking and for Jake Gyllenhaals extraordinary performance. There is no hero in this story, as this is a tale of the triumph of evil. Our main character is the devil running roughshod over everyone in his path. Like a cancer, he just grows and grows in his size and power, and he is shown flourishing in the end. He doesn t change or evolve or transform like a heroic character might. He has no mentors or friends and he eliminates his sidekick when the sidekick outlives his usefulness. Our main character s evil simply gains strength for two disturbing hours. The absence of a hero story here leads me to assign a rating of 0 out of 5 Heroes. Inasmuch as our main character is a villain, this is a movie about villainy and how it blossoms. Nightcrawler shows us how villainy is allowed to prosper when we allow it to prosper, when we condone it, when we cooperate with it, and when we place money ahead of principles. Nina and Rick are probably not terrible people; they simply succumb to greed. As the main character, Lou does encounter some resistance from a rival videographer (whom Lou severely injures), a sidekick Rick (whom Lou eliminates), and the LAPD (whom Lou outsmarts).  There aren t many villain stories that are better told than this one, and so I ll give Lou an impressive 4 Villains out of 5.  Movie:  Villain:  Heroes: 0",

A linear script, which contains some difficulties in guiding its acts and abuses at various climax, but what is necessary to take the monotony. Telling the story of Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man with an immense penchant and an insatiable desire to win in life, with difficulties of getting a job and living from petty thefts, he discovers a new market, selling accident videos And murders on local television channels, such a market becomes Lous's obsession, which does everything to stand out and does not put any effort or scruples. We can not judge so much Louis, a man with ambition and desire to overcome insatiable, we can not judge his work or even his coldness, only his crimes can be judged, the biggest villains are the public itself indulging in a basic human curiosity, Morbid curiosity, this interest generates the market that generates interest in exploiting it, this is a trade, and the criticism of the film is precisely on top of that, the despair of the television channels in selling death, and the little concern to understand or help Victims, what counts is the exploitation of its disgrace. The film has an extremely urban photograph, at times it remembers the great \"Drive\", with a palette of colors that always strives to emphasize the night, a good sound mix and a basic but competent assembly, the soundtrack is discreet, but When it appears, she talks to Louis, and the film seeks not to sell violence, other than the same shows, this is interesting, as it seeks to reach the public with its quality rather than pure appeal. The biggest highlight of the film for me is Jake Gyllenhaal, an actor who completely embodied himself for the movie, losing I0 kilos, not flashing, and even the way of walking is different, Jake is incredible, with a sociopathic face and really looking like A vulture, he completely steals the scene, not just the scene, the whole movie, you feel the desperation in his eyes, the despair of anyone who would do anything to achieve their goal, Jake makes the best performance of his career. Finally, \"O Abultre\" is a great and interesting film, it details itself in small details, but it is very well acted and has a very interesting morality.",

The cinematography is beautiful and the director was able to utilise LA well. The score was also euphoric and the tension was built well in the bigger and bolder scenes.

He is a person who is well educated, appreciated, however, one who is professional acting nice and showing signals of appreciation, as it differs in the inside of himself. He lives an unusual life, a thief who always wonders to find a career to achieve his goals. One day, he comes across some people filming crime scenes as a sale for news footage as for their career, also known as 'nightcrawling'. And so,  Louis Bloom involves as a curiosity into this business. As the film progresses, he gets very good and professional at the job, in fact.. he gets way too good at this job as he, himself commits crimes and acts in illegal actions.\n First off, Jake Gyllenhaal gives his finest role and performance throughout his career. He is absolutely courageous and self-conscious. He is fully engaged with that character, he withdraws himself and becomes fully the character Louis Bloom, which makes us the audience frightening and terrifying as we see him burst his way of performance. \n Also, it is so frightening how our main character Louis Bloom starts off as a protagonist, and as the film progresses, becomes an unexpected and fearful antagonist. However, so riveting and outstandingly written dialogue makes certain situations so exciting and realistic, adding unsettledness which makes us sweat in thrills. From these amazingly written dialogues, even though Louis Bloom transforms into an antagonist, we root for him, and we want him to succeed in every possible way, after all, he has committed crimes and taken illegal actions. \n Additionally, the last act, the last 15 to 20 minutes are the most suspenseful and hand-gripping finales that additionally decorates this film more beautifully. The streets of L.A look immaculately beautiful and flawlessly colored, which contains solid eye candy visuals.\n Overall, this film depicts the realism of the society as well as illustrating the character, Louis Bloom perfectly flawless. It is most certainly one of the best films of 2014 as well as the best-written script forms of this decade. For writer Dan Gilroy's first directorial debut, it is very impressive and unbelievable of what he accomplished.",

            "content": "3/24/17\nWhoah, Fox gave Nightcrawler his own movie? Oh wait, this isn't an X-Men movie, it's a crime thriller. Anyway, we open up by meeting Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a petty thief making money by stealing stuff and selling it, but only for himself, so he's no Robin Hood. In fact, he doesn't do anything as well meaning as Robin Hood. Anyway, after bargaining for a higher pay (and failing) he drives around until he sees an active crime scene and a pair of stringers film police pulling a woman out of a car crash. When one of the duo (Bill Paxton) reveals he's selling it to local news stations to use on air, Lou develops an ambition to boldly do what these guys do, and what follows is his machiavellian quest to be the very best stringer that no one ever was. We waste no time getting into the independent news chaser story, which makes sense from the discovery of this being a thing to the climactic \"in over his head\" climax. I'm going to be honest, the character of Lou Bloom is not very well developed, though we all have aspirations we should be careful not to choke on. In fact, you kind of grow to dislike Lou, which I think is the point of the movie, given the fact that he and his business partner Rick (Riz Ahmed) run around filming crime scenes and anything the police show up at to sell to a local news station. You really grow to dislike him because he's a pain to Nina (Rene Russo), the woman who runs the station Lou sells to, to the point he gets creepy on her, and I know we all have aspirations, but this guy crosses the line to the point where he's essentially a serial killer with a camera and a temper. It's also seen in the way he treats Rick: horribly. He's just relentless, thankless, and just plain rude to the guy who gives his time to help make these shenanigans possible. He's not very relatable in this sense, but Rick serves as the entry point for the audience, and the guy says what's on most viewer's minds: \"What the hell's he doing?\" He and everybody else get no real development, but for the relatability factor, I'll recognize him as the eyes of the audience. Nightcrawler also has this dark and gritty feel to it that just feels raw and believable, and everything we see advances the plot and speaks to the character of Lou Bloom and his insanity. Another flaw I'd like to point out though, is the vast levels of profanity. Was it really that necessary? It helps it feel raw, but I felt they could have toned down the language and made this accessible to younger audiences who should probably see this to see what media has become today: a scary, unpredictable force that brutally sticks to its guns in the face of being wrong. Before I go, I just wanna say James Newton Howard's score was a nice movie score, just getting that out there to end on a positive note. So now, I can say that Nightcrawler is a hard-hitting tale of modern media and the world of TV news in the age of the Internet, led by a psychotic cameraman who wants to be the very best at it for no real reason, seen through the eyes of a sane guy who just needs to make some money, and tells it like it is, unlike news media today.",

A smart, engaged film powered by an altogether remarkable performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, it is melodrama grounded in a disturbing reality, an extreme scenario that is troubling because it cuts close to the bone. Mr. Gyllenhaal's startling portrayal is far from the only distinction in this impeccably crafted feature film. Mr. Gilroy's directorial debut connects its hero's tacit madness to the larger craziness of a broadcast medium that teaches vast numbers of viewers to live with a false sense of insecurity. Gyllenhaal is in almost every frame of writer-director Dan Gilroy's first feature, skinny and wide-eyed, running down a driveway with his camera or cutting across oncoming traffic in the Challenger. It's an intense performance, the flip side of Ryan Gosling's in \"Drive,\" playing the angles and filling space with empty words instead of soulful silences. Nightcrawler flourishes as a searing indictment on unchecked mania, workplace malpractice, and the forces that maintain them. A thick film of sleaze coats every frame of Nightcrawler, a movie that takes a hard look at media culture and provides Jake Gyllenhaal a terrific opportunity to creep us all out. Restless, visually sleek, and powered by a lithe star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler offers dark, thought-provoking thrills.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD.

I was absolutely awed by the intensity of the story, even in the most static scenes there is a thrilling excitement created by the interaction between Gyllenhaal and the supporting cast. The movie, much like the stories that Bloom covers, moves at a breakneck pace and is always seeking to up the ante and become more shocking. I was delighted that Nightcrawler kept me guessing throughout, and I was definitely on the edge of my seat. Perhaps the most surprising choices they made were in the score. They made a brilliant decision to occasionally utilize the music as a way for us to get inside the character's head for a moment. So there are scenes that ordinarily would be played dark and gritty, but because of the elation that the main character feels at getting the story, we hear a more up-tempo shift in the score. That seems insignificant, but it's a hundred little decisions like that which make Nightcrawler so great. I would highly recommend it to people as a unique character study, and an intense thriller.",

Now, I know that the plot doesn't sound like a convincing pitch, but believe me; you would be wrong to assume so. Before we get started, there is a possibility for a few spoilers as I will be discussing the film in some detail, so here is your SPOILER WARNING.\n\nA well written script is paramount for any film to entice an audience, and Nightcrawler does exactly this. The dialogue from the outset is authentic, natural and intriguing; which remains consistent through the movie's entirety. We can also thank Jake Gyllenhaal for this, for his performance was truly sublime. Bloom is everything to like in a person; he's a talkative, enthusiastic, determined character, yet there is a very sinister side to him that lies within his nature. He is desperate, who resorts to theft and even murder to earn a living. He is unaware of where the boundaries between right and wrong lie, and if he does, he has no hesitation in crossing them. As the film progresses, Bloom becomes truly frightening, doing whatever is necessary to obtain the footage that separates the wheat from the chaff; and this is what makes him so interesting. Whether we are supposed to root for him or be disgusted by his acts remains ambiguous,  but one thing we know for certain is that he is unique in his enthusiasm for being successful.\n\nNightcrawler shows exceptional insight into the world of journalism, but has no hesitation in displaying the flaws of the industry either. There's even a quote from the movie whereby Nina (Bloom's footage buyer) states \"we find our viewers are more interested in urban crime creeping into the suburbs. What that means is a victim or victims, preferably well-off and / or white, injured at the hands of the poor, or a minority.\" And that's the harsh reality; quite frankly nobody gives a damn about poor or ethnic-minority victims, and to bring such a reality at the forefront of our cinema screens, I can't help but admire the movie. Any film could depict the wonders of journalism, but instead, Nightcrawler takes a more realistic representation of the news industry.\n\nThe movie, however, can be somewhat silly at times. The shocking fact that Lou remains innocent and free to continue his role as an unorthodox crime-journalist is staggering. Throughout the movie he continuously tampers with the crime scenes and evidence to benefit his own cause, yet his involvement in these scenes remain non-existent in the eyes of law enforcement; despite his lack of effort to hide the fact that he was there. Yes it's a minor flaw, but it's hard not to wonder whether such circumstances would repeat itself in a real life scenario.\n\nDan Gilroy's Nightcrawler succeeds in bringing an authentic portrayal of the world of journalism to life, with crimes that feel so real and shocking in which audiences can't help but admire. Every monologue that spills from Lou Bloom's lips holds a significance to the plot and his character's development; all of which go together nicely into a neat package. It's fair to say that Nightcrawler was one of the hidden gems in 2014, and a film to respect and talk about for years to come.\n\nVERDICT: Pleasantly Surprised!",

One thing that I was fond of, was Gyllenhaal's performance; he never allows the creepy smile to leave his face, no matter the situation he gets himself into and gives an excellent performance.\n\n\tWhile I do not believe that the film attempts to exercise social criticism about journalism, it paints a beautiful, bleak, misanthropic picture. Inside the painting, our prowling protagonist finds his match in the TV-news people and especially in an aging news director  (Rene Rousso who matches Gyllenhaal performance-wise) whose job insecurity and amoral personality compels her to act more like a Grand Guignol director. \n\t\n\tAs the protagonist tries to grow his emerging business (at least in his own mind) we get another good supporting character in his (not very bright) assistant. Also, we get a clear view on how far the protagonist is able to go in order to get his scoop and realize his dream of becoming incorporated. \n\n\tI mentioned that the film does not exercise social criticism, because I wanted to clear the air from the notion the film is about journalism. I believe the film attempts criticism, and that lies with the protagonist's many rants about his goals for the future of his \"company\". The fact that anyone who has ever ridden the corporate roller-coaster will recognize the ramblings of this (clearly disturbed) person, as typical middle-management talk, is the heart of the film's commentary. \n\n\tWhile the film is not especially deep, is a beautiful dystopian experience, mainly thanks to the efforts of the main lead and the stylized direction. Good entertainment when you are in the mood for something dark. 7.0/10.",

The world of watching television news, and wondering who goes in and shoots the aftermath of accidents, crime, and violence? In NIGHTCRAWLER, the audience gets an up close look, personal and even harsh at times the world of videography for the news.\n\nThis film is a spectacular thriller. Its setting is in the city of Los Angeles and its night life. Jake Gyllenhaal (Prisoners, The Day After Tomorrow) plays the character Lou Bloom. He is a very driven young man, desperate to explore and work in crime journalism. He works with a camera, filming crashes, fires, violence, and other types of dangers. As the film goes on, Lou Bloom becomes an even stranger individual. He was so strange and crazy, I thought he would make a good joker for an upcoming Batman film. On the other hand, he has what the news team looks for. Someone who is dedicated, a quick learner, and has a positive attitude. Such as, willing to work with them, and bond.\n\nFurthermore, the films acting and directing were awesome. Jake Gyllenhaal's character really does come off as a strange yet driven and intelligent young man. Even though he isn't physically threatening, like other characters in films. but psychologically he is a crazy creep. He has greasy slick back hair, and he stares at you with those big eyes. The writer - director, Dan Gilroy did a great job of directing. I really enjoyed how at first he made Lou seem like an underdog and a new comer into this business, and then how lou transforms into the man he is by the end of the film. Also, the director made you feel like you were in the car with Lou, up and close. Getting to know him, and his intentions.\n\nSo these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts. Overall,this film has numerous things that are well done. Everything from the acting, writing, directing, and world of being a \"nightcrawler\" in a crime-scene videography for the evening news. It has good moments, and I believe it is definitely worth your time. I believe NIGHTCRAWLER earns a...\n\n9/10 !\n\nThis review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading, and viewing. Have agreat day as always. :)",

However, the movie is undone by too many red herrings of Louis' own undoing. I don't mind a pessimistic ending, but his character obviously goes way too far, and gives himself plenty of rope to hang himself. Despite all the hints that his plans will be undone, the movie abruptly ignores all the clues to attempt a stinging ending. It felt forced and sudden, as if the writers were afraid to betray their admonishment of the news industry. In the end I think it undermined the message.",

            "content": "Neo-Noir is a very interesting genre; when used correctly it can add a much needed spice to film, especially where the crime drama is concerned. Nightcrawler, the latest effort into this field is a welcome new addition, mixing an atmospheric premise with a hint of media ethics and the drive of competition.\n\nNightcrawler is all about Louis Bloom; a conning sociopath who is looking for a way to make his fortune; as luck would have it, he stumbles across a group of freelance cameraman who get close-up footage on crimes in progress and sell it to local news agencies (nightcrawling). With a trusty employee in tow (played by Riz Ahmed), Bloom begins his foray into freelancing and crime journalism, all the while hiding his background behind a wall of well-rehearsed professional chit-chat. Taking place mostly at night, the film focuses on both Blooms' incursions into crime scenes and his bartering with the likes of news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo). What makes Nightcrawler so engaging is its build-up; as Bloom's competition and desire to earn soars higher, his tactics and crime scenes grow more risky and intense. There are some really restless moments later on in the film and once the police begin to play a larger role, audiences simply won't be able to take their eyes off the film's proceedings. The film also delves into a few ethical issues in journalism including the presentation of graphic content, and the need for accuracy in the media. These issues never overshadow the central plot, which leads me to its only weakness; the ending. It sort of clunks to a fairly unsatisfying conclusion where there isn't any real consequence to the things Bloom does over the course of the film. While this is a disappointment, the journey the audience takes with the protagonist is certainly engaging, even if he's not exactly the one you would root for in a film of this style.\n\nAt the centre of Nightcrawler is Jake Gyllenhaal, who really does go a long way towards carrying the entire film. There's a two-sided approach to his performance which really captures the nature of his character; on the one hand he puts on deceiving look of professionalism, marking himself as someone who takes his work very seriously, while on the other he obsesses over his work to an almost psychotic degree. He's not a character that you necessarily support; instead you're endlessly intrigued by his exploits and deeds over the course of the film.  If there's one caveat to Bloom's character, it's that his central motivation is relatively simplistic; he simply wants money and will cheat anyone to get to it. While this doesn't impact Gyllenhaal's performance, it feels a bit lacking considering how he's introduced as a thief and trespasser. Some of the side characters are also relatively underdeveloped; because Gyllenhaal's acting is so strong, the supporting actors (most notably Bill Paxton as Bloom's main rival Joe Loder) feel pretty basic by comparison. This is less true of Rene Russo who brings a spark of charismatic flair to the news director archetype. Other than that, Nightcrawler's characters are competent, albeit fairly basic given the realistic setting.\n\nThanks to a great central performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler stands out as a solid, well produced thriller. While some of the characters could be more developed and the ending is quite underwhelming, the film's neo-noir style and strong pacing more than make up for its shortcomings.",

A young man named Lou Bloom lives off of others, which many would consider a thief. Once he discovers the underground world of television news, it'll transform him into a menacing psychopath.\n\nLet me just start out by saying Jake Gyllenhaal is my favorite actor right now. In all honesty, he's my man crush if I ever had one because he's one of the most talented actors I've seen this decade. The way he's able to transform into different characters and conform to his role is breath taking, and it's actually scary in many ways. Without him, this movie would've been a lot different. Will he win an Oscar for all the amazing performances he's given lately? Probably not, but like DiCaprio, it doesn't matter. You don't need an Oscar to define you as one of the best actors, and I can't wait to see what more Gyllenhaal does with his career. \n\nThis movie is so unique in the way that it tells its story. The character of Lou Bloom is interesting in its own right, but setting the story in the television world of local news made the movie even more interesting. It was such a weird, yet perfect way to bring about the making of a maniac. I don't know if that's how local news actually works (news crews film crime and then sell footage to news stations), but it's interesting none the less. \n\nWhat I really took note of was the directing and the writing. I think that Dan Gilroy is so smart, and he did a great job of not only communicating his message to the casual viewer, but was really good at subtlety too.  There were some shots that I absolutely loved in this movie, and they weren't even big moments. They were very short scenes, but they were so smart and simple that it hooked me. The pacing is perfect in this movie, and it honestly feels scary sometimes.\n\nThe character of Lou Bloom is something else. Do I think Gyllenhaal is the prime reason this character was such a success? Yes. Was the writing still phenomenal? Yes. But the matter of the fact is, this is one of the scariest protagonists/antagonists of 2014. This guy is a complete as*hole up front. He's a killer, he's a thief, and he has every quality of a psychopath. I know I've used that word a lot, but it's true. This guy talks like a psychopath, acts like a maniac, and has the morales of a stone cold killer. Keep in mind, he's not unlikable by any means. I mean, he should be and in real life, I would hate this guy, but they execute it in a way that you're willing to go along this ride with him. It's a weird thing and in a sense, you're kind of rooting for evil. It's not only a psychological journey for the character, but for the viewer themselves.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this movie to most. Upon my third time watching this film, it's held up every single time.",

When stealing & breaking things we resell for a profit when resources are everywhere to only capitalize when times are hard. When getting our big or small break into the workforce we can't get into easily when others go based on reputation. When whatever it takes to break in we use. When other things we don't need to break in when its open to those who want it. When we see society and life is all breaking apart all around us to see there is bigger & smaller breaking news to report. When we see what is breaking news to break all the codes to the ones we want. When we break others into such positions when we get a partner for free. When breaking into the workforce is even harder for others. When we break the law everywhere to get what we want to break the rules slightly when it gets where we need to go. When we break and enter into places that are restricted. When we have no time to brake when we can't stop. When we need to break the headlines to be there first. When we see we are breaking out as a star behind the camera. When we see we are breaking in with other people when we are in demand from our bosses and competition. When we see we are all aware of the breaking story lines, broken bones, broken property, and broken hearts to want more. When we are breaking the bank with how much we earn to give those a break too. When we wish to break other things when it's work & pleasure to break in other things a new edge. When we break into many places knowing what else to break in when doors & opportunities open. When we see are breaking records in ratings. When we don't see what is breaking when it's our work when it's crumbling. When we must break others who compete with us to go so far. When we have a leg up for breaking the scoop to be first on the scene. When we break others who we are with when it's their focus & commitment to stay with us. When we see what is considered breaking news when it's not behind the camera but what's in front of it.\n\nWhen we give those a break to have it thrown in our face when it's not enough. When what tries to break us we break them first when the breaks we get can be used as a bargaining chip against us that we can't jeopardize. When it takes one breaking story to break in and expand. When breaking moments in our life we find a neck in what we enjoy when it's those breaking moments we hate seeing ourselves in but others to know we tapped into a resource that we are good at. \n\n\u00e2\u00a0***************************************\nWhen we have to resort to others to get by, settling for less without seeming desperate and giving the impression that we are worth more than other make us seem we are.

When the real story is not the real story, when your behind the camera and making the scene the way you entered it to be. When competition gets stiffer when we are faced with what we don't have and feel the pressure to either join the bandwagon or continue what we do.

The premise may sound like the kind of gimmick that you'd find in 100 different bad films but, fortunately, this isn't one of them. \n\nIt looks at first as if Nightcrawler's goal is to outline the dangers of the modern 24-hour news culture that we now live in and, whilst this is certainly part of it, the movie actually avoids sweeping societal judgement and instead becomes a character study of the fictional Lou Bloom.\n\nGylleenhaal's performance is truly upsetting and in Nightcrawler we're reminded of the eerie elements of his performance as Donnie Darko.\n\nThis film is constantly challenging us in relation to what it depicts and its sleek and gritty style is a perfect match with this approach. Nightcrawler is a fine example of a script, cast, and director all having a similar take on what the end project should be and here, that unity pays off ten-fold. \n\nThe movie's unrelenting cynicism and grotesque nature does begin to take its toll, and so I was constantly concerned that the film would completely collapse on itself at any moment as it continued to outdo the previous shock-moment, time and time again. I do think that some of this concern turned out to justified as the story arc nearer the end felt just a bit too heavy-handed for me. \n\nStill, the film ended well and was always an exciting and challenging ride. If you can prepare yourself for the queasy feeling that Nightcrawler will almost certainly leave you with, then it's a must-see.",

Nightcrawler was the last one I got myself into through this lazy method. \n\nAs you can clearly see from my rating, I was not disappointed in any way.\nThis movie is simply great. I am not very skilled at writing movie reviews so I'll be concise.\nJake Gyllenhaal is a genius of an actor and a monster in this movie. He plays a free lance sensational news footage maker who quickly turns his job into a morbid obsession. The more shocking the footage, the more money he gets, you know that kind of story very well. But I believe that the movie doesn't shine the most through its critical approach of emotional news reporting (targeting insecurities in order to raise the channel's ratings etc...), but through the character of Lou Bloom, an antisocial psycho who would break every ethic boundary to do better in what he loves doing and get more money. It might sound a bit easy to say this but Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is simply astonishing.  \nGreat night-time atmosphere (better than Drive, also don't know why I am mentioning this movie), the soundtrack sticks to the different tones of the movie even though it is not very memorable.\nMan, I don't know what to say, it's just great and I'll just leave a quote from Lewis Bloom himself : \"I would never ask you anything that I wouldn't do myself\". Funny don't you think? Cause... You know, he would do anything and stuff? Hm",

He is always five steps ahead and willing to do literally anything to get where he wants to be or how he wants the people around him to react. He is like a puppet master and everyone in the world is his puppets. He can probably very easily be categorized as a psychopath, but that's what makes the movie engaging. He goes the extra mile and always takes things too far. It leaves the audience on the edge of their seats. They hate him, but they want to see how the crime and his footage turns out. It's a very eerie movie and it leaves the viewer feeling on edge and skeptical about the media they consume, but I would highly recommend this movie for anyone in the mood for a thriller.",

Jake Gyllenhaal may not be America's favorite actor, but he sure does deserve some recognition for his role in this thrilling film. It was a wise choice for director / screenwriter Dan Gilroy to portray Lou Bloom as a thief first and foremost, as a thief is one of the oldest 'professions', the epitome of someone who is willing to do anything to get ahead. Gilroy's choice concisely reveals the core of who Bloom is and how he operates. Despite becoming wildly successful later on in his new line of work, Lou Bloom initially runs into difficulty landing an honest job--- why? Because you can't trust a thief. Some could say this is Gilroy's dig at Hollywood, which makes the Los Angeles setting all the more appropriate.\n\nThis film could not have taken place anywhere but Los Angeles, and Gilroy acknowledges this as he makes a point of incorporating the city as a supporting character with both beautiful and grungy landscape shots. The City of Angels is known for both the making and breaking of dreams, so a story about people putting aside their ethics to indulge in the supply and demand of the American fantasy seems apropos. Gilory's aesthetic is heavily reminiscent of fellow (adopted) Angeleno, Michael Mann, who also highlights the spirit of this city in his works. For a town that's brimming with swarms of paparazzi, willing to stick their cameras anywhere for the best shot, Nightcrawler's setting only seems natural. In fact, a disturbing realization came over me as I was watching the movie, which was that as a fellow LA resident, the world of Lou Bloom seems all too familiar.\n\nAs Lou Bloom, Gyllenhaal preys on the circumstance of his supporting cast, Nina (Rene Russo) and Rick (Riz Ahmed), forcing them to play his game within the confines of their limited situations. Nina and Rick's situations are unfortunately common in this biz. Nina, a jaded news director, is vying to keep network ratings high, but with her older age, she struggles to maintain her career. This leads her to make questionable choices in the gruesome footage she chooses to air on the nightly news. Lou takes advantage of her desperation, and is able to attain the upper hand though her vulnerability and need for his gory videos that draw in America to their televisions night after night. As a 60 year old actress, Russo must be facing some of the same challenges as many women of that ripe age in Hollywood, despite their talent and beauty, find themselves fighting for roles, usually of the matronly nature. Previous to the THOR franchise, Russo had a 6 year hiatus from the big screen, so it seems wise of Gilroy to write his wife into a role that she can so readily identify. Lou Bloom's manipulation of Nina would not have worked had it been with a man, or even a younger woman. Bloom knows the sad reality that is this business, and he takes full advantage of it. \n\nThere are people who don't seem to like Jake Gyllenhaal, so it seems that his latest film has him perfectly cast as a slimy thief, whose unstoppable ambitions land him at the top of the news broadcasting world in the new film, Nightcrawler.

Lou Bloom's manipulation of Nina would not have worked had it been with a man, or even a younger woman. Bloom knows the sad reality that is this business, and he takes full advantage of it. \n\nRick, practically homeless, faces the same dependency on Lou as Nina does. Desperately needing a job, Rick is willing to work for practically nothing under the guise of an 'internship', a concept that most young people entering the media world are well acquainted with. Lou Bloom is aware of Rick's desperation, and hires him as an assistant, knowing that he will do anything for little money. But as their videos increasingly blur the lines of morality, even Rick questions Lou's readiness to do whatever it takes. While Bloom has earned enough money to upgrade to a fancy new car, Rick is still left living out of a garage. It's a prevailing economic divide that is as common as the struggle of women in the workplace, making both these supporting characters an apt portrayal of some of the problems society faces.\n\nGyllenhaal is consumed by this role of the slick, sociopath Lou Bloom. The intensity of his eyes is frightening, like a power hungry man who's been looking through a lens for so long that he's abandoned the need to blink, lest he miss a film-able moment. To say that he is an opportunist would be putting it lightly. Everything that drips from his mouth sounds like it came from a motivational booklet on 'How to Become a Successful Entrepreneur' as he spouts off words of workplace wisdom, continually sharing his mantras with those he is trying to manipulate. There are times that Bloom's focus on productivity is strangely admirable as he chooses to take opportunities to communicate instead of engaging in an argument. However, he lacks the ability to truly connect with people; they are merely cogs in his machine to fame and fortune. He is simultaneously apathetic and sincere, to the point where it's unclear if he's just bullshitting his way around, or if he is fully committed to the crazy conviction he delivers.\n\nWorking in mass media, you see and hear of all sorts of crazy stories that make the actions of Lou Bloom appear less sadistic and more like LA's 'normal' orders of operation. To someone in Small Town USA, they may watch NIGHTCRAWLER and be appalled by the grotesque decisions of its characters, not understanding how people could be so dishonorable. To someone living and working in entertainment in LA, this just seems like an exaggeration of how this town runs its business. It's also America's obsession with 'news porn' that makes this film so timely. It's easy to look at Nina and Lou with disgust for their ethical discrepancy, but they aren't the only ones profiting from the misery of others. It's an American culture of blood lust that promotes such people and professions to exist, and this movie merely depicts our twisted tendency to go viral with violence. Gilroy's brilliant realization of all this emphasizes the reality of the kind of world NIGHTCRAWLER is spawned from, and it delivers an extra punch to the gut, especially if you live in Los Angeles.\n\nRead this review and more at www.1931Productions.com",

            "content": "At the onset of the movie, we meet a lone mysterious young man who clearly is trying to make meager money selling stolen scrap metal. Late one night he witnesses a freelance film crew shooting a car crash to sell to news stations. In the process, he sees the craft of the camera operators, fast pace thinking, and a morbid fascination with the violence and carnage. With no prior experience, he sets out to start a freelance camera business for himself. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the peculiar yet ambitious character. Although the main character is not likeable even off-putting, he is fascinating. He is clearly smart, persistent, and capable of great charm, but he is also calculating, manipulative, and unfeeling. His competitive spirit and unyielding drive to succeed cause him to hurt people, blackmail them, and force them into doing what he wants. It is chilling to what unethical lengths he goes to earn more money on a story, beat his competition to a story. Perhaps even more disturbing is how successful he is using his immoral tactics. I am not sure why I previously doubted Jake Gyllenhaal as an actor, but I did. This movie completely caused me revaluates his acting abilities. His physical mannerisms and facial acting are most impressive. He seems creepy with his overly crisp movements and his hollow go-getter act. There is a predatory animal-like, an analytical nature to his sociopath character. The direction completes and enhances the off-putting feel of the movie with strong camera work music and lighting. Dan Gilroy skillfully uses darkness and blue-green fluorescent lighting to make the viewer feel uneasy and build a growing tension throughout the movie. The story insightfully lampoons flaws in modern media news coverage and corporate world, much of which seems hauntingly believable. It is not a complete thrill ride, but there is smart subtle tension and the acting and directing make this a great pick.",

            "content": "Roger Ebert said of Fight Club, \"more people will leave this movie and get in fights than will leave it discussing Tyler Durden's moral philosophy.\" In similar spirit I think it could be said that Nightcrawler makes more of a case for the main guy being a creep than it does for the potential amorality and cutthroat ruthlessness of modern news teams. Writer/director Dan Gilroy must not have known (or cared?) enough what he needed in each moment of each scene to properly serve his cool and contemporary script. If he had, we would have seen fewer vague performances from his cast, and we would have felt a presentational style that suited a greater vision, rather than just settling for being fashionable and unoffensive. Jake Gyllenhaal is very talented and it's gratifying to see once again that he delights in creating bold, believable, and uninhibited performances when inspired by fresh scripts like this one. But every actor in a film is at the mercy of those behind the camera. This is to say that as strong as Gyllenhaal's performance is, if the director is passive or inconsistent about the flow and logic behind the way his scenes are staged, shot, and strung together, then he won't be capable of giving the right direction to his star, his supporting cast, or his crew. Gyllenhaal is very entertaining to watch, but to what end? The movie doesn't allow his character to go anywhere, and his is the one we are supposed to follow. Had he been able to rely on the guidance of a more assured director as well as the stimulating script and his own great acting talent, the performance could have been much more affecting, I think an easy Oscar nomination. It's not my opinion that Gilroy intentionally left drama by the wayside while only give potency to his gritty action scenes. I do not believe he got so wrapped up in the rush of making a vaguely artsy, cool movie that he sold out his vision as many do. But I do believe that his limited directing know-how is unsuited to the kinds of tricky scenes that he wrote in his script where characters talk to each other or do strange things that the audience should understand. Probably it's just not as obvious to him how to translate those moments on screen and create drama as it is how to throw together expensive shoot outs and car chases. This movie is smart if you're accustomed to ignoring loose-ends, but it's only worth watching for Gyllenhaal's performance, and he has given better work with better directors.",

Looking at how the night crawlers make a living in the streets of L.A., was really really interesting and thrilling at the same time. The way Jake depicts his character, his mania, his drive and perfectionist character, is immaculate. Even this weird look on his face and the moments he seems to be on the edge of freaking out but does not, were breathtaking. I found myself actually being frightened about what might happen next. \n\nThe entire movie was a roallercoaster for the viewer. Being on his side, then wishing he is caught for what he does, then again not. His co-actor/helper was also brilliant. The movie was quite long (approx. 2 hours) but it did not seem like it at all.

            "content": "There was a huge buzz on the internet about this film, because of Jake Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance, but a great performance doesn't always make for a great film. Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is down on his luck, he drives an old car, lives in an disgusting apartment, and doesn't have a job. He drives around at night looking for ways to earn money, when he comes across a film crew taping a crime scene. It seems like easy money, so Bloom goes out, gets a camera, and starts filming the police himself, only, he doesn't follow the same rules that the others do. I will not dispute that Gyllenhaal was terrific, but his character was beyond annoying. Louis Bloom is this O.C.D. guy, who is constantly rambling and talking to himself, something that basically ruins the whole film. This guy gets so annoying it's to the point of frustrating. On top of that, it takes a long time for anything substantial to happen. I was really looking forward to seeing this film and was impressed by how far Jake Gyllenhaal has come, but despite it's looming cult classic label, I found this film to just be one frustrating scene after another. Critics are willing to give films like this four stars and tell you it's a must see, because of an Oscar worthy performance, but what's really the point of seeing something that most people aren't going to want to sit through? Similar to Citizen Kane, it's got a great reputation, but don't let that fool you, this is one of the most nerve racking films I've ever sat through and to be honest, I'm sorry I did.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is a wickedly brilliant thriller, a social satire and an eerie look into the mind of a sociopath who can manipulate with the power of cold-blooded reason. That sounds like a tall order, but this is a deceptively simple plot made functional by a well-mounted script and a near-perfect performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nGyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, a man who seems to be as bland as the white shirt on his back. He's a drool, square fellow who talks with the confident detachment of a marketing video and dresses as if he's stealing from Good Will. Outwardly, he's painfully unremarkable, the kind of guy that you pass every day without notice, just another face in the tapestry of your busy day.\n\nHe lives on the fringes of Los Angeles. When we first meet him he's collecting scrap metal to make a few bucks. On the way home he passes a car on fire, and pulls over. What interests him is not the firemen rescuing the driver, but the presence of a man with a video camera (Bill Paxton) who is filming the action. Louis asks the man which news channel he works for, but the man tells him that he's freelance - he finds accidents and crime scenes, shows up, films footage and then sells it to the local news stations. Louis has a burst of inspiration and, before you know it, he's bought himself a police scanner and a cheap video camera and is scouting police activity.\n\nWhat is unsettling about Louis is how good he is at this new venture, and how willing he is to break every moral code in order to get paid. Before long he's crossing the police tape and snooping around the bodies with his camera to get the best and bloodiest images. His talent captures the eye of an attractive news producer named Nina (Rene Russo) who likes this guy's moxie. He does more work for the station, and demands higher pay. Before long, he asks Nina to dinner. What develops is not a romance, but an odd business arrangement built on curiosity and blackmail. At dinner he reveals himself to be a schemer, a deceiver, a liar and a manipulator with all the moral dignity of a bus station toilet. No one wants anything to do with Louis and yet he has such a bizarre method of concrete reason that you're surprised that the person in his cross-hairs doesn't fill the pauses with \"Go on.\" They are fascinated and so are we.\n\nLike Hannibal Lector or Travis Bickle or Gordon Gecco, we are fascinated by the charming monstrosity of this Louis Bloom. He's a man with the brain of a sociopath, a scummy little creature with the heart of a rat, and yet you can't take your eyes off of him. He has a way of motor-mouthing his way into whatever he wants. Watch carefully the way he turns the casual small talk of the dinner with Nina into a whirlwind of blackmail built on bold assumption. It's a brilliant piece of writing and acting.\n\nNightcrawler was directed by Dan Gilroy who wrote the screenplay for The Bourne Legacy. Here, in his directorial debut, he has constructed a hard-bitten satire, a look at 21st century TV news which rises and falls on ratings and the holy sacrament of \"If it bleeds, it leads.\" Louis is the most effective supplier of this, choosing the lowest rated TV station in L.A. so he can bilk it for all it's worth.\n\nIt's hard to describe too much of the plot without giving much away, except to say that when Louis films the aftermath of a domestic bloodbath before the cops show up, he ends up all but manipulating the news in order to get the footage. He's morally bankrupt, but we find ourselves glued to the action. We also find ourselves laughing at how willing this screenplay is to go for the throat. We laugh even when it isn't appropriate. Take, for example, the moment at the end when two people have an intimate conversation in front of a piece of footage on a screen. It's a moment so cold and heartless that you can't help but laugh.",

            "content": "We all realize that news has become more graphic and more sensationalized in recent years, but what's more difficult to determine is who's responsible for this phenomenon. Has the public become so desensitized to violence that the increased demand for dramatic images and information create a demand that TV news directors are powerless to ignore? Or have news directors become so apathetic about ethical standards in journalism that they just care about giving the public what they want whether it's responsible to do so or not? It's an interesting chicken-egg question that's pretty difficult to answer. Or maybe the question can't be answered at all. Maybe the best we can do is sit back and marvel at the current state of broadcast journalism, wondering how we got here - and how much farther these trends will go. \"Nightcrawler\" (R, 1:57) focuses mostly on the most prescient of these questions - where the current hyper-realistic, hyper-violent trends in journalism could take us. \n\nLos Angeles native Louis Bloom (a slimmed down and very creepy Jake Gyllenhaal) is meant to personify a news business without a conscience. Lou is a self-starter. Make that a self-absorbed, self-employed self-starter. He studies business plans and techniques online. What he learns, he constantly preaches to others and liberally applies to his own business ventures, which are, at best, illegal, and at worst, sinister. He steals construction materials to sell them to shady contractors, he murders a security guard to obtain a nice watch and he steals a high-performance bicycle to sell at a pawn shop in order to finance his latest attempt to make it big. He formulates his newest money-making scheme when he sees a cameraman (Bill Paxton) take video at the scene of a car accident and learns that he sells his footage to the highest bidder among the local TV stations. It's as a \"nightcrawler\" that Lou is at his best - and worst.\n\nArmed with a police scanner and a cheap camcorder, he becomes a creature of the night. He's not a vampire, but he might as well be. He prowls the darkness in search of blood. After all, in TV news, \"if it bleeds, it leads.\" Lou finds a perversely enthusiastic supporter in graveyard shift news producer Nina (Rene Russo). Nina buys Lou's footage, Lou hires a desperate and hapless assistant named Rick (Riz Ahmed), Nina encourages Lou and buys more of his footage, and Lou thrives, buying more and better equipment and a fast new car. As Lou's income mushrooms, so does his boldness.  He makes demands that are increasingly outrageous and takes actions that place himself, Rick, and innocent Angelinos in greater and greater danger, while single-handedly pushing the ethics of L.A. news broadcasts closer to the abyss.\n\nTo view this film as an indictment of the current state of television news is somewhat short-sighted. The main character isn't the cause of the problem, but rather its symptom. Not to mention that Lou is clearly insane and completely amoral. The things he does range from unethical to immoral to downright evil, but he is being enabled in everything he does by his customer. Russo's news director is the real villain here, presumably sane, but much more concerned about ratings and job security than what's right and wrong, or even what's truly in the public's interest. A producer named Frank Kruse (Kevin Rham) who works for Nina speaks out for journalistic ethics and Rick tries to be the voice of reason for Lou. Both Frank and Rick are ignored, with ominous and tragic results.\n\nA thriller, with a strong undercurrent of social commentary, \"Nightcrawler\" both thrills and chills. The movie features one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in a long time, but the message that the filmmakers seem intent on delivering nearly fades into the background. Gyllenhaal is very effective and even frightening, but not in a way that would lead most audience members to start boycotting sensationalized news broadcasts, and the lack of ethics embodied in Russo's character seem to pale in comparison with Lou's activities. Although the message of the movie is a bit muddled, the performances stand out and the storytelling is solid. I'm giving this one a \"B+\".",

The ending alone will make you wish you were in one of those car crashes instead of watching this piece of drek...",

            "content": "Not as though we needed any more evidence, but if there was any doubt about the talents of Jake Gyllenhaal then let Nightcrawler be the final word in the statement that he is one of the most impressive actors working today, as his creation of Louis Bloom is a creation for the ages in screenwriter Dan Gilroy's impressive feature debut that has some harsh points to make about today's modern day media techniques and makes them with a modern day Travis Bickle like central figure.\n\nWhile the city of Los Angeles is impressively captured here, a night time lit city of crime and desperate figures, while James Newton Howard's subtle yet effective score plays out as proceedings grow ever darker and while Gilroy's smart direction and unique script takes shape there is nothing that compares to Bloom. A haunted eyed loner who wants nothing more than success, no matter the cost, is a vile yet undeniably watchable figure that prowls on anything or anyone as long as he can achieve his questionable goals. From the moment we first meet Bloom in a restricted zone at a city train track through to the tense and white knuckle finale, Bloom is the cold blooded beating heart of the film and his rise from wannabe crime videographer through to aspiring businessman is one that will keep you well and truly glued to your seat even if proceedings sometimes take a turn for the unbelievable a little to often. Gyllenhaal deserves plaudits for sinking completely into Bloom, from his gaunt physical appearance, his empty yet razor sharp eyes and his general characteristic tics, this really is a full bodied performance that makes Gilroy's film more than the sum of its parts.\n\nWhile everything is professionally done in a production sense, Nightcrawler's greatest weakness is strangely found within it's narrative arc. Bloom's rise up the ranks of the local TV station is worryingly quick, his dealings with Rene Russo's desperate news station head Nina doesn't always ring true, Bloom failing to be penalised for obvious crime scene breaches make you scratch your head and Bloom's rivalry with Bill Paxton's industry veteran Joe takes a far fetched and in the end underplayed turn that feels like it belongs to another movie. It's a shame that so many elements of Bloom's story feel to far flung from reality, as when Nightcrawler strikes a believable cord it's a striking indictment of the modern day media circus and an often hugely original big screen picture.\n\nWhile not all elements ring true in this impressive feature, Nightcrawler is a great debut by Dan Gilroy. There's yet another award calibre showcase performance by the increasingly great Gyllenhaal and the journey into the mind of a man so concerned with his goal no matter the obstacles that may hamper his cause is an entertaining one. Nightcrawler is a thriller of the highest order and a depraved tale set in the city of Angels that deserves to be seen.\n\n4 abnormal job interviews out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

Gyllenhaal is superb in the lead role, cementing his place as one of the best leading men in Hollywood.  He brings the perfect combination of creepiness & charm to Lou Bloom, that even when he commits despicable acts, you still manage to root for & even like him.  Plus, while he does lie to avoid the law, he is honest about what he is, proudly stating \"When you see me, I hope it's the worst day of your life\".  He gets great support from the rest of the cast, particularly Rene Russo (in one of her best performances) as a TV exec ensnared by a monster she helped create.  Behind the camera, Gilroy crafts a ruthless crime thriller, never shying away from the gruesome aspects of Bloom's job and what he will do to accomplish it.  He doesn't cheat on the ending either (the last line is especially chilling) though more background into Bloom would have been nice (he's already established as as sociopath from the first scene).  Overall, one of the best films of 2014 and best crime-noir films in years.",

Most of the footage here is at night and it's slick with a pulsating score (but not quite Michael Mann slick).  Gyllenhaal is also slick in a robotic way but with no empathy for people and a cold hearted willingness to manipulate them for his own ends.  That's probably all you need to know.  This is director Dan (brother of Tony) Gilroy's first directorial outing after a number of undistinguished screenplays.  His wife, Rene Russo, stars as a TV news producer who desperately needs crime and accident footage to boost the ratings of her station; good to see her again (since roles for older women are so rare), but it's a one-note role.  Bill Paxton is here too with not that much to do.  Riz Ahmed has the only human-seeming character (as Gyllenhaal's assistant), almost more than one-dimensional. So, in the end, this is a character study with a not-so-new message about the bloodthirsty news media that wants to be a thriller (and does feel thrilling at times) but, alas, it is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, like so many others of its ilk.",

The film follows the newfound career of Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), who follows police calls to capture the aftermath of crimes in the streets of Los Angeles. As one might expect, this makes for an interesting premise, and things get more intriguing as Bloom develops a relationship with a needy managing director at a last-place local broadcast\naffiliate named Nina (Rene Russo). The thirst for capturing carnage on camera only increases as the film progresses, and this leads Bloom to take more risks in order to quench it.\n\nGyllenhaal definitely deserves recognition for his portrayal of this character, as he's probably borderline psychotic (think a more toned down version of Heath Ledger's Joker). This transcends his dialogue - even his body language and actions support this. Russo also gives a strong performance, as it's obvious her \"been around the block\" persona fits her role well. As for the other elements of the film, 'Nightcrawler' hits the mark across the board, following an arc that makes sense, building steadily to a crescendo of a wild ride that is a fitting way to cap off the film. The fact that the film takes place nearly entirely at night is also a nice touch, as audiences see LA differently than they do during the hot, sun-soaked day. And then, you can't ignore the solid soundtrack by James Newton Howard, which brings out the best moments that transpire on screen.\n\nDespite minimal box office attention, 'Nightcrawler' received a good amount of critical acclaim, including an Academy Award nomination for its screenplay and a Golden Globe nomination for Gyllenhaal, and the film will likely serve as a model for future indie thrillers.",

He excels at turning his protagonist from relatable, down-and-out dreamer to over-confident, opportunistic, sadist in one breath. This is certainly a career best for him. \n\nBeyond the pertinent themes and Oscar-worthy performance from Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler also boasts some beautiful, metropolitan nighttime photography (specifically, Los Angeles). Not since Michael Mann's Collateral (also set in LA) has a city been so fantastically realized as its own character. It's seedy. It's scandalous. It's parasitic. It's not unlike the protagonist.\n\nOne of the best films of 2014, it's a shame that Nightcrawler didn't get the kind of awards attention that it deserved. No matter. This thriller will most likely develop a cult following and a deserved place in the cinematic discourse that dwarves anything that films like American Sniper or The Imitation Game can hope to achieve.",

After realizing this isnt a one man job, Lou hires an assistant named Rick (Riz Ahmed) and Lou tries to train him. The beef of the movie is found when Lou and Rick stumble upon a shooting at a mansion. I cant go into more detail without spoiling the movie so I will leave it at that. First off, I loved this movie, I really did. I believe that Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job protraying his character. I also believe Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed did a pretty good job in there charcters as well. The eerie lighting, the writing and directing were great in this movie as well. To be honest, I haven'tbeen that into a movie like that in a very long time. The 3rd act had me glued to the seat in suspense. You may be wondering why i didn't rate it 5 with all of this praise, but the problem I have with this movie is it isn't good enough to be five stars.

Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Lou Bloom, a very unusual, eccentric, off-putting individual. Desperate to make his way in the world he will do for us all the things we are appealed to imagine, for the sake of entertainment.\nHis character is not well rounded but very well written. In this occasion a flat character is very fitting. He may be hard to identify with for most people, but as an anti-hero we will like disliking him.\nBut this movie could not have been so good without Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed that provide a high level of acting. Each of them contributes a great deal towards creating likeable, yet sad, characters.\nThe point of the movie is not just to entertain, but perhaps to open the viewer's eyes. The approach to the subject of hot scoops, and live news media may be very realistic, but that's a good thing.\nThe dark and grim plot is well planned. The movie offers a hard look at today's news rooms and field reporters from deep behind the curtain, and it looks rotten. With hard criticism, this picture offers a look at what is wrong in modern society as ratings created not only by media but by the viewers create the demand for such gore.\nThe detective and mystery theme is mostly overlooked however, and initially I wished it would have been addressed more. The movie mostly revolves around the drama happening around Lou.\nOn the other hand, perhaps it is was the right way to go. Focusing on the mystery and detective story would either diminish the main story, or otherwise put an unnecessary strain on the plot. \nIt was hard to watch, but there is no doubt Dan Gilroy has created a good movie. All in all, the grade A is very fitting here.",

When I frist saw the name of this film, I thought 'awesome, a spinoff movie for Kurt Wagner, the X-Man known as Nightcrawler.' I quickly found out this was not the case, and that the film was, in fact, about cameramen chasing news stories in the middle of the night. While the film is set in that world, it is about something much different.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal gives a commanding performance as Lou, the small-time crook turned nightcrawler. The character is truly unique, being somewhat removed from human emotion, while understanding the power of negotiation and smart business practice. He hires Rick (played very twitchily by Riz Ahmed) as his employee, and they build up quite a workplace culture. Lou also develops a tumultuous relationship with Nina (played stoically by Rene Russo), the director of a local news show, who he sells his footage to.\n\nHere's the thing: the movie is actually about good management in the workplace culture. Yes, the two main characters sit in a car looking for accidents to film, but they frequently discuss working conditions, compensation, and obedience. There's even a bit about not reading memos. Lou has a very logical, non-nonsense approach to his business. He knows how to negotiate, when he can hold fast, and when he must back away. He does it all calmly, and does a lot of research.\n\nIt's a gripping film with many layers to it, even though there isn't any teleporting in it at all.",

Yet even the most positive corporate attitude isn't worth the paper it's printed on if nobody's hiring.\n\nEver the entrepreneur, Lou tries his hand at the nocturnal profession of nightcrawling, an ethically borderline job that has him tracking down violent crime stories and shooting video for the highest bidding news network. If Lou is one thing, he's driven.\n\nBut of course he isn't just one thing. Besides being driven, he's also psychotic, willing to go to absurd lengths to beat the competition (and the police) to the scene, however dangerous. Lou goes from being a messenger to being an agent of death.\n\nWriter-director Dan Gilroy's screenplay blends tone and genre in interesting ways, using noirish strokes to paint over a sneakily comic premise that's already pitch black itself. It isn't a satire insomuch that the extremes to which Lou goes for a piece of footage are unrealistic (some journalists will tell you otherwise), but that his dedication to those entrepreneurial platitudes is often played for chuckles as much as it intends to put us on edge.\n\nIt's a difficult tone for Gyllenhaal to navigate, but he manages to pull it off. I cracked a smile more than a few times while still being deeply unsettled by this character. His nightcrawler really worms (no pun intended) his way under your skin, and stays there. He even dropped 30 pounds for the role, the contours of his now skeletal frame accentuated by the evocative lighting.\n\nWhile it's clearly Gyllenhaal's show, special mention should be made for his costar Rene Russo, playing the unscrupulous TV news director who initially encourages Lou's disquieting fascination with nightcrawling.\n\nAnother star, albeit one behind the camera, is director of photography Bob Elswit. He shoots L.A. after dark as a unique vision of Hell, where police lights flicker in lieu of flames, overseen by a million evil eyes that take the shape of television screens. Here's hoping he can nab some awards love this season.",

The crux of the story may seem somewhat mundane, even when things start getting intense as moral boundaries are tested, this could have been an average movie. However, with great directing by Dan Gilroy and an excellent performance by Jake Gynllenhaal, this film becomes exceptional. \n\nFrom the beginning you are interested in Lou, he is courteous and intelligent but as he shows from his first encounter with a person, a darker side lies just beneath the surface. Jake Gynllenhaal does an excellent job of portraying Lou, being respectable one minute only to lash out the next. Lou is a really interesting character that continues to push the boundaries of his world, like only a sociopath could, and although you may not agree with his actions, sometimes not even able to fathom the ease with which he makes them, it just makes him even more so one of the most interesting characters ever.\n\nRene Russo plays a desperate newsroom director and Riz Ahmed - a homeless man desperate for a job, both play their characters well and it's no surprise that their best scenes are when Lou slowly turns away from being a friend to taking full advantage of them. Bill Paxton is his usual scene stealing self, adding some humour to a dark movie while also giving us the media mantra that this film takes to its logical end, \"if it bleeds, it leads.\"\n\nThis film not only delivers one of the most intriguing characters ever, it also portrays the media for what is has become, obsessed with ratings, following in the footsteps of other great news movies like Network (1976). I also found that its follow through of the American Dream was interesting because although we have had flawed protagonists, a la Henry Hill or Jordan Belfort, I feel like Louis Bloom creates a class of his own.\n\nThis film may be hard to watch over and over again, because there is no character that you are constantly rooting for. Lou's decisions left me walking away from the film conflicted as to if he was actually the protagonist or not. However this film is definitely one of the most thrilling movies of the year and one of the most interesting. A must see movie of 2014.",

He's kind of smart too - he is learning new tricks rapidly and he has some sort of controll.\n\nThe plot is engaging and you are glued to the screen, even during the build up. Gyllenhaal has done some brilliant films lately and once again he steals the show. Still, he's well supported by a great cast and a super script. It looks really nice and there are few flaws here. The lead's crazy actions and the added realism is making it very watch worthy.\nIt's pretty twised, thrilling and has a great dialogue. I can also sense similarities from films like \"Drive\" and Cronenberg's \"Crash\".\n\nA terrific film that is smart, scary, creative, interesting and intense.\n\n8.5 out of 10 freelance companies.",

            "content": "\"A friend is a gift you give yourself.\"\n\n That's just a taste of the twisted logic from Dan Gilroy's protagonist Louis Bloom, played in spectacular fashion by a riveting Jake Gyllenhaal in the latest Fall '14 winner, Nightcrawler. As a first time director, Dan Gilroy, previously known for writing middling fare such as Real Steel and The Bourne Legacy, surprises with this L.A. thriller about a creepy loser who finds unlikely night work. \n\nNightcrawler represents a whole new level of acting from it's star Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal has been on a role lately with Prisoners, End of Watch and the little seen puzzler Enemy. But Nightcrawler puts him in line for his second Oscar nomination (he was previously nominated for 2005's Brokeback Mountain). As the sociopathic opportunist Louis Bloom, Gyllenhaal constructs a truly frightening persona of misanthropy, avarice and grandiose self-delusion. Seeking to earn money and fame by filming car crashes and homicides on the streets of L.A., Louis sells his violent, exploitative clips to a desperate nightly news producer played by Rene Russo. Russo, older but still strikingly beautiful, happens to be Gilroy's wife in real life. Lucky man. \n\nNo match for Bloom's twisted world view, she soon is dependent on his ill-gotten fare, and the film spirals toward it's spectacular conclusion with the audience not really knowing who to cheer for. Gyllenhaal's creation owes a debt to the dangerous loner Travis Bickle from Scorsese's Taxi Driver, but something about the tech-savvy, motivational speaker mindset of Louis Bloom makes him a mutated, less accessible and more sinister prodigy of DeNiro's classic anti-hero. Not to be missed.",

But in any ways, he wants to prove that he is right in every way. He can have debates with you, and he has rules.

            "content": "They only come out at night. Creatures that lurk beneath the darkness of night to stalk prey and attack when needed, especially if it benefits them greatly. This doesn't fit the model of a horrid, ugly monster from classic horror flicks, but a weirdly, driven young man named Lou Bloom. He enters Nightcrawler as an entirely different type of monster that is all the more frightening since this type of person is prevalent in various forms of society. Equipped with a camera and a distorted view of morality, Bloom mirrors the culture that we inhabit and presents a stark portrayal of values that don't seem that farfetched from the norm today. Nightcrawler is a dark thriller with a biting satirical edge that is hard to look away from, much like the blood and guts mentality of media that is being broken down to a mere nub. \n\nSet in Los Angeles, Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a young thief with simply no ambition to be anything more. He takes what he can get and moves on, selling what he can get his hands on. Lou knows how to sell himself and is great with numbers and statistics. He follows the market and is a quick learner, all of these things would be invaluable for any employer but for whatever reason, it hasn't worked out that way. Late one night, he sees a car wreck where cops are desperately trying to get a woman out of a burning car. Intrigued, amazed and curious he walks up to the wreck to get a closer look, but is met with disdain by the cops as well as a veteran cameraman Joe Loder (Bill Paxton). He finds a news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) at a local TV station that shares his views on the \"If it bleeds, it leads mantra''. Now hooked on documenting chaos and mayhem to viewers with an assistant Rick (Riz Ahmed), he finds himself entrenched in freelance crime journalism. But he quickly succumbs to immoral acts to further his new found career and make himself the star of his own story. \n\nGyllenhaal is a barreling train of madness and ferocity that is impossible to look away. He simply takes over the role and the entire movie. Bloom is such an interesting character that you don't mind to see more of him. His performance is simply revelatory as the ghoulishly fun Lou Bloom who looks somewhat of a normal, unassuming guy. But that just makes him all the more dangerous. Gyllenhaal transforms into the role like it's someone else's skin and the look he portrays is heavily apparent. From the sleek, bony cheekbones, bug eyes and slicked back hair, he looks something more of a lizard than a man. The dedication that Gyllenhaal showed is shocking and impressive. Getting ones weight down to 180 and going days without eating hardly anything is nothing short of insane. \n\nHe was all over the place with a firm grip on what he wants, needs and aspires to have. There is nothing in the world that he can't have and nothing is off limits to him. For much of the movie he is in control, a situation that he loves being in. But sometimes he isn't in control and it's a scenario that he can't understand. The perplexing conundrums that he finds himself in are fun to watch and especially to see if he can get out of them in one piece. And that's where it gets really entertaining. He attacks with vitriol at any and every corner where you're left dumbfounded to what just happened. His quick mind and even quicker mouth are more lethal than a machine gun. When he is on, he fires on all cylinders. Bloom is so overconfident that it's hard to not be a little impressed by him. He talks the talk and walks the walk with gusto like he's the CEO of a fortune 500 company. \n\nRusso was just as good as the no nonsense station manager. She quickly shows Bloom the ropes where he unexpectedly picks up rather quickly, maybe too quickly for her tastes. She's basically the only one who can challenge and test Bloom and push him to get her that story of violence and calamity that she thrives for. Russo has never been stronger or more in charge here and she really kicks some ass here. She is intimidating in ways different than Bloom but also someone you don't want to cross. But it's when she is at her most vulnerable that gives you an entirely different look at her and maybe shows some compassion for her. \n\nYou can tell she has never been in that position or made to feel that way and you know she would rather be anywhere else in the world. Russo shows some great range here as she tip toes the balance beam of morality. Ahmed had some impressive work here too as the diligent assistant who may be getting in over his head. He was the conscience of Bloom who constantly asks if the things they are doing are right. But he is as desperate as Bloom is and is willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. \n\nThe way Bloom is portrayed, you'd think he'd be an unlikable, disgusting villain, but the more you look at the overall situation, he quickly becomes less and less of a villain. We don't know Blooms backstory, but we don't need too. We know enough of what he is and what he wants. If he wasn't in freelance crime journalism, he more than likely would have found something else but he just happened to fall into it. But he is simply adapting to the culture around him by any means necessary. The media will always be seen and portrayed as blood starved vultures that will pick at the bones of a rotting corpse till there's nothing left, then move on to the next one. It's a system that perpetuates an endless cycle of violence during all hours of the day where audiences inadvertently get sucked in. People love violence and seeing someone else that isn't their family or friends in life and death peril. He's just giving them what they want and what does it matter if it's staged or not.\n\nBlood sells more than a happy ending and a perfect shot is the difference between indifference and shock and awe. Despite all the horrible things he has done over the course of the movie, and there are a large number of them, you still want to root for him in the end. Everyone should have a dream and he is going for that dream. He doesn't really have any inherent qualities that make him likable or someone you would want as a friend. But the way he speaks is mesmerizing and you oddly want to hear him talk for hours on end. He is like a machine, cold, calculating, focused and driven to a fault. He breaks everything down so succinctly that he could have been a presidential candidate. Bloom can talk his way out of anything while still thinking of the bottom line. He sees the big picture out of everything and anything. \n\nDirector/screenwriter Dan Gilroy really went all out for his first film and excelled where others more than likely not have. He has a great knack for storytelling and character dissections with a distinct noir feeling. He transports you to another world that you don't really want to peer into, given how terrible it is. It starts off slow to show ample screen time to Blooms character, but really steps into high gear as the movie goes on. It's paced very well where there is always something you can take from every scene. Nothing feels wasted or as if it didn't deserve to be there. His screenplay is very different than any other film he has written for. Knowing that he wrote the screenplay for Two For The Money and Real Steel would make you think that Nightcrawler would be an entirely different movie, but it surpassed all expectations to catapult him as a serious director worth looking at. The script was very impressive and one of the sharpest I have heard in a long while, Gone Girl also fits this category with a brilliant script. It crackles with ugliness and truth that's a feast for the ears. \n\nI could listen to Bloom sprout off statistics and trends at rapid fire succession for days on end. The script perfectly centers on Gyllenhaal's performance as Bloom where he makes everything around him his playground. Hearing Nina break down what makes a story worth reporting was disgusting and horrible in every way but a truth that should be revealed but in reality is not. It shows how much they rely on race to sell, frighten and intrigue viewers amid a false backdrop of endless violence. Knowing what makes a newsroom tick was a dirty experience that makes one want to take a shower afterwards to get all that dirt and grime off of one's body. One of the most uncomfortable scenes was Bloom deciphering his prey and was like watching a vivisection right in front of you. Bloom cut everything down till there was nothing left and all you can do was sit there shocked. Another great scene was Bloom bargaining his footage to Nina. He talks so fluidly that it didn't seem there was even a stop for him to breathe. He lays down his terms with dominance and assurance, already knowing beforehand that he will get what he wants. He talks directly to the camera with no cutting away, then inches closer and closer where you see more of Bloom that you would want. You once again become entrenched in his presence, creepy face and cunning, conniving wordplay all at once.\n\nThe orchestration by James Newton Howard was great and added another layer to the moodiness of Los Angeles and a perfect backdrop to the dark environments of mayhem. He has scored some of the greatest thrillers of all time with The Fugitive, The Dark Knight and The Sixth Sense. The chilling, tense score gave for a steely feeling while watching. It made it feel colder and detached. The lighting gave it a horror type feel and made Bloom that much more menacing and brought out his devilish tendencies within. But sometimes it's when he is shown in full light that makes him even creepier as the night suits him more. Countless shots show his face shrouded in darkness as it glosses over his eyes as if he's an entirely different being. You want to inspect him like any curious observer but more so in the darkness where he can fully reveal himself to the creature he really is.\n\nNightcrawler speaks to the consumer culture that has purported throughout society and is becoming a driving force for people to succeed. Bloom sees something of value and takes it by any means necessary for himself or for sale. Everything can be taken and sold to the highest bidder and it doesn't matter how it was obtained. The drive to get to the top by hurting all those who stand in your way is one of the reasons why the economy is in the toilet. People crush and harm others, blissfully spending money then are shocked when the bubble bursts. The distortion of success is revealed as nothing but a shallow fallacy built upon lies, deception and bodily, emotional harm to others. \n\nThe wish to become something else and create something grand drives Bloom to sociopathy. He wants to be appreciated for his hard work even if it came at the cost of others and doesn't look back on what he has done and only looks forward to what he can create. His coldness and apathy to all that befalls around him is terrifying and startling but a mirror image to the culture that perpetuates the notion that wealth can only be achieved by any means necessary. I know some movies will have comparisons to Nightcrawler, but I was reminded of A Shock To The System starring a brilliantly insane Michael Caine. He himself also was downtrodden by the system that turned to murder to achieve wealth and influence. Caine was also likable and someone you wanted to get away in the end. Don't know why it's so easy to like evil characters like these but it's the way that they go about it and how they want something different for themselves, like many of us.\n\nThere were some really great sequences here starting with Bloom amassing his clips and slowly building his influence. Nina talking to the newscasters was really fun and shows how quick newscasters are as they have to listen, think and speak at a moment's notice, fitting what they just heard in a comprehensible way that would fit in the newscast. The climactic ending was fast paced, thrilling, nail biting and shocking. It really was a great piece of action filmmaking that went all out. I loved the ending and really fell into place when all the dust settled.\n\nNightcrawler gave the media the punch in the arm it deserves and needed with a brilliantly transformative performance by Jake Gyllenhaal . In an amoral world, it's the ones who thinks of ones feelings and repercussions that are viewed as weird or strange and not the other way around. Those types of people don't survive in today's world as the ugliness of society slowly creeps into the mainstream taking over what is good and right. It presents a dark social commentary that rivals Gone Girl in every way while still remaining its own singular film. It's grotesque, immoral, sleek and too smart for its own good to become one of the best thrillers all year. Given how used we are to violence and sex at all corners of the day, hopefully this won't fall on deaf ears and we miss the point entirely, going on to watch the next report of a person getting maimed as the newscasters graphically tell every detail. If one can take one thing away from Nightcrawler, is that we have to change how we digest and interpret media and life and death onscreen. Lou Bloom should not be looked up too but should be feared as an all too real personification of society. Five invasive, graphic, gory, immoral news reports out of five.",

The plot is original and keeps you on the edge of your seat, in a very bizarre way. The cast play feed off of his energy in a most exciting way.

He's the perverted evil of the American Dream taken to the limit, much like Michael Douglas in Wall Street, but for our generation. A man raised on the Internet, with no prospects, but the ruthlessness to do ANYTHING for the footage. The scary part to me, is that, much like Gordon Gecko, there are too many people out there who will see Louis Bloom as a hero worth emulating. Perhaps it goes a little extreme at the end, but I feel like this isn't that far a stretch.\n\nThe LA scenery at night makes it a whole different world, and Gyllenhaal, who lost weight and started staying up all night to prepare for the role, looks perfectly like the creature he is, and fits the role ideally. Rene Russo is nearly pitiable as his counterpart, the news director of the lowest rated network, who partners with Lou, and brings out the worst in each.\n\nWe see Lou descend from beginner to cutthroat shark over the course of the movie, willing to destroy anything and anyone who stands in his way, including a competitor who tries to partner with him, and his own assistant/partner. \n\nThere's moments of comedy in this satire, but they're few and far between. Most of all, I couldn't take my eyes off the compelling story of this ruthless sociopath. From the first scene where we see him get a watch, to the end, this is not a normal man, but you know he's going to the top...\n\nFeels like a lot in common with To Die For as well as Network, but updated for the Internet Age.\n\nDo not miss this one, but it isn't for kids.",

The theme of how twisted media coverage of crime has become and the character of Lou Bloom. Gyllenhaal expertly plays this character who is creepy, yet friendly, and who gets under your skin in such a strange, uncomfortable way. The movie plays out brilliantly because throughout the plot we are unsure of the true nature of Lou Bloom due to him being such a strange character. We don't know if he's psychotic or just a little off. So for the entire movie we try to figure out what is up with this guy until the end of the climax when his true, dark nature is revealed. \nThe film is full of suspense. This for one reason; we don't know what Lou Bloom is capable of. We are left in a constant state of suspense because the character is so unpredictable and the lingering glimpses that we are given into his dark nature as the film plays out makes us suspect that at any moment he will do something completely insane. I think Nightcrawler is one of the best movies of 2014. I think the plot is really great, especially for it being a character-driven movie, the performances were all very good, Gyllenhaal's, of course, being exceptional, the soundrack was perfect, and the filmography was on par, even if it was a little heavy on the shaky cam.",

What Nightcrawler made up for in terrific acting from Jake (albeit, with some awkwardly placed music in the background) it lost with poor characters in his partner and the women who he sells his videos too. My guess is that Jake wanted most of the film to be on him, so he made sure that the other two main characters did not get much screen-time. The whole film centers around him, which can be made effective at points, however, I just didn't understand the point of it all. Sure it made some subtly social commentary and followed Jake Gyllenhaal's wacko character, but I just didn't get why the characters were doing what they were doing. I would have liked to see Jakes character receive some attention from the public in order to fuel his ego. As he says in the film, \"why he wants it is more important than what he wants\". That being said, I just did not understand \"why\" he wanted to do this. Given that reasoning, it made him seem plain old crazy, which I never like to see out of a character no matter how \"crazy\" they might seem. All in all a solid film, I say B+.

It's not really all that suspenseful, but it is beautifully shot and pretty well acted.  Jake Gyllenhaal does his best to be creepy and unlikeable and it succeeds.  The problem with films like these, is that there, normally is something at least likeable and or redeemable about the character, but Lou Bloom is not a good character.  He's a slimy piece of shit, and unfortunately that's not really what keeps me watching a movie and or engaged.  The cinematography is stunning though and it's a good performance.  It's a hard movie for me to rate because there is no likeable character among the bunch and it goes about saying what has been said in other movies recently about how the media shows us a skewed view on reality and what not.  Renee Russo also does a good job here, but again, no likeable characters, a bizarre story--a good one--but bizarre.  I think the story, cinematography, acting, and direction are all really, really good...but bizarre.  I couldn't look away, but I didn't really have any other reason to keep watching other than I rented it because I thought it could be good so in other words, I already spent the money and that's that.",

Jake Gyllenhaal gives us an inside look at a sociopath and he's shockingly good. \n\n\"If it bleeds, it leads.\" Every broadcaster and journalist knows this sentence in the media world, but Lou Bloom (Gyllenhaal) takes this sentence to heart and then some. First time writer and director Dan Gilroy gives us an eerie story of broadcasting gone mad. Yes, it's media satire but that's what makes this film so compelling. It draws you in slowing and never lets you go. Bloom is a freelance TV news cameraman who takes pleasure in other people's nightmare. Bloom has no morals and doesn't care who it is or how badly they're hurt. He just wants to get the 'perfect shot' to tell the L.A. audience a powerful story. He'll do what ever it takes to get to the top of the newsroom and that's what makes him so morbid. \n\nThe fact is, throughout the film we never know how far Bloom will push to get what he wants. He'll move bodies for better camera angles or go into crime scenes before the police get there just to film someone bleeding out. It's scary, intelligent and couldn't have been done with out a provocative performance from Gyllenhaal. From the moment Bloom puts his hair up into a man bun and slimes down to the L.A. nightlife of bloody car wrecks/shootouts, you're hooked. Gyllenhaal's sociopathic performance will also creep the hell out of you big-time. His eerie acting reminded me of other star-struck sociopath's on film like Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) in Taxi Driver. \n\nIn addition, there are other great performances by an ethically corrupt Rene Russo (Bloom's news director) and a skittish Riz Ahmed (Bloom's camera assistant). Nightcrawler is sleek, thought-provoking and will have you grappling on the edge of your seat throughout the film. The film also sheds light to the brilliant side of broadcasting lingo, film junkies will eat it up. Gilroy displays his potential as a first time director and Gyllenhaal rises to the occasion in a potent performance. It's truly a breakthrough in acting for him. In the media world how far would you go to push your agenda and throw ethics out the window? Lou Bloom showed us how far he'd go in the end and it's definitely haunting.",

            "content": "\"My motto is if you want to win the lottery you've got to make money to get a ticket.\"\n\nWhat a brilliant performance by Gyllenhaal in this rather morbid and exciting thriller. At times I was wondering whether it was meant to be amusing and jokingly or that it was intended to be presented as a serious and shocking story. Judging from my own chuckling at times and disbelief about what was being shown, I could only conclude that ultimately it was a mix of both. And it's masterly portrayed by Gyllenhaal, the chameleon of Hollywood and someone I do appreciate very much as an actor. After his appearance in \"Prisoners\" (which was an exceptionally exciting film) and the arty movie \"Enemy\" (as a story it was not my cup of tea, but in terms of performances it was again a success) just like Matthew McConaughey in \"Dallas Buyers Club\" he transformed physically into a gaunt, pale-looking good-for-nothing. Initially, he looks like a marginal person with a mental disability, but as you get to know him better, you come to the conclusion that he's extremely intellectual and has a kind of photographic memory. The way he quotes chunks of information that he has read on the Internet is pretty impressive. Louis Bloom is not exactly a simple figure but rather a cunning and manipulative character.\n\nThe whole story starts with Lou in the process of cutting a fence. He's initially no more than an insignificant criminal who earns his money by stealing copper and the like. Until he witnesses an accident one night on one of the highways around Los Angeles and he sees a freelance reporter (Bill Paxton) capturing the whole thing on film and after wards selling it to the highest possible price so that it can be used for the morning news. Lou doesn't waste any time and purchases a simple camcorder and police scanner. Immediately an assistant (Riz Ahmed) is being contracted and he hits the streets every night to film police interventions. His unconstrained personality and unscrupulous approach, ensure that he can capture pretty sensational images, allowing him to conquer a permanent position at the local station KWLA6. Here it's Nina Romina (Rene Russo) who rules as news editor. The straightforward film style of Lou appeals to her. As a sensation channel the presented footages can't be bloody enough. As she clearly stated : \"The best and clearest way that I can phrase it for you, to capture the spirit of what we air, is think of our news cast as a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut\".\n\nAs the title \"Nightcrawler\" partially reveals it, most of the scenes are made during the night in the city of Los Angeles. This provides some beautiful nighttime shots with Lou speeding around in his shabby car (which subsequently will be replaced by a flashy sports car) through the streets on his way to a variety of calamities he has overheard by using the scanner. He's a \"disaster tourist\" equipped with a camera. The film is an indictment against the growing sensationalism in contemporary reporting. The look and shocking effect takes precedence over content and objectivity. You can compare it with the bread and circuses in the Roman Empire. Lou is the personification of this somewhat repulsive attitude. On the one hand he's quite insane and frightening. On the other hand he's a real goal getter who misuses the Achilles heel of the media world in a shrewd way to benefit from. One man's loss in this case is Lou's gain.\n\nThat the masterful rendition by Gyllenhaal, as the extremely manipulative and creepy Lou, takes on the lion's share of this exciting and simultaneously satirical film, is beyond dispute. But the supporting characters contributions are as important,convincing and certainly successful. First there is Riz Ahmed as the pitiful Rick, the assistant Lou has chosen in between, after a rather absurd interview. Rick is the prime example of someone who can use the money and who's offered the job because he has a smart phone with GPS function. He's overwhelmed by the silver-tongued Lou and him being a dogsbody after wards was also predictable. No wonder you instantly think he's likable. It was also a pleasant surprise to see Rene Russo acting again as Nina Romina, the unyielding editor without a conscience. I haven't seen her after \"Lethal Weapon 3\". The fact Dan Gilroy is her husband, probably made sure that the selection criteria were flexible. Yet this wasn't a bad interpretation and you witnessed the way Lou gradually took control over this seemingly fragile little personality.\n\nIt was clear how it would end eventually. Although there was a choice between two possible denouements (two logical endings that arose to me spontaneously), the end was still intense and surprising. A disgusting example of self-centeredness and self-preservation. An example of which way our society is going and how people disregard ethics. The moral of the story is that there is a lack of morality in the media landscape and society today. Does this sound pretty cynical, nasty or downright morbid to you ? I'd suggest to take a look at yourself in an honest way and think whether or not you would slow down when passing a traffic accident in order to catch a glimpse of a victim? Or you'd return home quickly to zap to a news channel just because you have heard a disaster happened somewhere ? You come to the conclusion after wards that we are all a little bit like Lou. Disturbing ? Yep ! \n\nMore reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",

However, the real focus here is on the development of Jake Gyllenhaal's character, which pushes the film towards its complications. Gyllenhaal delivers one of those performances that transports you into his world, engulfing you in his motives, ideas and realities. It was one of those films where the central character's performance was the cream filling.\n\nHowever, it did help having a very well written script from Dan Gilroy, who also directed the film effortlessly, but with such thrill. What's even more disturbing is how Gyllenhaal 's mind-numbingly sensational performance failed to nab an oscar nomination. I mean, his eyes just spoke volumes every time his face faced the camera.\n\nNo, Nightcrawler is no masterpiece. But it's an intense, disturbing and utterly engrossing film that, without Gyllenhaal, almost seems pointless.",

His non-exiting sense of moral and strict business attitude makes him one of the best in business and he will allow nothing and no-one to get in his way...\nThe movie is totally engulfed by the powerhouse portrayal of Jake Gyllenhaal. His gaunt physique and manic way of talking and moving really shows his range as an actor and with the way the character was also written, you really don't know what he will do next.\nStorywise this also is nicely unique, telling about the nightcrawlers, the news sniffers who get by by shooting the crime scenes moments after the crime has happened. It also was nice social study of the morality of news television, where the news doesn't sometimes care about the actual story but only about the news' bankability.\nA great opening from Dan Gilroy, first time behing the director's seat.",

The setting of all-night Los Angeles reminds me of Jamie Foxx & Tom Cruises`s ``Collateral``, but less stylized and with more of a Reality TV direction, much like the television series Cops. There are some times when I find Gyllenhaal unable to mask his technical efforts, where his depictions come off forced, and there are moments when Bloom feels more like a movie character instead of a real person.

Soon after Lou commits an act of battery, he stumbles upon an accident scene where he is mesmerized by the work of some news videographers and the apparent lucrative nature of their work. So taken is he by it that Lou obtains low level equipment enabling him to do the same type of work however the nature of his videos are far more graphic than the norm and over time his methods of obtaining footage become quite questionable, bordering on illegal. His work (and an unexplained accident) soon allows him to supplant the video jocks that have been on the scene for years. Lou seems to stop at nothing to obtain his oh-so-precious footage. Repeatedly, he commits crime by proxy to serve his own needs and those of a struggling news director. Not only did Gyllenhaal lose weight, but he had to lose himself in order to play this part so well. Hats off to Rene Russo (playing Nina) as well, whose timing is impeccable when her character is provoked and questioned by Lou incessantly. He asks her for things that she wants not to give, but she realizes the symbiotic relationship that she is bound to form with Lou in order to survive. Their bond is crucial, creepy, and disturbing. The same can be said for Lou's bond with his assistant, Rick, as well (played by Riz Ahmed). No one really means anything to Lou and it shows. They are simply means to an end and he will not be denied.",

The film also has some very large flaws in logic and plausibility.Some of the supporting characters could have been better as well.In other words it's an okay story with a great lead but suffers from some of the worst direction and tone and is completely overrated in the praise it's gotten as it could have been a great film had it been a little more grounded in realism and didn't pull so many punches.",

Featuring Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, and Bill Paxton, the casting is quite good; as are their performances.  Gyllenhaal in particular does an incredible job at creating a creepy, psychopathic character that's also strangely fascinating.  And, Gilroy's directing style adds an atmospheric tone and has a way of accentuating the themes of detachment and obsession.  Well-crafted and provocative, Nightcrawler is an extraordinary film that explores the culture of violence.",

Jake Gyllenhaal likened his character to a coyote and it really shows. Eye sockets dark and retreated, a lanking hunched over posture and an instinct for survival. No matter the cost.

Despite that he is a thief and a psychopath. When he catches a group of freelance camera crew (Lead by Bill Paxton in a slightly sleazy role). Which this group are into various different crimes and they sell the footage to the highest bidder for any news channel. Lou decides to do the same, at first, working alone but Lou is such a quick learner and he is very clever. He will do anything to keep at it, since it might be the only real thing, he is only good at until people get in his way.\n\nThe movie has excellent direction and writing from Dan Gilory (Which his screenplay was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, which it is well deserved). Sadly, the Academy missed out putting out an nomination for Gyllenhaal's incredible performance for Best Actor. Also Rene Russo is very good in her role as a power hunger news director. \n\n\"Nightcrawler\" is a thriller but it has many moments of darkly comic sequences and there is some real satire in the world of news. \"Nightcrawler\" is one of the best movies of 2014. The other highlights of this feature is the cinematography by Oscar-Winner:Robert Elswit (Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, The Town) and unique music score by James Netwon Howard (Alive, The Fugitive, Outbreak). In time, \"Nightcrawler\" will be a classic. It is the kind of movie, if you get into it. You find yourself watching it, time to time. It is just that good! Grade:A.",

The performances are fantastic and the world they build feels both fantastic and grounded in reality in a way that is terrifying. It shows the danger that lurks in our own neighborhoods and the lengths men will go to to get what they want. But let's break it down.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal stars as Louis Bloom a slightly unhinged man who gets into filming breaking news footage and selling it to a TV station. This gets interesting when he starts going to extreme lengths to get the best footage available. If I tell you anymore I will get into spoiler territory.\n\nThings I Liked\n\nJake Gyllenhaal.How Jake Gyllenhaal didn't get an Oscar nomination is beyond me. I heard gripes from many other film critics about the \"snub\" but after watching Nightcrawler I get it! Gyllenhaal had been someone who had yet to impress me but after this I can say I am impressed much more by him. He transformed into a different person and every moment he's on screen he is stealing every inch of it. Phenomenal.\n\nThe Pace. The movie flows. It moves. It goes from one thing to another in a way that keeps you interested. It doesn't drop that focus and you think that someone could get in serious danger in every moment of the film. The entire pace is perfect for the tension of the movie and the tension builds at every turn.\n\nThe tension. This entire movie hinges on tension and the tension is constant. Every moment is so intense you don't know whether someone is going to kill someone or whether they are gonna walk away and let it alone. Much of this is credited to Gyllenhaal's performance and much of it the way the screenplay flows through the movie.\n\nThing I Didn't Like\n\nSome lack of Reality. There are several moments where Bloom does things, well within view of police and they don't seem to notice him or do anything to stop him. Especially when he is obviously involved in some morally grey issues. I just couldn't by it the entire time and it threw me out of the film a little bit. Other than that I don't have too many issues with this one.\n\nOverall\n\nNightcrawler is an edge of your seat thrill ride that surpasses Gone Girl as the best one of last year, in my opinion at least. Gyllenhaal give a career changing performance that is so good at walking the line of charismatic and creepy. The movie holds your focus and keeps you wanting to watch more and more. Then when it ends you feel a little uncomfortable with the world that you live in because the scene is one that could happen in your neighborhood under different circumstances. 4.5/5",

The break-neck pace is all about being the first on the scene - murder, accidents, fires, mayhem - and selling the gratuitous footage to the local news stations. But the better he gets, the more likely he is going to become the next story.\r I heard so many great things about Nightcrawler. The critics said the same like, \"It's a flawless peace of entertainment\" or \"One of the best movie of the year\".- So I was looking forward to the movie by hearing all the good buzz from it, and after seeing it I can say that this movie is flawless.\r Jake Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performance he ever did in his career. He lost a lot of weight for this role and I can say it pays off so well. I love how he makes his character so creepy, but so interesting to watch on screen. I swear to god if he doesn't get a Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie, I will be angry and disappointed at the Oscars, because when I watch a movie and don't see the actor, just the character that right they is talent.\r The director of this movie (Dan Gilroy) and he was only a screenwriter for most of his career and this movie is his first time directing and my god his he brilliant. Dan Gilroy but a lot of effort in this movie and I heard that the director of the movie actually met some people who do these things that people call \"Nightcrawling\", and to me that shows that this guy should make more films in future, because he's the kind of director that movie need.\r The writing in this movie is some of the best writing I've seen since Boyhood, I mean every sentence in this movie glues me in it's story and character's. The move itself has that dark, uneasy and hash look to it, but that's life. The shots were good, the other cast member's were great as well.\r But as I said in my Interstellar and The Guest review, the movie isn't going to get the perfect rating of five out of five star's, but the movie is still brilliant.",

However, as long as one can over look the story's obvious absurdities it can be enjoyed as a compelling and superior thriller.\rJake Gyllenhaal is superb as the not unlikeable nutter who opportunistically decides to make a living by filming the misfortunes, injuries and death throes of others, which he then sells to TV. His total disdain for people and human life sets no bounds and this, in turn, leads him to TV news producer Renee Russo. She is fantastic as an ageing last chance producer who becomes entangled in his web. The scenes between them both literally crackle with there own kind of tension and are excellently written.\rThe movie, mainly shot at night, makes excellent use of its L. A. locations, and a couple of set pieces (a home invasion and a restaurant shoot out) are outstanding and demonstrate first rate examples of how to create sustained tension.

Luckily, I was able toIn 2012, Aaron Sorkin piloted a television program that educated, informed and entertained by nit-picking the issues of modern day television broadcasting, information distribution and most of all, societal perception. Luckily, I was able to stumble upon a clip of the opening monologue of the show via YouTube, which was recommendation by a friend. The monologue, delivered by Will McAvoy, played by the audacious Jeff Daniels, is single handedly, one of the greatest monologues in television history, describing the issues with contemporary American politics, government, its people and most of all, the media. Approaching its third (and final) season, The Newsroom has proved to be a champion of debunking the public\u2019s predictive perspective of hyped up terror scares, exploitation news broadcasting and television, as well as ginned up controversy.\r With Nightcrawler, writer/director Dan Gilroy feature film debut, the film delivers an almost complete counter-program to one of the best shows on television today, glorifying the exact same things The Newsroom is championing against. Yet, from the first dark scenes of trespassing to the final scenes of pure brutality and unimaginable corruption, Nightcrawler crawls up your skin and into our heads as one of the creepiest and feverishly uncomfortable films of 2014.\r Nightcrawler begins like any nightmare would, at night. Basked in the sketchy noir lights of an almost unrecognizable Los Angeles, similar to Newton Thomas Sigel\u2019s Los Angles in Refn\u2019s Drive, the night city is consumed by insomniacs and blood-thrity reporters looking to make money and a name for themselves based on the misfortunes and tragedies of others.\r One of those inhabitants is Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a fast-talking, quick learning creepy night-dweller who takes most of his knowledge and facts from the internet and disposes of his verbal jargon to anyone who crosses his path for his own interests. We first meet the Lou as a petty thief who cuts fences and steals manholes to make his money and earn a living. Bloom is a sociopath, and although we don\u2019t immediately connect with the character, never once asking the questions of how, why and for how long he has been living this life, we never really question him either.\r After successfully trading his stolen possession to a local scrap metal owner, where he unsuccessfully bargains the terms of an employment position, Lou drives onto the barren freeway in his dilapidated car, stumbling across a car on fire. After pulling over and being mesmerized by the deadly ambers igniting on the hood on the destroyed vehicle, two news photographers crash the scenes with their nightly lit cameras and gear. Like we\u2019ve seen before, Lou is no stranger to awkwardness, since he is as much an opportunist as he is a slimy insomniac, he offers his services to the \u2018nightcrawler photographer\u2019 Joe Loder (Bill Paxton). Rejected, Lou still feels that he has finally found his calling and with that, he steals an impressive racing bike on the Venice beach boardwalk in order to pay for a dodgy camcorder and cheap police scanner in order to begin his adventures as an amateurish nightcrawler.\r The film\u2019s success can easily be accountable to its transformative star Jake Gyllenhaal, who lost over twenty pounds for the role by biking and running to set and reportedly spending up to eight hours a day at the gym. The actor, who has been nothing but superb in a recent string of stirring films from Prisoners, Enemy, End of Watch and Source Code, delivers one of his finest and easily most haunting performances to date. Complete with bulging eyes, an Adam\u2019s apple and veins coursing the entirety of his body, Gyllenhaal proves that the simplest aesthetics are the scariest. Having no regard for human beings and enticing strangers with a jabber that is almost to quick to comprehend, Gyllenhaal\u2019s dedication to the sketchy Bloom is seen both physically and emotionally, as well and felt cold-heartedly and abruptly by its audience.\r Bloom strives off hard work as he proves, despite his better concern for the law, he is a hustler. Convincing himself as well as everyone around him his potential in an industry that strives off trespassing, seduction and lies, Bloom manipulates everyone for his own regard. Reciting over the same lines, whether it be to a new employee of his company during a job interview to a desperate and homeless Rick (Riz Ahmed), or convincing low-rating news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) of his potential of delivering graphic, unsavoury and somewhat illegal images for her morning broadcasts, Bloom believes that \u201cIf you want to win the lottery, you have to make the money to buy a ticket\u201d, by any means possible. With-holding information to the police and pulling on the weaknesses of his prey, Bloom never thinks a second, making him one of the scariest, real people we never want to have the pleasure of meeting.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nTwo intoxicated old newsmen, a producer and the anchorman he just fired, in Network, nurse their last drinks at the bar, commiserating over the slipping standards of broadcast journalism. As a riposte to Howard Beale's avowal of an on-air suicide, in jest, the UBS news division head envisions The Death Hour, a weekly series whose content is wholly violent, wholly sensational. \"Suicides, assassinations, automobile smashups,\" Max jokingly brainstorms, never dreaming that his drunken ramblings outlining a telecast of blood-soaked spectacle would one day turn out to be an uncanny bit of prophetic extrapolation, a bar-lowering that allows somebody like Louis Bloom, a freelancing videographer, to be an invaluable media cog. Louis' bosses are death merchants, ratings-driven professionals who fulfill the UBS producer's longago pitch for a \"great Sunday night show for the whole family.\" Nightcrawler can be seen as the third film in an unofficial trilogy about the dumbing down of the news, the unassailable culmination of Beale's rant to the studio audience that television had supplanted books and newspapers as the primary medium of intellectual discourse. The penultimate film, Broadcast News, released a decade after Network, screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky's divination that entertainment value would eventually encroach on the erudite nature of hard news proved to be true, finds encapsulation in the scene where Jane Craig, a Washington bureau producer, sounds the alarm on broadcast news content when she presents a domino demonstration clip at a conference for local reporters. Whereas, in Network, the studio audience watching a degraded version of the news was the hoi polloi, denizens raised on Bugs Bunny, therefore rankling the old vanguard who still controlled the medium, in Broadcast News, we can see, quite pointedly, how the generation gap closed during the interim between both films. The Bugs Bunny aficionados were now the gatekeepers, industry insiders, who, to Jane's disappointment, are not \"mad as hell\" about the infiltration of fluff bombarding the airwaves, when the seminar attendees clap in approval after the final domino falls. At this juncture, the late-eighties, it would seem by the light-hearted genre(the rom-com) that is chosen to document the news program's fluid aspect in filmic amber, networks and their affiliates were, as of yet, not the whorehouses that Frank Hackett had purported UBS to be. Broadcast News ends on an optimistic note, a note suggesting that the trend could still be reversed. Tom Grunick, newly minted as the face of the news division, at his press conference, defers the programming duties to a civic-minded heavyweight. This conceit, in which a narcissist like the telegenic, yet uninformed newsman would be an advocate for hard copy that matters, now, in retrospect, seems more absurd than an anchorman being assassinated by network honchos because of low ratings. Tom is all about style over substance. Jane Craig doesn't exist anymore. Diana Christensen does. Once thought to be an implausible invention of a scribe with an overheated imagination, the bloodthirsty woman behind The Mao Tse Tung Hour, the UBS hit show documenting the terroristic maneuvers of the Ecumenical Liberation Army, lives on in Nina Romina, the news editor for a low-rated L.A. morning show, who embodies and widens Diana's vision of broadcast news as spectacle. Chayefsky, who would die in '81, never lived to see the ultra-violent direction that Hollywood would take; he never saw the big-budgeted studio films with high body counts, the count so high, audiences would become desensitized to the human collateral damage. In Bad Boys 2, neither we nor the filmmaker, in a chase scene between off-road vehicles, stop to consider the welfare of the Haitian peasants as the Hummer and Range Rover plow through their tarpaper shanties. Nightcrawler satirizes a different generation, The Terminator Generation, raised on the \"event movie\". Better than Man Bites Dog, the psuedo-doc about a film crew who follows a serial killer at work, Nightcrawler gets its message across about audience complicity towards violence because unlike the grainy B/W, cinema verite style of the Belgian import, the filmmaker uses the film language of the Hollywood blockbuster. Situated outside a glass-walled Chinese restaurant, Louis records a furious exchange of gunfire between the police and the suspects of a home invasion. The rectangular glass front, meant to represent a movie screen, provides a clue as to why people tune into the graphic imagery that apparently turns up on local mornings news shows in big cities. It's entertainment. It's The Death Hour. When Ben, in Man Bites Dog, murders an entire family in their home, we're horrified because it looks real. Here, violence, looks fun behind Louis' camera eye. Innocent bystanders die in the shootout, but we don't care. We've seen it in the movies.",

Death and destruction becomes headlines, \"each police siren wail equals a possible windfall, and victims\" are merely \"dollars and cents\" in the film \"Nightcrawler\".\r Lou Bloom is a hard-working man, a perfectionist, a fast-learner with a can-do attitude and an uncompromising work ethic. He's quite eloquent, articulate, and knowledgeable. He sounds like a nice guy, right? However, some people just don't know when to stop--when things have gone too far, out of hand, or crossed a line. Lou Bloom is one of those people. From tampering with crime scenes, to pressuring a co-worker for sex, to blackmailing and sabotaging others, to withholding information from authorities, to manipulating events to his advantage, Lou is an example of an opportunist who never stops pushing. He \"blurs the line between observer and participant\". Lou pursues the American Dream like countless other US citizens/residents--but he's simply willing to do anything to get his payday.\r The movie shows just how screwed up media can be. It\u2019s competitive and ugly, with people fighting over the most gruesome footage. Nina primarily represents the ugly objectives of a cutthroat industry.***MILD SPOILERS*** When Nina discovers that a home invasion massacre was a drug deal gone wrong, she decides not to release that info (as it doesn\u2019t go with the fear-instilling message she\u2019s trying to tell). Nina also tells Lou to focus primarily on getting footage from wealthy, white neighborhoods, because that\u2019s what the people want.\r Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent performance as Lou. He's convincing as the socially awkward, demanding, and unsettling man. Jake shows effort, and he even lost weight for the role (which is evident with his gaunt cheekbones). Renne Russo is also great as Nina, a woman who also has little moral qualms with the faults of her work. Riz Ahmed's supporting character (Rick) could've had more of a backstory. I also happened to like Bill Paxton in his small role (as Joe, rival cameraman to Jake\u2019s character Lou). Dan Gilroy does a great job as director, especially considering Nightcrawler is his first movie.\r Despite this praise, because Lou is presented as such a sociopath from the beginning, the movie has slightly less suspense toward the end than it could've had (in hindsight). However, the tragedy at the end is still unexpected to me.\r I have reviewed 38 other movies on Metacritic and IMDB, including the 2014 and 2015 films: Taken 3, The Interview, Exodus: Gods and Kings, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, The Equalizer, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Giver, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, Blended, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, The Lego Movie, and more.\r I review TV shows, such as: Empire (2015), The Flash, Arrow (Season 3), Gotham, The Last Ship (Season 1), Sleepy Hollow  (Season 1), Marvel's Agents of SHIELD (Season 1 and 2), The 100, I Wanna Marry Harry, Crisis, Gang Related, and more.

The film plays out brilliantly and is paced greatly until somewhere in the second half that i can't state exactly where, but once the \"road accident\" and \"set up\" takes place the film picks back up for a climactic, fast paced and faultless finale! One of 2014's best, grab it now!",

He said in a recent interview in regards to the film \"I don't think this experience will every completely go away\" and I would be surprised if it left him that easily. Gyllenhaal builds an extremely complex character, reminiscent of Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker in \"The Dark Knight\" in some ways. This performance is one of the best of the year and his character should be viewed as one of those that I am lucky enough to have seen on the big screen. Like Gylllenhaal I don't think that, for me, \"this experience will every go away.\"\r What I also found of interest was how the film made an insightful comment in regards to what today's media has become. This is something that I don't think the average viewer picks up, understanding that the media is this film is twisted looking to make money without principle nor wanting to inform people, the purpose of news (or rather what it should be...) \"Lou\" is this twisted monster, a personification of today's media. What I did notice was how Kevin Rahm (playing Frank Kruse) acts as the opposite this, standing up for these traditional principals and what news should be. The film does well to make this comment, something that I think most films should try to do, and it hits a fine line in regards to it, something that I think \"The Imitation Game\" didn't do in regards to homophobia and completely missed the boat on in regards to women rights (see my review on it).\r What I can criticise, and its worth noting I only do so because there always has to be some criticism with any film, in regards to \"Nightcrawler\" is how I found Riz Ahmed's inclusion (playing Rick) a bit unnecessary, the same with the film's ending. I find this in most films and I can never put a finger on it but in some ways I sympathised with the bastards next to me whispering \"why hasn't this film ended yet?\"  Its finally worth noting that Dan Gilroy makes his directorial debut with \"Nightcrawler\" and that explains some of the films flaws, but I'm not going to criticise him. I mean it his debut, and a bloody good one at that.\r \"Nightcrawler\" is a fantastic film and for me, Jack Glyenhaal was the highlight. 100% deserved of an Oscar Nomination, perhaps a win. What \"Nightcrawler\" made me realise though was how **** up our media is.",

After multiple rejections, Bloom, a keen observer, becomes involved by chance in the dark world of L.A. night crime \u201cjournalism\u201d and discovers not only that he is fascinated by this sheer cirque du freak a.k.a. media, but also that he is very good at catching glimpses of human decadence and moral decay.\r Persistent and insidious by nature, Bloom crawls under the skin of an ethically challenged TV producer, Nina, played by Rene Russo, desperate to prove herself on top of her game. Their professional relationship quickly turns from a win-win situation into a personal and intimate (although the viewer never gets a direct proof in this respect, but only a couple of visual hints) power struggle, easily won by a scheming Bloom. And this is where Gilroy shows his masterful directing eye through clean cut close-ups and narrow camera angles that manage to catch the characters\u2019 body language and facial expressions: a sneaky reptilian Bloom and an arrogant feline like Nina \u2013 both creatures of the night.\r Bloom is not at all a sociopath as he might come across at a first glance. He is just a striver, an over-achiever who lacks any kind of conscience or feelings and is willing to literary step on dead bodies and who is not so different from any climber on the corporate or social ladder. He\u2019s manipulative and a very good salesman, not bound by any moral constraints and thus, anyone who comes into contact with him becomes an instant prey. Bloom is a by-product of today\u2019s society that tries to spit him out at first, only to become his playground later, and to a certain extent he is the embodiment of the American dream.\r \u201cNightcrawler\u201d is an obvious satire, but it never preaches or moralizes. It observes through a lens and lets the viewer grasp whatever he will out of this contorted monster.\r Gilroy knows how to build up tension and keep up the suspense by alternating quiet wide shots with fast paced action scenes. His directorial debut is reminiscent of Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s \u201cDrive\u201d and \u201cOnly God Forgives\u201d, a sort of a \u201cneon cinema\u201d product that casts a spell on the viewer through its raw lawlessness and haunting soundtrack. But unlike Ryan Gosling in \u201cDrive\u201d, Gilroy\u2019s Bloom is an anti-hero that you loathe from the first frame (maybe except for the few times when you see him carefully wetting the only sign of life in his shadowy spartan apartment \u2013 a plant). Jake Gyllenhaal is annoyingly fascinating in his creation of Bloom and the movie\u2019s brilliance is largely due to his Oscar worthy performance. With wide bulging eyes and a head that seems almost too big for his skinny and slightly gibbous frame, Gyllenhaal shows how much he immersed himself into the creepy crawling Bloom. Gyllenhaal seems poised to win his first Oscar nomination for a lead role with \u201cNightcrawler\u201d, but even if that doesn\u2019t happen he sure managed to hone one of the most despicable yet memorable cinematic anti-heroes in recent years.\r \u201cNightcrawler\u201d is a must-seen, definitely worth the ticket money and your attention, especially for the haunting intensity of Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance.",

Nightcrawler is a character study, a look into the mind of an already established psychopath as he delves deeper and deeper to the point of no return. You follow Lou Bloom, a man who goes from one payout to the next in a variety of illegal ways, until one night he discovers he has an unmatched talent for Nichtcrawling, which is the filming of crime scenes and violent acts for the seedy underworld of the late night news. Bloom becomes so obsessed with capturing the best possible crime on camera and goes to unspeakable lengths to achieve his goal.\rGyllenhaal gives the performance of his life as the creepy yet totally gripping lou Bloom, with his wide eyes that never blink and stilted conversations that sound as if he's gone onto the web and looked up 'How to talk to people'. The whole movie essentially follows his journey up the ladder of the Nightcrawling profession, in fact I don't think there's a single scene in the film which he doesn't appear in, as the other cast members really do play supporting roles for the main even that is Bloom. The action sequences are done immaculately, with the last 20 minutes of the movie proving to be the tensest I've seen in a long time.\rI can't think of a serious issue I have with this movie. The acting from Gyllenhaal is Oscar worthy, the storyline is unpredictable and tense and even the directing, whilst not perfect, really portrays LA night-life superbly.

His direction is subtle. Editing is just brilliant.

The heights he scales and the lengths he drives deserve a big fat ovation. A psychopath on the loose, Jake is something more than that, a perfectionist who does things that he is good at. A deft thief whose keen eyes fall on crime journalism. He crosses all human confinements and legal barriers to get stories that are still hatching. Every crime scene is his puppet. He beats even the police to it.\r An equally good performance by co-stars Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed who end up being manipulated by the devilry of the badass diligent Nightcrawler. Sitting on the hood of the car listening to every word that the static says, learning everything about police radio codes, manifest how dedicated the protagonist is to his work. In his words: \"I am a quick learner.\"\r There are shots that Jake perfects without dropping his calm demeanor, unhindered and incessant speeches that make you want to clap for his effort. The screenplay brings magic through his lips. The time he breaks the mirror screaming with frustration shows the perfection he has achieved in his acting. A great actor, with the variegation he has scoured, makes him one of a kind. I place him amongst the greats. Bravo!",

Or that I liked Lou Bloom. As someone suggested at dinner afterwards, he may be a sociopath like Charles Manson or Hannibal Lecter, but at least Hannibal Lecter had a sense of humor and so some self-knowledge. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar-worthy performance and is always in character and completely convincing. The analogy to Manson may be apt since Manson supposedly (and ironically) got his start in manipulation by reading Dale Carnegie\u2019s classic  book \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People.\u201d Bloom has taken business courses online and learned only to be ruthless. He also reminded me of Bartleby the Scrivener in that his own desires and will came before anyone else\u2019s. Nightcrawler is a fascinating film, and I wasn\u2019t bored for a second, watching the diabolical Bloom become a \"success\" in the amoral world of sensational broadcast journalism where ratings are the only thing that count \u2013 a world worthy of Bloom\u2019s cold and clinical view of life.",

Finally a director gave us a unique approach at newsroom entertainment in today's 'I want it now mentality'.

Jake Gyllenhaal is my pick for Best Male Actor Oscar this year and the movie deserves a nomination, as does first time director, Dan Gilroy. In the words of Lou Bloom \u201cA friend is a gift you giveNIGHTCRAWLER \u2013 JUST WOW \u2013 WHAT A MOVIE. Jake Gyllenhaal is my pick for Best Male Actor Oscar this year and the movie deserves a nomination, as does first time director, Dan Gilroy. In the words of Lou Bloom \u201cA friend is a gift you give yourself\u201d \u2013 this movie is your friend!\r Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a loner, a dedicated and passionately driven loner. He has absolutely no friends and spends his time by himself, learning a vast amount of skills on the internet or stealing items to sell. He desperately wants love (or his idea of love) and a job with a steady income. His social skills are based on what he has learned online, as such, he has no social graces or knowledge. He speaks like a text book and is void of emotion and a path to live on. He tries asking for jobs and selling himself to various places but he has no luck, until he sees a fascinating and bloody piece of inspiration. He could become someone who works for himself and gets a reward if he does the job well, that of a nightcrawler, overnight freelance trash journalism. The stuff that trash TV news wants a piece of, the darkest of society at its worse. You all love seeing a train wreck, you know you shouldn\u2019t watch but you can\u2019t take your eyes off it. Lou films it and sells it to TV for you to watch over your morning breakfast. But as a freelancing job there are other freelancers and if you want your item sold you need to have the best footage, what would you, or in this case, Lou do to get the best sellable footage?\r Lou is a vampire, a manipulative murderous vampire, he is terrifying in his matter of fact speak, unpredictable and unstoppable, could it turn into a serial killer movie? Lou is another train wreck you can\u2019t take your eyes off, while his delivery is humorous his belief in himself and the world is beyond freakish, the worst part, people like him probably exist.\r Lou meets KLWA night news editor, ruthless, trash TV editor, Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who he sells his footage to exclusively. Romina is at the end of her career tether and knows that train wrecks will sell and get people viewing. In Nina Romina\u2019s own words describing the ideal footage \u201ca screaming woman, running down the street with her throat cut,\u201d she says, and Lou is willing to go the extra distance to get it for her. It\u2019s a match made in television hell.\r At the start Nina views Lou as a simple determined guy, the new kid on the block who may have some good footage. But their relationship grows into much more.\r Russo\u2019s husband, writer/ director Dan Gilroy has delivered a fresh and nuanced screenplay and delivered it on a golden platter with his debut movie. The unintentional wit and candour of Lou is reminiscent of Norman Bates and Frank. Gyllenhaal provides a dedicated tour de force with his performance. He was so dedicated to the role, he worked out eight hours a day and rode his cycle to set to lose weight as he wanted to be a \u201chungry coyote,\u201d he also was so involved in the \u201cmirror\u201d scene he ended up in hospital getting his hand stitched, he then came straight back to set.\r The supporting cast of Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton is the icing on the cake for this movie, they were all perfectly cast and perfectly delivered their characters. All of these characters have a small but pivotal piece on Lou\u2019s chessboard and it all comes through onscreen, there is never too much nor too little delivered. That being said I always want more Paxton onscreen, he plays such a great character in this, he could have his own movie. And Russo is still one woman I would turn for, ever since LETHAL WEAPON 3 I have crushed on her, I never thought she could do a trashy and desperate look, an aging and needy power woman, and she does, while slowly falling into Lou\u2019s world of insanity.\r Academy Award Winner Robert Elswit\u2019s cinemtography is the cherry on top of that icing on this glorious cake of a movie. It has a definite Scorcese look and feel to it. The seedy undertones and dark moodiness of Los Angeles created by Elswit have never felt so unappealing, it literally is a hunting ground for Lou. At the same time the colours are all striking, to match the increased sight by Lou's large \"all-seeing\" eyes, eyes that Gyllenhaal rarely blinks - he did the same thing in DONNIE DARKO.\r NIGHTCRAWLERS' satirical dark comedic thrilling look at paparazzi styled freelance guerrilla journalism is at times hilarious and at others terrifying. This is the closest film to Scorcese's BRINGING OUT THE DEAD I have seen. It is an amazing piece of cinema for film lovers, this is not for the family or date night. Gyllenhall for Oscar!",

Although opening on or about Halloween eve, and with a suggestive title lending itself to that ritual, the film is actually the story of those vulture-like papparazzi who, instead of following celebs in innocent daily real life situations, seek to capture the tragedies and \"breaking news\" stories that besiege our evening news each night. In the mid 20th Century, these photo journalists would freelance and sell their wares to the highest newspaper bidder. Now, in the era of television and video and digital photography, the suppliers become video camera operators and the bidders are the news directors of local tv stations.\rAs so ably portrayed by Mr. Gyllenhaal, the film tells the story of one such video cameraman and the lengths and extremes he will go to \"get the shot\" or \"capture the video\". It also depicts his enablers in the newsrooms of Los Angeles who empower and enable these \"nightcrawlers\" to reap the economic benefits of their endeavors. The film is well paced and will hold your interest and involvement and makes its point in an artistic although not too subtle a manner. I give the film an 8.0, primarily because of Mr. Gyllenhaal\u2019s fine work but, also, because of the ability of Mr. Gilroy to both write and direct without sacrificing one role for the other..",

The film suffers from an uneven voice and bad pacing which all could have been corrected by an expert editor. NIGHTCRAWLER needs an objective eye to whip it into shape. But enough of the negative. So much is so good and the film is full of surprises from the performances to its depiction of LA. Incidentally, about 90% of this film is shot like 50 feet from our house. I can only think of one other film that captured the \"real\" LA so closely and that is THE MORNING AFTER. This is the real LA. Not the reel LA. I don't want to give it away but I so appreciate that the sleaze factor is kept in check and actually feels like the real world rather than an over amped sizzle reel. Jake Gyllenhaal is very good but doesn't totally or intrinsically inhabit his character. He's a guy that's weird and scary but not so scary that you'd run away from him which is good but you see Gyllenhaal's wheels turning which is not so good.\r But then there is the revelation...

The film is bolstered by Gyllenhaal's performance which is electrifying, unpredictable and extraordinary. I'm holding out hope for an Oscar nomination, even if his superb work in recent years (i.e. Zodiac, Prisoners) has gone unrecognised by the Academy. His work here is more than deserving to buck the trend - I was left hanging on every word that came out of his mouth, dripping in guile and insanity. He's backed up by a strong supporting cast. Rene Russo stands out as the station manager who becomes Louis's biggest client for his footage. Her work is similarly Oscar-calibre and she shows her character's insecurities and vulnerabilities with subtlety and grace, doing a particularly good job of showing simultaneously the shock at Louis's moral decline and her dependence at the rejuvenation his footage is giving her career. Dan Gilroy's alternately disturbing and exciting and surprisingly funny (in parts) script deftly handles its character's amorality and the exploration of the way media and crime are becoming closely intertwined.\r 'Nightcrawler' owes a lot of its frenetic, adrenaline-rush spirit to its technical work, particularly John Gilroy's editing and writer Dan Gilroy's directing - it's sleek, it's crisp, it's energetic, it works wonderfully with Gyllenhaal's acting to gradually push you to the edge of your seat so that by the nail-biting final act, you're practically falling into the aisle. The road scenes in 'Nightcrawler' are especially good, boasting some of the most brilliant camerawork I've seen this year. Its strongly reminiscent stylistically and visually of Nicolas Winding Refn's masterpiece 'Drive', especially in the way its more action-oriented scenes are shot and the way it handles its L.A. scenery. Robert Elswit, a skilled veteran of cinematography whose work dazzles me on P.T. Anderson features, deserves credit for his gorgeous landscape shots of the city in 'Nightcrawler.'\r It's everything I could want in a thriller and it's well worth the watch. One of the year's most demented and brilliant films, 'Nightcrawler' is something special in the canon of crime thriller and deserves all the recognition it can get.",

Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is down on his luck, he drives an old car, lives in an disgusting apartment, and doesn't have a job. He drives around at night looking for ways to earn money, when he comes across a film crew taping a crime scene. It seems like easy money, so Bloom goes out, gets a camera, and starts filming the police himself, only, he doesn't follow the same rules that the others do. I will not dispute that Gyllenhaal was terrific, but his character was beyond annoying. Louis Bloom is this O.C.D. guy, who is constantly rambling and talking to himself, something that basically ruins the whole film. This guy gets so annoying it's to the point of frustrating. On top of that, it takes a long time for anything substantial to happen. I was really looking forward to seeing this film and was impressed by how far Jake Gyllenhaal has come, but despite it's looming cult classic label, I found this film to just be one frustrating scene after another. Critics are willing to give films like this four stars and tell you it's a must see, because of an Oscar worthy performance, but what's really the point of seeing something that most people aren't going to want to sit through? Similar to Citizen Kane, it's got a great reputation, but don't let that fool you, this is one of the most nerve racking films I've ever sat through and to be honest, I'm sorry I did.",

While Gyllenhaal gives it his all in what some would consider the most compelling performance of his career, I never entirely bought into his character because he was essentially an amalgam of every other brooding, reclusive sociopath in cinema history, and he was all too familiar a character to even remotely pique my interest. Nightcrawler is a film that teeters uncomfortably between being realistic and illogical throughout, with vague social commentary jammed somewhere in between. It seemed like the score was absent for over half the movie's duration, but it flutters in occasionally (and awkwardly, I might add) to remind the audience of its existence. Director Dan Gilroy also demands that the audience revel in the inhumanity depicted on screen, and is so focused upon unsettling the audience, that any message he may be trying to convey is completely diluted by this forced grittiness. This film pales in comparison to Gone Girl in all respects.",

This is not just a thriller and Rear Window ripoff but a nice commentary on the media and violence, which is explored through the disturbing and intriguing Louis Bloom. Jake Gyllenhall does a great job in the role providing a character that is both revolting in his obsession with violence and media as well as his detachment from it but is also intruging with his passion and obsession. I won\u2019t blame you if you find this movie revolting as it is messed up but for me I could and was entertained by this film.",

Scenarios are intense as we watch our lead Gyllenhaal run into dangerous situations that could land him in prison or in the grave. His motives aren't exactly disagreeable, but his methods are. The movie has a lot to say about modern journalism tactics.\r The whole film succeeds thanks to how well the character Louis Bloom is written and how well he is portrayed by Gyllenhaal who gives another fantastic performance. He is a character who is equally creepy, brilliant, deranged, and likable. It's this combination that makes the character do things you won't agree with, but still keep you rooting for him at the same time.\r I have to give special praise for how the film is shot. The gritty, almost grainy look of the world makes it look like one of those crime-thrillers from the 80's. For my fellow gamers out there I guess you could compare it's look to that of Hotline Miami. It gives the film a touch of a retro vibe.\r \"Nightcrawler\" is dark, creepy, and at times vicious. It's a lot like it's protagonist in that respect. It's a wild and smart ride. One that you should take if you are in the mood for a thought-provoking piece of entertainment. It's unlike anything we've seen in a while.",

None of this **** where the other cars on the road all drive at 15mph while the main car dodges carefully in between. These shots were full on.\rOne of the very few films where I was left wanting more at the end.\rLooking forward to Nightcrawler 2. : )\r9/10",
