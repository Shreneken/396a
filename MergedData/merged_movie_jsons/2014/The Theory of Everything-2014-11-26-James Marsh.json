I was on the edge of my seat watching Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones) as she did more and more amazing acts of love for Stephan Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). I cannot imagine anyone that fits the definition of love more than she did.Redmayne was brilliant as Hawking.Anthony McCarten took Jane Hawing's book and wrote a screenplay that was a thrill to watch.",

            "content": "We are all familiar with the story and with Steven Hawking. His groundbreaking work 'A brief History of Time' and devastating disabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness and immortal fame.But few of us could understand the complexities of his personal life and the shocking divorce in 1990 from his long sacrificing wife of more than 25 years. Indeed that episode served to darken his reputation in the minds of many, including myself, who felt ill at ease with anyone who could leave a partner who had done so much for him just at the long awaited moment when international fame and recognition finally arrived.This wonderful production, so well scripted and paced throughout, serves to explain that vital anomaly in Hawking's life. And it is made all the more poignant as it is based upon the account written by his wife who has borne so much.But it is the breathtaking performance of Eddie Redmayne as Hawking that simply blasted this film into an extraordinary level. It is difficult enough to mimic so famous a person as Hawking and it is even more difficult to portray so accurately the debilitating and gradually increasing effects of Motor Neuron Disease. But to transmit so clearly the profound emotions and inner suffering that Hawking must have experienced in his agonizing journey was a performance that left me quite speechless and at times in uncontrollable tears.It would be a travesty of the industry if Eddie Redmayne is not nominated for an Oscar after this performance. And to my mind it was a work of art that simply cannot be equaled let alone beaten.Have a good handkerchief ready to hand.",

            "review_title": "Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are a match made in heaven in James Marsh's biopic...",
            "content": "Encompassing all the best parts of films like A Beautiful Mind by Ron Howard but creating its own signature and style to the biopic genre, James Marsh's gorgeous and beautifully compelling The Theory of Everything, the true story of Stephen and Jane Hawking, is a sensitive piece of filmmaking that stands as one of the finest movie efforts of the year. Starring Eddie Redmayne as Stephen and Felicity Jones as Jane, the two develop a masterful and sonorous dynamic that behaves as a naturalistic relationship that inhabits qualities of both love and sadness. They're a match made in heaven. Also acting as a morality tale, screenwriter Anthony McCarten puts forth intriguing questions regarding love in the shadow of someone's disability. Do you really know what is asked of you when you vow to love someone in sickness and in health? What happens when disability doesn't allow you to love the way you want? Are you better off just breaking free if you have the chance?The film acts as a moving oil painting. Beno\u00eet Delhomme shoots to utter perfection. Intimate in scenes requiring the viewer's undivided attention, and taking the liberty to capture the essence of the time where the innocence of love offers many possibilities. The scenes ultimately feel as if we're in a dream sequence, sleeping silently as these two lives play out in our minds.You don't get any tears or moving feelings without the bravura score of J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson. Criminally overlooked last year in the grand scheme of things for his work on Prisoners, the composer orchestrates his best score of his career. Very likely not just my favorite score of the year so far but one of mine in the last few years. From the opening credits, J\u00f3hannsson puts his stamp with heavy violins and beautiful piano playing. In the end credits, you can sit and marvel as the names cross the screen with the music that accompanies it.When it comes to biopics, people tend to automatically give credit to makeup and body language when talking about a performer. Past winners like Jamie Foxx in Ray have always felt empty as a performance but people were so tied in with the mannerisms that he brought to the role, which he often did in his stand up comedy routines. In Eddie Redmayne, we get a fully realized and tender performance. The first twenty minutes of the film, prior to the diagnosis of Hawking's disease, Redmayne utilizes all the quick wit and charm to show what his Stephen loved the most of his work and his woman. Obviously going through the physical transformation must be rewarded. Contorting his body and learning the physical tics that Stephen Hawking has displayed in real life all ring true. Since his breakout work in Les Miserables, a role that should have landed him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, I was wary to believe I'd revisit a praising session with the young actor so soon. It's one of the best things offered this year.When it comes to Felicity Jones, the emotional backbone of the entire process has to be awarded to her. With stunning works in Like Crazy under her belt, Jones takes upon a daunting and heavily emotional character, never afraid to have the audience dislike or be disappointed in what she's doing. Marsh directs her to astonishing resolve. As a leading lady, Jones ignites such fiery and compelling questions not necessarily asked before in a biopic such as this. Complex and staggering in the way she decides to portray the brave Jane, Jones allows her character to grow, and both live and learn inside of her. What's most remarkable about Jones is she makes everything seem so effortless. She's not faking anything, she's really feeling and becoming Jane. She locates all the emotions required of her to execute successfully. It's a turn I wouldn't be surprised to see runaway with the Academy Award for Best Actress.The supporting players are no shortage of talent, though secondary to this type of story. Charlie Cox was just as good in his screen time. As Jonathan, Cox lays it all out on the table, heart on sleeve, and soul bared for all of us to see. David Thewlis, Emily Watson, and Simon McBurney are all solid but brief.Production Designer John Paul Kelly and Costume Designer Steven Noble should be commended for their meticulous craft in bringing the time period to the screen. An Oxford University dormitory along with a dozen outfits worn by all the characters can easily be taken for granted in a film like this.Screenwriter Anthony McCarten adapts his script from the book \"Travelling to Infinity: My life with Stephen\" which was written by Jane Hawking. Audiences like their fair share of love stories, but some of them, rather most of them, don't like the ugly that goes with it. In real life, people make mistakes, and do things that can make some cringe. I believe some of the more questionable and controversial things during the Hawkings marriage was merely glossed over to not paint them negatively, even though the world is well aware of what went on. I'll be honest, I knew next to nothing about Stephen Hawking and his work prior to sitting for the movie. I knew the robot voice and that's where it about ended. If anything, the film inspires me to learn more about Stephen's work and theories presented. All of those things are definitely given a back seat to a film that doesn't really require them. The Theory of Everything is not about the equations or the mathematics. It's essentially about us. It's about love, and not just in the form of marriage. We as humans learn to love ourselves, our families, and our children. They are placed in our lives but I'm not sure how much we realize what goes into maintaining those relationships. The movie makes you think of those things.",

            "content": "This film is highly recommended.You can certainly tell it's Oscar time when all the more dignified and personal projects inundate the movie houses in hopes of capturing the gold. For most of the other nine months, we get lesser efforts and big blockbuster spectacles to fill-in until late October arrives. Then, it's time to get serious about our cinema choices. The Theory of Everything is one such film. It carries its pedigree with style and class, even if it is a rather conventional biopic in disguise, with its main character suffering through a debilitating disease while finding the stamina to go on.With a very literate screenplay by Anthony McCarten and accomplished direction by James Marsh, the film tells the story of famed scientist Stephen Hawking and his battle with ALS. It also concentrates on his relationship with his supportive and loving wife, Jane.Love will conquer all. Or so it should. But the horrors of this disease and the hardships they face seem unsurmountable. We see the couple meet, fall in love, marry, have children, and grow weary of each other. Stephen achieves adoration, fame, and fortune while Jane takes a back seat to her caregiver role and bringing up the family, amid the tears and frustration they face on a daily basis. One immediately empathizes with these characters due to their tragic situations.The two leads are splendid and their acting is peerless. Felicity Jones plays Jane. Her role may be less showy and far more understated, but the actress is perfect at showing Jane's endurance and strength in the subtlest of ways. Eddie Redmayne is Stephen Hawking and his performance is literally trans-formative. (He must have learned his craft from tons of research about Hawking and creative influence from Daniel Day Lewis.) This is an impressive physical performance, from his black horn rimmed glasses to his walking cane and distorted posture. Both will receive well-earned accolades for their memorable work. Fine supporting work by Charlie Cox as Jonathan, their loyal friend, and Simon McBurney as Stephen's father add more clarity to the film.As with most biographical films, one sees the rise and fall of the protagonist before it arrives. This film follows that tries-and-true formula. But Marsh's direction compensates for the linear structure and predictability of the story. The director relies heavily on his actors' subtle actions to tell more about their characters than the mere words they speak. He also wisely shows Hawking's point of view by angling the camera range from a lower stance or keeping it stationary to reinforce the characters' immobility. The final scene, recapping Hawking's life in reverse, beautifully sums up Stephen's life full circle in the most visual of terms.But The Theory of Everything is foremost a love story. The film desperately wants to be a crowd-pleaser with an uplifting message of inspiration, even when the reality and truth of their actual lives is bleaker than it appears on screen. The film glosses over some factual content to play up the human drama of this pair of young lovers. It skillfully manipulates its audience to wallow in the heartbreak. Director Marsh successfully capture the pangs of young love and bittersweet romance in this emotionally involving film. The Theory of Everything is an immensely satisfying film with stand-out acting and skilled direction. The proof is right there on the screen, even if the facts are slightly askew.

            "content": "The Theory of Everything tells the uphill struggle that world renowned genius Stephen Hawking went through when dealing with his, now, infamous disease and trying to maintain his relationship with his loving wife, Jane. The strengths of this film rely solely on Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. These two actors are absolutely, one hundred percent, PHENOMENAL in these two roles. Stephen Hawking is the role that Redmayne was born to play. Hawking is portrayed as a charming and intellectually superior individual that behaves just like any one else. After a bit, we start to wonder what was every so amazing about him...then the heartbreak starts. Jane Hawking is a sweet, loving and determined person that will go to the lengths of the universe to make sure her husband, Stephen can survive. I get chills just thinking about certain scenes, some of which will most definitely be requiring a large box of Kleenex. The truth is, anything that I say here about these performances, no matter what it is, is still criminally underselling the sheer brilliance of them. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are simply incredible and I'd be even willing to go to the extreme to say that both actors will not only be nominated, but I'd be surprised if they didn't win the Oscar gold. Now, with that being said, this film's structural issues are severely hampering this film's chances at being a classic. I wasn't completely sold on the structural integrity of the film. It showed enough of the relationship aspect behind Stephen and Jane but it very briefly touched base on Hawking's intellectual discoveries and I thought that if it was a bit more balanced in that respect, it would be a near perfect film. One plot point that I did find utterly enthralling is the idea that Hawking struggles throughout the film to do simple things. These scenes are, by far, the most heart wrenching scenes to watch. James Marsh directs his actors effortlessly and can evoke the type of emotional response out of his audience through them, but when left with telling a story, Marsh falters. Marsh, known for 2012 IRA drama, Shadow Dancer proves that he is an actor's director. He cares about human drama over anything in a tangible sense, which benefits this film greatly but also harms it in the way of progression. Despite these minor infractions, The Theory of Everything is a film that everyone can enjoy and turns into a real audience movie. It is a film that will have you laughing one minute and crying the next, no easy feat for any film, and this one does it effortlessly.",

            "content": "Before going into and seeing, The Theory of Everything, I really did not know too much about Stephen Hawking. I of course knew who he was and that he was a famous physicist for his work on black holes and other such matters and I had also seen video clips and photos of him, but really knew otherwise next to nothing about him and I have never actually read any of his books, but after seeing the film I am a little tempted and curious to do so, even if the subject matter does go over my head a bit (I both did poorly and did not enjoy high school physics class). On the other hand, those who go into The Theory of Everything, looking for an elaborate account of Hawking's work and his science and the method behind his work, then those people may be in for a bit of a letdown as this story while it does focus on Hawking's life, it mostly focuses on his long marriage and relationship with his wife, Jane, who wrote the book on which the film is based on. The film focuses heavily on the relationship between Stephen and his wife, Jane and the hardships they had to deal with due to his various health problems that he developed when they first become interested in each other till the present time. Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking, does a phenomenal job here. He starts out as a shy, somewhat bookish and nerdy student who has a fair bit of humour to him and also has a love of education and finding out the big questions and answers of the world. As his illness develops and progresses over the years, we see how hard it is for him to move, speak and just do everyday things whereas he is eventually confined to a wheelchair and has to speak through a computer. Redmayne's performance is so believable and must have been really hard to pull off as we see him struggle to eat, walk, speak and just how he twists his face and muscles and how much physical difficulty and pain is involved in this as well as his strong desire to succeed and to achieve more and more each day is evident in Redmayne's wonderful performance which must have been exhausting and difficult to play, but he does an excellent job here in what I think is one of the year's best performances. Equally good here is Felicity Jones, who plays Jane. While the role is not as demanding physically, it is more demanding emotionally as we see her totally devote herself to all of Stephen's every waking needs and how she went out of her way to both care and love for him. At times it was certainly difficult and I am sure she just wanted to give up, but we also as in him, see her determination to make things work and she is an incredibly strong person and character and you can see that everything she does has her full best and wonderful intentions. Her performance is an emotional one and is beautifully and brilliantly portrayed as well and is also one of the year's best performances. When the film first started out, I thought it would be a fairly safe and by the numbers biopic, but it really took me by surprise at how interesting I found these characters, their lives and the situations they found themselves in. Again because of the brilliant performances and masterful script and direction we can both care for and have empathy for these characters as well as personally cheer them on and wish all the best for them as we are sitting quietly in our theatre screens glued to the screen with captivation and interest. The film has an excellent pace to it and works well as a biographical film, but works even better as a story of love and the difficulties and sacrifices it took to make it work and just how strong both Stephen and his wife are at the end of this film after all they have gone through. It really is an inspirational and feel good film when you think about it after all they accomplished and went through. Sure there are moments of heartache and when we see them suffer, but it is not all grim. We also see moments of happiness and how these two, from the second they met, really do love each other and had a marriage full of trust and devotion to one another. The film is doing well in limited release and expanded wider in theatres this week and I feel very privileged to have been able to see it on the big screen. It is thoroughly fascinating from start to finish and features two of this year's most believable and best performances and also gives us hope and encouragement while we may be not exactly in their same circumstances, but for other things as well. The Theory of Everything, is a real triumph and one of the best films of 2014.",

            "review_title": "Great romantic movie about a brilliant man, ironically very little science",
            "content": "But it does tell an inspiring story about Stephen Hawking's personal struggle with his illness that's very uplifting.The story of Stephen Hawking and his then wife Jane, apparently based on a book she wrote about it, which probability explains why there was not much science in the movie, not that I'm complaining, as it was a well played film about a difficult relationship.I didn't known Stephen and his wife actually met around the same time as he began to suffer from Lou Gehrig's Disease. Makes the whole concept that Hawking has three kids with this woman more interesting (something was working). Felicity Jones did a great job playing such a strong, patient, and compassionate woman, all well narrated in this movie. The difficulty Jane Hawking had being with a man getting trapped in his own body, played by Eddie Redmayne.I have herd of Hawking's surprisingly positive personality, not because of his condition, but because I expected his condition would make it hard to express any emotion. Redmayne did his research to express the struggle of Hawking on camera nicely (I keep forgetting The Hawking is a Brit).This movie turned out to be a great one about the time span of a relationship. Done more romantically than borderline soft-core flicks like Blue is the warmest color and 9 songs, and it was not as depressing as Blue Valentine. it was just a true take on a complex relationship taking it's toll, well performed by some brilliant actors.If your looking to watch this movie to hear some science talk, that's not what the movie is really about, unless ironically convincing the world of his theories on time was really as easy as the movie makes it out for Hawking. Overall very enjoyable.",

            "content": "The Theory of Everything is an extremely moving love story concerning the brilliant British scientist Stephen Hawking and his first marriage. Whilst you may need a PhD in Physics to understand the intricacies of Hawking's theories (which by coincidence I have and \u2013 no \u2013 it's not enough) the lack of any sort of Physics knowledge is not a barrier to enjoying this movie.Starting in 1963 when Hawking is starting his PhD studies in Cambridge University, the story picks up with the geeky and socially inadequate Hawking as he sparks a (rather unlikely) relationship with the extremely attractive Jane (Felicity Jones from \"The Invisible Woman\"). If this segment of the film had a hashtag it would be #punchingabovehisweight. Greatly encouraged by his mentor Dennis Sciama \u2013 generally seen as the father of modern cosmology and played by the ever reliable David Thewlis \u2013 Hawking develops his extraordinary theories (and counter-theories) in the hot-house of a 1960's Cambridge. Fate cruelly steps in though with Hawking developing the Motor Neuron Disease with which he is now famously associated. Given he was given just 2 years to live, he clearly has a private black hole somewhere to have warped time for the last 60+ years! As biopics go, this is an exceptionally good one. Eddie Redmayne's Hawking is just mesmeric. Hawking himself, on being given the opportunity to see the film before its world premiere, commented that at times he thought he was watching himself. The depths of physical and emotional acting Redmayne displays with this performance has to be seen to be believed, and I will personally eat my hat if Redmayne does not get at least an Oscar nomination for this part. (And who wouldn't want to see Hawking himself roll out to announce an award at the Kodak theatre!).Felicity Jones is also outstanding in the role of Jane. The film is based on Jane Hawking's own book although screenwriter Anthony McCarten has taken a few liberties with the life story for dramatic effect. As referenced above, Hawking has seen the film and he was reportedly so moved that he shed a tear and then offered the use of the actual audio from his speech synthesizer for the film. So in this sense, Hawking narrates his own dialogue in the latter half of the film, which is quite a coup.Supporting actor parts are also great from an ensemble cast with Simon McBurney (\"Magic in the Moonlight\", TV's \"Rev\") as Hawking's father, Harry Lloyd as Hawking's university friend Brian and Charlie Cox as the 'family friend' Jonathan being particularly effective.The director is James Marsh, best known for his gripping documentaries \"Man on Wire\" and \"Project Nim\", and the cinematographer Beno\u00eet Delhomme (\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\") realising a wonderfully nostalgic vision of 60's Cambridge. Also notable is the beautifully fitting music by Islandic composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson - I fully expected this in the credits to be the omni-present Alexandre Desplat, but for once I was wrong! So a 'must see' in the run up to the Oscar season, but one to take lots of tissues to if you are affected by emotional films: this one seemed to be particularly impactful on the females in the audience - perhaps because it tells the love story from the perspective of Jane - with my wife virtually in tears throughout! (Or maybe that's just because the realisation has finally struck that she's been married to a PhD physicist for 30 years??!).(If you enjoyed this review please see my archive of other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and subscribe to receive more).",

It has little interest in what Stephen Hawking is about, except for very cursorily. I guess that's not a huge problem, but, frankly, I don't know that much about Hawking and wished I had gotten to learn more from this movie. It does deal a lot with his disease and health struggles, which I suppose many are more interested in. The film will surely be most notable for its two lead performances. Eddie Redmayne certainly nails the physical side of Hawking and projects a very clear character. Felicity Jones, though, does better work as the woman who has to work very hard to make their lives work. No one else really registers much (though David Thewlis and Emma Watson, among many others, are featured), but that doesn't really matter. The filmmaking is competent but not notable. James Marsh, best known for his documentaries Man on Wire and Project Nim, has done good work in feature filmmaking before with the underrated The King. Here he doesn't get much to register.

            "content": "\"There should be no boundary between human endeavour,\" Stephen Hawking explains during a press conference. It is this line that strikes a chord at the very centre of James Marsh's incredible biopic on one of the most brilliant scientists of our time. The Theory of Everything is not just a story about the science behind the beginnings of our universe, but the science of love; and how life's challenges that we face everyday, shape who we are and what we achieve. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones turn in phenomenal performances as the revolutionary Stephen Hawking and his former wife Jane Wilde. Eddie's mentally and physically challenging role, displaying Hawkings brilliance and motor neuron disease, are extremely commendable and impressive (a sure fire for a Best Actor nomination at next year's Oscars). On the more sensitive side, Felecity displays the endless love and powerful fight Jane brought to the Hawking household. As the years pass, their lives are changed tremendously in very profound and heart-wrenching ways. The movie does not shy away from making Hawking a complex character, as well as Jane, showing both their positive and negative sides. I really liked that the movie was able to shape them into fully well-rounded characters despite the \"romance\" aspect of it. The score for the film is tremendous.. absolutely outstanding! It hits all the right marks, brings upon emotions right when you are on the verge of tears, leaves you in awe after a beautiful monologue, and finishes with a melancholy but very fitting tone. The script and directing were top-notch.. right up there with the best... and the cinematography? give that guy an award already! A masterpiece to watch. While some critics may be quick to judge how the film focuses more on the romance rather than the science that made Hawking so renowned, I believe that the love is what made him who he is today. Human endeavour is endless... Stephen never gave up hope, nor did Jane... and though their lives ended up in different places, it was their years together that displayed to us how a little bit of hope can go a very, very long way.Verdict: A beautiful story that shows how time and love are limitless... no beginning, no end (despite his earlier hypothesis). *****In Theatres: November 7th, 2014 (USA), January 2, 2015 (UK)",

            "content": "Saw 'The Theory of Everything' as someone who like biographical dramas (even if a lot play liberties with the truth), especially the inspiring ones that have a lot of emotional impact (and there are plenty of those out there), and who was interested in both the subject matter and Stephen Hawking himself. The trailer was also appetising and then there was the awards attention.After finally seeing it, after it being on my long \"to see\" list that got bigger and bigger, as my music and course commitments grew, for a while, found 'The Theory of Everything' a good film with several superb elements that could have better considering the subject. While critically praised, audience reaction leans towards the more positive but more divisive for reasons that are understandable, being someone who agrees with a few of the criticisms if not all. There is the agreement that 'The Theory of Everything', being based on his first wife's memoir meaning there is a lot of his personal life, could have focused more on what made Hawking so brilliant as a scientist/cosmologist, how he contributed to the subject with his theories, his importance to it and how he was perceived, there wasn't enough of that. Another criticism that is shared by me is the rushed and jumpy nature of the narrative as a result of trying to cram a lot and there is the sense that in doing that that it tried to do too much. However, 'The Theory of Everything' is photographed and designed beautifully, while it's sensitively directed, by someone who clearly had a passion and sympathy for what was focused on, and hauntingly scored.It is a thoughtfully written film and explores his heavily-focused on personal life with delicacy, little one-sidedness and a lot of charm and emotional power (motor neurone disease is a horrific condition to suffer from and that was handled heart-wrenchingly). Also found myself inspired and learning a good deal. Eddie Redmayne gave one of that year's best performances, a truly poignant and powerful performance and a career best thus far. His make-up is remarkable. Felicity Jones is the emotional back-bone of the story in a way and it is just as much about her as it is with him, and her acting is subtle and warm while showing Jane as having as as many flaws as she did strengths. The chemistry between them has a lot of heart.Charlie Cox, David Thewlis and Maxine Peake are strong support but it's the two leads' show all the way.All in all, good film that could have been a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

Decided not to give up, with the help of his future wife, he starts working on his PhD, bringing into the world some theories never heard before. Although encountering many problems along the way, especially when talking about his health, he continues to amaze the world with his research, so many people come to bring him hope or even technical help, which will allow him to communicate and ultimately aid him in his pursuit of finding an unique and simple equation which will solve everything.It's a dramatic biography of one of the most brilliant minds the world has ever seen, filled with suspense, love, friendship, struggle but also relief and success. It manages to transmit a lot of emotion, the main actor having a flawless interpretation throughout the entire movie. His performance alone makes this movie a must see, let alone its plot and characters.",

            "content": "What a wonderful accomplishment of a film by James Marsh (Man on Wire) who brings such depth and beauty to the life/love story of Stephen and Jane Hawking. The film is adapted from her novel on their life and brings forth much of the love and tenacity necessary to care for and love someone going through great physical struggles over time. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones give fantastic and intimate portrayals of Stephen and Jane during their courtship and lives together. My vote for best film at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. In Q&A after film James Marsh told a great story about Stephen Hawking's reaction to the film where he gave the response that it was in \"largely genuine\"... and Eddie Redmayne said that Stephen Hawking after viewing the film allowed them to use his actual \"voice\" instead of their approximation for the film that they had produced. The most touching was that Hawking had tears to be wiped away after viewing which will give to you a sense of how genuine this film is.",

            "content": "Acclaimed physicist and cosmologist Dr. Stephen Hawking has devoted his life to the study of space-time, black holes, and the origin of the universe. Whether the universe is ultimately knowable through a series of mathematical equations is as yet undetermined, but it forms the basis of his lifelong goal of finding what he calls \"the theory of everything.\" Written by Anthony McCarten and based on the book by Jane Hawking, James Marsh's film, also titled The Theory of Everything, traces Hawking's life from his days at Cambridge University in the 1960s, his lifelong struggle with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the ups and downs of his marriage to Jane Wilde.The Theory of Everything begins with Hawking, in a masterful physical performance by Eddie Redmayne, as a young university physics student who impresses his professor, Dennis Sciama (David Thewlis) and meets a more artistically-inclined student Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones), who is studying medieval Spanish poetry. We learn fairly quickly that they have a fundamental disagreement. She is religious while he is an atheist who tells her \"I have a problem with the celestial dictator premise,\" though his atheism, for the most part, is glossed over in the film. Before their courtship gets off the ground, however, Hawking's problem with coordination becomes more and more obvious.When he loses his balance and collapses on the pavement, he is taken to the hospital where he is told that he is suffering from a motor neuron disease, known as Lou Gehrig's disease, which will become progressively worse to the point where he will no longer be able to speak, swallow, function on his own, and even breathe. Despite his failing vision and the fact that he is given only two years to live, Hawking sets his mind to his doctoral thesis on the question of \"Time\" and receives his PhD while still in his twenties. Meanwhile his illness progresses to the point where he has to receive a tracheotomy to stay alive, even though it means he can no longer speak.The worsening of his physical condition, however, only makes Jane's commitment to him that much stronger and they are soon married, a marriage that will last thirty years and produce three children. Fortunately, a computer program called Equalizer designed by Walter Woltosz, allows Hawking to \"talk\" by use of a speech synthesizer. Though he is now confined to a wheel chair and his body movements are almost completely constricted, he is able to deliver lectures on subjects he has devoted his life to with the use of the speech device.Jane remains steadfast in her love and support over the years, but the burden of care eventually takes its toll and she is drawn to Jonathan (Charlie Cox), the director of the church choir, while Hawking develops a growing relationship with his nurse Elaine (Maxine Peake). Hawking's intellectual achievements are enormous given his physical condition, yet The Theory of Everything hardly lives up to his inspiration, maintaining a bland level of niceness throughout and providing only a superficial understanding of the main characters. It is a safe, standard-issue biopic that does not probe very deeply, smooths over conflicts and unpopular ideas, and stays away from any form of unpleasantness.While the film covers a considerable length of time, the characters do not seem to age and the stresses and strains that led to the unraveling of Hawking's marriage are not depicted or explained. The film also glorifies the scientific model without questioning whether or not a so-called theory of everything can tell us anything about the underlying nature of reality. Though Redmayne disappears into his character, and captures Hawking's facial expressions and physical disabilities with amazing skill, Marsh's banal, worshipful biopic leaves a black hole where satisfaction ought to be.",

            "content": "Jones and Redmayne, what a couple. I was kept thinking that it had been a while since we had such a perfect match in the movies, and it was specially a treat to have this kind of chemistry with two people who are not stars/celebrities, taking away from the material, plus the fact that they are both wonderful performers, and it couldn't get any better with a great job done by the director and his team. What a perfect universe and what a treat for us.Hawkins and his wife, the story. It all begins in Cambridge, as two plain but smart and sensitive people fall for each other. Not sure what liberties were taking with the real people's personalities, but it's refreshing to see a film that concentrates on the wonders of falling for each other, and it's simple, perfect, organic. It doesn't take away from giving us enough to understand each of their personalities, and there's no big drama, except for the eventual introduction of the muscular deterioration, but every element is worked around the relationship between these two very special people, a man who revolutionized the world of Physics, and a woman who couldn't be more different from him if we had concentrated on philosophical or theological angles. These two don't let two matters derail their emotions, and it's not that they live in a perfect world, or that they are in a perfect relationship. It would be a boring story otherwise.Hawkins health deteriorates, and the prognosis is not good. He's give a couple of years to live, and this is enough to kill a budding relationship, but one hasn't counted on the strength and the level of the attraction between him and his future bride. They marry, have kids, support each other, and eventually encounter a few bumps on the road, and things get interesting.As previously stated, they have a \"normal\" relationship where they care and love each other, and there is a strong core because their relationship is based on genuine affection and friendship. They undergo a period of intense stress, as it becomes obvious that she needs help, support, and she is after all, an academic. All of the attention is on him and his achievements and handicap. Her life is on the verge of falling apart, until Jonathan shows up, and to put it mildly, it does complicates things a little because a bond established between her and him, and unexpectedly between Hawkins and him.One has to remember that things are bound to change, that the universe has rules, and this applies to relationships, too. The Hawkins stand by each other, but they are not invulnerable, and eventually more chemical reactions happen, and life changes. New people come in, some unions change, partners change, and life moves on. What doesn't change in this film is the emotional pull it possesses, and the audience is bewitched by its power, as we continue admiring the beautiful work done by this team. I was a bit hesitant at first because there were comparisons to \"My Left Foot\", but the work here is more subtle, and the emphasis is not on the physical acting (though it's quite impressive). Instead more is done with lines, with looks, with more subtle approaches. One can almost hear the heartbeats, the power of a sigh, expressing desire, love, or frustration.The backgrounds and the technical work is impeccable and helps the overall effect. This is a work of art where nothing gimmicky deters from the main idea. Yes, we see a very special man, with a very special mind, but most of all, we see the human being and his wife, his passions, the fact that his thirst for knowledge might originate from something truly special inside of him. I can't explain otherwise how he landed such a wonderfully spiritual partner. The film ends with a strong emphasis on the word \"hope\". He hoped for more than a couple of years, and his life went on for a lot longer. We only hope that most people who yearn for something as wondrous as some of the stuff we see here, have their dreams come true because unlike this film, life is hardly perfect.",

What occurred to me after seeing it and reveling in the characterization is that while it's a nice love story, it could have been about almost any talented person who hooks up with an amazing, loyal woman. What I am saying is it is more a story of triumph than a story about Stephen Hawking and what he truly is. We see his day to day existence and his conquest of strife, but we know little of the professional man other than the rewards he receives and the controversy he engenders. Of course, he is the representation of modern physics and cosmology, but that is left for us to read for ourselves. There are documentaries exploring his life as a physicist and some are superior to this. Nevertheless, the love story where one gives all one has for another is hard to dismiss. I found out that Eddie Redmayne spent time with the great genius in order to capture his essence. He spoke of Hawking's great sense of humor and what an incredible labor it is to be him. This will probably be nominated for some Oscars, but beyond the acting categories I don't see much else.",

This is the sort of film that Ron Howard usually makes, but nonetheless the audience is in capable hands.Redmayne is superb, the illusion is greater because he LOOKS like Hawking. Astonishing.Jones is centre of the film. Every film needs a centre and you could do worse than than beautiful and magical Felicity Jones.Her astonishing beauty (a perfectly symmetrical face and oversize eyes) depends for impact on getting just the right camera angle. This allows the director, by picking the angles, to use her beauty like a weapon with which to harpoon the viewer in key scenes.

            "review_title": "The Theory of Eh-verything",
            "content": "The curse of most biopics about famous individuals is that the films in question always boil down a subjects life to a \"greatest hits\" reel and then stuffs the rest of the run time with a sub-narrative to tie all these moments together. More often than not, this sub-narrative is a love story, which isn't inherently bad; it's just that when a proper balance isn't struck between the major themes and the filler, the results are usually lackluster. \"The Theory Of Everything\" charts the tumultuous marriage of legendary physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane as they struggle to keep their life together while Stephen slowly succumbs to the symptoms of ALS. And while it puts all of its efforts into trying to be a heartbreaking portrait of a strained marriage (a portrait that at times is quite beautiful), the movie seemingly forgets that one of its subjects also happened to be one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century.Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) meet in college and forge a bond through the universal law of \"opposites attract\". Jane believes in romance and poetry and God, while Stephen believes in logic and reason and the rejection of what he calls a \"celestial dictatorship\". Jane is pursuing an education in the written word while Stephen seeks to find a unifying theory that can explain life, the universe, and everything. The two fall in love, only to face a roadblock when Stephen is diagnosed with a neurological disorder that threatens to destroy his motor skills one by one, giving him two years at most to live. Jane pledges to stay by his side, and although Stephen beats the odds and manages to live year after year, the struggles of caring for her crippled husband take their toll on Jane.If the above description seems like it forgot to mention that Stephen Hawking was a world famous physicist whose theories were revolutionary and world changing, it's because for the most part, the movie forgets this too. The most we see of Stephen's career is regulated to the beginning and end of the movie, with passing mentions made to the evolution of his work made whenever the film needs to remind the audience of where we are in history; such as in a moment shortly after the birth of Stephen's third child, when his father mentions that Stephen is \"world famous\". Having never seen Stephen working on anything beyond giving a lecture or two, we never actually see how he got to this point. It's frustrating, because the film doesn't seem to want to find a way to balance \"Stephen the Husband\" with \"Stephen the Physicist\", and so we watch as The Physicist is shoved to the margins.Not that the story of Jane and Stephen is terrible, it's just that its good moments are few and far in between. A lot of these struggles manifest in tropes so familiar, there was a point when I really felt that this could've been any story about a husband and wife dealing with the pain of a partner's disease. The fact that it involves Stephen and Jane Hawking is, at times, almost entirely inconsequential. These flaws aren't helped by some of the film's problematic directing and editing choices. Certain scenes seem to trail on after they clearly should've ended, and important characters are thrown into the film far too late, only to disappear again without mention. When Emily Watson showed up almost an hour in without being identified, I was left baffled until Felicity Jones drops a \"Mum\" in her line to signify who she's speaking to. Why are we meeting such an important person in Jane's life, played by such a serious actress, this late in the movie? It's just one example of some of the sloppy structure choices made by director James Marsh.It's only Eddie Redmayne, who truly makes his presence as an actor known here, that keeps the movie from sinking into the muddy bog of familiarity. As Stephen loses more and more of his basic motor skills, Redmayne finds ways to make every movement count, whether it's a playful smirk or a downward glance of pain. His chemistry with Felicity Jones, who turns the inner conflict of Jane's struggles into a revelatory performance of its own, is endearing; and when the two are allowed to flex their acting muscles they create some of the films greatest moments. Honorable mentions also go to Beno\u00eet Delhomme's gorgeous cinematography and J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's powerful score.Ultimately \"The Theory Of Everything\" has joined the ranks of \"Ray\" and \"Jobs\" and \"Dallas Buyers Club\": performance pieces more concerned with winning acting awards than telling a good story. As memorable as Redmayne and Jones are, their talents only serve to turn a film that would've been completely forgettable into \"good but not great\". The Hawking's deserved better.",

To the Homer Simpson crowd he is known as \"the wheel chair guy.\" The film is not only biographical, but gives hope to people with ALS. In circa 1963 Hawking was given two years to live. Apparently God saw fit to give him more time to prove he doesn't exist. You get 25 minutes of Hawking before he is diagnosed.It is also a love story and includes a brief history of his wife Jane (Felicity Jones) who struggled and fell.Hawking is an iconic pop cultural figure too as his book took complex ideas and made them available for the masses. If you watched the film \"God's NOT Dead\" it is Hawking who they parse in an attempt to prove God's existence, i.e. you must prove Hawking wrong first to prove God exists. He is that powerful of a figure.The film omits quite a bit of his life and work, but hits the highlights in an abbreviated and sometimes low budget fashion. For instance we see him enter the chambers to be awarded and then afterwards. We don't see the act itself. Steven also likes to frequent certain type of California adult entertainment establishments. This is reduced to him looking at a Penthouse magazine. The famous runaway wheel chair accident is omitted.If I had one criticism of the film it is the ending when they run the film, i.e. time backwards as it shows the producers have no idea what Hawking really said about reversing time. It couldn't be like that due to the laws of entropy. The smashed glass could not put itself back together. Hawking specifically states this in his book.A movie for science buffs and non-science folk alike.No f-bombs. One Damn. Shows near nudity from an open Penthouse.

And yet the meeting of Stephen and his first wife Jean is so quick and easy, it's not one bit interesting.As an actor and probably the next Oscar winner, Eddie Redmayne transforms from a quirky, ambitious student into the tortured, wheelchair-bound genius, but the performance shouldn't be compared to Daniel Day Lewis in MY LEFT FOOT since this particular vehicle seems more like an actor's workshop than a fleshed-out biopic with a genuine character arc.It's as if the scriptwriter wanted Hawking's controversial philosophies on Atheism, through the prism of discovering a powerful Black Hole, to have a cinematic soundboard \u2013 with an intellectual date movie buried within the stardust. Yet after tedious bouts of soap opera diatribes we never really know the man behind the suffering and brilliance, and how he managed to bridge his personal life with his breakthrough in science, and beyond.Like an actual Black Hole, this particular THEORY has an intriguing design with absolutely nothing inside.",

I want to see Hawking, and I want to hear about his theories on the universe. There's little to no science present here, leaving the experience oddly hollow.

Adapted from Jane Hawking's memoirs of her life with her husband Stephen Hawking, the film elegantly and honestly chronicles their triumphs and struggles together following his diagnosis at age 21 of a debilitating motor-neuron disease (ALS), which doctors predicted would kill him in two years. Much in the spirit of \"The King's Speech\", it is a story of going up against the odds, no matter how high they are stacked against you, and still emerging victorious. Neither a straight-forward biopic nor strictly a love story, the result is something that gives a somewhat deeper portrait of its subjects than most films based on the lives of real people usually show.Anthony McCarten's excellent script is bolstered by the two very capable leads of Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking and Felicity Jones as his wife Jane. Neither seem the least bit daunted by the reality of playing real-life figures who, contrary to the norm for biographical films, are still living, and ably match each other in sincere, emotional performances. A pivotal moment where Hawking has lost the ability to speak and literally can't find the words is made all their more heartbreaking by their combined talents.Jones is a powerhouse, bringing a strength and determination not typically seen in female roles. She does credit to her real-life counterpart, a young woman who single-handedly saw to it that nothing would stand in the way of her husband's reaching his full potential, both in his career and his life, yet had her own demons to fight as well. In my humble opinion, her performance puts her as real contender for the Best Actress Oscar next year. Eddie Redmayne, who happens to be a dead-ringer for the famed physicist, gives a fearless turn as Stephen Hawking. His performance is neither affected nor clownish, and at all times deeply moving. He emulates the effects of the disease so convincingly it's hard to believe it is just an act. As Hawking's ALS progresses, his motor function becomes more and more limited, yet Redmayne never lets you forget the brilliant mind inside. He allows Hawking's indomitable spirit and quirky sense of humor to shine through; merely a sly smile, a twist of the head, a glance, and you'd swear you were looking at the man himself. This complete habitation of a character is the kind that has to be seen to be believed, and coming from someone so young makes it doubly impressive. I know it's a tired clich\u00e9 to say that actors who play disabled characters deserve all the awards, but if anyone has earned a Best Actor Oscar this year, it's him.I found myself profoundly impressed by \"The Theory of Everything\" for many reasons. In an era where we can so easily lose our perspective on life and take so much for granted, it makes you genuinely count your blessings and be grateful for what you have. It also serves as an inspiration to believe that anything is possible, especially in view of the fact that Hawking continues, fifty-odd years after his diagnosis, to defy all odds. I feel it will be an important film not only in an artistic sense, but also for bringing to the public consciousness the inner life of one of our century's greatest minds. If only a handful of people go out of the theatre understanding Stephen Hawking as more than a man in a wheelchair, then I believe it will have accomplished at least some of its purpose. With that being said, it isn't a film for everyone. For those used to quick cuts and continuous action, the powerfully character-driven storyline and lengthy close-ups with stretches of little to no dialogue may make it seem overlong, but if you appreciate a well-crafted film that gets you to think and feel as only a good film can, then don't hesitate to appreciate it for all it has to offer.",

So seeing him depicted before his disease took hold and having a relationship with a pretty woman named Jane and their marriage and eventual three offspring was something of a revelation to me and Mom. Also, how touchingly devoted she was to him even with all the ravages of his health coming into effect through the years. The way they grew gradually apart was also sensitively done as well as who their next partners would become as they got introduced later in the narrative.

At once walking and talking like any other student, he is gradually struck with a disease that debilitates him. Confined to a wheelchair, a bout of near-fatal pneumonia requiring a tracheotomy, unable to speak, and needing a computer system to voice the words in his brilliant mind, Stephen Hawking would be a great influence on the scientific community, particularly in his work on the black hole and the vast boundaries of the universe. The film occasionally touches on his dealings with religion and God due to his wife and helpful assistant (a choir director Jane eventually falls in love with) being of the Christian faith. And while also occasionally highlighted considering the focal character's profession and genius so intertwined with science, the struggles with disease and how Stephen overcomes what limits him is the most important aspect of the biopic. Stephen and Jane are equally important to those behind this biopic. Stephen is so well thought of in this film, he's basically a patron saint\u0085the film seems to go out of its way to make him as endearing and worthy of affection as possible. Jane is shown primarily as a wife and mother in constant struggle to help him, but her efforts eventually demand someone more inclined to patiently offer devotion to him, which a hired nurse is able to (which Stephen eventually falls in love with). The ending reflects a reunion between former married partners when the queen offers a special accommodation, and Stephen has Jane look at their children, realizing what they have accomplished. Sugary and sweet when it needs to be, rarely showing any strife despite a disease that one would think might exist, the film just doesn't want to look at Stephen as anything but commendable. The score is fitting for the kind of biopic being presented: it is effectively sentimental, elegant, tragic, and encouraging. The score, like the dreamy photographic look, aims to manipulate our emotions and take us on a journey that allows us to embrace this man wholeheartedly. As far as depicting the complications of a horrible disease, this film knocks it out of the ballpark. But I think what is ultimately fascinating about the man\u2014the genius and the science that came from it--is less important to those that made this film. This film cares deeply about Stephen, but it glosses over a great deal of what people in his field consider important.Redmayne offers a painstakingly detailed physical performance mimicking Stephen's plight; it screams Oscar bait, but he's damned impressive just the same. Felicity Jones is equally good as the burdened but mostly loyal wife. Their chemistry is first rate. I do think the film takes creative license and paints in strokes that allows us to come away with a great deal of respect and admiration for Stephen, without seeing him *warts and all*.",

            "content": "In a recent review of a Christian propaganda film I did state that there's a danger of elevating Professor Stephen Hawking as the greatest scientist in the history of humanity . According to other scientists this simply isn't true , he's not on a par with the likes of Albert Einstein or Ernest Rutherford or many scientists of the 20th Century . He is of course what is known as a celebrity scientist who along with the abrasive love him or hate him biologist Richard Dawkins and uber-geek boy Brian Cox someone who can make the intricate , mind boggling and often incomprehensible topic of science understandable and fascinating for a mainstream layman audience . Much of Hawking's celebrity comes from the very sad fact that he has spent the majority of his life trapped inside a useless body due to motor neuron disease . He is - and I hope no one picks me up wrong - the good human form of the pop culture sci-fi view of the alien genius villain who is all brain and no body such as The Mekon and Davros .I'm saying this because I've got the instinctive feeling that THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING might be getting rewarded for the subject rather than the content and is a film I found difficult to take to The story starts in 1963 with young able bodied intellectual future scientist Stephen Hawking meeting young literature student Jane Wilde at Cambridge University . I've no idea what the young Jane Wilde looked like in reality but played by the beautiful Felicity Jones she is an absolute stunner and by far the best moments of the film are in the early stages when romance blooms between this unlikely couple . Unfortunately adversity is on the horizon and unfortunately for the audience we then get the Oscar baiting type aspect that the film has its eyes on Director James Marsh made a rather reserved drama about the troubles called SHADOW DANCER which while treating the subject matter with non sensationalist respect brought a rather slow paced and poetic feel to the film which I wasn't too keen on and I found myself wishing he'd done something a bit more risky and dynamic with this film which has that look of a light hearted one off drama you see on Sunday nights on ITV . Despite the absolute liberties taken with facts at least in A BEAUTIFUL MIND director Ron Howard did bring a great visual panache to a rather talkative film . Here however there's little in the way of cinematic feel and revolves around love in the face of adversity . Ask yourself this: If THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING wasn't about real characters in a film based on a true life story would it have picked up so many rewards or nominations ? I rest my case",

            "content": "'THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING': Four Stars (Out of Five)The Oscar contender biopic about renowned physicist Stephen Hawking and his relationship with his wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. It's based on Jane's memoir 'Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen' and focuses more on her point of view; of their lives together. The film stars Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking and Felicity Jones as his wife Jane. It costars Charlie Cox, Emily Watson, Simon McBurney and David Thewlis. It was directed by James Marsh and written by Anthony McCarten. Hawking approved of the film's production (and the finished product) and even provided his Equalizer computerized voice, for his character in the movie. I found the film to be pretty well made, and somewhat interesting, but also a tad too slow and uninvolving (in places). The story begins when Jane Wilde (Jones) first met Stephen Hawking (Redmayne) and follows their relationship, as he first finds out he has motor neuron disease. She stays with him, through the hard times, and accepts his proposal for marriage. The two have a family together as Hawking continues to pursue his dreams in physics, and eventually becomes one of the most famous physicists of all-time. The story stays focused on the couple's love for each other and doesn't stray too much into the details of Hawking's groundbreaking scientific discoveries. As a love story I thought the film was very sweet and touching; I especially like how it shows the ways in which Stephen and Jane made things work, despite their troubles; especially the ones brought about by Stephen being an atheist and Jane being a faithful Christian. Still I'm not a big fan of biopics and I had hoped a movie about one of the greatest geniuses of all-time would have focused more on his passions for science and discovery, rather than just being another routine relationship study. The performances are good though and the directing is decent. It's definitely a movie worth seeing, even if it doesn't quite deserve all of it's hype and possible (upcoming) awards recognition.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chY2PeSnCng",

We see him fall in love with Jane Wilde and start to develop some interesting theories before being diagnosed with motor neurone disease. He is told that he will probably live another two years at most but rather than giving up he throws himself into his research into time and the nature of black holes. The two years soon pass but he shows no signs of dying; in fact he is working as hard as ever on his research and starts a family with Jane, who is now his wife. Things get harder still when he has a tracheotomy and loses his ability to speak. Even this doesn't dissuade him from his research, it does however start to put a strain on his relationship with Jane as he becomes close to his nurse Elaine and Jane gets closer to Jonathan, a man she met at church.If anybody is worried that this film will be bogged down with complicated science needn't be concerned as it is far more about Stephen Hawking's relationship with his wife Jane and how they deal with his condition. Eddie Redmayne is outstanding in the role of Stephen Hawking as he depicts him going from an apparently healthy young man to a man confined to a wheelchair who can no longer speak; it isn't just a case of sitting in the chair he captures the mannerisms and posture of the real Professor Hawking\u0085 it is no surprise that he picked up an Oscar for his work. Given his outstanding performance it would be easy to overlook Felicity Jones' performance as Jane; she may be playing an 'ordinary' person but her performance is far from ordinary. The rest of the cast are also impressive. Overall I found this to be a moving story that was definitely worth watching.",

The life of \"A Brief History in Time\" author Stephen Hawking, with a screenplay adapted from Jane Hawking's book \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,\" is glossy and professionally-assembled, right down to the romantic blue light that bathes the young lovers at the dance where they first meet. As Stephen Hawking, Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne is puckish and charming; it's a masterful performance that must carry the movie emotionally for quite a stretch, yet Redmayne is equal to the challenge. Playing his seemingly tireless spouse (who bore three of Stephen's children even while his muscles were rapidly failing), Felicity Jones has to play a saint, a daunting task. Jones is not required to show joy or splendor because, apparently, Jane Hawking was too busy being a nursemaid/wife/mother to be truly happy; the one sequence where Jones is allowed to brighten a bit is when Stephen, an atheist, first references God in his manuscript and shares the moment with her. The film isn't full of pomp and prestige--it's entertaining and moving--but the notion that Stephen is just a delightful, wily genius in a wheelchair is rather tough to swallow. \"The Theory of Everything\" isn't a puff piece on the physicist and author, but neither is it a probing investigation of the man behind those theories. **1/2 from ****",

Eddie Redmayne gives an impressive physical performance as Hawking (it's no wonder he won the Oscar -- the Academy loves performances like these), while Felicity Jones suffers nobly, as wives always do in biopics like this. She is really the more interesting character, or would be if the film allowed her to be, instead of treating her as an assemblage of personality traits it can use to move the plot forward. All of the dramatic conflicts in the film are treated equally, and none of them seem to carry much significance. Hawking's announcement that he's leaving his wife, for example, is handled by the actors as if he's told her he just spotted a mouse in the basement.The film does a good job of recreating its time period, which is something another Oscar-bait period piece from the same year, \"The Imitation Game,\" didn't do. Still, the film manages to look like a magazine ad, everything bathed in a glossy glow.The story of Stephen Hawking is so interesting and the movie is competently enough made that it ends up by default as being interesting itself.

A bit shy, he spies a beautiful fellow student, Jane (Felicity Jones) at a campus party one night and they have a great conversation. Before long, Stephen is asking her to a special dance, even though he can't cut a rug himself! There is one huge difference in their lives, however. Jane is a devout Christian while Stephen is a professed atheist, only trusting in science. Suddenly, the courtship is on hold. This is due to a terrible fall Stephen has on a sidewalk and the subsequent, very sobering diagnosis of motor neuron disease, similar to ALS. Naturally, Stephen is disheartened and holes up in his room. Only Felicity, arriving to see what has occurred, restores hope to him, with her declaration of love. They are married, they soon have a son. But, the progression of the disease is awful while the doctors give him two years to live. Meanwhile, theories of the creation of the universe and other \"small\" topics keep his mind focused away from his doomed future. But, is it so? The couple has two more children and, despite being reduced to a wheelchair, Stephen lives on. What exactly does the future of S and J hold? This very fine film chronicles the life of the brilliant British scientist, Hawking, and his physical and emotional struggles. Also told is the lesser known tale of his first wife, Jane. As the physicist, Redmayne is superb, making Hawking's descent into anatomical deterioration very, very real. Jones is likewise wonderful and the rest of the cast, including Emily Watson, a great collection of performances as well. All movie amenities, from sets to costumes, script, and direction are of the highest caliber as well. No, its not a happily ever after story, in many ways, but it is an extremely well done tale of the courage and determination of the human spirit.

This films falls into two categories, both of which I am generally wary of: it is \"worthy\" (which often carries with it the unspoken addendum \"and dull\"), and it features what Robert Downey Jr's character referred to as \"full retard\" in Tropic Thunder ie. a portrayal of some sort of debilitating condition which often supercharges a performance in terms of being Oscar bait.This is a story which is both inspiring and heartbreaking, often at the same time. It is often funny, often happy, just as often sad, and very moving. It doesn't concentrate on Hawking's MND (although this is, of necessity, a major part of his life story) but, instead, treats that as just part of the tale to be told of a man, his accomplishments, and his family.Felicity Jones, a favourite of mine for some little while now, is very good here in a role which doesn't give her a lot more to do than be the straight man to Redmayne's turn as Hawking. This sort of set-up can overshadow the performance by the second fiddle (viz. Tom Cruise in Rain Man), but Jones does well without ever overdoing it.But this is Redmayne's show. You have to acknowledge the physicality of the performance in terms of reproducing the effect of Hawking's MND but, for me, the real strength of his performance is in the shy confidence of the young Hawking, the subtlety and emotional conveyed despite facial contortion and no dialogue, and the joie de vivre which shines out from start to finish.This film frequently brought me to tears. It is wonderful, and I recommend it.",

Full of trust and devotion that is until Hawking had a blazing affair with his married care giver/assistant and fled from his wife and kids to marry her. The film also depicts his wife having her own fling. Devotion to science yes but as others have pointed out the empty chair in the room is science itself, left out in the cold. We learn little about his scientific genius. We see awards, invitations to award ceremonies etc.but almost no real essence of his achievements, what they are, how they have altered our thinking and understanding of the universe. Suddenly he mentions god, why? Suddenly he abandons his early theory, why? How? When?I say devotion to wealth because this is how and why he survived when almost all others with his disease have perished early on. His fame and fortune helped provide him the best 24/7 care possible plus electronic gizmos that gave him the gift of communication which allowed him keep working and hence keep his sanity. The help of others: We see so many stories of devastating illness and how films depict people's successful efforts to overcome i.e. special Olympics. Sadly, Stephen's illness is so devastating that there is never an issue of recovery, of regaining speech, movement etc. He can and does survive but we can only witness a progressive disease that never lets up, even for an instant. Sadly, most of the film hammers us with the step by step progression of this horrid disease and its sequele. Unlike other man/woman conquer disease stories Stephen was never able to overcome the physical damage to his body. Luckily, his brain, his genius survived.We watch the same relationship soap opera many have lived, namely,a family under great stress that succumbs via his wife's inability first to cope with his care and next have an affair whilst Stephen is having his own affair with married women until he leaves his wife and kids for a grass-is-greener divorce and re-marriage that lasts all of about six years.

Stephen is given two years to live but plans on using his mind to get as much done as possible with the assistance of his wife.THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a story that a lot of people are going to know very well but I will admit that I knew very little about the subject, his life or his work. I pretty much went into the film not knowing what to expect in terms of the story and there's no question that the work this man has done is quite remarkable. Not only is his work remarkable but the fact that he's overcome all of these obstacles is something amazing.As far as the film goes, I thought there were certainly some flaws along the way but there's no doubt that it features some of the greatest performances of the year including Redmayne who turns in one of the most memorable performances in decades.While watching Redmayne, I couldn't help but think of silent star Lon Chaney. Chaney was known for not only his make-up effects but the various ways that he could deform his body and play a wide range of characters. Watching Redmayne pretty much cripple himself from one scene to the next was amazing to watch. In fact, it's hard to take your eyes off of him with the various twitches in his body and the way the actor pulls it off.There's no a single frame here where you feel like you're watching an actor. It really does seem as if you're watching someone battle this disease. Once the character loses the ability to speak, there's a sequence where Hawkings breaks down and it's an incredibly powerful sequence. Jones is also extremely good in her supporting, not-as- flashy role. She perfectly brings a certain toughness to her character that obviously she would need to survive the entire ordeal. Emily Watson, David Thewlis and Charlie Cox all add wonderful support.The film also contains some great cinematography and a very strong, emotional score.As I said earlier, there were certainly some flaws in the film including the opening twenty-minutes, which I thought were rather weak. It really took me a while before I warmed up to the characters and the story but things certainly pick up once the illness hits.

James Marsh's THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is the quintessential archetype of this sort and it is going to give Eddie Redmayne the coveted Oscar for such a taxing mission to imitate Stephen Hawking, the still alive-and-kicking bigwig cosmologist. However, Marsh conducts the film with a fluid pace and it wondrously invigorated by its technical crew, particularly J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's engrossing soundtrack and the ever- pervasive subdued light from lighting department. So, as a result, the film itself is a pretty good biopic, or more specifically, a good (even great) hagiography, since it is adapted from Jane Hawking's autobiography, she is Hawking's first wife and their marriage lasted for 30 years (1965-1995). Hence Jane (Jones) is not just a supportive wife who lives through all the ups-and-downs with Hawking, but completely overshadowed by his achievement and put aside in the corner as we might expect from any standard biopic of great man, instead, Jane is as much in center both in this picture and the un-common relationship as her renowned husband, it is their love story that touches, impresses and melts our hearts, so if you are going to this film harboring a false hope to witness Hawking's extraordinary academic path, you are destined to feel disappointed. On the other hand, the script excruciatingly whitewashes Jane and Stephen's extramarital affairs to offer both a mutual more high ground of looking good, their m\u00e9nage- \u00e0-trois period with sweet widower Jonathan (Cox) is overwhelmingly in rapport, Jane's repressed feelings towards Jonathan never dare to overstep the social boundary, the most explicit indication is Jane's night visit of Jonathan's tent during a camping, then, that is it, it is always a safe card to leave the rest to audience's imagination, as far as the next morning they are not shown together walking out of the same tent, it is safe! As for Stephen's dallying with Elaine (Peake), goes a little bit more explicitly, using Penthouse magazine as the catalyst, but no further familial conflict is presented, the ugly side is well-preserved in the memories of those who are involved firsthand, audience's voyeuristic curiosity again is quenched mercilessly by the tacit agreement of the filmmakers and the insiders. No one should depreciate Redmayne's performance, even for the most sharp-tongued disparager, he is absolutely par excellence, when you grab such a once-in-a-lifetime chance and pull off a role with such sublime verisimilitude and imposing elbow-grease, Oscar is in your pocket, even a revered veteran's belated comeback stunner cannot take it away from you (sorry, Michael Keaton). Felicity Jones, is equally excellent, but without a physical-transformation edge to secure a win and one disadvantage is that she is hampered by the default of a hagiography, there is something emotive wanting. Nevertheless, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a cohesively-orchestrated eulogy of the power of love, love is the theory behind everything, not time, not space, not God, only love, even it has decomposed into a past tense, the feeling of its once authentic presence will still be dauntless enough to encourage us to strive in this world of infinity, that's why we should thank this movie for giving us the blessing.",

Come 2014, The Theory Of Everything belongs to similar genre diving deep into the relationship of a well-known personality with his better half.As we look into personal life of the famous Physicist, Stephen Hawking, we are also shown about his work while fighting against the rare disease which keeps him on wheel chair for the entire life.Famous for making documentary \" Man On Wire\", James Marsh adapts the book of same name based on the life of legendary Stephen Hawkings and written by Jane Hawking. The reason I brought A beautiful Mind comparison as it dealt with mysterious life of well-known educated professor. The movie begins with evolution of a scientist and how he meets Jane. A small incident changes his life but he does not lose hope. Jane is his pillar of support and helps him keep motivated. The screenplay falters little bit but bounces back with nice climax. The background score with gorgeous cinematography adds on extra charm to the film. Full marks should be given to Eddie Redmayne for fitting the role of Stephen Hawking. Hats off to Felicity Jones for the playing the role of Jane Hawkings.Overall, a wonderful movie in every sense. Watch it to know the actual story of Stephen Hawking.

They really do bring this movie to life, which is a Biography on the relationship between Stephen Hawking and his wife. I will admit the movie did get boring at times for me which I sort of feel guilty about. Since it's about a man that has a brilliant mind but deals with a illness that paralyzes his body. And tries to cope with the situation while having a relationship and coming up with theory on time and existence. The cinematography is beautifully shot and the music really fits into the environment. What I thought that was lacking was a bit more substance and less clich\u00e9. Also the lack of science and how Hawking came up with his theory could disappoint some audiences. Although the actor was spot on playing Stephen Hawking but more focus on his thought process and answering to why and how of certain areas of the character would have made it better in my own opinion. Oh and also I don't know all about the whole relationship situation between Hawking and his first wife, but his first wife was a sacrificial saint. So yeah, it's a elegantly crafted movie that might come off a bit too clich\u00e9 to some audiences including myself.6.5/10",

            "content": "This is 2014's most overrated film of the year. While Eddie Redmayne is good as Stephen Hawking, it's really just a performance that deceives the viewer and critic. He looks like Hawking. His hair and clothes look like Hawking. He does the 'Hawking' smile and weird thinking stare face and frowns. Yes, he does a believable Hawking. Well done. But it's just a glorified impersonation. There's no actual great acting or stretch of a transformation or method or scenes that Redmayne is tested as an actor nor Hawking's character development. The dialogue and interactions, aside from using actual Hawking quotes from speeches and writings, are awful and boring and redundant and derivative. The whole performance is mild and plain, and the story is weak. The story has generally been done before. There are no significant scenes or moments that go above and beyond anything generic, nor anything for Redmayne to truly bite into to 'perform.' Even the accident and fall portion of the film is mild and never really becomes that emotional at all. Mostly, the film fails miserably in exploring Hawking's internal thoughts, imagination, rituals, and inspirations.It plays like a T.V. movie. And quite frankly i'm tired of these Hollywood films doing biopics about an ENTIRE life, using montage and generic moments that aren't specific or significant enough. Biopics that are focused on a period on a life is more interesting than trying to do a whole life in two hours. There's no sense of Hawking and his children in his life. Births are fast-tracked, montage child play and smiles. The film gives you an impression of just Jane, his wife, being a vessel for children. There's no sense of Hawkings personal life, interests, time spent, or anything underpinning the vast ideas he develops. We see him on a beach or being pushed in a wheelchair by family as piano plays. The film is devoid of politics or popular culture and changing times of each decade other than clothes as lazy indicators, and the exception of pointing out Penthouse a few times as some recurring wink wink joke to convey Hawking as some sexual guy. This 'sexualized' Hawking happens throughout the film in various ways...\"so Stephen, do some things still 'work.'\" The movie mostly follows Jane and her torn affair with some choir priest. In fact, Jane is in more scenes and gets more to act on screen than Stephen Hawking (and Redmayne for that matter). The story is more focused on tripe romance and affair rather than Hawking. And even when departing, a montage is set in again. No emotional development is organic. And, perhaps, maybe as brilliant as Hawking is and as tragic as his condition is, maybe he's just a boring guy and not much can be that interesting in terms of a character on film in scenes other than a guy sitting in a wheelchair mumbling and smiling and frowning. The film would've done a better job with Hawking's imagination and space interpreted in shots, as well as the times he was living in and absorbing and watching as opposed to generic renderings of his domestic life (which was still mild and safe compared to the actual reality) and Jane's struggle and perspective. Everything is furthered by cued dramatic music and montage and shots of faces occasionally. By trying to cram in broad strokes in writing the film into a corner with Jane's story, the theory of everything becomes theory of nothing.",

            "content": "The understanding of us is a pursuit that great minds like Newton, Galileo and Einstein have gone after for generations. Their the ones that always asked \"How did the universe begin?\" and \"Is there an ending or a boundary for the universe?\". They are seen as people the people that can take mankind into the next steps through science to get a better understanding of life. They also face controversy as some of their ideas contradict religious beliefs and even the existence of God. I don't see much of an issue myself as I'm a Christian and I see much of the ideas as searching how the universe works and not the universe itself, therefore allowing my belief in God to be justified.One such person to be recognized in the field of physics is Stephen Hawking. His bestseller A Brief History of Time has opened up the door of complicated mathematics and ideas of the cosmos to the mainstream public. What people love about this guy is that even with the complication of a motor neuron disease, he has been able to continue with his scientific journey and that he remains an active lecturer. His early life and romances are revealed in The Theory of Everything. While a young man, Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) is a very intelligent student who is taking his steps into earning his doctorate at Cambridge in England. He is also socially awkward and likes to shut himself in his room as he studies. That changes when he meets Jane Wilde (played by Felicity Jones) who takes a liking to the young man despite their academic and religious differences. Hawking is a cosmologist while Jane is a literature student. Hawking is agnostic while Jane is a Christian. The two still manage to enjoy their time with each other and start a relationship.A fall at his school sends him to the hospital where it's revealed that he has Lou Gehrig's disease and that he only has about two years to live. Jane decides that she loves him enough that she will stay with and care for him. they marry and they have three children together. As Hawking's condition deteriorates further into a wheelchair, he finally allows more help. This results in a man Jonathan Jones (played by Charlie Cox) into becoming a caretaker as Jane struggles with her feeling towards him and her love and beliefs for Hawking, When I saw the first preview for The Theory of Everything, I thought that the movie was going to be too schmaltzy. It's clear that this is a romance and not a full biopic. So in a way, its probably more romanticized then it was before. But as stories go, this one isn't bad. The Theory of Everything rationalizes that true love is always sticking with your partner and with both of it's leads being very likable, I can see that working. Eddie Redmayne fires away one of the best acting performances of the year as Stephen Hawking. He portrays him as a ambitious scientist and even a bit selfish in his later years, but still make him relatable when it comes to sticking with his principle. He really wants to be seen not as a cripple who succeeds, but as a great mind who triumphs. Felicity Jones is also great, giving us a young woman who may be peaceful with her mind, but no nonsense with her actions. She's the only one that can get through to her husband, even against doctors and other scientists. I'll give this eight and a half A Brief History of Time books out of ten. This one is more of an acting piece then a great story, but this is what I would have liked to have seen from last years August: Osage County.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Stephen Hawking would most certainly make anyone's list of the most fascinating people to have overcome severe obstacles in life to achieve greatness. Even today, at age 72, Hawking remains one of the foremost physicists and cosmologists. His extraordinary mind now 50+ years trapped inside a body that failed him, and as we learn, should have killed him by the time he was 23.Director James Marsh is known for his work on two documentaries: Project Nim, and Man On Wire. His flair with reality in those two films is mostly kept in check with this conventional biopic. Based on Jane Hawking's book \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\", the film does a nice job of showing us the stages of his motor neuron disease, while never digging too deep into the resulting hardships for Stephen or Jane (his wife).Eddie Redmayne (Les Miserable, My Week with Marilyn) delivers the type of performance that often results in awards. His physical contortions capture the Hawking we have all seen, yet he also emotes the charm and wry humor that accompanies his genius. Jane is played by Felicity Jones (so terrific in Like Crazy) and since it's based on her book, we are provided a glimpse into her strength and tenacity as she refuses to give up on Hawking or their relationship.Some basic science is touched upon here - mostly through beer foam on a table or the glowing embers from a fireplace, but it's highly recommended that you read Hawking's best selling book \"A Brief History of Time\" if you have not already done so. It's written using language so clear and concise, that even I almost understood it! Much more than science, this film is about the tenacity of Jane and her ability to keep Stephen moving forward while still pursuing her own studies and raising their three kids.The evolution of their relationship is deftly handled, even as they each drift away towards others. When the break eventually occurs, it is the one moment in the film where heartfelt emotion is on full display. Oddly enough, it's more relief for both parties than disappointment. In light of the doctor's original estimate of two years to live, this moment is quite poignant.Excellent support work comes courtesy of David Thewlis as Hawking's professor and mentor, Emily Watson as Jane's mother, Simon McBurney as Stephen's dad, Charlie Cox as Jonathan (Jane's second husband), and Maxine Peake as Elaine (Stephen's second wife). Also of note, Harry Lloyd plays Stephen's classmate and friend Brian. Mr. Lloyd is the great, great, great grandson of Charles Dickens.You can see this one without being intimidated by the science, and instead get a glimpse at Hawking's challenges and the strength of Jane.",

Instead it is a hodgepodge of 50% theatrics, 49% personal life drama and 1% science and even that of questionable accuracy. For example, it seems to imply that the theory of singularity was developed by Hawking and it was immediately hailed by the scientific world which is totally at odds with the account given by Hawking himself in his own book. The theory of stellar collapse was developed by Subrahmanyam Chandrasekhar on board a ship on his way to England for higher studies at Cambridge. It was based on his flash of insight that while Pauli Exclusion Principle is limited by Relativity, Gravity is not and therefore when a star above a certain mass (later named Chandrasekhar Limit) begins to collapse, it completely disappears into a mathematical abstraction called singularity. This shockingly alien concept was hotly contested by the scientific orthodoxy and ferociously attacked by his supervisor Sir Arthur Eddington and opposed by Einstein himself even though the mathematics was irrefutable (\"A Brief History of Time\", P. 83-85). In fact, Eddington's hostility was so vicious that Chandrasekhar had to switch his field of study although it later formed the foundation of the theory of Black Holes which was built upon by others like Oppenheimer. Arthur I. Miller's \"Empire of the Stars\" gives a detailed account of Chandrasekhar's scientific career and his rivalry with Eddington.Hawking is unquestionably one of the most brilliant minds of our time but to credit him with the achievement of another brilliant mind and to totally distort history does grave injustice to both of them and misguides the viewers.",

I don't know whether the walls and indoor decoration of Hawking's home were not only of the same time period but also pat to the last detail. Maybe the children of Hawking, in the movie, resembled the real Hawking's children. Maybe not. The point is, in this case, it doesn't matter how accurate the film was. That is because there is no real underside or revisionism or whitewashing, or cherry picking, in the very fabric itself of the Universe, er, I mean of Hawking's life. Everything is above board. Because of the lack of seediness in Hawking's life, the film comes across as quite authentic. Because most audience can know, they maybe can't all of the time, but they can know when they are being thought of as idiots. The Theory Of Everything respects its audience.It was a fine decision to omit the early years of Hawking's life. Hawking might have had a normal childhood, but being insanely precocious, he must have been lonely. But given that most biopics want to include a duality of the man in private and the public figure, Hawking's childhood isn't relevant. To compare, The Imitation Game did correctly to show us young Turing's childhood problems and his abortive romance with Christopher. Like the 1982 movie Gandhi, The Theory Of Everything shows us the defining moments of Hawking and his triumph as a physicist.These days the Oscar nominated movies have been gaining quite good soundtrack music. In these very average times, this is the one bright spot. The movie itself didn't move me. I don't know what the director could have done more. I think every shot was well calibrated and there must have been much thought and deliberation behind each decision. But one thing's the pity is that the physics, the subject matter and the touchy subject of atheism were not given more than a superficial whirl. The strongest scene was when Hawking is struggling in putting his sweater on and he has this epiphany that helps with his work. Such moments were rare. I must also say that the guy who plays Jonathan missed a chance to shine in a prominent role. He was not a very good actor. The performances could have made this movie better, but it was not to be.

In this movie Eddie Redmayne gives a really impressive performance embodying this physicist; performance which grants him an Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role. In fact, as it is a progressive disease, every stage of this disease is like a completely new performance for him. You witnessed how he has to adapt and communicate in certain way. All this process of learning how to cope with this terrible disease, how how his family's relations change throughout the film and his romance is very interesting. Undeniably Felicity Jones is an absolute revelation, she is incredible, and totally deserves her Oscar nomination for best actress in a leading role. They both brilliantly portrayed good people in a shitty situation. Above all this film is about all Stephen Hawking's life aspects: from schooling, his theory, his disease and his relationships. However the film is not really showcasing and focusing mainly on his theory but on his life journey. The little chunks of science are really accessible though, as Stephen Hawking is explaining his theory such as everyone can get it. Finally, there are twists and turns that surprised me at times. Now I really hope Jupiter Ascending is good because otherwise it will ruin Eddie Redmayne' career and I am going to be really really sad.

And the degree of both is just above average.Anthony McCarten may have had plenty of headaches while writing this romantic drama under the disguise of a biography, because how large a gimmick is the story, the same goes for director James Marsh in building the setup. They should've had gone back in time, defying their subject scientist's theory, and pondered upon how to create an adaptation of a memoir which seems partly biographical and mostly a novella. I haven't read the memoir and nor do intend to, but the main problem with this apparently inspiring film is that it focuses more on the personal lives of Professor Hawking and his ex-wife. While that be it, the thing that fuels this problem into a wildfire is that the audience think of it as just not a romantic drama (like the synopsis suggests), but actually an upright biography about the cosmologist.To an extent, even director James Marsh (whose Oscar-winning doc Man On Wire, about Philippe Petit's daredevil act, failed to gather traction, so Robert Zemeckis is making a film) tries to sweep it off as a romantic drama. The ounces of insights into the professor's study and his theories can be found only in the background, thus nullifying the whole shindig. As a romantic drama, I started loathing few characters, which if I disclose who may cause you to loathe me as well; characters who can be found in a string of romantic dramas over the past decades.As a biography, which it sometimes pretends to be, The Theory of Everything shuns science which is ironic. Eddie Redmayne is fabulous, although he may slip by with only an Oscar nod, maybe. Felicity Jones is sweet and so were the supporting characters, who would have had bigger roles to act if this were not a genre confusing tide.The cinematography is fine, and so is the music, the latter of which tries to support the apparent inspiration inducing characteristic I was talking about. All said and done, the film never quite bores you, always engaging us with short sequences that describe as to what really happened since 1963. Had they exploited 5 minutes of the 120 minute narration to explain his disease, I would have jumped up in my chair.BOTTOM LINE: The Theory of Everything is a non-self-deprecating drama that takes its viewers on a canoe-ride into the lives of the great Stephen Hawking and second-rate Jane Hawking. A drama so good and a biography so bad that if I wanted to learn about the scientist's theories, I would reread his books.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",

The Theory of Everything is a biography on the life and challenges of Stephen Hawking, the Theoretical Physicist who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's (ALS) disease and told he was not expected to live for any more than two years upon his diagnosis at age 21 in 1963. Eddie Redmayne is a good actor who this year walked away and won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance of Stephen Hawking but I really did not see how his performance was anything more than a cheaper imitation of John Hurt's performance in the Elephant Man. John Hurt did not win the 1981 Oscar that he was nominated for as the crippling and deformed figure of John Merrick.I understand the difficulty in crumpling up your body for a disease that gradually eats away at the central nervous system and still being able to live a full life. But watching Eddie crawl up a flight of stairs with his debilitating disease does not warrant beating out fellow Oscar nominees Keaton, Cumberbatch, Carell or even Cooper for that matter does it? This is not an enjoyable film, nor in my opinion did it capture the known historical events in Stephen Hawking's life (so far). But what I really don't understand is how Redmayne was honored with the Best Actor award for his performance over so many other superior performances by the other 2015 Oscar nominees. In my opinion the Oscar voters have lowered the bar much lower than it has ever gone in the past for warranting the Best Actor award.I have one question for the Oscar academy of voters. Did you actually see the other nominees performances? I give the film a 5 out of 10. As for the Best Actor award going to Eddie Redmayne for his performance? What The?",

Credibly capturing Hawking's gradually declining health, Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for his performance, but it is actually co-star Felicity Jones who has the film's best moments as his wife, struggling to remain strong and not cave into a desire for normality. She has a particularly touching part in which she tries to get her resistant husband to use a 'spelling board'. Given that the film is based on Jane Hawking's autobiographical account of her time with her ex-husband, it is unsurprising that Jones is given such a juicy character and so much focus; the film is equally about her as Hawking. And yet, Marsh's attempts to balance the film being about both leads to it falling short as an insight into the mind of the scientific genius. Hawking's theories are often pushed into the background compared to something like 'A Beautiful Mind' which had plenty of scenes dedicated to John Nash's thought processes. Supported by an excellent J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson score and detailed sets and costumes, this is certainly a handsome production, but those interested in a film more about Stephen than Jane Hawking may need to look elsewhere.",

The cinematography and score give the impression you are about to watch a heart-felt, inspirational tale where love conquers all. If we didn't already know we were about to watch a film based on the life of Stephen Hawking, we might think we were watching a romantic comedy set in a fantasy world.When it's revealed the main character has motor neurone disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the look and tone of the film stay bright and uplifting, despite the dark and depressing things we are watching unfold on-screen. Scenes shift between painfully heart-wrenching to light, fluffy melodrama better suited for a daytime soap. The Oscar bait clich\u00e9s are at an all-time high here, you start to wonder if during the credits they will resort to bloopers. At this point, the whole idea of the film seems in bad taste.While The Theory of Everything has some great performances, the look and execution are more suited for an A&E movie of the week. It's more interested in romanticizing a failed marriage rather than celebrating the work of a man with a brilliant mind. The result is an inconsistent, uninspired, painful bore.",

            "content": "Review: I quite enjoyed this emotional drama about Stephen Hawking and his rise to fame whilst suffering with a rare slow-progressing form of\u00a0amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\u00a0(ALS), also known as\u00a0motor neurone disease\u00a0or Lou Gehrig's disease, that has gradually paralysed him over the decades. The movie also concentrates on his relationship between him and his wife, Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) and it shows how she struggled to care for Hawking whilst bringing up there three children and studying for a PHD in medieval Spanish Poetry, whatever that is. Hawking also produced a best selling book called A Brief History Of Time which has sold more than 10 million copies and at 72 years of age, after getting told that he only had 2 years to live, he still continues to seek the theory of everything. This is truly a remarkable story about a man who, against all odds, is a scientific genius. It really does prove that you can achieve your dreams, no matter what obstacles come in your way. The performance from Eddie Redmayne is unbelievable and it must have been hard to perform because Hawking was on set while he was making the film. Felicity Jones also put in a great performance and the director told his story extremely well. Before I had seen this film, I never knew anything about his life so it was good to see him as an ordinary intelligent student before he came down with the terrible disease. The gradual decline in his abilities to do things, was sad to watch, but he still had his sense of humour and the ability to achieve his dreams. The love story was quite sad but they are still close friends and they have 3 grandchildren so it wasn't a sad ending. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and Eddie Redmayne really did deserve the many awards that he received for this role. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Like many others that have seen this movie, I really didn't know that Stephen Hawking was English. Maybe that's because his computer voice is American! I didn't understand why he turned down his knighthood from the Queen but I'm sure he had his personal reasons to do so. I couldn't help feeling that his wife was being a little bit of a bitch throughout the movie and she didn't show that much sympathy for Hawkings situation after a while. I'm glad that Hawking finally let her go so they both could find true happiness in there life's, because it made them closer as friends. Anyway, I have seen Hawking in a few TV series and he has made a couple of special appearance in a few programs and he still hasn't lost his sense of humour. That's what makes this a truly remarkable story and I couldn't help feeling emotional through it. This has boosted Eddie Redmayne straight into the limelight after starring in movies like Les Miserables and My Week With Marilyn. His next film starring Channing Tatum called Jupiter Ascending, has blockbuster written all over it so there no turning back for this 33 year old actor.Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $121.2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biopics about the remarkable life of Stephen Hawking and his rocky relationship with his wife. 7/10",

Mr. Redmaynes painstaking efforts are the only reason I gave it any rating at all. With all the facts and wonder we have have at our disposal about the man, why is it that there is little or nothing involving his deep, driving demand for 'the answer' and all that is entailed in his studies.

I realize that I need to cut to the chase, here: I'm torn because \"Everything\" is obviously a labor of love, and a paean to a contemporary secular saint. Ergo, I would be a stick-in-the-mud not to respect and enjoy it. But this doesn't change the fact that the treatment just rubbed me the wrong way.

Specially because Stephen was thrilled about it, and he made it very clear on the social networks. But i was highly disappointed. Eddie Redmaine is absolutely flawless, he really deserved that Oscar, so was Felicity Jones. I rated it with a five only for them and the soundtrack (i love The Cinematic Orchestra, which Arrival of the Birds and Transformation was PERFECT for that final scene that brought lots of tears to my eyes)...but that's about it.The movie focuses way too much on the romantic life of Hawking, his wife, his children (who suddenly disappear when it's convenient). I wanted to see more of Hawking's academic life, how his brilliance was acknowledge (you get only two fast paced scenes on this). I wanted to see how his theories changed the way we view ourselves, the universe, and our place in the universe. I wanted to see how he contributed so much to science in general and cosmology. Of course i wasn't expecting a documentary or i would see one, but i was expecting a film about Hawking and not about how ELA destroys a person's ability to move and to be 100% dependent on others. I definitely wasn't expecting to see a movie developing at the speed of light, where you can't really measure his brilliance (i mean, that shot of Hawking's on a cover of a magazine to give us a glimpse of how famous he was becoming is atrocious). If you don't know a thing about Hawking, you definitely won't learn anything with this movie, unless you are very, very, VERY curious and start your research (he deserves it). I hope, at least, that the movie will spark your curiosity for one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.",

It's her fight for her love for Stephen first, and then against his disease. She is the strongest character, even though the public easily sympathizes with everyone. They are people who have encountered difficulties in their lives and they feel extremely pure. The script is well written: the fact that it is focused more on the personal life of Stephen Hawking makes it easier to follow, although dealing a little more with his professional research would have made it deeper and maybe more philosophical.

            "content": "\"Your glasses are always dirty.\"I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with James Marsh's The Theory of Everything as I found the love story a bit bland and the biopic in general very conventional and safe. It is well produced and banks on a strong lead performance from Eddie Redmayne, but there is not really much else to the story. Marsh focuses on Hawking's relationship with his wife and the battle they faced together with his illness, but there is not much more to it and by the end I didn't feel I had learned anything new about this brilliant man. Marsh has made some interesting documentaries in the past (Project Nim and the far superior Man on Wire), and in a way this film seemed liked one covering one fact after another, but it lacked personality. I never believed the romance at the beginning of the movie; it was all rushed. The film's greatest flaw is that it tries to cover too long a period in Hawking's life. It goes from one memorable event in his life to the next without digging under the surface of who this brilliant man really was. I never felt connected with these characters despite their inspirational story. I wasn't moved by scenes or events in Hawking's life that should've moved me and I think it's because Marsh was focused on trying to cover all the important moments in his life. The greatest thing about this film is Redmayne's strong performance who deserves the recognition he has received, but I don't think there is anything else to it.I'm still surprised that Anthony McCarten's adapted screenplay was nominated for the Academy Awards, because I found everything about it very conventional. The screenplay was adapted from Jane Hawking's autobiographical book, so the film focuses more on their relationship than on Stephen's accomplishments (although we still get a scene where he receives a standing ovation from his scholars). We are told the story through Jane's point of view and despite loving this man very much she gets weary of him through the years since he doesn't accept help from anyone else. Some of my personal conclusions from this film are that his family isn't portrayed too well (they don't seem to do anything to help Stephen through his illness) and Stephen himself never seems to be grateful for what Jane is doing for him. Perhaps two reasons why the marriage didn't work out in the end.If there is one reason why I would recommend this film to anyone it's for Eddie Redmayne's performance alone. It is impressive how well he manages to portray Stephen's mannerisms, his facial expressions, and his movements. It is a physically demanding performance and Redmayne actually makes you believe he is battling through ALS. It may not be my favorite performance of the year (probably because I wanted to like this character more and get to know who he really was), but it is an incredible one nonetheless. Redmayne will forever be remembered for his role here. Felicity Jones has also received a lot of praise for her performance as Jane. It isn't nearly as showy as Redmayne's performance was, but she delivers a strong role. She is a talented actress, but I think she has been better in other films and is being a bit over-hyped for her performance here. The rest of the cast only appear as characters in a series of events with very little personality so there wasn't much Harry Lloyd, David Thewlis, Emily Watson, or Simon McBurney could bring to the film. Redmayne overpowers everyone here and this becomes his movie. He is the only reason why I am recommending this movie which to be honest I found quite boring otherwise.",

Furthermore I was very aware of the buzz around this film and especially the plaudits for the performance by Eddie Redmayne in the central role. So there was no way I was going to miss this movie and I was not disappointed. Redmayne is simply brilliant and totally inhabits the role, but I was also impressed by newcomer Felicity Jones as Hawking's first wife Jane.At one point in the film, Jane briefly explains the nature of the theory of everything: an attempt to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. But like CMB - the cosmic radiation that is regarded as proof of the big bang theory - the science is in the background. In the foreground is the relationship between Stephen and Jane and indeed the film is based on her 1999 memoir, \"Music To Move The Stars\" which was republished in a revised version in 2007 as \"Travelling To Infinity, My Life with Stephen\".Life married to a self-centred genius would never have been easy but, when one adds the impact of progressive motor neurone disease plus the fame that went with the former and the support staff that went with the latter, it is a testimony to Jane's humanity that the marriage lasted so long, although the later years were characterised by an open relationship on both sides. The towering performance by Redmayne, movingly displaying the physical deterioration over time, plus family scenes shot as if with a home movie camera, makes the film look more like a documentary than an artistic creation. Indeed brilliant British director James Marsh has more experience with documentaries (\"Man On Wire\") than films (\"Shadow Dancer\") and this skill has paid off enormously with this splendid film that is bound to win many awards.The most moving lines are when Stephen and Jane decide to part and when they are joined by their three children at Buckingham Palace and the final scenes - a flashback through time - offers a clever and apposite conclusion to the film but not the story (Hawking - given two years to live when first diagnosed with MND - is amazingly now 72).",

That his superior intellect developed astounding theories about the origins of the universe should be an inspiration to anyone facing obstacles in one's own life, be they minor or virtually insurmountable as seen here. Personally I would liked to have seen more in the way of Hawking's scientific method and how he came to his theories and discoveries. However even with the brief mentions alluded to in the film, I ask myself and the scientific community both - how can we ever really know anything about God and the origins of the universe? Hawking himself went through this dialectic, leaving me to ponder how Man can pretend to reduce the proof of anything to do with the origin of time and space to a single equation. Answers only leads to more questions, making a Theory of Everything a fatal conceit, though sometimes a decent movie.",

There is no need to worry about getting bogged down with cosmological arcana, since there are few details given as to what Hawking's fame as a scientist rests on. Some mention of black holes being mathematical singularities, that they may emit radiation and ultimately disappear, that maybe the creation of our universe could possibly be traced back to a singularity. I suppose this level of detail is appropriate for a movie targeting a general audience--those wanting more can attempt to read Hawking's \"A Brief History of Time.\"In popular culture Hawking is more well known for his decades long struggle with ALS than for his contributions to cosmology. The first part of the movie detailing the initial relationship between Steven and Jane is affecting, accentuated by the knowledge of what is to come. As well done as it is this prelude doesn't break much new ground--the story of two attractive young people falling in love is not a neglected topic. The main thrust of the movie concentrates on Hawking's disease and how that was handled by him and Jane as the disease progressed. I have to give Redmayne credit for his impressive performance, I hope he did not suffer any permanent physical damage from the contortions required by the part. Hawking has himself said that the movie gets things right, in the main. I just wish that it could have delved a little deeper. For example, touching on Hawking's thoughts on politics, religion, culture, and issues faced by the disabled, would have made this more interesting. Hawking's atheism was pretty much whitewashed. I suppose citing his quote that heaven is a myth for those afraid of the dark would have been out of place in the guarded approach taken here. There were some odd scenes like the one that has Hawking on stage later in life getting out of his wheelchair to pick up a pen that a woman in the audience had dropped. Whose fantasy was that? To what end was it in there?This is a polished production, maybe too polished. I had the feeling that, like dark matter, we didn't see a lot of details that we know must be there.",

Because this screenplay is an adaptation of his wife, Jane's (Felicity Jones) memoir, Traveling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen, the film is largely about their romance, which is nicely done, and their three children (a bit of a drag), and a brief episode or two of his actually lecturing about his theories of black holes, time, and the super question about the existence of God, whom Stephen makes a part of his argument..But if it has to be an emphasis on the challenges of their marriage and divorce, writer/director James Marsh has done well keeping the maudlin at bay and showing a sincere love between the principals.

What Redmayne is able to convey with his eyes is astonishing and I would be just fine with him winning the Oscar this year. The movie is, in essence, a \"two-hander\" and Jones more than holds her own as Hawking's wife Jane, and it was gratifying to watch two strong performances on the screen together.The story is told strongly by Director James Marsh while the cinematography brings strong, interesting visuals to a picture that could have been bland. It was a welcome addition to a good story.I cannot leave this review without mention of Professor Lupin himself, David Thewlis as Hawking's mentor, Dennis Sciama. It is always welcome to see Thewlis on the screen but I was distracted at the first moments of seeing him in his Professor's robes at an old London University.

The film brings up God's role in the universe a lot, effectively dramatizing the science- Hawking is into the big questions. But The Theory of Everything is mostly a personal story, his trying to cope with being a brilliant scientist losing all voluntary physical movement and speech. It's frustrating to see him trying to explain his theories, but gratifying when the Soviet scientist announces the little man has done it. It mainly follows his family life and the difficult situation he and his wife Jane are in, and essentially makes Jane out to be a saint.Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking, deserves real credit for being able to portray a character from a young, able-bodied (but still shaky) man, to a man struggling to speak, to wheelchair-bound and speechless. His triumph- or Hawking's- is inspirational.",

            "content": "The Theory of Everything is a biopic about Stephen Hawking(Eddie Redmayne) & the love story between him & his wife, Jane Hawking(Felicity Jones). Stephen Hawking is diagnosed with a life threatening disease. The film chronicles the relationship between Stephen & Jane Hawking over the years. It also shows us how Hawking made significant breakthroughs in science, despite his physical deterioration due to the disease. The Theory of Everything is an outstanding film. I loved the fact that Hawking never gave up in spite of all the difficulties he faced in his life. Jane's resolve to stay with Stephen despite his illness, moved me. The relationship between Stephen & Jane Hawking is one of the highlights of the film. Their relationship exudes positiveness, strength & undying love & dedication to each other. The main highlight of the movie are the performances. Eddie Redmayne has given the best performance of his career as Stephen Hawking. Redmayne completely embodies the character. The way Redmayne has portrayed Hawking's physical & speech deterioration is jaw-dropping & flawless. No wonder he's the front-runner to win the Oscar for Best Actor & won the Golden Globe for Best Actor. Redmayne truly deserves all the praise & awards that come his way. Felicity Jones is spectacular as Jane Hawking. Jones has also given her career's best performance. Harry Lloyd is great as Brian. David Thewlis is brilliant as Dennis Sciama. Charlie Cox is incredible as Jonathan Hellyer Jones. The supporting characters are impressive too. The music by Johann Johannsson is captivating. If I had to pick one flaw in the film, I'd say that the second half is a tad bit slow. Still, this movie deserves all the Academy Award nominations it has received. A must watch.",

            "content": "Normally sappy love stories aren't my cup of tea, but once you introduce one of the greatest and most profound scientists of the 20th century into the mix, then you've caught my attention. That plus the healthy dose of awards hype made The Theory of Everything a must see. That great and profound scientist I mentioned is none other than Stephen Hawking, and this film tells the story of his search for the beginning of time and the answers to the universe, chronicling how as his mind grew his body deteriorated due to Lou Gherig's disease or ALS. The film is actually based on the novel that Jane Hawking, Stephen Hawking's wife, wrote and it details her struggles in caring for such an incredible mind whose body had become hardly self- sufficient. It's a timeless love story that celebrates the triumphs of such a brilliant mind, and how Hawking learned to live with the disease, never letting it stop him from answering the questions he wanted answered. The Theory of Everything tells a powerful and captivating story, albeit the execution is a bit dull. Stephen Hawking's story is obviously an insurmountably important one, and one that deserves to be immortalized in film, thus this film is doing a great service to the artistic and scientific communities. The extent of his triumphs are captured very well in this film, while also capturing the very human story at the center of all the scientific jargon. And so, despite any shortcomings of this film, it is still a very important one, and one that absolutely needed to be made. My main issue with The Theory of Everything were its reservations. This film plays every conflict so close to the chest, never really capturing the struggle until the third act. Obviously the central conflict here is Hawking's battle with ALS and his trying to cope with the disease as it breaks down his body bit by bit. But this central conflict doesn't feel like much of a conflict because when one thing becomes an issue it seems to be resolved in the very next scene. It's a film that doesn't take any risks, and there is a severe lack of tension throughout, and it's honestly pretty boring for the majority of its two hour runtime. Not painfully boring, but dull. The film definitely does get better as it goes along, though, and by the end I was left satisfied and a little more well informed about one of the most important scientific minds who ever lived. It transitions from sappy love story to compelling human drama, even if it takes a while to get there. From start to finish, though, this is a beautiful film with gorgeous cinematography and stellar performances. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Hawking is shockingly accurate and the resemblance is uncanny. Felicity Jones gives it her all in her portrayal of Jane Hawking, and the two form an unbelievably adorable couple.Overall I think I just wanted more from The Theory of Everything. The film centers around a lot of things, and it never devotes quite enough time to any one aspect. Major parts of Hawking's scientific advancements are glossed over. The conflict between Hawking and his wife never really picks up either. It's constantly a factor driving the story but the film shy's away from delving too deep into the conflict, and there seemed to be a resolution just when I thought things were really about to get going. But between the beautiful shots, fantastic performances, and incredibly significant subject matter I would say that The Theory of Everything is a great little work of art about one of science's most inspiring figures.",

            "content": "BY RYAN C. SHOWERSEvery year there are one or two films that score major nominations throughout award season that are not particularly special, and they manage their accolade success by appealing to older voters and not taking many risks. Usually, films of that nature can be appreciated for style, performances, and consistency. \"The Theory of Everything\" is \"that\" film this year, but it's not as easy to appreciate as typical period piece Oscar films.\"The Theory of Everything\" is most notable for its beautiful cinematography. It pleases our eyes with strong, radiant colors such as blues, golds, greens, and browns. There is also a fine texture to the photography, as if a painter swiped gloss across the lens, which produces a beautiful, faded look. To put sound with the visual, the charming musical score composed for \"The Theory of Everything\" is an invaluable component in the film's areas of success. Without it, the film would fall flatter than it occasionally does. In addition, Director James Marsh envisions the project on a smaller scale, as if he was holding all the components in his hands when he filmed it. The directing makes the screenplay's lacking scope excusable. Marsh makes everything fit nicely as one commodity. On paper and at first glance, this looks like a role of a lifetime for Eddie Redmayne, and even though the writing does not allow this to be an overwhelming performance, Redmayne fades into Hawking's fight. Assertive in the beginning and subtly crushing in the later scenes, Redmayne uses his physicality and emotions to play the part as ably. Felicity Jones is his leading co-star, and she's splendid but, like Redmayne, nothing to note in the history books.Simple and harmless, the surface is the limit in \"The Theory of Everything\". It has a subject matter and a pretense of something emotionally draining and three-dimensional, but the opposite could not be more true of the film in front of you. The film fails to affect the slightest bit of emotion onto its audience, and the awkward part is the numerous moments where the film thinks it is being absorbing and engaging and it's not. The characters begin to weep, waiting for us to join in with them, and we end up just uncomfortably staring at the frame. Instead of grabbing our emotions, the misfortunes of the characters instead grab our distanced, unemotional sympathy.Though the directing should be looked at with blame for this, the script is even more responsible for the film's troubles in this area and for its general problems. The dialogue is unorganized, the ideas decides not to reach farther than what would be appropriate for junior high school audiences, and the screenplay tells this story in the most basic way possible. In fact, the best scenes in \"The Theory of Everything\" are the montages where we just watch the characters be instead of listening to poorly written dialogue. (The montages rely on the acting, musical score, and directing more than anything which is why they work so agreeably.)An unremarkable film with some fetching assets.Grade: B",

All it seemed to say was he got praise for one idea and then got praise for another idea that contradicted his first. Hardly portraying the work of a genius, which Stephen undoubtedly is.So OK it's supposed to be a love story then. What love story? I felt no real chemistry between the two leads at all.Then there is the chocolate box representation of middle England and the stereotypical characters in it, again all in soft blinking focus.As for Eddie Redmayne's performance it was OK but I did not find it at all engaging. It was a good physical impression of Stephen Hawking but where was the passion, where was the angst? Sadly missing for me.One final niggle, there is a scene towards the end where Stephen is supposed to be conversing with Jane and it is absolutely clear that there is no way he could be creating the text on his computer in the speed required to produce the conversation we see.I watched it with my wife on Valentine's day eve and she was equally unimpressed.

            "content": "\"The Theory of Everything\" is an apt title; James Marsh's film certainly encompasses much. It's both biopic and love story, you might say in equal measure. As a biopic it's much less sentimental than I had expected, given its subject, (Professor Stephen Hawking), and for most of the time, as a love story, it eschews sentimentality, too. Of course, the love story at the centre and which takes up a good deal of the film, is that between Hawking and his first wife Jane, on whose book the film is based. On a lesser level it's also a film about science and about an illness, Motor Neuron Disease. It tells us little about either but that's hardly a fault. It is a film about human beings and not about molecules and I have to confess I was surprised at just how good it was.I had expected something tantamount to a Masterpiece Theatre production and while it's certainly cosy at times and very British, it's also extremely intelligent, (Anthony McCarten's screenplay is first-rate), and it never dwells for longer than is necessary on any issue once its point has been made. Consequently, it never feels anything like two hours in a cinema. The director, James Marsh, has proved his pedigree in the past in the field of documentary (\"Man on Wire\", \"Project Nim\") but that earlier work doesn't really prepare you for something on this scale. The film feels epic and intimate at the same time.It's also superbly played. Redmayne, surely, has to be the one to beat when it comes to handing out prizes. His performance is not only a brilliant physical transformation but he somehow seems to get inside the mind of Hawking as well. I'm not saying it's easy to play someone who is severely physically handicapped but I think it must be harder to convince us when you're doing very little or nothing at all and it's in these quiet moments that Redmayne is at his best.As Jane, Felicity Jones, (she was Dickens' mistress in \"The Invisible Woman\"), is also superb. She gives Jane a much steelier edge than may have been expected. Jane sacrifices almost everything but is the first to pull the plug on the marriage. A host of outstanding character actors give us various parents, colleagues and carers without ever lapsing into caricature. Charlie Cox's almost too-good-to-be-true choir master is a case in point. The character may be the dashing white knight who comes to Jane's rescue but manages to give us a glimpse into the soul of the man. There's also a lovely supporting turn from David Thewlis as Stephen's professor at Cambridge. It's not totally perfect; one or two of the romantic moments tend towards the mawkish but these are fleeting. All in all, this is something a triumph and a rather unexpected one.",

The theory of everything is a romantic film and not a biographical and a scientific one which luckily works out in it's favour, there is less focus on the works of Dr. Hawking and more focus towards the relationship he shared with his wife Jane Wilde Hawking. The film does get predictable often but the films pulls through due to the earnest performance by the two leads and hits some satisfying emotional highs. Eddie Redmayne has never played a lead in any film but when he gets a chance in this, he hits a homerun, the amount of research and effort he has put into this role net him an Oscar nomination and who knows maybe even a win. Felicity Jones is incredible herself as Jane, she is the backbone for the Hawking family, she takes care of the house, the children, helps Stephen with his books and research. However this is the second time I have seen Felicity Jones aging on screen improperly, while every character ages normally Felicity Jones doesn't look that old compared to her co-stars, her make up isn't up to the mark and she always looks young, this was prevalent in another film of hers- The Invisible Woman. Lastly, if you take out the good acting out of the film you aren't left with much but it's still a decent watch because it provides some very strong emotional highs.",

That is a question even Stephen Hawking, one of the smartest men on the planet, couldn't answer. Every year the Academy states manipulative and boring message movies, conventional true stories and occasionally something that actually deserves to be nominated before us and claim they are the best films of the year. The Oscars are a joke. The latest evidence for that is The Theory of Everything. It's an awards bait movie so they lapped up its true story about a man who overcomes difficult circumstances. They can never resist that. Still, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones deserved the award nominations. Jones is the emotional backbone of the movie and has to carry a lot of it, while Redmayne's performance is not only emotionally involving, it's an incredible physical performance too. Still, the true story of Stephen Hawking and his wife leaves out 2 key things: Firstly Stephen Hawking is a scientist and this has barely any science. Secondly, they sugar-coat the romance which really wasn't the fairy tale it's depicted as.TTOE is well directed up to a point and has various emotional moments. You can't help but get caught up in it occasionally and it does move you, although how a film about a man with Motor Neurone Disease is rarely ever harrowing is a baffling mystery. It's well done technically, so what's letting it down is the writing. There's no narrative arc and there's no true inspirational message. Mainly what it's about are various clips from Hawking's life punctuated by montages. Basically, the cinematic equivalent of a family photo album. I thought this was about a scientist? It's too soft and it's too long. When a movie is nominated for so many awards I expect something that deserves them. I don't expect to have my head dunked in syrup but that's what I get. Still, I've seen Crash and various other weak Oscar films so maybe I should have known. A very average movie only lifted into the 6/10 category by its 2 leads. It's got its impressive moments but if it had won Best Picture it would have been the new Crash.6/10",

The movie takes an easy drama within these events, by simply just watching how Hawking can still move forward on his research and with his family, despite of his condition. Even with a terrific performance from its lead actor, the movie just walks from one time to another, hardly examining anything else complex within the story other than the basic summary on screen. It can still feel engaging, but it's impossible to think how else compelling this movie could have been.The story juggles with many issues; it is about Hawking's study of his theories, it is a love story that is slowly fading its romance and it is a sad drama of the scientist's fight of his illness. The film doesn't have an exact focus on its story, it keeps trading from one conflict to another, but doesn't necessarily lead to any remarkable buildup. Maybe at the parts where Hawking's body is falling apart, the movie becomes completely compelling, but at the other subplots: the scientific side is likely used to define his career, but it only hints a more interesting topic. The love story, which happens to be the most important part since it aims to be the core of the entirety, is mostly displayed for a typical drama that doesn't go beyond showcasing the tragedy and some important information of each time.The direction is at least decent, it settles with the characters nicely, and also picks some random style when it comes to the cinematography. It all looks stunningly bright, making it visually pretty. But there's nothing else memorable in the filmmaking other than that. The acting however is the best thing to merit, specifically Eddie Redmayne. People would be more focused on his portrayal of the physical struggle because that clearly is what makes it truly affecting and that is one tough thing to achieve in this role and he's done it terrifically while still capturing a personality. The rest of the acting are all pretty natural enough to keep things entertaining on screen.The Theory of Everything is alright, but it felt like there's something more to explore in this biopic. It does work at being an easy inspirational drama that pictures the unfortunate moments of his life, leading to an eventual triumph. It's often gripping, but it would have been even more if it digs deeper at the themes that are filled in outside the bitterness. It's pretty hard to argue that it's bad, it's competently crafted and wondrously acted, but it still leaves a lot of intriguing questions that are only partially answered around the bright images.",

We're also used to hearing him called the world's smartest man thanks to his work on gravitational singularity theorems. But you're probably less familiar with his life story.\"The Theory of Everything\" charts Hawking's life from his days as a student - where he met his first wife Jane - to his rise to international renown as a theoretical physicist. But a major part of this is Hawking's health as he succumbs to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, rendering him immobile. Through thick and thin, Jane did what she could to support him.Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones both perform their roles flawlessly. The movie makes clear that there has always been a human side to this hero of geeks and nerds. It's a great movie, and Redmayne deserved his Oscar win.I like to think that if Prof. Hawking debated a willfully ignorant person, Hawking would have to say only one sentence before the moron's head would fall off in confusion.",

I was disappointed.The story lacked direction and purpose. It had potential to be a great character piece like Raging Bull, but that was lost in the parts of the movie that focused on science and Stephen Hawking's ailment. It also failed to be a truly good scientific movie because it almost glazed over Hawking's work. I couldn't tell if the relationships, the discoveries, the fame, or the declining physical health were supposed to be the driving force of the movie. Now, I must admit the performances by the supporting cast were heartfelt and sympathetic yet not really like real people. Eddie Redmayne seemed intent on merely making Hawking seem nice and innocent and consequently one-dimensional. I was disappointed too in that his transformation into an Als patient was so revered. Yes, he looked like Stephen Hawking, but there was no depth behind it. No substance. No deeper motivation. All in all, Redmayne disappointed me.",

I wasn't expecting big bangs or anything, but some of the scenes felt like they were recapping what we as an audience could put together in our own heads.A warning also for those of you of a squeamish disposition, in some cases we do see what goes on in a operation and it could be quite upsetting for some.Overall though a good film that tracks what Jane Hawking had written in her earlier book.",

            "content": ". . . Stephen Hawking? String theory and quantum physics suggest this is possible. A look at the evidence in the current film release--THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING-- indicates this is likely the case. Since my next door neighbor was diagnosed with and relatively quickly died from Lou Gehrig's disease, Hawking's survival for 51 years and counting never ceases to amaze me. (My neighbor, before passing, once said that Hawking is somewhat controversial in the ALS community; it sounded as if they suspect him of have Gehrig's disease \"Lite,\" or something.) EVERYTHING is an amazing (if somewhat Soap Opera-Ish) movie in which actor Eddie Redmayne outdoes Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis' offering from MY LEFT FOOT. Is it just a coincidence that Poe wrote \"Eureka\" (1846) in an apparent attempt to explain everything? (Being one of the six living humans who has actually READ Eureka, I need to point out in Poe's defense that Hawking had the shoulders of more giants such as Einstein on which to stand than did the \"Raven\" author.) Furthermore, anyone who has read Poe's short story \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\" (1845) will see an almost perfect parallel to Hawking's personal situation as they watch EVERYTHING. In addition to anticipating Hawking's life's work and unique personal circumstances, Poe's recurring fear in nearly half his tales was of a living death (or of being entombed alive--most famously in \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" 1839). Is it too much to say that Stephen Hawking is Poe's worst nightmare come true?",

And while, when our present becomes history, he won't be counted among Newton, Einstein or likes of them, he is still a living symbol, one of the greatest contemporary minds. Speaking of it, do you know exactly what his greatest scientific discoveries are? A movie will try to give you an even sloppier explanation then what Interstellar did of something else. Ultimately, it is not important, as he himself disproved his greatest discovery. His true lifetime achievement lies instead in popularization of science. Making the unimaginable (borderline) understandable. And that is where he will live forever as an inspiration beside people like Feynman, Samuelson or Sagan.Sadly, movie tackles none of this. Even worse, it works against his lifetime work. As a movie that explores Hawking's personal life instead of professional, it just serves as deterrent to current generation of potential geniuses. Stephen's and Jane's relationship is highly improbable today. But script does not promote any encouragement to offset this, other than misplaced \"No difficult how life may seem...\" quote. Instead, we are served with scene after scene of increasing disfigurement and disability without a point. I understand that this is historical fact, but Hawking himself repeats time after time how much joy he had in life. Very little of this joy is transferred into the movie, primarily due to really bad character writing.Movie is a budget production, more suitable for TV then for cinema. Eddie Redmayne is convincing as Hawking, although pretty one-dimensional. Unfortunately, horrible makeup work makes him much younger than required in second part of the movie. Felicity Jones works well as Jane Hawking, but again has such a shallow text that Kirsten Stewart could have played the role better, as a master of blank stares and open mouths.Funny how Hawking himself did not appear in the movie. He certainly does cameos for The Big Bang Theory, so why not here? 3/10",

Throughout the first twenty minutes I was really disappointed. Even Eddie Redmayne, who I will rave about later, was kind of bad in the start. Everything seems so offbeat, clich\u00e9d, cheesy, it really seems as it is setting itself up for failure from second one, where it starts with possibly the most clich\u00e9d and frustratingly predictable scene it could have possibly started with. It seems to be directed by a computer: \"shot here, close up here, establishing here transitional here a now to cut\" was what I heard the screen screaming to me at the start. Plus it had many laughable filmaking and storytelling techniques, which, although got less and less frequent, carried throughout the whole film. It had a number of interactions which were supposedly there to elevate the drama, but ended up making me kind of embarrassed. Moreover...man what was going on with this cinematography? It is the most uneven I have seen in my life! The shot composition isn't in anyway off, but that lighting and that color palette changed every other scene, it was so off putting!Fortunately of all those negatives the movie only carries on only the last two, after the first act. Once it gets deep into its emotional and thematic core it becomes fascinating and sometimes very hard to watch. To say Eddie Redmayne is cast perfectly would be an understatement, he carries out the gargantuan task of portraying the great Hawking, in the best way possible and succeeds in a performance that deserves all and more of the attention he got, this actor can do no wrong at this point. Equally brilliant, but unfortunately much less talked about, it Felicity Jones, who isn't definitely in as a shiny of a role, but she surely is as amazingly great as her co-lead. With subtlety she holds up the emotional core of the movie that could have really collapsed had their not been a performance of such brilliance at the center of it. Moreover I have to give recognition to a great score that elevated even more the sentiment the movie had. On the other hand, I am kind of torn on the screenplay of the film. On on side it explores some very human themes that touched me deeply and gives a brilliant portrayal of this stunning story, but on the other it gives a very, very simplistic cut to the whole scientific aspect that I would have enjoyed a lot to see, had it been there.To sum it up, \"The Theory of Everything\" is an engrossing an emotional resonant real life drama that I would recommend to see, it's only unfortunate that it could have been much more.",

How has Hawking been able to live so long despite a two year prognosis given in 1963?

The Theory of Everything tells the tragic, yet inspiring, story of Hawking from his youthful Cambridge years to the miserable deterioration of his body through the following decades by ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). A brilliant mind, this man has birthed a totally new path for quantum theory/mechanics that is so crucial to our understanding of the universe\u2014his ceaseless search for the answers or just that single convenient explanation of what this largely enigmatic world truly is and how it came to be. Are the answers simply derived from our perceptions of time and space? There's no denying that Hawking is an ingenious and fairly eccentric individual, but does his life exactly warrant another Oscar bait of a biopic? Or rather, does it translate well?Well, without even any attempt at establishing an authentic and aesthetically distinct atmosphere, The Theory of Everything rushes us right into the romance as soon as it commences. Main character attends a crowded party with his more enthusiastic friend. He sights a beautiful girl. Girl, out of miraculous coincidence, notices him with a fancy as well and learns his name. Boom, they meet there and then. Storytelling can't get any lazier and more formulaic than that. Moreover, that concisely introduces us to the tone and style the rest of the film will assume. The screenplay is simplistically boiled down to please crowds with every inspirational platitude and heartwarming comment. As a deliberate tearjerker through and through, it will oftentimes slip in a brief humorous exchange of dialogue to calm the weepers down. Fundamentally, the script is highly predictable in its structure and manner\u2014something you would expect a traditional mindset to adore, which includes the Academy. Bless its heart, the film is so na\u00efve and overly optimistic that its complementary visual appearance/cinematography turns out so bright and unremarkable that might suit it more for a BBC show. This is exactly the result I expected from another entry in the period piece/biographic genre that follows an extraordinary human being but tries too hard to make him sympathetic and relatable to audiences. We witness a very saintly portrait of Stephen Hawking\u2014never losing temper or making moral mistakes. Even when touching on the more controversial aspects of Hawking's beliefs like his attitude towards religion and the \"Creator,\" the picture executes this all in a way that appeases everyone once again and sweeps any atheistic ideas under the rug quickly, surely believing that such material might prove to be too condescending or alienating for its viewers. On the other hand, the majestically melodic score by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson remains one of the film's greatest elements, but the sheer exhibition of acting talent here is definitely what takes the spotlight. Of course, there's the showy, but very effective, performance from Eddie Redmayne, which is juxtaposed with a much more subtle and nuanced performance from Felicity Jones who wears the mien of utter exhaustion and deep concern with her throughout a depressing, albeit very admirable and encouraging, life that's spent nurturing her \"companion.\" It's these two wonderful performances that provoke wild emotion from moviegoers and essentially take the movie beyond the level of generic fodder that it occasionally comes frighteningly close to. At the end of the day, if you're one to allow sentimentality to take over and thus excuse a transparent lack of inspired, brave artistry, then The Theory of Everything might very well win you over. Otherwise, this is the kind of film that might possibly be included in numerous discussions during awards season and then placed into the group of forgettable made-for-Oscars biopics a year later.",

A pretty nice job of juxtaposing Hawking's scientific breakthroughs with his own (and everyone else's) human relations is its strongest suit. Eddie Redmayne's performance as this difficult-to-portray character is outstanding: He captures the disabled Hawking's perceptions and point of view very well. The film is slow but evenly paced, with a quiet humor throughout. Yet, the transitions are jerky and abrupt in many places, and we don't really see Jane's reasons for attraction to him, nor how, when, and why the marriage fails. Like many other things here, it all happens suddenly and randomly for no apparent reason. This may have been at least partly deliberate, as universal happenstance is another theme here, but still. . . The time-frames toward the end are also a little unclear, and there is little age-progression in most of the major characters. As others have noted, there is relatively little about Hawking's science in this film, and what there is is pretty basic. \"The Theory of Everything\" is not meant, of course, as a detailed expos\u00e9 of singularity theory; however, just a bit more in this area would help to illustrate some of the more personal themes here. Most of the dialogue is also pretty ordinary: \"The Theory of Everything\" keeps trying to reach for a depth that it never quite achieves. In a number of places, it stops just as things start to get interesting. It seems that the directors of this film were faced with a common dilemma faced when all the central characters are still with us and likely to be among the first viewers: They were making a film centered mostly on the Hawkings' personal life but were compelled to avoid getting TOO personal.Anyway, the theater concession stand attendant told me that she loves everything about this film, as many other people obviously do, so my reasons for being disappointed by certain parts of it are clearly not shared by everyone out there.",

Hawking and partner Brian are racing bicycles on the street. The two came to a secret tavern at the end of the cycling race and pushed open the wooden door, which was filled with young people who were listening to songs. Here, Hawking met his later wife Jane for the first time.The two exchanged physics on the stairs.-\"What does the cosmologist believe in\"-\"What do you believe in?\" Uses a unified equation to explain everything in the universe.-\"is it\"-\"Yes\"-\"What equation\"\"The problem is here\" This question is very good, I don't know yet, but I want to study it \"They exchange contact information, meet in the game hall, and participate in dance parties as each other's partners.

Religion believes in miracles, but miracles and science often cannot coexist. And Jane is a devout believer, and God is one of her spiritual pillars. Such a contradiction of faith has also become one of the fuse of their end of marriage.At Cambridge University, Hawking was recognized and admired by his mentors and classmates with his extraordinary ability.Unfortunately, after a coma, Hawking was diagnosed with a rare amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and was told by the doctor that there were only two years of life left. However, Jane did not leave him. .In a conversation with Hawking's father, Jane faced Hawking's father's rational advice and said, \"I don't think I'm very strong, but I love him and we must fight together.\"The couple's married life is beautiful but full of challenges. As the three children grew older, Jane's life pressure also increased, she had to take care of the whole family alone, while studying for a doctorate.In the choir of St. Mark's Church, she meets Jonathan Jones, a kind and passionate man. Gradually, Jones and Hawking's family moved closer and closer, and in close contact, Jane and Jones developed a romantic friendship. Hawking was keenly aware, but reluctantly accepted the reality because he felt that his wife and the family needed help. And Jane and Jones strive to maintain friendship in order not to let broken families continue to be broken.After the pneumonia was cured, Hawking lost his ability to speak, and the heavy pressure of life forced Jane to come to the nanny Elaine. The arrival of Elaine became a special part of Hawking 's monotonous life. He showed humor in front of Elaine and never before Jane after getting sick. They wrote books together and read the magazine \"Loft\" together. Elaine helped him Cook everything. Hawking showed a childlike smile in front of her.This became the fuse of Hawking and Jane's marriage.\"I have loved you.

Jane was invited as an honorary partner of Hawking to accept the Queen's reception.\"Your glasses are always so dirty\"At the May Ball many years ago, Hawking and Jane, who did not dance, discussed physics, poetry, and religion.\"Do you want to be religious\"\"I don't believe in this kind of god who controls everything\"\"Why study medieval Spanish poetry?\"\"Probably because ...

He's played here to perfection by Eddie Redmayne (who I'm convinced spent a lot of time with the real-life Professor Hawking and copied his mannerisms almost exactly), while Jane is played by Felicity Jones, and it is just as much her story as it is his; her attempts to understand and love him are almost vicarious for the experience of the audience. \"The Theory of Everything\" of course also includes his crippling diagnosis of motor neuron disease (ALS), which left him with a life expectancy of just two years - but he's obviously still here more than half a century after receiving that life-changing diagnosis.\"The Theory of Everything\" is a beautiful, marvelous film - so much better than the usual Hollywood stuff, even though this film is very much so-called \"Oscar bait.\" But damn it, I loved it.

            "content": "For a movie that claims to be about the life of world renowned, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, The Theory of Everything has remarkably little to do with the life of a world renowned, theoretical physicist. Through and through, the movie is a love story; and it is beautifully told. It's not necessarily a movie for fans of Stephen Hawking or his work, considering the subject is hardly ever touched upon except in moments of praise for his brilliance, but is instead geared towards anyone who is interested in a good romance between two lovable people.It begins with a chance meeting between the young and brilliant, lovable but clumsy, Ph.D. student and his soon to be wife, the literature-loving Jane Wilde (The movie is actually based on her book: Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen). For some inexplicable reason \u2013 I suppose you could call it \"love at first sight\" but it seems more like \"convenient for the plot\" \u2013 these two take an instant liking to each other. After 3 or 4 brief encounters the two students fall deeply in love, but their happiness is quickly sucker-punched by Stephen's diagnosis of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), a disease that eats away at his motor controlling neurons, causing paralysis and, as the doctor predicts, death within two years. It's a very sad realization for both the audience and the characters, but when Jane promises her life-long love and commitment to Stephen, there is a sense that everything is going to be okay. The rest of the film takes us through several decades of their life and how Stephen and Jane cope with his physical limitations.Eddie Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking brilliantly; delivering a performance that is, at times, so very delicate and at other times fueled with confidence. The wit characteristic of Hawking is presented perfectly and his disease, including the gradual loss of his ability to speak, is handled with respect. Not once is there a moment of overacting, and we are reminded that there is a fully functioning and genius mind within a debilitated body. Felicity Jones plays Jane Wilde beautifully, showing us the strong commitment and inevitable weariness faced by someone in her position. Ultimately, it is Redmayne that steals the show.The most glaring issue the movie faces is time. It's understandable and perhaps even a little ironic given the subject matter of the movie. To faithfully and honestly tell the story of their long marriage is a gargantuan task, and we often find ourselves skipping through massive periods of time without warning. Stephen is almost fully paralyzed about half an hour into the movie and the two characters are well into a marriage with their first child. There is little time to believe that they are actually falling in love until we are thrown headlong into their lives.Still, the story is as honest as it can be. Jane and Stephen are two caring, loving, and normal people who have to deal with impossibly difficult circumstances. After the initial bullet-train ride through their first years, I spent the rest of the movie actually caring about their relationship. Unfortunately, there is no sense of urgency or some larger than life goal, only their onwards struggle and perseverance. It provides the movie with a direction-less quality. As we watch his body degenerate, his drive is an intellectual one and we are promised that he is working diligently on his unified theory of everything behind the scenes of the movie.In fact, aside from his disease, Stephen's life seems relatively unremarkable. They have children, a family, friends, and Stephen pursues his career brilliantly, although little time is spent explaining it. Stephen learns to deal with his disease as best he can and is able to succeed with the help of everyone who cares for him. On the other hand, Jane seems to be the one who suffers the most. We learn of her goal to earn a Ph.D. in literature early on in the movie, but she quickly forfeits her own wants to support her husband. She is a strong and admirable woman, but there is a sense of unfairness as she is forced to completely remove her own goals from the picture and instead take on the full time task of caring for a family that can't care for itself. By the end of the movie, I realized (if we're to believe the story) the famous Stephen Hawking may not have made it where he is today if not for the unyielding love, optimism and attention he received from Jane.Not surprisingly, their relationship begins to crumble when we see Jane attempting to pursue her own desires. Soon enough, after years of happiness, the gravity of it begins to weigh down on her shoulders. There are even hints of some mutually agreed upon acts of infidelity, although it is handled with grace rather than betrayal. The two seem to grow apart for reasons beyond their control and neither blames the other for their inability to continue the uphill battle, despite the years of love between them. There is a gentle understanding there; rather than greed and guilt, there is a shared sadness when they realize perhaps it was just too difficult after all. It's very nice to know that Hawking himself contributed to the movie and even cried when he watched it. It's a hopeful love story, even if it ends bittersweet.I watched The Theory of Everything with a free screening pass given to me by a friend. I noticed Intersteller was playing at the same time and was so tempted to go watch that instead, but I resisted. While I certainly don't regret my choice and left with a feeling of gratification, I also didn't leave with any significant thoughts of the movie on my mind. The Theory of Everything is a nice movie to watch, but it's unfortunately forgettable.",

The preparation he must have done for this part has to have been gruesome - the changes in his facial features, the things the disease did to his body - so well portrayed. I forgot he was an actor - he is Hawking. The story is important for many reasons. The focus on the disease and its progression, the affects of it on their marriage, and the genius of his mind was not affected. Felicity Jones is just as good as his wife - never knowing the course the marriage would have to go through - she was devoted to him through it all - even though she was loosing the sense of herself. In reality, you wonder how she was able to raise three kids and take care of Stephan and always be there for him. Her performance is worthy of awards too.The movie is well casted, well written and I hope there are many awards coming its way.",

            "content": "You don't have to be into Physics or Science in generall to understand this movie. Although it's about Stephen Hawking, it has very little science in it and even with all that science in it, this movie is not about science.It's about the relationship between Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde, who met in the 60s, fell in love, married, got some kids and had their couple issues during their difficult marriage.Based on the biographical book by Jane Hawking/Wilde.The movie is a biography, a romance and a drama/tragedy. It's not a feel good movie, because you get to see, how Stephen Hawking loses more and more control of his body, struggling with his desease, and his wife Jane loses more and more herself as woman, wife and love of Stephen Hawking.If you're not into that kind of movie, there is one reason why this movie is a must-see: Eddie Redmayne.Eddie Redmayne is spectacular, brilliant and one of the best actors of his generation. His acting is beyond perfection (in cooperation with the excellent make-up, costumes, camera, editing and direction, that all together gave life to Redmaynes physical performance of Stephen Hawking).In contrast, what Redmayne had to do like overacting the physical degradation of Stephen Hawking, Felicity Jones as Jane Hawking is great, her acting is very sublte, more with her eyes and mimic. She plays a very loving woman, left alone with herself, the kids and with Stephen Hawking. Excellent role for Felicity Jones.There are 2-3 scenes, that gave me goosebumps, one being where Jane broke up with Stephen. I felt the sadness, the pain in both actors, but Eddie nailed it and hit me with his performance right in my heart and guts. Brilliant.Eddie Redmayne deserved the Oscar as main actor for his performance.Recommended.",

            "content": "As soon as I heard that there was going to be a film about Stephen Hawking I was excited, when it was released I heard positive comments and reviews, and of course awards season was looming so I predicted good things, so of course I watched it, from BAFTA nominated director James Marsh (Man on Wire). Basically, set in 1963, Stephen Hawking (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Eddie Redmayne) is an astrophysics student at Cambridge University, he meets literature student Jane Wilde (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Felicity Jones), both are working for their PhDs. Stephen excels at mathematics and physics, but his friends and Professor Dennis Sciama (David Thewlis) are concerned he has no topic for his thesis, Stephen is concentrating on his relationship with Jane, they attend a ball together and eventually share their first kiss. In a lecture about black holes Stephen speculates that they may have been a part of the creation of the universe, he also first notices he is not able to walk very quickly, while pursuing his research Stephen's muscles begin to give out while walking and he suddenly collapses. In Cambridge Hospital, the Senior Doctor (Adam Godley) tells Stephen that he motor neuron disease, a disorder affecting the cells that control voluntary muscle activity including speaking, walking, swallowing, and general bodily movement, although his brain will remain unchanged his muscles will soon be uncontrollable, he is told he has approximately two years to live. Stephen becomes reclusive towards roommate Brian (Harry Lloyd) and everyone, Jane tells Stephen she love him, he eventually cheers up and tells his professor his thesis paper will be about time, when asked \"what about time?\", Stephen simply replies \"time\". Stephen and Jane marry and have a son, but his ability to talk becomes worse due to the motor neuron disease, he finally presents his thesis that a black hole was responsible for the creation of the universe, the examination board tell him his theory is revolutionary, he is awarded his doctorate. Unable to walk Stephen relies on a wheelchair, he and Jane have a second child, a daughter, and he astounds professors in a lecture with a theory about the visibility of black holes, Stephen begins to become a world-renowned physicist, and an electric wheelchair allows him to move around and play with the children, however Jane is becoming frustrated, looking after the children, and caring for Stephen and his increasing fame. Jane tells Stephen of her depression, her mother Beryl (Emily Watson) suggests she join a church choir, there she meets handsome conductor Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Stardust's Charlie Cox), they become close friends and she employs him as a piano teacher for her son, Jonathan becomes friends with Stephen and to the whole family, helping however he can. Jane becomes pregnant and has a third child, Stephen's parents because of Jonathan question if the baby is his, she is appalled by this question, but alone they admit their feelings for each other, Jonathan does leave, but Stephen convinces him to stay. Becoming more famous, Stephen attends a concert in Bordeaux, while Jane and Jonathan go camping with the children, however Stephen contracts pneumonia, doctors tell Jane the only way to save him is to perform a tracheotomy, which will render Stephen speechless, she tells them to operate anyway, after this Stephen becomes depressed, as does Jane. Stephen starts to communicate with a spelling board with hired nurse Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake), the two get on well, then Stephen gets a computer with a voice synthesizer built in, it responds to his clicks, he is able to use it to speak at an almost normal pace again, and he uses it to write a book, A Brief History of Time, which becomes an international best-seller. One day however he tells Jane he is going to America to accept an award, taking Elaine with him, this triggers the end of their marriage, Stephen and Elaine fall in love, Jane reunites with Jonathan, in America at his lecture Stephen at one point imagines being able to stand up, almost crying at the reminder of his disease, but he presses on and gives a inspiring speech to get a standing ovation. Jane living with Jonathan gets a letter from Stephen to come with him to meet the Queen, after the two talk happily in the courtyard and look at their children, Stephen saying \"look what we made\", the closing text tells that Jane married Jonathan, but she and Stephen remain close friends to this day. Also starring Simon McBurney as Frank Hawking, Abigail Cruttenden as Isobel Hawking, Guy Oliver-Watts as George Wilde, Charlotte Hope as Philippa Hawking, Lucy Chappell as Mary Hawking and Me and Orson Welles' Christian McKay as Roger Penrose. Redmayne is absolutely brilliant playing the man afflicted by a terrible disease, but never letting it hold him back from his achievements, or love, and Jones gives a terrific sensitive performance as the woman who does her best to stay with him through all the trauma, this really does convince you of the realities of what a life changing disease can do to a relationship and a single life, I agree the odd moment of the symptoms make it lose a little momentum, but you cannot argue that it is a fantastic portrayal of the true story of a genius of our time, a splendid biographical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and Best Music, Original Score for J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, it won the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Original Music, Best Editing, Best Costume Design, and Best Make Up & Hair, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

The 20 years in the interim aren't included at all with the exception of two sentences on screen after the film ends.What disappointed me most was that the works of Stephen Hawking are not touched on in any way except that words \"Time\", \"Hawking Radiation\", and \"Black Hole\" are mentioned. But that's pretty much it. No context - nothing. This could have been a movie to inspire people to go into science or achieve great things.

This is one of the most Disappointing Films of Recent Years. The Movie of the Week Story, is so Familiar because it has been Done so Many Times it's a Staple of the Inspirational, Highly Emotional, and Touching Stories of a Handicapped Person that Overcomes all the Odds and Survives and Flourishes Despite Overwhelming Obstacles.But the Twist here is that this Person is a Genius and one of the Best Minds of Our Time. But His Particular Gift is in Physics and Cosmology and We get very Little Exploration of the Brilliance that made Hawking the Talk of the Scientific Community. It's like a Tarzan Movie that Focuses on Jane and tells of Her Trials of being In Love with an Anomaly. OK, but it Ignores the Elephant in the Room.So Ignoring the Elephant, the Film is a somewhat Interesting Love Story, but the Movie Decides it is the Only Story to be Told about this Brilliant Man and the Wife that Stood by His Wheelchair Until She Didn't. The Movie is a Deceit and Never Tries to get into Stephen's Head, and that's where the Gold is. So We don't Discover much about His Treasured Intellect or His Work and its Effect on His Peers and Scientific Community in General, or Why He is so Revered as an Innovator of Thought. His Breakthroughs are so Glossed Over that the Filmmakers must have Thought it was Beyond the Comprehension of Us Average Humans. How are We Seekers going to Learn about Complex Things if They are Withheld like some sort of Sacred Fruit Fit Only for the Gods. The Audience is Given a Glimpse of the Apple but are Never Allowed Close Enough to Take a Bite.Overall, it s basically a Bio-Pic-Chick-Flick and a Family Friendly Foray that is a Weeper, Withdrawn, and Frustrating the way it Hints at One Thing and Shows Us Another.

Perhaps, just a tad TOO high... Don't get me wrong. EVERYTHING is both an exquisitely well-made film and a rather delicious, interesting and quite entertaining experience! Here, in my Review...I will make my very best effort to explain exactly why my aforementioned expectations are so important in the case of EVERYTHING!And from its beginning moments...EVERYTHING jump starts itself by introducing us to a rather soft-spoken, nerdy (what else?) young Physics doctoral candidate: One--Stephen Hawking!Within minutes, we are inserted into the stop-motion bloom of Stephen and Jane's surprisingly intense and, yes, sweet relationship. In its early minutes, we also get some foreshadowing of Stephen's ominous deteriorating health, which, obviously, in and of itself, will not prove to be the least bit surprising to anyone watching the film. EVERYTHING is clearly Stephen Hawking from his first wife Jane's perspective. Considering that the movie is based on her book, could it have been anything else?As a logical result, what we get here is a focus on Stephen Hawking the man and the husband; his private persona, much more than his public and professional one!Will this emphasis on his relationship with Jane and his prolonged struggle with ALS and its debilitating effects, leave some people feeling somewhat shortchanged? Undoubtedly, there will be some.However...EVERYTHING isn't completely devoid of moments that underscore Hawking's scientific mindset and insight, I think that most people, as the end credits begin, will be convinced that there were just not enough of these moments to meet their expextations, ...particularly in light of exactly who HAWKINGS was and exactly what he did to achieve his well-deserved fame! I prefer not to go into any more detail, because we wouldn't want any Cinema S-words.....now would we?An interesting personal anecdote in relation to Mr. Hawking: For many years, I naturally assumed that he was an American..... Why? Well, as I'm sure perhaps millions of you have noticed, when he speaks, using what has come to be considered his trademark computerized voice, he clearly speaks with an American accent! To my chagrin, only just a few years back, did I discover that it was simply a case of AMERICAN technology determining to use its own AMERICAN voice!!!EVERYTHING's only real shortcoming? Quite honestly, the movie seems to do a lot of \"Reelin In the Years!\" during its last three-quarters of an hour, or so. To clarify that a bit, the movie constantly skips forward a few years at a time, briefly shows us a new son or daughter, for example, in a couple scenes, then jumps forward a couple years and repeats this process! Perhaps the sheer volume of detailed events in Hawking's life would have been better served by presenting them in a four or six hour mini-series? Just a parting opinion, of course!....ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa\u00f1ol, are most welcome!",

I'm sure any way you spin it, you would've come out with a film that feels like formula all the way through, but I do think that the script could've been better in actually giving the arcs more emotional power. As it is, it sort of just goes through the motions, while still highlighting its sentimentality in a really obvious and sometimes overbearing way (and some of this is also due to the direction). And yet despite that, it's such an easy film to like. I enjoyed it, and I think the two leads definitely give it its effectiveness. As good as I thought Redmayne was, he wasn't particularly surprising. If you've seen the trailer or any clip, you sort of get the idea. There's just no other way a role like this could be played, technically. The thing is, Redmayne does everything he needs to and yet I wasn't particularly affected by him on an emotional level. Despite how showy the role looks on the surface, he's just sort of there. Felicity Jones is who I really loved. Without any hint of artificiality or trying to chew up the scenery, she's just so effective and has such a warm presence. It's with her that I felt the heart and soul of the film, not Redmayne, and I think she should totally be in line for an Oscar nomination. Definitely the best thing about the film",

Now initially upon hearing this you may think that it is going to be a much more serious film strictly documenting the key events in life of Stephen Hawking. Now although it does include these events, the film has a large focus on the relationship between himself and Jane and therefore does play out as more of a romantic film like a love story. This is what made the film a lot more engaging and interesting as it really captures the joy in Stephen's life at a time that many people would think was full of pain. The performance of Eddie Redmayne is one of the best of 2014 if not the best as he captures the looks, personality and attributes of Stephen Hawking which has to be one of the toughest roles to portray. He does all this so well that he stands out above the rest and really puts him in the race for Best Actor. The film at times did feel like it was getting a little predictable but that is kind of expected when dealing with a story that is very real and people may be somewhat familiar with. In summary this film was not the greatest film of the year and is certainly not for everyone, but if you enjoy romantic dramas or want to learn more about the life of Stephen Hawking; this may be a film you will enjoy - 7.9",

            "content": "Here are my reasons, in summary: 1) The film goes way too fast, we jump from one scene to another and the events develop very quickly, not giving us time to assimilate what happened. Examples: Stephen's and Jane's Romance, Stephen's theories about time, children that appear out of nowhere and finally Stephen and Jane's separation. 2)You're never sure what this film is really about. Is it about love? About the universe? About life in general? It's probably about all that together, but there is no balance with these topics for sure. 3)The last scene, where Hawking answers questions from the audience, seems way too forced. I believe the filmmakers wanted this too become a memorable scene, but it doesn't really feel that way. There is no sense of a climax here, since SH only gets asked comfortable questions, so there is no conflict. He is already world famous and very successful, I get that, but that just makes the audience not care too much about him, since he has nothing to lose. 4) It's never explained how SH managed to live more than the expected two years. I'm sure there is an explanation for that, but it is never given in the film. 5) Finally, I have the feeling this movie never really takes off. It just seems to be at the same emotional level during the two hours, which makes it rather flat. This is very connected with #1, I felt like the entire film was a giant trailer for a bigger film. Dunno how to explain it better. Those are my general impressions of the movie, maybe you agree with me, maybe not. I agree that Redmayne's acting was great, but I wouldn't give this movie more than 5 points out of then. Definitely not compare it to \"A Beautiful Mind\"",

This movie, however, in a word, is sloppy.First, the compliments: all stars go to the actors. Eddie Redmayne, the male lead, spent a lot of time with the actual Hawking, and it shows in his dedication to capture the difficulties of living with the debilitating disease. Felicity Jones brings a nice mix of unconditional love and strength as the wife. David Thewlis feels right at home playing the advising professor. Charlie Cox is okay as the \"nice guy\" family friend, with just the right amount of shyness/reservation. Maxine Peake does well as the motivating nurse.*some spoilers ahead*The problems come with some of the scene choices and the way they are presented. For instance, there's an incredibly loud party and you can barely hear young Hawking conversing with Jane. He has a chess set in his room, yet he's never seen playing with his roommate or so, for the chess set's sole purpose was evidently to be smashed into a wall during a fit of rage. He gives a lecture for the first time after defending his dissertation, but his words are completely inaudible. The director thinks this is all fine and continues to bring subtitle-free speech until many minutes later when the machine arrives. During one of the earlier dinners, Hawking has difficulty bringing food to his mouth, so he slinks away and rests on the stairs (?). Then suddenly the director decides to show us random video of the inside of the human body, possibly the digestive tract, but it's absolutely unclear what is going on. Is he hungry? Did he wet himself? Has the disease progressed to another stage? Towards the end, it could perhaps be inferred that he and Jane divorced, yet 'divorce' or 'separate' is never mentioned aloud. It is unclear whether he was intent upon being with the nurse romantically, and whether she reciprocated those feelings.Yes, there are some good moments, but overall I got an impression of sloppiness. Scenes, editing, word choice, and unclear intentions are only some of the problems I see here. As I said before, Stephen Hawking led a remarkable life, yet let us remember that we are here to rate the movie. 5/10.icy'",

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning At Cambridge University in 1963, young physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is on the road to greatness, and despite his social awkwardness, has even managed to attract the attention of Jane (Felicity Jones), a young female student. Then he is suddenly stricken down with Motor Neurone Disease, leaving him a paralyzed, invalid wreck. The doctors tell him he only has a few years to live, but he and Jane fight the odds and defeat them head on, with Stephen living a full and brilliant life, and becoming one of the most celebrated physicists of all time.Here I am, a year after it came out, finally reviewing the film that may well serve as Redmayne's Taxi Driver, while he's kicked off this year with another film released on New Year's Day, where he's played a trans-gendering artist. A biopic of well known professor Stephen Hawking was a very interesting idea for a film dramatization, given the place he's managed to secure in popular culture over the years for someone from such an unshow-business background (I honestly thought he was genuinely American, given his voice box.) Yet somehow, despite some impressive acting and sweeping production values, The Theory of Everything fails to really sweep you up in the account of Hawking's life. Something...is just missing from the script, some kind of oompth or gravitas that gives the drama the real motivating kick that it needs to be really amazing. Somehow, you're just not as embroiled in the trials and tribulations of his life as you could have been. It's one of those films where everything is aesthetically fine, but no real magic spins off.Still, Redmayne deserves his recognition, and it could have been a far worse attempt to document this most unique and amazing of men. ***",

            "content": "Every year I end up watching one or two \"critical darlings\" that I likely wouldn't normally watch because of Awards season. I am trying to get ahead of the curve and see as many potential Oscar nominees before the nominations take place and since The Golden Globes were announced today, I decided to check this film out. I had fairly meager expectations given that I anticipated this to be a bit of a bore honestly. I was completely wrong. The film is emotionally charged, beautifully shot, fantastically acted and just a really amazing story about a man that everyone knows the name but how many of us know about him? As another reviewer pointed out, they made this film without hardly touching on the Science that Hawking is most known for but that serves to make this film easily enjoyable by just about anyone. This film is about Hawking's personal life, his relationship with his first wife and his heart wrenching physical deterioration with Lou Gehrig's Disease. In some ways its a simplistic film focusing on those certain details while likely avoiding others but it definitely gets the point across and ends up sitting with you long after the credits roll making this an impressive and very good film.The last time I saw Eddie Redmayne it was in the magnificent Les Miserables. However, I found him less than magnificent in that film. Honestly, I found him incredibly irritating so I wasn't looking forward to seeing him in this. Well I eat my words. Redmayne is magnificent. He is certain to get an Oscar nomination because he completely loses himself in this part and easily gives the best performance I have seen this year. It brought tears to my eyes more than once and you just ache for this man. He makes Hawking come to life on screen. Fellow Golden Globe Nominee Felicity Jones is high on my list of favorites. Yes, its true that much to my wife's chagrin I have an enormous crush on her and have ever since Chalet Girl. In the first part of the movie I was a little surprised she had gotten her nomination. It wasn't that she wasn't good in her role as Hawking's beloved first wife but she was just okay and really had to step up to match Redmayne's performance. However, when Hawking deteriorates physically Jones finds her footing and gives an excellent performance in the latter half. I'd still say it wasn't anywhere near Redmayne's but she is very good and their chemistry is excellent. David Thewlis is also very good in a supporting role as Hawking's mentor and friend. I must admit though I was a little surprised that the rest of the supporting cast is just okay and no one particularly stands out at all. In fact, a couple of the more significant characters feel clumsy and almost in the way of the overall story.Surprisingly so, James Marsh has had a lot of experience with documentaries and that rarely translates well into strong direction of a motion picture but he does this extremely well. Perhaps his experience in factual films helps make this feel so real. The true brilliance of The Theory of Everything is that you feel like you are right there with Jane and Stephen Hawking. You are experiencing their life. This is a first rate biography and as the story goes even Hawking himself was moved to tears watching this. The tone of the film is so sad and heart wrenching and yet you're inspired to watch on because Redmayne makes you believe and understand Hawking's brilliance to the world even if you know nothing about his theories and work. The film slowly changes direction and you begin to see things more from Jane's perspective (this being based on her book) and you get a different understanding of Hawking seeing him from her side of things. This isn't a film that everyone will enjoy but for a beautiful drama with a great story and a magnificent lead performance you can't go wrong. I look forward to seeing this film at the Oscars and see what else is out there that can rival it. 8.5/10",

At the moment when the clich\u00e9 of the young scientist with comprehensive bizarre but brilliant intellect was broken by explaining the personality of the protagonist (like who he was in fact), the film makes sense, albeit seriously reminds us of a previous title on the same topic.It is important to note the film because of the history it represents. Because of the strength of the protagonist to live with the hope that it will deal with every obstacle which he will face. Because of the love that is able to give such power and to multiply the good. Truly understanding that life is a struggle and that the more you fight, the more you distance yourself from the bad and the possibilities of failure is a state of mind typical of big and powerful people. Although they might not look exactly like this. The constant effort to reach the wave in the end leads you in the dock of a lake placid waters of happiness. And there is where all your previous existence gets its meaning.Therefore, we will counteract the physical forces and not let ourselves be sucked in by a black hole. We will strive to expand the universe and we hope that you will follow us in your personal example.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.fr/",

            "content": "Quickie Review:A young scientist named Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), is in search of finding a single unifying theory that explains everything about the universe. As ambitious as that sounds, it is made more challenging when he is diagnosed with motor neuron disease that will slowly take away his ability to move or speak. Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane (Felicity Jones) decide to fight the disease together, naive to the difficult journey that lies ahead. Based on the life of Stephen Hawking, The Theory of Everything showcases acting of impeccable quality. An inspirational story of a man that overcomes his disability to pursue his passion. At the same time a moving story about human flaws. Definitely one of the finer films of 2014 that must be seen.Full Review:Stephen Hawking is one of the most renowned scientist living today. Considering how he was able to continue his research despite the motor neuron disease makes his contributions all the more impressive. Such an inspirational man, and yet many (including myself) probably are not aware of his personal story. I had high expectations for this film, and now that I've seen it I agree that The Theory of Everything deserves all the Oscars attention it has been getting.This is a wonderfully acted film by both Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. The movie covers Hawking's life from the 60's to the early 00's, so you get to see the disease progressively get worse. The way Redmayne shows the gradual effects over time was flawless. I'm not sure how he got his body and face to contort so accurately, but there were times where it felt like the real Stephen Hawking himself was on screen. The real brilliance of Redmayne's performance was not how he looked, but how he was able to emote through the limited range of movement and speech. He was able to show the vulnerability and the humor of Hawking convincingly even in the later stages of the disease. Felicity Jones' performance as Jane Hawking was crucial because her relationship with Stephen Hawking was the emotional crux for the entire film. Felicity Jones absolutely delivered, the emotional transformation that Jones' character goes through is just as impressive as Redmayne's physical change.On the top of the acting caliber, I liked how the script handled the characters. After being together for decades, of course the disease starts to affect the marriage. The script and the director could've easily made the relationship problems seem one-sided, painting one of the two as being wrong. Instead the film treats Stephen and Jane Hawking as real human beings. A couple that was naive and flawed as any young couples are. Both are neither guilty nor innocent, but make very understandable and human mistakes. This ultimately made the film delightfully relatable and emotionally impactful. I have to mention how beautiful the soundtrack for the film was. Instantly from the opening scene the evocative music brought goosebumps to my skin. I have loved Johann Johannsson's music in the past and this might be some of his best work yet. I am glad he is getting the recognition he deserves.All in all, I highly recommend The Theory of Everything. Some people are bothered that it is not a completely accurate story, to those people may I mention that Stephen Hawking himself has said it's \"broadly true\" and reacted positively overall. So the film also got a seal of approval from Hawking. In the end movies are meant for entertainment and not a high-school textbook. In that sense not only was The Theory of Everything entertaining, it was a deeply moving.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",

            "review_title": "Great drama with minor flaws",
            "content": "\"The Theory of Everything\" is often advertised these days as the new must-see movie on Stephen Hawking. However, it is as least as much about his wife Jane Wilde, especially given the fact that the screenplay is based on Wilde's book. This screenplay scored also one of the movie's five Academy Award nominations and has a true shot at winning, just like Redmayne and J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's music. Felicity Jones probably has no chance at winning her nomination as she just has the less showier part compared to Redmayne. The film is directed by James Marsh and you may have seen his Oscar-winning documentary \"Man on Wire\".I felt that the movie worked best when it was a full drama. Unfortunately, they included lots of humor to make it a lighter film in contrast to Hawking's struggles and doubts. Because of the tryhard humor, I cannot put it as one of my favorite films of the year. However, it is an interesting depiction of how a relationship can end and still both partners find happiness with their new love interests. The audience won't mind either as both new partners were presented as extremely likable throughout the film, long before they actually got together with their persons of interest. Also, as you probably guessed, the movie is not too deep in terms of Hawking's studies as it would simply have become too difficult to understand for broad audiences. Instead, we get to see the struggles that most of us also try to cope with in everyday life: relationships, health, friendships etc.My favorite scenes include the one near the end where he takes the pen and gives it to the girl who maybe suffers from the same disease (in an early stadium) that he has. Another one would be the struggles with Jane as she tries to teach him how to speak without his voice with the help of colors and she realizes she may not succeed. The other woman succeeds right afterward pretty quickly, which shows us that she may be the one. And finally, I also loved the scene when Jones' character tells about how she will stay with him, even if it is only two years.I also liked Eddie Redmayne in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\", a great film, so I'm happy he is getting all the awards recognition, even if I would probably not include him as one of the best performances of the year. McConaughey won last year for playing a character who was told he has only very little time to live, but it turned out he had much more. Same description fits Hawking in this film. Will Redmayne get the Oscar or can Keaton make a comeback? I have not seen \"Birdman\" yet, so can't say who I would prefer. Funnily enough, Redmayne is up against Benedict Cumberbatch who probably gave the most seen Hawking performance before \"The Theory of Everything\". Finally, a shoutout to David Thewlis who stayed in mind most from all the supporting players here. Good performance, but that's pretty much a given with him. By the way, the real Stephen Hawking, over 70 now, keeps appearing on \"The Big Bang Theory these days.",

            "content": "This film took an incredible amount of dedication to get through; I even had to break it up between two days. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal did such a good job of showing the 'silverspooned' flippancy, and associated arrogance of anyone lucky enough to get into Cambridge, that half way through you're almost glad that Hawking's ego was tempered by fate and ALS. Guy gets into boys' club, Guy gets into aristocracy, Guy gets pretty girl, and it's all about the Guy, with very little science thrown in. Certainly the script was gleamed from the first Mrs. Hawking's work, but after some thought at the film's end, you wonder if Hawking's ALS was the single most deciding factor that provided the 'thinking man' time to think himself to greatness. After all, great men come from great sacrifice, and Mr. Hawking's great sacrifice was that he no longer could experience life the way the rest of humanity experiences it. The film certainly had an air of 'Cambridge guy does film about another Cambridge guy' love only a fellow Cambridge guy and the old boys' club would appreciate., The rest of the 99.9% of us are left with less than a real look into the source as to why Hawking was famous (as was the compelling root of similar films like Russell Crowe's \"A Beautiful Mind\"). Even after desperately waiting for Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) to share some much needed humility we're even grasping for deeper development of Dennis Sciama, PhD. But after trudging through the fiction that was Alan Touring's re-telling, it's not hard to believe that Cumberbatch and Redmayne are friends, as they are more apt to tell the story as they see it, as opposed to the way the story was as history experienced it.To quote Kirk Lazarus from \"Tropic Thunder\": 'Everybody knows you never go full retard.' Eddie Redmayne certainly took that advice to heart, supposedly almost to the point of experiencing his own spinal damage in the making of this dull film. You'd certainly get a better return, and a heck of a lot more \"Stephen Hawking\" watching television's \"Big Bang Theory\" than you could from Redmayne's the theory of making a very boorish film. For every intellectual movie-goer out there who already knows Hawking's disabilities, you'll get nothing more than what you already knew from Redmayne's portrayal, and for those searching to know Hawking more, well then you just may not like Hawking after Eddie Redmayne's rendition of him.",

Jane Wilde have our respect, humanity salutes you, and so on. BUT. This is a movie about Stephen Hawking, the world famous physicist. I don't wanna be rude, but we \"wanna see\" his story, his feelings, his struggles, his hardships, his fight with the neurodegenerative disease, and the achievements he made despite all that. I kinda understand the lack of science and the focus shift to drama, but lets not forget: it's still a movie about Stephen Hawking. Sidetracking time: I'd love to link a Guardian article here, in which Jane (only half year after the death of her ex-husband) complains about her depiction in the Theory of Everything. She thinks in a movie about Stephen Hawking (I can't stress it enough!), they should've shown the unspeakable difficulties of packing for the family, driving, organising...etc. Let me give you a little bit of St. Paul: ,,Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude.\" If it was so selfless and altruistic of Jane to take care of Stephen, maybe she should be happy about the recognition instead of arguing for more. I'm sure Hawking's grave is a comfortable hump to stand on, but... can you please not, maam? She doesn't realize that even this recognition has already happened to Hawking's detriment. For her part, a more detailed depiction of the difficulties of daily care was cut short. And in comparison, they cut out pretty much Hawking's entire scientific career. You can decide which is more important. In a movie about Hawking...I agree that the presentation of their relationship was sketchy at best, but I don't think the solution would be to further swell her role. Hawking is lost in his own movie. It only contains traces if him. We don't get to know why he was a special person, a one in a hundred million. Time... time is not enough! And if you need more time-time, then make more time-time! Make it longer!Replace the Hawking in the movie with a similarly sick person and basically nothing will change. In vain did Eddie Redmayne played his soul out in this role if the script pushed the physicist's genius into the background because of commercial consumability, along with him, making space for the female lead we honestly don't care about. This is not your movie, Jane! Not your tragedy, not your success story!Again, I understand the no science policy, but if you wanna make it more personal: where is Hawking's childhood? The relationship with his children? Or the surprisingly intimate relationship with the priest? Where is the deep seated depression of his? The ruler of England honors him? No time...time. No time to be scientific, no time to be humane, no time to be experientially emotional... so what's the point, then?",

Not only is he alive but is an international figure, having made great contributions to the field of physics and wrote a worldwide, best-selling book, explaining his theories in more simplified form, so the ordinary man on the street could understand his extremely difficult concepts.The film has a beautiful score with performances that seem quite believable. Eddie Redmayne shines as Hawking in an extremely difficult, physically-demanding role. Still there's another voice in me that asks should Hawking really be viewed as an \"inspiration?\" Of course he is but on the other hand, if you were a genie and could take away Hawking's disease along with his super-intelligence, I believe that Hawking wouldn't hesitate to cast off his \"brains\" so he could walk again. What I am trying to say is that despite the inspiration, his life is still a tragedy. In the end, is there really enough here to create a full-length feature film? Or would a documentary serve as a better vehicle to illustrate the Hawking story? The \"sad decline\" which I alluded to before is quite ably illustrated here for all to see. There's not much drama in that\u2014 nor the eventual dissolution of Hawking's marriage to Jane, which was an inevitable resolution given the overall tragic circumstances.\"The Theory of Everything\" is a beautiful tribute to a man who made something out of his life despite a harrowing disability. In that respect, it accomplishes what it sets out to do. We all can be inspired by such a tale but ultimately, Hawking's accomplishment is no \"triumph.\" The dream sequence where Hawking gets out of his wheelchair and picks up a pen while attending a conference reminds us that such a simple act trumps any of the afflicted scientist's intellectual accomplishments which is decidedly akin to nothing more than a Pyrrhic Victory.",

I freely admit to being as susceptible as the next man to skillful manipulation. In my favourite Noel Coward play, This Happy Breed, he establishes in Act One that Queenie Gibbons is flighty and values a 'good time' above the steady true love offered by next-door neighbour Billy Mitchell. In Act Two he has Queenie run away from home with an older, 'glamorous' man, causing her mother to forbid mention of the name Queenie ever again. Late in Act Three, Billy Mitchell, long established as a career sailor in the Royal Navy, calls on the Gibbons - as is his wont - whilst home on leave; casually he asks Ethel if the name Queenie is still taboo and relates how he ran int her in Nice. 'Is she still there'? asks Ethel. 'No, she's next door. We were married last week'. I've seen a dozen productions of the play over the years and I often watch the DVD of the film version so I know what's coming and never fail to burst into tears at that point in Act Three. Consummate manipulation by a great writer BUT the scene lasts for minutes only, the key speech seconds, AND it is, of course, Fiction. The story of Stephen and Jane Hawking is so factual that both are still very much alive and portrayed here by two actors who are beyond praise but if manipulation isn't your thing best avoid it.",

If you are interested to hear about Stephen Hawking's theories in great detail you better watch The 2013 BBC documentary/movie \"Hawking\" currently on Netflix. This movie does take into account Hawking's theories but the focus is on his personal and family life. And it does a very good job at portraying his first marriage and the love and devotion of his devout wife through the course of Hawking ALS disease. Some have slighted this movie for not covering Hawking's theories in too much detail, but there is already a good BBC film on the scientific discoveries of Hawking, so a rehash of the same territory would have been a waste of time and effort.The movie focuses on Hawking's first marriage. It covers how he and Jane Wilde fell in love and married despite Hawking ALS diagnosis and a prognosis of death within 2 years. It is presented with humor and grace and tenderness. It traces Hawking's gradual deterioration from walking with difficulty with canes, to crawling up the stairs, to getting wheelchair bound, to losing his voice and yet surviving and not succumbing to the disease in 2 years as was the prognosis. The movie shows the toll the disease took on Hawking's wife that led finally to the separation and finally divorce.The acting in this movie is very good, played with understatement and sincerity. The humor is endearing. It is not the definitive film on Hawking, but restores a balance that was missing in the BBC documentary/movie. So in that respect it is a different take on Hawking's life and work.",

            "content": "There was one little moment in 'The Theory Of Everything' that I really didn't like \u2013 while on stage in his wheelchair, Stephen Hawkins imagines himself standing up, picking up a pencil off the floor and placing it on a table. It's an odd fantasy sequence in a film that does so much to ground itself in the utmost reality, and I'm taken out of the moment. But why do I start this review straight off with a criticism? Because I figured I should probably note ONE criticism, considering that these thirty uncharacteristic seconds are preceded by two hours of exceptional cinema.For those who don't know, 'The Theory Of Everything' is the biopic of legendary physicist Stephen Hawking. Told chronologically starting with his time at Cambridge University, the film recounts both the young man's rise to bona fide genius and the physical deterioration caused by Motor Neurone Disease. At the centre of it all is his wife Jane (who's memoir the film is adapted from), the rock that meant Hawking never stopped fulfilling his potential. As much as the film is about Stephen and his extraordinary life, it is just as much about her extraordinary resolve. And, above all, it's about the strength of their love (which is, yes, extraordinary).I'll admit, I had my doubts about the casting of this film. Both Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are undoubtedly very talented, but I wasn't sure they could pull off such complex characters. Man, was I wrong! The two actors are astonishingly good, and have a fantastic chemistry on screen. Even their scenes as young lovers, before the tough stuff, is great. We really believe that they were made for each other, despite the obvious faith and science conflict, and it's beautiful to watch. But it's when that tough stuff starts, when Hawking begins to break down physically, that the chemistry is electric.As Jane, Felicity Jones proves a revelation. Her transformation from sweet young girl to steely-souled wife is brilliant, as she battles to keep herself together. Even when she finally breaks, we don't hate her \u2013 quite the opposite, in fact. Screenwriter Anthony McCarten makes sure to never paint her as a bad person \u2013 instead, she comes across as a woman who has reached the end of her tether, justifying her eventual decisions. Jones, to her credit, expresses that brilliantly. It's what she doesn't say that is most striking about her performance, with those tired eyes and awkward silences.But let's cut to the chase; the real star of this movie is Eddie Redmayne. I should probably explain why I didn't like those thirty second at the end of the movie. Such is the magnificence of Redmayne's transformation that I forget it's him. At no point does it feel like I'm watching an actor play a role \u2013 this is Stephen Hawking \u2013 until he picks up the pencil and looks like Redmayne again. There is an everyman quality about Redmayne which makes him perfect for the character \u2013 yes, Hawking was a genius, but it never corrupted him. He was humble, charming, funny, innocent in his own way, and Redmayne captures that with his goofy grins and cheeky wry smiles. Even when he is at the point that he can't talk or move his body, when almost everything has shut down, he never stops trying. There is a wonderful scene where he meets his new nurse (Maxine Peake in a small but excellent cameo), which is both laugh-out-loud funny and tragic at the same time. Hawking is a man who had to fight everything - literally death itself \u2013 to achieve his potential. And he does. When you look back on previous Oscar winners \u2013 Charlize Theron in 'Monster', for example \u2013 the awards lot like to see those physical transformations. Well, you might not get a better one than Eddie Redmayne this time round.Kudos also needs to be given to director James Marsh. Well, he got those performance out of the leads, so the plaudits are obvious, but he also does wonders with a strong supporting cast that includes David Thewlis, Harry Lloyd and a really lively Charlie Cox (though Emily Watson, a personal favourite of mine, is in it for what seems like a cup of coffee!). But his method of direction is brilliant. The film's style reflects Hawking's state \u2013 the first third is a lot of quick cuts and moving shots, almost overemphasising the natural agility and physical prowess Hawking had. Then, once he is diagnosed, the cinematography changes. The camera moves closer to the characters, right up close to Hawking's face and his body, almost unnervingly. It's a great tool, solidly executed.A word commonly being thrown about when people talk about this film is celebration. I wish I could be original and think of something else, but a celebration is exactly what 'The Theory Of Everything' is. A celebration of humanity, of faith, of science, of love, of life. The fact that Stephen Hawking is still alive today, after having been given just two years left to live, is a testament to his greatness. If you don't want to watch it for how inspirational it is, though, just watch it for Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones' transformative performances. They deserve it.",

Not knowing of how true is the screenwriters adapting Stephen Hawking's life to the big screen, but the moderate pacing does not upset the audiences as it fills with a lot of interesting theoretic dialogues which some might be funny and the special yet specific cinematography has successfully crafted a beautiful life full of love. A big applause for Eddie Redmayne who has worked hard to portray a character with motor neuron disease that looks extremely real, nature yet pitiful; while Felicity Jones is doing great to support by building up a charming and emotional chemistry. With amazing and calm scores from J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson to enhance the overall tone of the film, the biopic inspires us that when there is life, there will be hope and so, to be courageous, to be strong in overcoming challenges, it will still be successful in achieving dreams.

            "content": "\"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\"Hamlet's words tell of a world that will be beyond Horatio's understanding and implicitly also ours. That is the world of Stephen Hawking. There is a moment in \"The Theory of Everything\" when Hawking's wife Jane attempts to explain her husband's theories by using vegetables on the dinner table as props. She does rather well. But for most of us \"A Brief History of Time\" , and the rest of Hawking's work, will be almost completely incomprehensible. This movie is not, however, about his science or about his astonishing academic achievements or his genius. We rather take those for granted. In a way it is about something that is bigger than these things \u2013 the human spirit, courage, love, redemption\u0085When in 1964, at the age of 22, Hawking was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease and given two years to live the prospects for him to make a lasting contribution in his academic field of study seemed remote. There would not be enough time. But for Hawking time does not always flow forward and he also manufactures it, not least in his own life. If you know that your own time is unnaturally limited then each day you are given becomes the more valuable. This is not just in respect of your work (academic study in Hawking's case) but in your personal and emotional life. And it is the latter which is the main theme of this astonishing film.Around the same time that Hawking's illness emerged he met Jane Wilde, a clever, pretty and engaging young history student at Cambridge. Their loving relationship and marriage is at the heart of \"The Theory of Everything\". They quite quickly had two children (a third was to follow later) and overcame difficulties that would have defeated most of us. For Hawking coping with his illness whilst continuing to produce leading-edge academic work became a courageous and determined obsession. For Jane there was never any doubt that she would commit herself to the extraordinarily difficult task of supporting her husband. This lasted more than twenty years before the combined stresses of his fame and the entrance of others into both their lives led to their parting. This story is told with great sensitivity and without sentimentality \u2013 and it is absolutely believable.The movie is a modern biopic in that it is as scrupulously authentic as the confines of a two hour movie covering more than fifty years of time allow it to be. It may be a brief and selective history of that time but it is faithful to its source material, Jane Hawking's book telling her story. The authenticity is enhanced by the quite brilliant performances of the two leads \u2013 both Oscar nominated. Eddie Redmayne's Hawking is an astonishing impersonation and it seems to capture everything of the man himself with unerring accuracy. He looks the part and conveys the energy, the drive and the humanity of the man, as well as the intellect, in such a way that he actually becomes him. Felicity Jones as Jane is no less remarkable. Here there is no need to try and do an accurate impression but an overriding need to convey her love and commitment, whilst not subsuming her character and personality to that of her extraordinary husband. For example as Hawking wrestles, quite mischievously I thought, with the implications of his evolving theories on the concept of God, she retains her faith and her solid Anglicanism. At no point is this a source of conflict between them.Like Horatio our own philosophy may not be able even to dream the things in heaven and earth that Stephen Hawking is able to cope with almost diffidently. But we can engage with the human story because it has references that we will all relate to. Love, loyalty, ambition, temptation, frustration among them \u2013 as well as the more mundane need to navigate safely through the journey of time past, present and future. At the end of the film the story is briefly replayed in reverse. We move back from Time Present to that moment in Time Past when Stephen and Jane first met. It seemed to say that the possibility of time travel may be something that science hasn't quite delivered yet. But in our minds and our memories we do make these journeys. And though physically we might struggle, though few as malignantly as Stephen Hawking has had to, if our minds remain alert we can still live profoundly satisfying lives full of achievement.",

I was quite disappointed in the lack of information presented. When there was scientific theories presented or the ideas of Hawking himself they were briefly covered and not in depth at all. I learned very little (and this is coming from someone who has about average education in the field) and was rather disappointed in this aspect. The acting in this movie was phenomenal. It was very, very good, and I was truly impressed. Personally, the cinematic quality is not nearly as important as the overall content, which I felt was lacking. I am not into a lot of romance movies and I can very easily see how someone would have a different opinion, but I wish that it had more scientific ideas attached to it.",

The title of the movie suggests that more attention would be given to Hawking's actual theory, but this entire movie is about his relationship with his wife, and even in that it falls short of the sentimentality needed to carry a good love story. They get together so quickly that we really don't understand his wife's attraction to him or why she falls so deeply in love with him so immediately that she's willing to sacrifice the rest of her life taking care of a severely handicapped person. I don't mind a good love story, but then call it The Theory of Love or something. Hawking isn't portrayed as especially brilliant. Sure, there's a few scenes where he wins an award, presents his theories to his peers and receives praise, writes his famous book, but these things just happen in the film in a matter of seconds and then they are over and we're back to his wife spoon feeding him or what the next upgrade to his wheelchair is going to be. We're never really allowed inside his mind to get a sense of the brilliance that is going on. I give Eddie Redmayne huge props for pulling off the acting job that he did, but doing so within the confines of such a lazy script makes this a rather good story about a disabled person who is lucky enough to have someone who loves and cares for him, but not a good movie about Stephen Hawking.",

            "content": "Despite being about uber-genius Stephen Hawking, there's nothing incredibly complex about this biopic; it's just a good ol' fashion relationship drama that concentrates on character and storytelling. That it does this so incredibly well, though, is why it is the first five star movie of 2015. With a life as amazing as Hawking's it would've been pretty easy to focus on either his scientific brilliance or his medical condition as the core story, however the film's success lies in its choice to primarily explore his partnership with wife Jane. Meeting before he is crippled with motor neuron disease and struggling together through the seemingly impossible, Stephen and Jane, as played by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, are two of the most interesting lovers you will see on screen this year. In the early stages their chemistry is intoxicating \u2013 their brainy youthfulness making for a tremendously sweet romance \u2013 but as the years progress their bond simultaneously becomes trickier and more profound. Whilst his physical transformation throughout proceedings is astounding, there's more to Redmayne's Golden Globe-winning performance as the famed physicist. He brings a charm and sly wit to Hawking that makes him grounded, relatable and infinitely fascinating. Yet it wouldn't have mattered how good Redmayne was if Jones wasn't just as absorbing in the more emotionally complex, if less \"flashy\", role as Jane. She is deeply enthralling as a woman who balances love, family, personal growth and responsibility, despite continuously battling against the odds on all fronts. This really is the Redmayne-Jones show, and as wonderful as the score, cinematography and James Marsh's direction is, you get the feeling that with these two talented actors on centre stage this true life tale would be enchanting regardless of what occurred around them. A dramatic tour de force that is worthy of all the praise heaped upon it.",

I wouldn't have dared to bet on the movie having any chance to come this far when I first saw it, courtesy the screener copy (hate to reveal being a pirate :P), none whatsoever except Eddie Redmayne for his portrayal as Stephen Hawking in the movie. Well here it is, standing tall with handful of nominations this awards seasons with 5 nominations in the Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor, Actress and Original Score. I just watched it a second time in cinema, this time falling more in love with the movie.The story about Stephen hawking, the world renowned physicist and cosmologist wouldn't have been unheard of, there being lot of movies, documentaries and TV shows on his life and works. This movie though is shown from Jane Wilde Hawking's perspective who was Stephen Hawking's wife. The plot is not purely biopic as such but the movie takes us through the hard life Stephen Hawking had to go through after he was diagnosed with motor neuron disease and how his wife backed him throughout the tough times before eventually parting their ways. It would be an instant love affair if you happened to be a Stephen Hawking fan and for others you would appreciate the heart breaking drama which never goes over the top melodramatic. I loved the ending very much, a fitting climax drawn parallel to his work \"A brief history of time\".The lead cast terrific and deservingly front runners in acting categories this awards season. I have had seen Felicity Jones (who played Jane Wilde Hawking) earlier and this without doubt is a breakthrough performance from her. The surprise package comes in form of a relatively unknown Eddie Redmayne who nearly nails it to perfection as Stephen Hawking, the kind of performance which reminds us of Daniel Day Lewis in \"My Left Foot\". Music by Johnson Johanson deserves a mention too for rendering an emotional texture to the frames. I, for one, loved the pace of the movie barring the lagging scenes somewhere in the middle, it kind of felt like dragging the movie into a heartfelt climax. :) To conclude, \"The Theory of Everything\" isn't the type of movie for casual movie goers who are looking for some time off the park. I would recommend it to serious movie buffs or for those wondering what the Oscars buzz is all about!! Not the perfect biopic yet a must watch. My rating 7.5/10",

            "content": "A well-made biopic can recreate on the screen the intensity the protagonist has gone through at a certain moment of his or her life. But no motion picture can recreate the protagonist's frustration and agony of going through hardships day after day, year after year. This should be kept in perspective when watching the film.After Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking has to be the next best-known name in the realm of modern physics. The term \"modern physics\" is carefully chosen here over relativity, sub-atomic particle physics, unifying theories, and a half-dozen other appealing choices. Those of us that have read a few for-layman science books (best of which are Isaac Asimov's) may be tempted to throw around terms such as event horizon, singularity, quantum theory, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, etc etc. But just like Jon Snow, we know nothing and less. Rather than being completely overwhelmed by Hawking's stupendous scientific achievement, it would be better to approach \"The theory of everything\" as a human story.Note first that this film is fully endorsed by both Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) and Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones) who have remained friends after years of striving to maintain a failing marriage. In the end, they each found a different soul-mate but that doesn't diminish the beauty of the relationship they have shared. But as I had mentioned, one should not lose the perspective of the difficulties they face consistently, which are only depicted in brief scenes in the film. Always looking for a rational explanation of things, I think the fact that Jane is not professionally trained to look after a paralyzed patient could be the most serious problem. This becomes quite evident when we witness how professionally trained Elaine Mason, who eventually becomes Hawking's second wife, (Maxine Peake) successfully helps to him use the \"color spelling board\" after his loses his speaking faculties and before the voice generating device comes to his salvation.Peake, whom one critic describes as \"charismatic\", does indeed bring to the screen such cheerful confidence that lifts the spirit of the audience. Her sort of counterpart, Jonathan Hellyer Jones (music teacher and recent widower when he first met Jane) is also well portrayed, by Charlie Cox, who convincingly traces how this unassuming, gentle man evolves from Jane's platonic soul-mate to good family friend and eventually to an almost surrogate-father figure to the family. Two other solid supports come from Emma Watson's maddeningly brief appearance as Jane's mother and David Thewlis (who played Michael Aris, i.e. Aung San Suu Kyi's husband opposite Michelle Yeoh in \"The lady\") portraying Hawking's ever-present and reliable mentor Dennis Sciama. It is, of course, Redmayne and Jones that make this film soar.Watching Redmayne here will block out his two earlier quite respectable performances: reporter Colin Clark in \"My week with Marilyn\" and Marius \"Les Miserables\". Redmayne's resemblance here to Hawking is outright uncanny. And then, we have seen very good performances of paralyzed characters, most notable of which are Mathieu Amalric in \"The diving bell and the butterfly\" and Javier Bardem in \"The sea inside\". Against these two masters, Redmayne's performance does not suffer. Further, what he is portraying is not just a paralyzed man. It is a genius trapped in an immobile body. On top of that, it is a genius with a mischievous sense of humor and rich emotions. By comparison, Jane Wilde (then Hawking) is ordinary but that very ordinariness is a huge challenge and I have to keep coming back to my point that what the filmmakers can show on screen is only a flicker of a moment from a lifetime. Clever screenwriters and directors can do a lot within the strict limitation of screen time. In that department, unfortunately, this film is only passing grade. If you think of the clumsy and contriving scene of Jane coming to see Jonathan after leaving her husband, you'll see what I mean. So a lot is up to the actors. How do you deliver a Jane that is frustrated to exhaustion, still deeply in love, still wanting to persevere and at the same time feeling a little guilty, all that and more? Jones nails her character with pitch-perfect performance.* Hopefully, by next March, I can update \"Golden Globe nominations\" to read \"Oscar wins\"",

The story follows Hawking from his early days at Cambridge, where he meets Jane (Felicity Jones). From there the movie chronicles their life together as well has his crippling battle with Lou Gehrig's disease. The movie gives and intimate inside look at one of the world's most brilliant minds on space and time. The key ingredient to The Theory of Everything is Eddie Redmayne. His portrayal of Hawking is unforgettable; a respectfully done work of brilliance. I don't know what is harder, playing a living legend or playing a dead one. With the deceased you have this air of an omnipotent beings that have a life beyond the grave, any flaw in performance will be deeply criticized by fans as blasphemy. Whereas with the living you risk of insulting someone to their face. Out of the 5 actors nominated for best actor this year 4 of them are playing real people. Redmayne is the only one who had to answer to living. From what I read Hawking is happy with Redmayne's performance. Felicity Jones is up against an actress playing a real character, Reese Weatherspoon's Cheryl Strayed from Wild (2014) in the best actress category. Both well received by their real life counterparts, yet neither are the front runner to win the Oscar. I was not blown away by this movie. Hawking's is a very inspiriting story of overcoming adversity, I just didn't walk away inspired. It was more about the love story between Hawking and his wife, who are now in fact separated. When this movie and Imitation Game (2014) were nominated for Best Picture, I mentally prepped myself to be bored by both of these, due to my own ignorance. Imitation game was amazing, painfully moving and super inspirational, this one left a lot to be desired. The director James Marsa is known more for documentaries. This I think is obvious in watching the movie. He does a lot with visual camera tricks and dream like transitions to add more without manipulating the story in anyway. There are a lot of odd, and somewhat confusing elements to Hawking's life that are treated very delicately. I will not spoil it so as not to ruin anything. I think a director with more fictional film experience would have been better. There is a reason why his name is left off the Best Directing category. If you are a fan of Dr. Hawking's work then this film is worth a look. It's always interesting to get the back story on the greats. It does have a few good chuckles and some very touching moments. But if pure entertainment is your quest, pick something else. Unlike Dr. Hawking's book, even at 123 minutes, this film does not feel like a BRIEF history of time.

Jane's love and sacrifice her passion made Sir Hawking move on and developed the most beautiful formula with a single theorem that explain the whole Universe. Without love, how worthless this world will be. Redmayne and Jones is tremendous in the plot, I love every part for Jones her expression is one of the best and I can feel the love she had given in the film. You will feel sad for the disease Sir Hawking that has, you will feel sorry for Jane, but you will discover the beauty of the story. I really love this film, I really sorry that this review is sort of personal but it is something I Really want to express. I lucky that I had the chance to watch this movie in the time of my life.",

His life story was very much a tale of love.While Stephen's life was one of immense adversity, his stubborn, pragmatic approach and wonderful sense of humour were his survival kit.The beautiful soundtrack by J\u00f2hann J\u00f2hannsson is a perfectly fitting accompaniment to the story.Without a fault in my opinion, this movie is as wondrous as Stephen's theories.",

            "content": "Sigh, another biopic of an extremely brilliant man. Is there any point? Can we understand the scientific genius Stephen Hawking? Actually, as it turns out we can. Going into this film I was excited but somewhat sceptical. Biopics can be eye-opening; however we must be firmly grounded with the character at its core. If we lose focus, then a film may as well stop as far as I am concerned. What 'The Theory of Everything' chiefly gets right is that we are always engaged and care about the life of Stephen Hawking, which is no small task, especially when one considers how brainy the man is.We enter the swinging sixties where a healthy Hawking studies Cosmology at Cambridge; he shares a room with Brian played by Harry Lloyd who has a perfect relationship with him, one that works off of the thoughts and excellence of the other. Eddie Redmayne plays the eccentric Hawking and gives a performance which will (and must) win him an Oscar. When you view the film you will find it hard to disagree. He is truly a breakthrough and does the man justice \u2013 yes he looks the part, but do not fear this man can act.He meets the determined Jane played by Felicity Jones who manages to be one of the better female roles captured on film. Many may remember the cringe worthy performance supplied by the pretty but not reliable Keira Knightley in 'The Imitation Game', which is another biopic worthy of mention. Jones outshines her effortlessly and seems secure in the role. As Hawking's physical well-being deteriorates she remains strong and powerful in a role many may have swept to the side. That is harder to do, when you see what she manages to achieve. When we learn that his life will never be the same again, the film veers dangerously off course, prompting tears but not much of anything worthy of substance. Don't worry this is a small bump in an otherwise smooth journey.As Hawking loses control of his muscles we are presented with an astonishing scene \u2013 one that will resonate throughout film history. As he prepares to leave the table from dinner he finds it difficult to walk up the stairs. As his legs give way he is forced to use his arms as his sole means of reaching his destination. As he looks up he sees his child whom is crawling on all fours without effort. This is a poignant parallel where Hawking sees what he has become, a small infant like child, one who is now dependent on others for his well-being.Over two hours in length, the film's grip lets go in the last third. Consider this necessary as up to this point it has been breath-taking. The film after all had to give us room to breathe. 'The Theory of Everything' is a biopic that gets almost (well) everything right. The two leads are strong, the love story is believable. But, most importantly we always understand and never lose sight of Stephen Hawking. 'The Theory of Everything' passes with honours.",

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsPart biopic, part love story; \"The Theory of Everything\" rises on James Marsh's polished direction and the strength of its two leads. Not an idealistic, all flowers and cuddles ordeal - it's a veritable depiction of true love and companionship. Also, the debate between theists and atheists has been played out in all matter of social circles for years now, yet it's only now that a film tackles this subject in such a beautiful, heartbreaking, subtle, and enlightening manner.Starring Eddie Redmayne (\"Les Mis\u00e9rables\") and Felicity Jones (\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\"), the film chronicles the extraordinary true story of one of the world's greatest living minds - the renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking - who falls deeply in love with fellow Cambridge student Jane Wilde. Once a healthy, active young man, Hawking received an earth-shattering diagnosis at 21 years of age. With Jane fighting tirelessly by his side, Stephen embarks on his most ambitious scientific work: studying the very thing he now has precious little of - time. Together, they defy impossible odds, break new ground in medicine and science, and achieve new ground in medicine and science, and achieve more than they could ever have dreamed. The film is based on the memoir \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\", by Jane Hawking, and is directed by Academy Award winner James Marsh (\"Man on Wire\").Devoid of anything flashy, but backed by one of the year's finest performances, this intimate romantic drama is a revealing look at one of the most fascinating individuals of our generation. How Redmayne, not just able-bodied but downright pretty, twists himself into the famously blighted professor, and then projects the thought processes behind the disability, has to be seen to be believed. There's a mischievous quality to Redmayne that seems a good match with the wit Hawking has always managed to convey with a raised eyebrow and a mechanically-voiced quip. Stephen Hawking is the best thing that's ever happened to Redmayne's career, and \"The Theory of Everything\" is a treat.\"The Theory of Everything\" reveals the man behind the icon: courageous, mischievous, funny, loving, but also difficult and at times selfish. It offers interesting characters and standout acting. Sometimes you wish the movie had delved deeper into its characters, but for what it is - a romance tale involving one of the great minds of humanity, interspersed with bits and pieces of Hawkin's academic prowess and scientific theories - it's engaging and moving. \"The Theory of Everything\" is deftly funny on occasions, endearingly heartwarming at other times, and wholly inspiring. If only we could get more loves stories like this and \"The Fault in Our Stars\", released earlier this year.",

            "content": "I was never much of a scientist growing up. Not because I didn't find the answers to the complexities of the natural world fascinating but because I was never patient enough to do much of the leg work. The forming of hypotheses, the testing, the recording of data the rigorousness of the scientific method etc. I much rather read about the newest discoveries than dedicate eons discovering them myself.The Theory of Everything (2014) is much like the rushed scribbles of scientific data I jotted down in grade school. There's a modicum of passion and a dollop of research but ultimately there's not much behind it. At best it's a straight-forward, paint-by-the-numbers biography with a little directorial flare and two very strong performances by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. It's reminiscent of The Last Station (2009) for that reason only there's even less reverence to the protagonist's life's work. I dare say at worst The Theory of Everything is a subversive insult to one of the smartest men alive.The film plots the relationship of physicist Stephen Hawking (Redmayne) and Jane Wilde (Jones) which budded while they studied at Cambridge in the 60's. It was during that time Stephen contracted ALS and was given only two years to live. Decades later he and Jane married and had three children all while Stephen achieved his doctorate, published his infamous book A Brief History of Time and becomes celebrated as a leader in his field.He's also an atheist. If you didn't know that rest assured it will be brought up again and again. It seems scribe Anthony McCarten wanted to mold an atheist character like screenwriters wrote gay characters in the 90's. Nearly every scene of courtship is overshadowed by talk of religion and later in the film when the differences between quantum mechanics and general relativity are expressed all we really got was the phrase \"God is back on the endangered species list.\" Along with his ALS, his atheism and a general understanding of his job, there's nothing really underlining the character or the importance of Hawking's contributions to the world. This is a man who changed the way we see the universe like no one has since Einstein. Yet a biographical rendering on screen is given even less pomp and circumstance than John Nash in A Beautiful Mind (2001). At least there was a mystery afoot in that movie. The polish and conventionality of this film actually does the man a disservice as it doesn't draw attention to anything other than the bittersweet 30-year love story. His revolutionary mind? Forget about it.I will give credit to director James Marsh for treading the very thin tightrope of clich\u00e9 romance tropes. He manages to throw in a few saccharine moments here and there but pulls his punches before they become manipulative. Thing is he employs this strategy so often that many times I felt like I entered the room just after the drama had ended and all that's left is a visual imprint of what was.Ultimately The Theory of Everything is a decent film with great performances, polished if flawed directing and boring screen writing. It's flawed because it's a safe movie about a man who is anything but; who did the research and the long hours to accomplish a lot. I suppose there is some consolation to that though. At least now more people will actually know who he is and will search on their own for what he's actually done.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Since the beginning of time, a Stephen Hawking biopic was inevitable. And we also knew that it would take a hell of a performance to back it up, something in the region of Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot commitment. On a physicality level, Eddie Redmayne delivers, a star shining since 2012's Les Miserables. Unfortunately The Theory of Everything's script is so stripped down and skimmed across that it doesn't offer enough insights to satisfy intrigue. The film takes a very sentimental approach to Hawking's life from his early university days to being offered a Knighthood. It's a tough focus to have on a doomed romance. What is it trying to say? It is trying to exemplify resilience in the face of hardship? Can't be, they broke up. It's not exactly a matter-of-fact approach either with its expressive cinematography and sweeping score. Director James Marsh is known for a heightened experience with his dramatic and intense Oscar winning documentary Man On Wire. Granted, despite lacking an arc to speak of, Redmayne is thoroughly impressive. To imagine him getting up everyday then sitting in that chair and getting under Hawking's skin takes some skill. He works on a transformative basis, but that has limited value when the material is limited. It's the way that his chemistry with Felicity Jones works. I've liked Jones since Cemetery Junction and I'm glad she's getting some mainstream attention but since the warmth of Junction, she's worked best and most confidently in her icy mode. Her acclaim is justified here, but it's sporadic. She's not consistent, every scene she needs to built to a crescendo rather than holding it throughout the film. When she's engaged as a woman struggling under the weight on her shoulders, she's great, meeting Redmayne's match. But the way that all the actors are working together, including notable supporting performances from Charlie Cox and David Thewlis, they internalize their emotions to the point that only superficialities remain.You can see that they minimise dialogue to let the moment speak for itself, but it's overdone, relied on too much, and the dialogue that gets let out is too often a piece of trite. If it wasn't for the honesty of the performances, it would drag the whole film down. Nevertheless, I defend that it's not a 'standard' biopic, if for its creative visuals with the frames drowned in coloured lights and wide lenses distorting the frame. There's clearly a lot of effort put into every scene, even if it's slightly misguided emotionally. The highlight is absolutely Johann Johannson's beautiful score, the antithesis of his ambient work for Prisoners. It does half the work to capture its beautiful moments, of which the film has a few, but none that successful jerk enough sincere tears. If only The Theory of Everything gave itself enough room to breathe so I could get emotionally invested, but there will be inevitable Oscar nominations in near future. It's great to see Marsh's whole-hearted attempt at fiction, but hopefully he'll take on something perhaps less ambitious and just as intimate on take 2.7/10",

Music like that for some strange reason makes my feel more life inside of me, and the people who did the music I give them two thumbs up for that.But what the movie dose lack on is that they didn't really sell the fact that Hawking is a genius, and we know that he is but in this movie everybody didn't really seem all that filled with his mind blowing work, everybody was all like \"Yeah great job man, that's some good stuff\". but really they should be losing their sh't over how smart Hawking was.Theory of Everything is a well made Biography movie with fantastic performers from Eddie and Felicity, excellent directing and a pretty nice score.",

            "content": "If you want a film that is going to inspire you, not with fictional stories, but instead with the use of a true one grounded in reality than \"The Theory of Everything\" is what you should go out and see right now. It is, simply put, a fantastic, life-affirming film that is propelled forward by its story and its leading roles. In that order. And the rest of the film is pretty good too. But \"The Theory of Everything\" isn't all about Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) and how incredible his story is. Instead the film is \"part biopic, part love story\" with the latter telling us about the imperfect marriage between Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde (played by Felicity Jones). Eddie Redmayne is fantastic as Stephen Hawking and what is best at how he portrays Hawking getting worse in regards to his Motor Neurone Disease (/ALS). Redmayne starts the film as a young Hawking and we can tell this guy is clever. But it is as the film goes on that Redmayne's performance gets better. Halfway through the film we are looking at a slouched Redmayne, slurring his words and occasionally smiling and by the end of the film we are looking at Redmayne playing Hawking as he is now. In testament to this the real-life Stephen Hawking commented, on seeing the film, that he felt he was sometimes looking back in time at himself. I'm with him. His performance is again, incredible, as incredible as the story he has the privilege to tell. If I don't see him in the running for the Best Actor Oscar come February then I will be surprised. Felicity Jones performance as Jane Wilde is magnificent too. Although on the surface she doesn't seemingly require the various skills that Redmayne has to delve into, she again does the story and her real- life counterpart justice. Although she starts the film as a student, we come to see her having to raise 3 children as well as look after her husband and you feel that she really is going through all this. Again, the real-life Jane Wilde was impressed with Jones' performance. When I think about Best Actress potential this year, she should also be in the running for the appropriate Oscar.Harry Lloyd is brilliant as Stephen's university friend Brian too. Although Brian is a mere composite character, he is a brilliant one at that. His attitude is drawn from Jane's descriptions of \"Stephen's fellow lodgers and research students\" at Cambridge: \"They talked to him in his own intellectual terms, sometimes caustically sarcastic, sometimes crushingly critical, always humorous. In personal terms, however, they treated him with a gentle consideration which was almost loving.\" He could also be in for an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. But it is the story that really propels \"The Theory of Everything\" forward and it provides for half the reason as to why the films leads are fantastic. The film itself is based on Jane Wilde's 2008 autobiography \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\", a flattering account of their initial marriage and a significantly different, revised edition of the 1999 autobiography \"Music to Move the Stars: My Life with Stephen\", a less flattering account of their marriage, sparked when Hawking left Wilde for his nurse Elaine Mason in 1990. (It's worth noting they quietly divorced in 2006 following a 5 year period of rumours over whether Mason abused Hawking, apparently hitting him, throwing him around and even leaving him in the sun to burn for several hours.) The revised edition was sparked by her and Hawking managing to develop a good working relationship with Wilde. The story of \"The Theory of Everything\", as I said earlier, is \"part biopic, part love story\". We learn in the film of how clever Hawking was and how he refused to let his disability stop him from being great, initially managing to overcome the 2 years he was given to live and ultimately managing to become a household name. But this isn't what \"The Theory of Everything\" is really about. Although the film does give Hawking his due, it's not as if Eddie Redmayne has a bigger role than Felicity Jones. Their roles are coequal and the film thus focuses on Stephen and Jane's relationship, in particular how Wilde had to cope with raising 3 children whilst looking after her husband.\"The Theory of Everything\" is a fantastic film with a fantastic story and two fantastic leads. The only problem I had with the film, and it's always there for me when I watch this kind of film, is although it is never boring, you do find yourself occasionally wondering how long is left. But this is not the final thought I want to leave you with. Instead, let me remind you that \"The Theory of Everything\" is again, a fantastic film and worth seeing if you get the chance. It tells you something that apparently a nurse wiped a tear from Hawking's eye when he first saw the film.",

My main areas are Math, Chemistry and Physics. So I went into viewing this movie already pretty familiar with Hawking and his works. Eddie Redmayne of course won the best actor Oscar for his performance as Hawking and it is fully deserved. Felicity Jones is fine as his girlfriend who stands by him when his illness is diagnosed and becomes Mrs Jane Hawking. The story here starts in 1963 when Hawking is a new graduate student in Physics and is having difficulty declaring a field of study for his PhD. But he finally gets inspired and writes a thesis on the origin of space and time as a singularity that became the Big Bang. Of course later in life he said his new theory goes against that earlier one.The thing about this type of Physics, there is no good experimental evidence for most of them, making it difficult to know how valuable their contributions might be, aside from his best-selling book \"A Brief History of Time.\" As the movie unfolds we don't get a good feel for the time but in the end there are Hawking children in their late teens so it must have been up to about 1990 or so. We see Hawking's physical health degrade, his being fitted with various devices that allows him to communicate.Good movie.",

And also that is called a real love from Jane. This movie is really sensitively attached with every scene and I just loved it.How willpower does he has! Not imaginable...I'm actually loved the last scenes... How director has knew what we need that time... And for satisfaction he once made Stephen sir to get up from the chair... How lovely was that! And in last he has proved his intelligence with revising the whole movie till the first scene when Jane met Hawking.And truly emotionally attached it me with all the life he had. There is no negative point of this movie and really when I'm writing this I watched it twice to get more emotional....But I gave it 4 and half ratings... But the half rating is cut for they haven't shown us HOW HE DISCOVERED HIS THEORY. His efforts and to researches those are lacing part.. but still it's the best movie I have seen ...

Apparently not entirely accurate in some parts, but close enough for the most part. Characters are well developed and the movie is very engaging.Superb performance by Eddie Redmayne. He captures the mannerisms, and even physical appearance, of Stephen Hawking perfectly. Got the 2015 Best Actor Oscar for his efforts, though I think there is very little to choose between his and Michael Keaton's performances (in Birdman).Great performance too from the mesmerizingly beautiful Felicity Jones.

A Ron Howard-type, 1940s-style emotion-seeker using Dr. Hawking's sad illness for a center point, this story was very little about what made the man great in his field, and almost all about what made him such a force of mind and will while enduring a physical illness that felled most others with it early on. Living on for decades beyond expectations showed the results of that great will along with the long-suffering, loving care his wife showered upon him for all those years of indignity and degenerative insult. To show his brutal struggle's accomplishments as well as the film showed them was grand and very encouraging to behold, but I truly wish the film had shown more of what made him so heroic in his field as well as in his illness. Thus, the film failed in that for me.Eddie Redmayne as Hawking was outstanding, as his amazing physical similarities were only overshadowed by his uncanny ability to portray Hawking's illness's effect on his body and face as he declined. Felicity Jones as his loving and caring and so enduring wife, was also outstanding, as the fierce will and love she showed in her role was surely as strong as Mrs. Hawking showed in real life.Don't expect much of Hawking's science in this film, as it has just enough in it to engage us about Hawking's life mission, which is the title of the film. He is still working on it, and I am sure that is what is keeping him alive for the rest of us to someday benefit.",

He is a student who excelled to the extremes in physics and math. He meets Jane Wilde whom she finds curious and they begin a relationship. Central story regards a muscle disease that strikes him down rendering unable to get around. His brain is still active but his muscles deteriorate to the point where his speech is slurred and he is in need of a wheelchair, and eventually an electric wheelchair to get around. Director James Marsh captures the period, which takes place in the mid 1960's. The film's true strength lies in Eddie Redmayne's ability to distort his body and movements as Hawking's body breaks down. Felicity Jones plays the frustrated Jane who marries Hawking and struggles to provide for her husband's constant care. This leads to the screenplay's one big drawback when it presents the fall of their marriage and the introductory of a choir conductor, played by Charlie Cox, who also assists in Hawking's care. Maxine Peake plays Hawking's second wife who seems more able to care for him yet viewers may find this conclusion quite depressing. Other roles are fairly standard issue including David Thewlis as a fellow professor who sees great things in Hawking. While the film is sad it also presents a view of one stricken by such a condition as well as beating a two year life span odds to live to an old age. The theory of that will only come off as a surprise to those who watched him succeed. 7 \u00bd / 10",

Because this happened in the UK there seems to be no major financial difficulty like insurance running out etc. It's sympathetic to his wife since it's based on her book. Don't quite understand his scientific contribution party but it isn't about that. The recent biopic Mr Turner was dreadfully boring and showed things no one wanted to see. Also the one about Dickens with Ralph Fiennes was pretty bad too. At least in Theory you see what you want to see. Felicity Jones as his wife is right for the role - not too pretty. Eddie Redmayne finally has found a role that suits him. He isn't handsome enough for major romantic lead roles like Les Mis. So this role is just right for him with his slightly crooked features. He looks a lot like the person he is playing, much more so than many other biopics of late. It isn't right to give an Oscar just because the actor is portraying terrible illness on screen but in this case he is pretty good.

For those interested in learning more about the extraordinary mind of this physicist and his contributions to science, do not expect to be enlightened. The story is more a love story adapted from his first wife Jane Hawking's book TRAVELING TO INFINITY: MY LIFE WITH STEPHEN as adapted for the screen by Anthony McCarten. Were it not for the struggle with ALS that is depicted from the onset to the present (Hawking is 72 years old at present) and the manner in which both Hawking and Jane adjusted to this deteriorating disease, this could have been another soap opera a la Nicholas Sparks, but the actors involved make it work, aided of course by the direction of James Marsh.One summary offers the synopsis well: 'The Theory of Everything is the story of the most brilliant and celebrated physicist of our time, Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) , and Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) the arts student he fell in love with whilst studying at Cambridge in the 1960s. Little was expected from Stephen Hawking, a bright but shiftless student of cosmology, given just two years to live following the diagnosis of a fatal illness at 21 years of age. He became galvanized, however, by the love of fellow Cambridge student, Jane Wilde, and he went on to be called the successor to Einstein, as well as a husband and father to their three children. Over the course of their marriage as Stephen's body collapsed and his academic renown soared, fault lines were exposed that tested the lineaments of their relationship and dramatically altered the course of both of their lives: Stephen remarried Elaine mason (Maxine Peake) and Jane remarried Jonathan Hellyer Jones (the very fine actor Charlie Cox). The others in the large cast who deserve mention include David Thwelis as Stephen mentor and friend, Simon McBurney as Stephen's father, and a quick little walk on by Emily Watson. The film does not fail to touch us because of the diagnosis and the performances, but it would have been stronger had more of Hawking's contributions been shared. Grady Harp, February 15",

He is now in his seventies and is active as ever. Despite his inabilities, he is still a brilliant genius but a human being with flaws as well. He became a husband, father, professor, author, and even speaker without his voice. The talking box conveys the only voice that most of the world is aware of Hawking. Despite his inability to speak due to a tracheotomy, he has still endured and survived. I don't know what qualifies for a miracle but Hawking is an example of one. He still is going strong.

The whole film is rather tedious and unremarkable, which is a tragedy considering its subject matter is one of the most remarkable men in history. Life and reality is glossed up to a fine sheen, which makes for some nice viewing if you don't dig too deep into what really happened. It is criminal that its screenplay has been nominated for an Oscar over more deserving screenplays in Pride, A Most Wanted Man and Gone Girl. Just when I thought the film was about to excel into something special, it hit a biopic clich\u00e9 or a scene that felt exactly like it was written for the trailer. The montages were my least favourite part - clich\u00e9 arrangements of key events that prevented the lazy filmmakers from having to put much effort into developing the story. More laziness is shown when no effort is made to make Jones look older as time passes - when she's meant to be in her 40s she still looks like she did at University. A new hairstyle doesn't mark the passage of time.Most of the cast are completely forgettable, but Redmayne and Jones save the film and push it just above \"waste of time\" status, but its a shame they didn't have as strong a chemistry as one might hope. Felicity Jones is absolutely adorable and she puts on a beautiful performance as the long-suffering and miserable wife Jane. In spite of the hype, Eddie Redmayne kills time for the first twenty minutes or so until he gets into the illness stage. Here is where we see something special - I honestly forgot i was watching an actor, and I found myself saying \"whats the big deal\" until I caught myself. He is a remarkable transformation throughout the movie, playing the part respectfully but convincingly. The \"I have tried\" scene towards the end of the film is easily the best moment for each actor and was the closest the film came to having an emotional impact. However, whilst The Theory of Everything is a fairly good film, it could have been something very special if it was in more daring and experienced hands.",

Stephen soon learns about his illness and decides to shut Jane off from his life. But Jane insisted on him and stated her for him even though knowing the illness will progress and slowly take Stephen away from her. They get married soon after, and Stephen soon graduates his doctoral study, having more interest to cosmological physics. Jane stands by Stephen as the illness progresses, impairing his locomotion, balance, speech and even swallowing. They have two children and Stephen's work starts to gain spotlight. But little by little, Jane starts to loose her spirit, though she doesn't reveal it.Jane's mother advises her to join the church choir to help her fill her spare time so she goes. There she meets the choir's tutor Jonathan. Jonathan gets close to Jane and her family, even with Stephen. He goes as far as being a helping hand for Stephen when the family goes on an outdoors trip. Jane ultimately starts to feel attracted to Jonathan. But Jonathan backs away when friends and families start to whisper. As Jane goes with Jonathan, Stephen goes to watch an opera. But Stephen has an episode and goes into a comma, and the doctors hesitate in doing a tracheotomy on him due to his muscles have already undergone atrophy which means that it will disable Stephen's ability to speak. Jane insists on tracheotomy, but the family then have to struggle in communicating with Stephen.Jane hired a help, Elaine, who quickly suits Stephen's needs while Jane slowly slips away from him. Stephen then gets the robotic speech aid program which helps him a lot. But then Jane reaches her threshold and she and Stephen gets a divorce. Jane goes on to marry Jonathan. But Stephen calls for Jane, as the first spouse, to accompany him in receiving a title from the Queen.The movie proves to be a great treat for me for several reasons. First, it's timing of nearing Interstellar (2014) nicely complements each other especially on the theoretical physics field. Also, the story strikes a nice balance between the focus between Stephen and Jane, as well as addressing the assortment of connected issues such as religion, family, and also persistence and not giving up.The movie also has nice touches on the technical sides. The coloration choice is a way in making the story setting stand out. The camera angles, particularly on the early Cambridge time, are also great, utilizing nice through-the-window angles. The slight blurring and edging incorporated more significantly in key emotional scenes are also a great way to emphasize the story.The acting side is a very nice overall work for me. I agree with those who say that Eddie Redmayne should have at least an Oscar nomination. His acting here doesn't only involve slimming done his body to the proper weight for his character, but surely he must also endure cramps in doing the muscle-atrophy impersonation. Felicity Jones did quite okay, although she didn't really get much of variation in expressions.All in all, for me The Theory of Everything (2014) is worthy of a 7 out of 10 score. Again, it's great timing of release in connection with Interstellar (2014) sure does help in building a positive feeling in watching early on. But the later on drama build also doesn't disappoint.",

And he's British, which one never realizes from his computer voice. Theory of Everything shows Hawking's brutal physical deterioration in the context of his marriage. Eddie Redmayne is impressive in expressing that deterioration while still showing the man trapped in an increasingly uncooperative body. Eventually he has little to work with as an actor besides his eyes and lips, but he does a lot with those.It's the sort of performance that always wins Oscars (Hollywood loves a good disability acting job) but honestly I was more impressed by Felicity Jones, who expressed a steely, quiet determination and, as the movie progressed, increasing frustration. Often she isn't given much more to work with than Redmayne, being asked to tell the story with her eyes, and she does so marvelously. Even though the movie is ostensibly about Hawking, it feels like it's at least as much her story as his (not surprising, since much of it is based on her book).While the story is often touching and absorbing, the writers ultimately couldn't figure out how to end it. The movie has two scenes that feel like endings, one at a Q&A and the actual ending, but both feel like they're struggling to create a profound moment out of fairly ordinary moments. For me the lackluster ending lessens the overall impact of the movie; a good ending would have made this an 8 instead of a 7. After watching the movie I read an interesting article on Slate on how accurate this was. Overall reasonably accurate, although it sounds like the real Hawkings was a bit more of a pain than the fluffy fictional one.",

Remember when \"Birdman\" came out, it was all about Keaton until \"The Theory of Everything\" raised its little head and every Academy pundit knew it was over for Batman, 'Robin' would steal his thunder. Serves him for not playing a tragic inspirational real-life figure, that's the lesson we learned from Rourke's loss. Just look at all the winners in the past 10 years: Winston Churchill, Hugh Glass, Abraham Lincoln, George VI, Amin Dada, Truman Capote, fictional characters never really pay off.And you can't even blame the Academy, Eddie Redmayne is actually the best thing about the film, his performance really makes you believe this is Stephen Hawking resurrecting as a young freshman and then slowly descending into the condition that made him such a pop culture icon celebrated in \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\". And the film showed a fascinating aspect about Stephen: for someone who didn't believe in God, he exemplified the idea that God gives when he takes away and Lou Gehrig's disease was so great a handicap He could only compensate it by making Hawking the greatest mind of the twentieth century, second to Einstein.But I digress because the film, while celebrating Hawking' achievement, also focuses on his family life with Jane. Felicity Jones is good as the all-loving but then long-suffering wife, highlighting a sort of bipolar temptation from the film. It tries to be two things at the same time: \"A Beautiful Mind\" and \"My Left Foot\", it's far better than the former which relied on misleading thrills to make Nash' life more interesting, but maybe I wished it dared a little more and could plunge us in the mind of the genius, or focus on the internal battle between his inner self (he wasn't an isolated nerd but a lazy, easygoing fellow), his struggle to understand the universe and make himself understood.That mental exploration was the kind of stunts I expect from movies about intelligent or visionary people, to make you feel more intelligent, but the treatment is rather superficial because the story is busy swinging back and forth between drama and science, to insist on the woman behind the great man. So it all comes to a simple question: are we interested? If so, to what extent? It's always nice to have the external insight but this is why I was so critical at the film's conventional aspect (it's an Oscar baity film if I ever saw one), it should have kept Jones as a supporting character and be more focused on Hawking's world, Jones was a comforting and important presence but she wasn't pivotal in his achievements.So just when we have a glimpse on his genius and the film seems to take off to some realms of intellectual celebrations, we have the domestic life back again, problem with the kids, with the family, the gossips, the gas bills... this is a man who's contemplating the universe, the big bang, time and we have to endure the peripheral aspects, it's like someone pointing out to the moon and we have to endure the finger. I didn't hate that approach, overall, the treatment was well done but it fell flat. If Marsh anted to highlight that aspect, maybe he needed an extra hour because I didn't care much for Felicity Jones.Or maybe I should retract that bit, the first parts did annoy me in the sense that the love story looked like a retread of \"A Beautiful Mind\", it became interesting when he lot the ability to speak and the marriage went downhill. However; we never feel the real transition between happy and sad Jane. So to end on a comparison, the film manages to be a sort 2010s \"Pride of the Yankees\": the man's popular then there's the illness, relatives coping with them and the final speech, of course, this time, he survives but the couple falls apart. It's all done well when it comes to biopic about such tormented characters, you expect more.It's like Redmayne was trapped in that wheelchair and could only stick to Hawking's mimics in order to guarantee his Oscar, it was his zone of comfort, Jones was the actress who went beyond the limit of a two-dimensional role and gave it a poignant aura and the film could take its way to the Oscars, it played it safe and succeeded admirably by grabbing the Best Actor Oscar.\nAt least, \"Birdman\" tried something new and got the Best Picture. But the film seems to equate the award with a series of parameters cohabiting with harmony, I guess I can say it's a great Oscar-bait movie, it's a very limited way to look at it, but still better than being a bad Oscar one. And I just realized James Marsh had won the Oscar with \"Man On Wire\", so he's capable of making inspirational movies with a uniqueness of their own.",

            "content": "There's an image that we have of Stephen Hawking: basically, a brilliant man trapped in a useless body. To know all that he's accomplished given the obvious challenges and limitations that he faces is in itself inspiring. And, clearly, in spite of it all, he has a sense of humour. This may seem silly, but one thing that I truly admire about him is that he sometimes appears on \"The Big Bang Theory\" - surely one of the silliest (and, yes, best) shows on television. But there's a lot about Stephen Hawking that I didn't know. I, like many I've talked to, thought his disability had been from birth. I honestly never realized that he had married and had children. I found that \"The Theory Of Everything\" put a very human face to this man who seems, somehow, different than the rest of us - more limited in some ways, far superior in other ways. As a brief history of the life of the author of \"A Brief History Of Time,\" this movie worked very well.Not just brilliant, Hawking is a very complex man, with a very complicated personal history. The movie begins with him falling in love, and more or less ends with the end of his (first) marriage. The relationship between Stephen and Jane starts as a truly simple romance of two people who just find each other. It becomes a true love story as Stephen begins to decline physically and is diagnosed with ALS and given two years to live. It then becomes a story of devotion as Jane cares for him and encourages him in his work. There's then the sad and tragic end as the love Stephen and Jane have for each other isn't enough to keep them together. It is, in fact, a brief but well done account of Hawking's life and of Jane and Stephen's relationship.The lead performances from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as Stephen and Jane are superb. Redmayne especially seemed to capture Stephen Hawking, which must have been a difficult acting job, trying to capture the reality of Hawkings' physical decline.The only real weakness I saw in this was that it jumped into the love story too quickly. I thought we could have been offered a bit more of a glimpse of Hawking's early life, which might have made for a fuller character study. But what we do see here is fascinating. The movie is both sad and inspiring, and sometimes both at the same time - which is a rather difficult balance to achieve. \"The Theory Of Everything\" pulls that off well. (9/10)",

            "review_title": "Elegant.",
            "content": "The Theory of Everything chronicles the life of Stephen Hawkings - world renowned British theoretical physicist and probably the most famous scientist in the world.Starting in 1953, when Hawkings (Eddie Redmayne) is attending Cambridge University as a PhD candidate right through to present day, the film is an elegy not just to his incredibly successful career, but also to his triumphs in his personal life with his wife, Jane (Velocity Jones).With its primary source based on Jane's memoir, 'Travelling to Infinity: My life with Stephen', the entirety of his and her lives are detailed in fine-tune, from the moment they meet in a party a connection was made. She was studying Medieval Spanish Poetry, and he was studying time-travel cosmology. Through the hard-ships of his life as his body failed him, Jane is not scared away, but instead stays, marries him, has a family and cares for him. Fair to say, it is as much Jane's story as it is his, from where it is shared and melodramatic.From the beginning scenes of the film, Oscar-winning director James Marsh makes a point in showing that Stephen has a problem. Beginning subtly, but slowly deteriorating, Stephen is diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease, or ALS. Given two years to life he is soon unable to walk, then after an emergency tracheotomy, he is unable to also talk.Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Hawkings is undeniably incredible, and adds much gravitas to the performance as he slowly transforms. In the later scenes, now unable to walk or talk, he is restricting to a wheelchair; hunched, hands cramped, face distorted and only able to communicate with his eyes and a computerized voice. Redmayne's resemblance to Hawking is uncanny and authentic as he dips into front-runner Oscar-bait. Upon viewing the film, the real Stephen Hawkings even admitted that it was like he was watching himself.The science of the film, which are the fundamentals behind Christopher Nolan's Interstellar are often complex to understand; but quantum physics, black holes and relativity are all expertise subjects to Hawkings, which led to his famous accolades going world- wide from his book 'A Brief History of Time'.Of course, the theories are quite difficult to comprehend if you are not a mastermind scientist. But that is okay, as on the screen we merely see Hawking's in front of chalkboards with long equations, big words and hypothesis' as others either proclaim his work as 'Brilliant!' or 'Rubbish!'The Theory of Everything certainly holds a treasure chest of rich material. Too much for one film to squeeze in perhaps, with the massive subject of who is Stephen Hawkings? But Marsh's vision is poignant and precise as nothing is rushed or missed out as it condenses into the tidy two-hours running time.Set in a similar style to Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind, the film is elegantly crafted from the beautiful cinematography to the sensitive performances. It's masterful, triumphant, and will surely prosper in every category possible at this year's Academy Awards as one man's struggle provides the point that 'there is no limit to human endeavour'.",

            "content": "The story of Stephen Hawking, a man who overcome extraordinary physical disadvantages to become both a preeminent scientist and a best-selling author of popular science books is remarkable; but it's a difficult one to capture in a dramatic film. In that sense, 'The Theory of Everything' merely recounts what you might already have known about Hawking and has the same inherent weaknesses as most biopics. A strength is the very convincing portrait of Hawking's deteriorating physical condition; I wouldn't exactly call it a tour-de-force of acting per se (given Hawking's decreasing ability to directly convey his own emotional state), but the overall depiction is very good. Perhaps because his professional work was so complex, the film concentrates mostly on his emotional life, and that of his wife, Jane. Her story is told as one of quietly plucky Englishness; in places, one feels the film might have shied away from truly telling things how they were. Overall, it's nicely done, but unlikely to be revelatory for anyone already familiar with the material.",

But the movie presents their romance and struggle more as a well-mounted soap opera than as a biopic of one of the world's foremost scientists. It sometimes comes off as a cheesy disease-of-the-week movie tempered by a rather tawdry love triangle, or quadrangle ((Stephen:Jane:Choirmaster:Penthouse) If you want any knowledge of the professional life and works of Stephen Hawking, you will not find it here. And that is a shame. Because his professional life and work are infinitely more interesting than that of his occasional interest in eyeing a Penthouse magazine or her struggle with her libido. Medmayne deserved his Oscar. But the script let both him and Hawking (and the viewer) down.",

            "content": "One really needs to set their expectations right before diving into this so-called biopic of Stephen Hawking because The Theory of Everything isn't really an exploration of the various breakthroughs Hawking made throughout his career but is mainly about his relationship with his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. Remember that it is adapted from Jane's memoir & is told from her perspective, not Stephen's.The Theory of Everything tells the life story of Jane & Stephen Hawking who meet for the first time at a party in 1963 & there's an instant spark between the two. Their relationship blossoms but tragedy occurs when Hawking learns that he has motor neurone disease. Devastated by this diagnosis, he loses all hope but Jane gives him a reason to live for. The two eventually marry but Hawking's deteriorating health keeps testing their relationship.Directed by James Marsh, The Theory of Everything is a work of incredible warmth & affection as Marsh does a superb job with the given script & is painfully honest with its content. The script sidelines everything to focus entirely on the relationship dynamics. Cinematography provides a glossy layer to the whole picture, Editing keeps the narrative quite engaging for the majority of its runtime, and J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's score is very intimate, beautiful & heartwarming.Coming to the performances, Eddie Redmayne's illustration of the renowned theoretical physicist is extraordinary for the young actor is completely immersed in his physically challenging role & nails Hawking's mannerisms with breathtaking precision while Felicity Jones is equally committed in her role of Jane Wilde Hawking & her emotionally resonant performance is as impressive a highlight as Redmayne's jaw-dropping work. And its supporting cast does a fine job as well.Sure it feels a bit manipulative on certain instances, sure it conforms to the conventional clich\u00e9 that behind every successful man lies a great woman, sure it travels a route that doesn't involve much risks or bold decisions & sure it concludes on a rather lackluster note but the on-screen chemistry between Eddie Redmayne & Felicity Jones plus their performance is so magical, convincing & full of charm that it ultimately ends up brushing away most complaints.On an overall scale, The Theory of Everything may not be the Stephen Hawking biopic many might have been looking forward to but it nonetheless works as an awe-inspiring love story that offers an insightful peek into the personal life of an unusual couple. An endearing & entertaining piece of filmmaking that's technically polished & works magnificently on the strength of its two leads, The Theory of Everything is a delightful cinematic experience.",

            "content": "A heart wrenching tale that while beautiful is not what it should be. To say I have conflicting feelings about this movie would be an understatement.It is a good movie with brilliant acting. I still believe that Bradley Cooper deserved the Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role Oscar for his part as Chris Kyle in \"American Sniper\" but Eddie Redmayne performance as Stephan Hawking in this film is a close second in my book and I can understand how others would chose Redmayne over Cooper. Felitcity Jones as usual had a great performance with a great range of emotions. On the ten star scale I give it a seven. I do not regret watching it and I would recommend it to others and potentially watch it again. However, despite the positives I cannot help but think of the negatives.I have two major issues with this movie. One the color grading is horrendous. I believe it was intentional and is meant to be part of the visual story telling. Sadly, it fails at providing this as a story element. The color grading ends up just distracting from the film. Blown out shots, overly grainy scenes, unbalanced and unrealistic color pallets will take you out of the movie and remind you are looking at a screen. My second problem is the focus of the story. There was a clear lack of focus on the breakthrough science of Hawkings. It was more focused on the building and failing of his relationship with wife and eventual ex-wife Jane. This alters the film from a celebration of a man's genius to a focus of the betray and betraying that he experiences in his life. I do not believe this was the best use of the time. I wanted more science and less drama.But as I said before I don't regret watching it. You should try watching it yourself. My issues might not bother you like they did me.",

This was sad to see from all of the support she had given him but I guess she thought it was time.The only negative things about this inspiring film is the pacing and lack of science.

This could be forgiven if it also showed all of Stephen's highlights, but it significantly downplays his achievements by failing to convince the audience that his ideas were truly revolutionary.

I'm glad they didn't try and complicate things too much. Instead these theories are presented to us at a high school level so basically everyone can understand. But that's not the bulk of the story or why we went to the theaters. We went to see the beautiful and difficult relationship between Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane.Now it is based off of Jane's book about her life with Stephen before and after he was diagnosed with motor neuron disease. Sure the way they meet in the film is a bit clich\u00e9d but it didn't matter because of how great their chemistry was on screen. Felicity Jones was wonderful. I had only seen her in Spiderman before this so I had my doubts but her and Eddie Redmayne are close to locks for Oscars, even in this packed acting year. My favorite moments from the film involved them and just how effortlessly their chemistry seemed. It reminded me a lot of one of my all-time favorite films A Beautiful Mind in that sense. Living with someone with this disease and knowing the expected life span is not long had to be extremely difficult and Jones portrayed that perfectly. Redmayne gave us so many sides to his character without being able to do much was very impressive. He also had several emotional scenes with his family and friends that were just heartbreaking. They were beautifully mixed with Johann Johannsson score which will probably also get nominated come February.As much as I loved the relationship aspects of the film I wish we got a little more insight into just how much of a genius he was. We see him fight through this terrible disease but we don't see him fight previous theories or challenge the grain as much as I thought. We hear him talk about it briefly here and there but I cant say I remember each thing he accomplished. It did make me interested to read up on some of that going forward. It also made me appreciate Interstellar even more with some of his theories being implicated into the making of that film. So if you're a sucker for romance films you will love this story. In particular just how great the performances were. I'm sure you will hear about them come awards season.+Edmayne & Jones Oscar worthy +Johannsson's score +Chemistry among everyone -Not as much focus on his work 7.8/10",

Redmayne's Academy Award win is definitely deserved, it is almost impossible to believe when you watch him on screen that he is simply an actor, that he does not have ALS, he transforms completely in to Stephen Hawking and no one could have played this role any better. Filled with emotion and intense dialogue, the Theory of Everything is an absolutely outstanding film that I would recommend to all moviegoers. Follows the life and struggles of Stephen and Jane Hawking as they marry and raise children while the renowned physicist's Lou Gehrigs disease becomes increasingly worse. Best Performance: Eddie Redmayne",

            "content": "-The Theory Of Everything is the new biopic that follows Stephen Hawking from college through the beginning of his permanent disablement due to motor neuron disease. It focuses on his career, but most importantly, the relationship between he and his wife.-The film is a biopic, so it is limited with what they really could have done with it, but they did the best with what they could! -The story itself is focused very well. The characters are what makes the movie and they are very deep and full of emotion. It's not an easy movie.-I'll go ahead and talk about the thing I should as a Christian before I continue though. Stephen Hawking is an atheist. The subject is brought up a few times, seeing as he marries Jane, who belongs to the Church of England. However, 1. They really could not have avoided the topic. He's a physicist. 2. It doesn't seem biased that much. Sure it kinda does support the character, but it doesn't push an atheistic agenda or really say much against God. Actually one of the things I found interesting was that he starts out not believing in God because he thinks he can't believe in God, and then he does because his own theory demands that there is a God. He is asked about it in an interview and has trouble answering. I think it was probably a big conflict in his life at the time, and I liked seeing that! Back to the review! -The pace is good, but it's not a fast paced movie. It's just not boring.-The tone is pretty depressing because it's a man and his family dealing with a life-changing disease.-The acting is A+ work. Both leads will get Oscar nominations. They killed it, especially Eddie Redmayne as Hawking.-The music is beautiful Oscar stuff.-Content: It's PG-13 for the disease and its physical and emotional effects really. A few references and some mild language, but it's tough because of the condition.-So the Theory Of Everything is an excellently made and acted, emotional movie, with a theme that does make it hard to enjoy. I would still say that The Theory Of Everything is worth seeing, but it's in limited release, so I would totally buy it at full price. Strong 7.5/10.",

            "content": "The Theory of Everything is heartbreaking and inspiring story of Stephen Hawking told through his wife Jane's relationship with the intellectual.The Theory of Everything is the film adaptation of the biographical memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.The story of the life of Stephen Hawking, one of the most famous modern physicists told from his youth to adulthood through his discovery of love and relationship with Jane Wilde.To portray someone who is still living is a daunting and unnerving task. Eddie Redmayne takes on the insurmountable effort and immerses himself into the person both physically and emotionally transforming himself into the role of the real life world-renowned Stephen Hawking. Felicity Jones perhaps has the more difficult responsibility of portraying Jane Wilde, the famed theoretical physicist's paramour, wife and eventual caretaker. Jane Wilde, later Jane Wilde-Hawking, is a far less well known persona. Yet, Jones relies upon pure assured confidence in her character and is able to relay a compelling and engaging complementary counter-figure to audiences.Together Jones and Redmayne help to tell the dramatic true love story of Hawking and Wilde in The Theory of Everything. The beauty and magic of the film and story is primarily told when focusing on Hawking in the beginning, prior to the onset of symptoms from the neurodegenerative disease while at Cambridge. It is here that director James Marsh makes for some absolutely breathtakingly beautiful shots.Once the symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig's disease advances The Theory of Everything slowly changes focus through the eyes of Jane. Marsh's direction of this subtle and slow transition is marvelous with mildly distorted fishbowl effects through the point of view of Hawking. Marsh expertly captures the overwhelmingly frustrating, emotional, and detaching impact of the disease silently and effectively.Unfortunately as it becomes increasingly more difficult to understand Hawking as the disease progresses it also becomes harder to stay engaged with the film. And the story loses steam through the second act of The Theory of Everything.The Theory of Everything is an honest and un-exaggerated look at the real story of a man who has transformed how the world looks at science and the universe. Though as it can be said, behind every great man is a great woman, and audiences become privy to the seemingly untold story of the woman behind the man.For more full reviews of recent releases, please check out our WEBSITE.",

            "content": "2014 was a big year for ALS awareness. You got videos of the ice bucket challenge that went viral, and then you got movies like this, becoming a huge success. The Theory of Everything really showcase how ALS: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis AKA Lou Gehrig's disease really damage the body. It doesn't shy away. While the movie is depressing in that limelight. It's also show how uplifting and inspiring people are, when they face that problem. No matter how grave the diagnosis that the main character receives, he doesn't let it get in the way of what he wants to do with his life and work, thanks in large part to his support system. Directed by James Marsh, and adapted by Anthony McCarten. The movie is based on Stephen Hawking's ex-wife, Jane Wilde's second memoir, 'Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen', which focuses on the more positive sides of their relationship than the less flattering memoir, 'Music to Move the Stars'. That memoir provided part of the basis for the 2004 BBC TV movie Hawking starring Benedict Cumberbatch. The filmmakers behind The Theory of Everything felt best if they portray Hawking, in a better light. This might be good for the film, as it doesn't show, much of Hawking's dark side, but it can also be a fault, because it makes him seem least than human, and more saint-like. Anyways, the movie tells the story of Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his relationship with his wife, Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) over the years. The movie moves in very good pace. It opens up during their time studying at Cambridge in the 1960s, move to the struggle that Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde had to deal with ALS, and finally climax, with Stephen Hawking's biggest success in physics, when he release his book, 'A Brief History of Time' in the early 1990s. The first half is robotic, force, slow and clich\u00e9, but it's the second half that really makes the film, very interesting. It was very thought-provoking and one of the few movies that had a good objective love triangle. While, the movie plot is predictable, there were some scene that really did shock me that I didn't know, about the man. The acting from both Eddie Redmayne as Hawkings and his co-star, Felicity Jones as his wife were very good. In the wrong hands and the wrong actors, it could easily gone sour, with a cartoony approach to Hawking and unlikeable presence for his wife, Jane. Redmayne really got Hawking's mannerism down. It was very believable that he would transformation to what Hawking is today. Even, the real life Stephen Hawking love Redmayne's performance in this biopic based on his life. Like Hawking, Jane Wilde was amazed to see that Jones had incorporated her mannerisms and speech patterns into her performance. She was very impressed. The movie made the audience feel sympathy to what Jane was going through and it's sad, how apart, they became, over the years. The movie deals with rough topics from everything from marital discord, infidelity, and near-death experiences. The movie kinda digs into Hawking's studies, but it never truly goes into a huge detail discussion about it. I hardly remember anything say about black holes in this film. I believe the movie couldn't had work if they did. It's better off, for a documentary to tackle that subject, than a film like this. It would turn most people off, from the main story. The movie kinda downplays Hawking's strong atheist beliefs. The topic of God is only mention, a few time throughout the film, so that they can attract, both religionist and non-religion viewers. It kinda makes sense. Also, at the time, in which the settling of the film is set, Hawking still believe that the universe is governed by the laws of science, created by a God, but God does not intervene to break the laws, but as recent as 2011, he restate himself, that he believe no God, because there was no time before the big bang, and with no time, there cannot be a God. One of the best things about the film, is the music that covers it. The movie is very accuracy to Stephen Hawking's life, with only a few minor changes to his life. A good example is like how he found out that he was diagnosed with ALS. The real Stephen Hawking feel the movie is accurate enough to his life. The film still is met with mostly positive reviews and it will indeed go on to win a few awards in film festivals. Overall: An excellent film with an astonishingly good transformative lead performance. A must-watch.",

            "content": "It's surprising that it's taken such a long time for a high profile cinematic version of the life and times of famed author/scientist/mathematician Stephen Hawking to be made into a feature film and thankfully the end product is a very fine telling of an aspect of Hawking's life that many would've never even considered, that of his relationship with his once long serving wife Jane. Under the assured hands of Man on Wire documentarian turned feature director James Marsh, The Theory of Everything (based on Jane Hawking's autobiography) is a fine film without being a must see one.The recipient of 5 Oscar nominations it's not hard to see why Theory has been such a success with Academy voters. From the films well designed pallet, two fantastic lead turns with a career defining one from Eddie Redmayne as Hawking and with a lovely original score from Johann Johannsson, Theory screams quality in a productions sense yet can't quite overcome it's at basis nature the feeling of a TV movie of the week production. There is nothing overly grand on display here and those looking to get an insight into the mind of man far above normal intelligence despite his psychical inhibitions should look elsewhere, as while the works of Hawking play apart here the focus remains largely on the trials and tribulations of Stephen and Jane's marriage and the strain that was heaped upon them both in many aspects from the horrible onset of ALS.James Marsh succeeds greatly in his treatment of Hawking's dealings with this inhumane disease and not once does any situation that Hawking faces with his body failing feel over the top or played for pity votes and that is largely due also to the films constrained and respectful lead performances from two of the industry's most impressive young talents.In a role that has rightfully seen him nominated in most major award ceremonies around the world Redmayne is near unrecognisable as Hawking and displays a finely tuned acting power to be able to disappear into a man we are all so well accustomed to seeing, so much so that you begin to forget this is in fact not Hawking himself. In a less noticeable but no less powerful role Felicity Jones has gone on with the strength of acting shown in lesser known films and come full circle with a matured and naturalistic turn as Jane. Jane is the one we come out of the movie feeling most for and that is in no short way due to Jones's believable and commanding turn. Stephen and Jane's love story is one that can become quite awkward and at times utterly inspiring and these two performers nail it completely.The Theory of Everything is a very watchable and at times moving experience but perhaps its greatest failings is that it's a film we knew we were seeing before we had in fact seen it. Nothing much occurs here that we can't have predicted, situations play out like the rule book set before it and everything feels a little to \"nice\" in a way that surely can't have been the case in real life. A very interesting look into the life of a man we may never have thought of as one of us and with two great lead turns, this is a movie well worth your time but I'd suspect its appearance in this year's Oscars will be an unfruitful one despite its award worthy lead turns.3 and a half magazine subscriptions out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

Eddie Raymayn is so good pertaining the doctor, without overdoing it. The movie doesn't focus on his work, but rather his relationship with his wife and his family, in a human and realistic aspect. It is tempting to approach the subject as a very sensitive one, tiptoeing around the illness and the human nature, present everyone as superhuman rather than man with their own flaws. The meddling of science with the ordinary life is being presented with the beautiful scenes of family life or private moments, or simply showing the waves crashing. That gives an elegant touch to the heavy scientific field and to the human drama. All in all, a great movie.",

            "content": "The life of Stephen Hawking has always had the potential to lend itself to a theatrical feature. His work in the field of science and his tragic diagnosis with Motor Neuron Disease are two highly interesting aspects of his life that would translate effectively to the big screen. Finally, director James Marsh has decided to adapt Jane Wilde's memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, for his new film The Theory of Everything, a film whose release has garnered a huge amount of praise from critics and audiences alike. But contrary to the title, it doesn't really have everything. The film is a biographical drama focused on the relationship between Stephen Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde, a literature student he fell in love with at Cambridge Univiersity. It follows the pair from the 1960s onwards, following his diagnosis with Motor Neuron Disease, and the difficulties they encounter. Within the first half an hour, the film most definitely impresses. The writing seems to be on point, and the acting near-flawless. It genuinely seems as though it will be a gripping biopic. Hawking's diagnosis, the pivotal moment of the film, is presented as a horrific turning point; it doesn't shy away from presenting MND in a brutally raw fashion, relying heavily on excellent acting and cinematography to bluntly convey a harsh reality. It is a truly cathartic scene, painful to watch for all the right reasons. But then the film devolves into something of a feeble thing, diverting focus to Hawking's love life and how his immobility poses something of a difficulty. It's not bad as such, but it ultimately boils down to a depressing, unspectacular and rather ordinary romantic drama. Even so, the praise the film has received is at least partially deserved; for one thing, the acting is superb. If anybody is worthy of all the praise the film has received, it's Eddie Redmayne, who assumes the role of Hawking and captures his body language and subtle nuances perfectly. He is utterly convincing in the role, while Felicity Jones who plays Jane is also highly commendable. Put simply, the cast is perfect. All the same, however, I can't help but feel disappointed with the film. The acting is tremendous, yes, but the story itself feels a little drawn-out. There are moments in the film that seem quite slow and uninteresting, and its predominant focus on the romantic aspects of Hawking's life frankly become monotonous after a short while. Of course, being based on Jane Wilde's book about her life with Hawking, you'd naturally expect the film to maintain a romantic focus \u2013 it is a love story after all. The trouble is, this love story just isn't very interesting. Those expecting to see a gripping documentation of Hawking's life will more than likely be left disappointed. By about halfway through the movie, it becomes all about Jane, with little focus at all on Hawking's work in the field of science, which would probably have made for a more interesting film. Instead, the film's plot trudges along rather sluggishly, unfolding like a soap opera, belittling Hawking's efforts in favour of a clich\u00e9d and bland romantic drama. The fact that it is based on a true story merely makes the film out to be even more insulting, as Hawking's debilitating disease is conveyed as little more than an obstacle for the couple to overcome. On a more positive note, the character development of Hawking and Wilde is very good, and their relationship seems to build and develop at a natural pace. That said, nurse Elaine felt a little underdeveloped, making Hawking's decision to take her with him to America seem rather sudden. Of course, this lack of development makes sense, as the book itself is presented from Jane's perspective, but it doesn't make for an overwhelmingly satisfying filmic experience. In fact, it feels as though the film peters out by its conclusion. It maintains a positive, pseudo-inspirational tone, but one which is hardly uplifting enough for you to leave the cinema feeling as though you've seen something 'great'. Contrary to all the praise and accolades, it's not a masterpiece. It's just an ordinary film. Ultimately, it's difficult to summarise my thoughts on this movie. The praise the film has received is understandable, as the acting and cinematography is nothing less than amazing. Redmayne's Hawking is entirely convincing, and the harsh reality of his MND diagnosis is simultaneously conveyed in a beautiful and painful manner. But the film doesn't seem to know where its priorities lie; Marsh seems to disregard Hawking's disease in favour of a bland and forgettable romance. It might be a faithful adaptation of Wilde's memoir, but if you're looking for a gripping biopic on the life of Stephen Hawking, this isn't it.",

            "content": "The Theory of Everything is a terrible movie, which is a shame because it had the potential to be much better but due to poor directing, screenplay, acting (with one exception), and cinematography it falls way short.This movie takes absolutely no risks or chances. They could have shown Stephen Hawking and Jane trying to have sex despite his disability, and the resulting scene could have been both tragic and powerful if done correctly. But they don't attempt this. All sexual encounters in this movie are implied. Look, I don't go to movies to watch sex scenes, but would it have killed the director to try and show something a bit risqu\u00e9? Is Hollywood not ready to show a person with disabilities making love? They completely shy away from the basic humanistic aspects of their portrayal of Dr. Hawking and simply show the most formulaic of love story plots.The movie focuses almost exclusively on the \"love\" story between Jane and Stephen Hawking. However, the two main actors Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones have very little on-screen chemistry and the entire fabrication of their cinema relationship is artificial to the core. Regarding the overall acting, a special mention needs to be said about Felicity Jones' poor acting skills in this movie. She seems to handle most scenes with a cheeky, almost irritated delivery of her lines as if everything about being with Stephen Hawking seems to bother her. She never seems to show happiness at all in the movie (or any emotions, really). However, Eddie Redmayne's acting is significantly better. He's able to convey a decent amount of emotion sometimes without saying anything and using only facial expressions. I think that takes a lot of skill and that is the main reason why I don't give this movie a 1/10. However, the poor screenplay and scriptwriting leaves Redmayne with very little to work with other than mimicking Stephen Hawking. This is a shame because a better script could have flexed his acting muscles to portray some more raw emotion such as anger and frustration over his disability.As for the directing, the movie shows the steady degeneration of Stephen Hawking as he goes from a normal young man to someone with severe disabilities, yet many scenes appeared to be shot out of order because sometimes his condition seems to have suddenly improved versus the scene before. For example, in one scene he is hardly able to talk without a lot of difficulty and slurring of his speech, but in the next he speaks to his father at an almost normal pace. To me, this inconsistency demonstrates poor directing and/or editing. Also, there is a very strange progression of time in this movie. His kids seem almost born out of nothing. Another scene, another baby. Speaking of his kids, they seem to be absent from a vast majority of scenes and play almost no role in the movie. I understand the movie his not about their kids, but would it have killed them to put in even a single line that shows how they feel about having a father like Stephen Hawking?The cinematography is truly basic, especially for a movie nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award (thankfully not nominated for best cinematography.) The camera work is very uninspired and boring and mostly sticks to showing the characters in each scene. Very little thought is put into framing or lighting with very basic themes like \"bright morning scenes for happy moments\" and \"dark evening scenes for sad moments\". How very boring. There are only two good moments of cinematography in the entire film which last about 10 and 5 seconds respectively, and that is pretty sad for a 2 hour movie.Finally, one of my biggest gripes with the movie was how it dealt with the aspect of Stephen Hawking being an atheist. The script seemed to antagonize this fact, making it appear that Stephen's atheistic views were wrong and his wife's views were virtuous. I'm sorry, but please refrain from injecting your own religious biases into a film. There are already enough Christian-centric movies coming out of Hollywood each year, we don't need another one tooting God's horn.Overall 2/10 simply for the quality of Eddie Redmayne's portrayal and nothing else.",

            "content": "This is a very beautiful film that shows love, dedication and commitment. To fall in love so fast and be faithful so long \u2013 till death them parts \u2013 is a fairy tale, an untellable story and the film tries to tell it. Doctors when they are confronted to a disease they do not know or understand are ready to tell you will die within two years. This film, this Stephen Hawking is the most brilliant proof that doctors' predictions, and alas sometimes their prescriptions, are useless and nonsensical. They can just not admit they do not know. Stephen Hawking is also the proof that your body can become completely obsolete, nonreactive, dilapidated and yet your mind may keep all its power, and the first power man's mind has is to be able to choose between ending the suffering of the body before intended by nature or using his mind to its full potential till the end of time, till the natural end of his time.As for the famous theory of the black holes, of the limitless universe in space and time, and of the big bang that starts from something that is not considered as being the beginning, which is obvious since it existed before the big bang otherwise there would not have been a big bang, I will not here discuss the few details I could discuss. For example that time is a human invention and that nature only contains duration. This is so true that we still have not been able to configure some time counting machine that would come to the perfect dimension of a second, minute, hour, day, month, year that would enable us to skip the leap years and other silly little corrections like that. The fake debate about God or no God is just what it is a fake debate. If the universe is limitless it has no beginning point, hence it has no creator. If there is a creator somewhere we can always wonder the way Buddha used to wonder: but who in the cosmos created that God, and that opens a door that leads to so many other doors that there is no logic along that line. The myth that you can find the perfect mathematical equation that will demonstrate the big bang theory is what it is a myth that cannot anyway evade the fact that if the big bang and the universe can be described by mathematical formulas, then it is obvious this universe is logical, is rational. Can anything rational exist all by itself outside the brain of a sentient and rational being? And that cannot be man since man is so young in this universe. We can always say it is the result of the architecture of the universe and that architecture cannot stand one minute if it does not respect some balancing elements, etc. And you see the result. My grandmother is turning over and over in her tomb and she is losing her last teeth because she is chattering with fear, she is shattered by fear. I can very precisely explain the origin and the phylogeny of human language that started somewhere around 250,000 years ago because it is the product of a very clearly definable situation, but to look for an origin of the universe which implies the universe is not limitless, or to accept the idea that the universe is limitless which implies always is not quantifiable and forever really means forever, does not answer the question about where all that comes from. Luckily the film avoided that level of theory and concentrated on the human side of this heroic suffering and brilliant inventiveness, though, after one rebuffing session with scientists that sees several men of science leaving the room in furor and anger before some Soviet scientist turned the wind around, it does not even hint at the fact there might be some serious objection against that theory because it is nothing but a theory, hence a model constructed by the mind of a man, the minds of a few men. Hence something that has to be taken as what it is: only a human representation of what man understands about the universe at one moment in time, one moment in man's history, and man's history is the basis of man's time. Of course no one expects a film to give us the final truth about what we do not even know how to imagine.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",

Every film has been clever or funny or informative, but 'The Theory of Everything' is all of the above and more. The love story in the centre of it all is the truly captivating part brought to light by two exquisite leading performances and a flawlessly written script.Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones have been nominated for Academy Awards for their performances. Redmayne has undoubtedly delivered the best performance of the year. He is absolutely mesmerising in every scene, to the point where you occasionally have to remind yourself you're not watching actual footage of the real Stephen Hawking. His only real competition for the award is coming from Michael Keaton in 'Boyhood'. Keaton was good there's no doubt about it, but his is more a case of \"what a great story it would be if he won\", whereas Redmayne deserves the award for simply acting his butt off.Jones is also very good in her performance. She's an integral part of making the love story believable and one you want to root for, while always understanding just how hard it would be. I had never actually seen Jones act in a film before this one. Her nomination is richly deserving and while I'm afraid she'll struggle to upset Julianne Moore and actually win the award, she will be given the chance again in the future I'm almost certain, based on the performance I just watched.A lot of the hate this film is receiving seems to be from people who aren't too fond of atheism. It's incredibly disappointing that these people can't simply put their views aside and judge a film for what it is. The other criticism I have seen brought up once or twice is that the film is too formulaic or \"Oscar bait\". I don't understand this at all. I would absolutely 100% of the time prefer a film that was moving and beautiful whilst being told in a conventional way, than a film that makes every effort to be as different from the pack as possible but never actually affects its audience or makes any valid points. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a prime example of the latter for me.'The Theory of Everything' is the exact reason I take the time to watch all of the Oscar nominees every year. I always stumble across a film that I would never have taken he time to watch otherwise and end up absolutely loving it. I really wasn't excited going into the theatre at all, expecting this to be one of the nominees I would least enjoy, so I was thrilled to be blown away by it. The acting is mind-blowing, the script is perfectly written and the direction is sound. What more could you ask for?",

            "content": "The stories of great people, particularly the great thinkers, have been source material for a number of acclaimed and awarded biopics, a sub-genre that has evolved a lot in the last decade. You can tell just by comparing two of 2014's best, each focused on one of the greatest British minds of the 20th century. There's \"The Imitation Game,\" the suspenseful, \"critical moment in the life of\" take on the life of mathematician and computer grandfather Alan Turing, and then \"The Theory of Everything,\" an emotional romance taking the \"snippets in the chronological life of\" approach to theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking.Taken from Jane Hawking's memoir, it makes sense why \"The Theory of Everything\" tells us more about her and Stephen's relationship than it does about Stephen's work. For those interested more in the science of Stephen's life and work, it's a film that will disappoint on some level; director James Marsh and writer Anthony McCarten are far more interested in the philosophy and ideology that influenced Stephen's way of thinking, and how Jane influenced him as well.\"The Theory of Everything\" is also a chronicle of a crippling disease. We meet Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) at Cambridge, where he meets and falls in love with Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) and shortly thereafter learns he's suffering from ALS, a fatal disease. Stricken with depression, he tries to distance himself from Jane, but she insists on staying by his side. We slowly watch Stephen lose the ability to move parts of his body until he becomes wheelchair bound and can no longer speak. Yet miraculously the disease never claims his life, and never affects his mind, even if it does take a heavy toll on his family.Redmayne certainly deserves all the praise in the world for being able to honestly and authentically portray the evolving disabilities, but his performance is so much more than such surface-level awards-bait fodder. Redmayne's true accomplishment is how he lets Stephen's personality grow and shine through despite of the physical limitations. Through eye contact and facial expressions, he paints something special despite the clear restrictions of his brush. Stephen's spirit really shows, and it adds to what's already an emotional film.Yet Stephen is not the sole focal point of this movie. Jane is very much his equal, and in many ways, the film is really about her, a woman's struggle to be the caretaker she set out to be, what it is like to feed and clothe and literally care for an internationally famous person incapable of doing those basic things for himself. She is a complex character, both strong and weak, shoving aside expectations of how she should or shouldn't behave or think at every opportunity. A young-faced 30-year-old, Jones is trusted to convey age and maturity as the film goes on (the makeup doesn't really get the job done), and she does in a way most actresses her age simply have yet to demonstrate in their careers. Marsh and the film's casting director, Nina Gold, deserve a whopping commendation for trusting in such young talent to convey these people at such mature stages of their relationship. Most films would've gone with older veterans knowing they could get away with them playing Stephen and Jane in their 20s and that later in the film they would fit naturally. Instead, they got two lesser-known but rising stars who have long careers ahead of them and could still probably fill these roles 15 years from now.\"The Theory of Everything\" only lacks in compelling drama. It's a portrait of two people and the ups and downs of their relationship, making it a much more indie take on the life of a famous person rather than the Hollywood prestige biopic route that won \"A Beautiful Mind\" the Best Picture Oscar. More concisely, it will move audiences far more than it will entertain them, which for the biographical genre, is actually refreshing.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more!",

Instead, concentrating, on his former wife Jane Hawking's book: Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.The movie opens at a party, where Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who's a friend of his sister They strike up a conversation and find a real connection, so much so that Jane, scribbles down her number on a sheet of paper and hands it to Hawking before leaving. His relationship with Jane blossoms and they soon begin to spend more and more time together. However, he soon begins to find that simple tasks are becoming difficult and following an accident, tests confirm that he has motor neurone disease. He subsequently shuts himself away, as the condition begins to take hold and spends most of his time alone, that is until Jane begins to talk him round.The Theory of Everything is a beautiful peace of movie making, with Redmayne's performance quite outstanding.

Based on Jane Wilde Hawking's autobiography The Theory of Everything looks at relationship between Stephen and Jane (Felicity Jones) as they fall in love and deal with Professor Hawking's motor neuron disease, looking at the physical decline and the struggles Jane has to go through caring for him and the family. Those wanting or expecting a look at Professor Hawking's scientific work will be disappointed as it is only glanced at: if you want the film about Hawking's science then I recommend watching the excellent BBC TV film Hawking starring Benedict Cumberbatch.Redmayne is transformative in his role as Stephen Hawking, being brilliant at showing Hawking's disability taking over, from small things like struggling to run to being unable to speak. He had excellent chemistry with his co-star. Jones as Jane does have a sizeable role, having to help with husband academically and physically and develops a relationship Jonathan Jones (Charlie Cox).James Marsh's direction is solid making sure their decent pace and provides some interesting visuals thanks to Beno\u00eet Delhomme's old- fashioned cinematography. But Anthony McCarten's screenplay has a very episodic quality, looking at small moments of Hawking's life, such as Hawking's university days before his diagnosis, dealing with his diagnosis, early scientific breakthroughs, etc.... The scientific revelations shown to be eureka moments.The film is very reminiscence of A Beautiful Mind, looking at the personal life and struggle of a scientific/mathematics genius, having a look at his relationship and how they have to deal with adversity.7.5/10",

Yeah... Luckily, the films are different, the one in question is more focused on relation(ship)s, feelings, different kind of love (for people, science, history, etc.) - all events and scenes are subject to them. The plot is smooth, the tune warmhearted, but - unlike in Hawking - there is less attention on Hawking's intellectual inheritance, and some moments related to other people I had to review later from Wikipedia. Cinematography and music score are splendid as well, but the real gem is Redmayne: so distinct, I have to admit, and \"better\" than Cumberbatch due to far bigger likeness with real Hawking, above all. I was not so enraptured by Felicity Jones, well, she was really good, but so were all others in supporting roles. Anyway, I am sure that The Theory of Everything will be rewarded with multiple Academy Awards.

He fully and completely inhabits every aspect of the character, with not a trace of his original self evident at any stage. With minimal help from the makeup department, he perfectly metamorphoses into the famously twisted shape of Hawkins, and the resemblance is uncanny. His facial ticks and mannerisms are also spot-on, and he perfectly captures the wicked twinkle in Hawkins' eyes; the eyes of a brilliant man who despite being trapped in a useless body never lost his fine sense of humour.And although Redmayne's performance is one of the greatest displays of acting skill you could hope to see, it does not eclipse the quality of the film itself, which is beautiful, touching, fascinating, funny, heart-warming, and life-affirming. It would be very hard indeed to find a better all-round piece of cinema.

Btw, is the 'Universal' logo getting even more impressive in recent years?'The Theory of Everything', 12A, 123mins, is a film about the life of the renowned scientist Dr Stephen Hawking, played by Eddie Redmayne, and his wife Jane Hawking, played by Felicity Jones. Both stars give superb performances. Mr Redmayne has rightly just won an award for his role.The film, based on the book by Jane Hawking, focuses on the relationship of the couple. They meet at university but their relationship is quickly dominated by Dr Hawking's illness and physical decline.The early university scenes authentically capture the period. The later scenes of illness brutally capture that reality too. The resilience of the human spirit over adversity is a major theme.This film is a good companion piece to the other recent 'genius' film, 'The Imitation Game', starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Alan Turing, the breaker of the Enigma code, and the father of computers. Mr Redmayne beat Mr Cumberbatch to an award. Both acted well, however the character of Dr Hawking is a much more human and warm character, than that of the colder, less human, and less sympathetic Dr Turing.'The Theory of Everything' also beats 'The Imitation Game' in one important respect, namely that 'Theory' is almost completely chronological, whereas 'Imitation' moves back and forth in a very disjointed way. 'Imitation' would have been so much better set out chronologically. 'Theory' Director James Marsh, however, is not slavishly devoted to chronology. Time is a central part of the film, and the science in the film, and Director Marsh cleverly tweaks his chronology for this reason.The science in 'Theory', like in 'Imitation', is dealt with in a way that is simply explained, and easily followed. Fans of 'The Big Bang Theory' know that the science never gets in the way of the story, and this is true also of 'The Theory' film. 'Big Bang' fans also know that intellectual struggle can easily be portrayed by holding a piece of chalk in front of a black-board. So too in this film. Incidentally, Dr Stephen Hawking, in real-life, has made several guest-appearances on 'Big Bang', playing himself.Simon McBurney, in a small part, gives good support.While this film is about a scientist, science does not dominate the film. As the film is about a man who suffered problems with his mobility and his physical condition, from an early age, it is necessarily a slow film.In this film we learn a little bit about our universe and Dr Hawking's contribution to our understanding of it. We learn also about the man, and his wife. We learn too about life and love.In essence this is a story about love. 10/10.",

Taking into account that this is based on Jane's memoirs, it makes sense that more of the emphasis is placed on Hawking's domestic life rather than his accomplishments in the field of science; film's structure deprives it of some expected conflicts, and thus the emotional impact that comes hand in hand with said conflicts, yet it's still riveting thanks to a remarkable, eerily transformative performance from Redmayne (who earned a well-deserved Oscar) capturing the essence of Hawking with tremendous authenticity, and it's also a great showing for Jones as a strong woman who \"does her best\" even in the most difficult of times.

OK, so I am no Dr. Stephen Hawking, but I can write a cheesy pun review on a movie about him. \"The Theory of Everything\" is an emotional movie about the life of Dr. Stephen Hawking, the renowned physicist who presented theoretical predictions including the one that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. Hawking also achieved success with works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his \"Brief History of Time\" stayed on the British Sunday Times best-sellers list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. While my \"Not so Brief History of Puns\" was not even published! Anyways, what made this so courageous and commendable, is that Hawking was able to accomplish all these great feats living with the debilitating ALS disease. All of this is depicted in \"The Theory of Everything\", but Director James Marsh decided to march to the beat of a different drum by highlighting Hawking's longtime relationship with his first wife Jane Hawking. So, \"The Theory of Everything\" is mostly a love story about overcoming insurmountable odds and having profound resiliency to produce a marriage and a family. Stephen had three kids with Jane. There was hardly any Marsh Madness in the direction of the picture, so I give a passing grade to the film's orchestration. I thought that Anthony McCarten's screenplay was a tad weak; and it might have been the film's only minor drawback. However, the greatest force of \"The Theory of Everything\" was the powerful performances from Eddie Redmayne as Stephen and Felicity Jones as Jane; my theory is that they will be both get nominated for Oscars, and yes I did not kill any brain cells figuring that one out. So drop everything, I mean everything, and discover \"The Theory of Everything\". **** Good",

            "content": "Spoilers...if you don't know history.From the opening minutes of a bunch of annoying brainiacs in a prestigious college trying to pick up girls through scripted banter, I could not stop comparing this film with A Beautiful Mind. Both are sanitized biopics about troubled ivy league geniuses, both feature degenerating male leads and sympathetic female ones, both feature the same annoyingly-warm lighting, the same clich\u00e9d, harmless script, and the same overcompensating, bravado performances.The Theory of Everything tells the story of Stephen Hawking, an ambitious physicist struggling to keep a normal family life and a fertile professional career amidst his crippling motor neuron disease which eventually leaves him almost entirely paralyzed. The script sidesteps many of Hawking's most important ideas and instead focuses on his relationship with his wife Jane and the drama that inevitably ensues in a marriage strained by illness. I knew the film would go the soapy route but I didn't know to what extent. For a man with so many brilliant hypotheses, The Theory of Everything only scratches the surface and leaves the audience with a made-for-TV quality script with an unearned sense of grandiosity. Thank god for these performances! A part like Stephen Hawking is pure gold for any brave actor willing to take on the challenge, and Eddie Redmayne did the best possible job with the given material. His body movements (or lack thereof) and speech patterns are highly realistic for a man with Hawking's condition. In the second half, he becomes a silent actor and contorts his face like a seasoned pro, gathering more sympathy through facial gestures than words. Felicity Jones as Jane manages to keep up with Redmayne and cultivates quite a nice chemistry with him that endures through the hardest of times. Jonathan Jones, Jane's second husband, is probably the most charming character in the entire film, and Charlie Cox's performance is undeniably delightful. Visually, James Marsh created an admirable film with a few flashes of whimsy and creativity (excellent eye/black hole match cut and a wonderfully edited montage near the end). The score by Beno\u00eet Delhomme is predictably opulent, quaint yet overly dramatic. The Theory of Everything takes an enthralling true life story and diminishes it in the way most lives are when condensed into two hours of pure Oscar bait. Still, the story never veers into unwatchable territory and the acting talent on display is reason enough to see it.",

We all know how this movie ends, after all, Hawking is still alive today. His journey, however, holds many surprising twists and turns which give one an even greater appreciation for this great man and his incredulous story. Eddie Redmayne (Hawking) will surely get an Oscar nomination, and if he wins, it would be well-deserved. He was magnificent; you never felt as though he was acting which made his performance utterly heartbreaking. Felicity Jones, as his wife, Jane Wilde, was also superb. If the actual Jane was anything like the one Jones portrayed, then Ms. Wilde deserves the title \"Saint.\" This film certainly gives a wikipedia type summary of Hawking's life, and there are some moments of slowness in the film (hence an 8 out of 10), but the message of this film is 10+. What resonates the most is the theme of the movie, which for me, is that living a life filled with hope and positivity takes courage, sometimes to heroic heights. Perhaps Hawking's genius goes even beyond his aptitude in science, but rather lies in his attitude toward life. The manner in which he's lived and continues to live sums up the Theory of absolutely Everything.",

            "content": "It would be lovely to have A Theory of Everything, a lovely tuning in equation that can explain and predict the movement of celestial and atomic bodies in a vacuum (if there is such) of space. Anyone even vaguely interested in science would discard such thought- science and a theory that explains everything- all the factors that seem to contradict each other and are impossible to replicate- in a field that over a span of month new theory can resurface and rewrite our current knowledge. That what makes most of scientists bonkers, it is impossible to ever be right, and this statement is underlining (because at some aspects right can be right no matter what). And now it became abstractly confusing and I am not sure what I am- review- yes- I was supposed to review, not, em, confuse with random ideological thesis. I can securely state that over a good percentage of the globe is capable of recognizing name Stephen Hawking, or image of the crippled, old man with computer on a wheelchair. No wonder, this is now the name we use to describe genius. Even when many quoting Einstein or Hawking cannot place finger on the exact thing those figures have discovered. It has, after all, little to do with us- in other words- causing Apple to fall on the ground is not a form of demonstration. It requires abstract thinking, something that our mind does not need. Hawking a publisher of worldwide bestseller A Brief History of Time: From Big Bang to Black Holes, like title suggests is a quite brief historical account that explains notion of space/time, and it begins with explosion of arguably nothing that caused creation of everything and is possibly going to end in a bing crunch. Don't worry, you have millennium of time- you may think that going down to the groceries is a lot, but that's just peanuts to space. Oh- Ah- I should be reviewing a movie. Yes, this high scorer in categories varying from acting to music, is a second critically acclaimed biopic of a revolutionary Cambridge graduate. Now, I preferred the previous one, here meaning The Imitation Game. Even when from a personal point of view I prefer Hawking over Turing, that arrogant sense of humor, I am to judge movie not person. Recorded in an unorthodox way, with extreme close ups and vintage coloring board. Playing with light and not bothering to polish the inequalities- the camera work was unique- and kept me distracted from the narrative. Which is not a thing camera work should do. Yet I loved the time lapses and reverse edit at the end, and one shot that made me feel Hawkings frustration over the table. Score, much like in most of biopics was this idyllic combination of calm piano notes. The acting, although the supporting cast was passable and widely ranged, all the focus goes to young Eddie Redmeye- who throughout the movie feels like authentic Stephen Hawking- and shows a wide palette of talent, when tacking the scientist during different stages of the illness. I did have no problems with pacing, but at times the story seemed to drag. I did not really feel sympathetic to the characters, not surely why, I cannot place my finger on it (much like on a single electron). I disliked Jane, maybe she was supposed to be like this, but the movie did not keep me interested to see how her fate would unfold. I didn't feel like being part of the event, not sure if I am the observer, or if i am to step into shoes (or wheels) of the man. Cinematographically, a waste of potential- so much more could be done to show the anger and confusion and struggle, also, there was a chance of graphically explaining the abstract theories, which I was waiting for, quite blankly. There was no \"wow\" moment in which the plot, camera and music come into a wonderful crescendo and unison and your mind goes \"this is it\". Concluding, it is a good, insightful watch. With great, ambitious lead and interesting presentation, which unfortunately also brings movie to a \"uncomfortable\" style of narrative, that instead adding to fluidity slows it down. A good watch, but not a must see- recommendation.

The acting is truly superb. Eddie Redmayne nails the role of Stephen Hawking and portrays the disabling affects of ALS really well. Felicity Jones defines what true love means as Jane Hawking and depicts the struggles she faced throughout the course of her life with Stephen.I think it might have been nice to see a little bit more from Jane's side, especially since this movie is based on her book.However, overall, the movie itself is a touching and inspirational tale. It begins with Stephen Hawking as a college student and how his life with Jane unfolds after his diagnosis. It does have some suggestive material that might not be best for younger kids and frankly they might think the movie is slow or boring unless they're super interested in science.I was disappointed by the fact that the movie didn't really seem to explain why the marriage between Stephen and Jane Hawking fell apart. Jane does develope feelings for another man, but she remains loyal and faithful to her husband despite all of the hardships.It ends shortly after his book \"A Brief History of Time\" was published and gained international fame. It's kind of strange and unsatisfactory in a way, but also poignant at the same time; leaving questions much like Stephen Hawking had prior to his death. It definitely would prompt some viewers with an appetite to learn more about Stephen Hawking. Which I believe is a good thing.Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. It was thought-provoking and a testament to what one can accomplish. As long as there is life there is hope.",

            "content": "This uplifting Stephen Hawking biopic is well worth seeing. The basic outlines of the story are well known. In his student days at Cambridge, Hawking developed a neuromotor disease that affects the body, not the brain, and was given two years to live. Such a diagnosis would end the ambitions of most people, but he survived to become preeminent in the fields of theoretical physics and cosmology with numerous British and international honors, including a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian honor.Hawking also has tried to make the complexities of the physical sciences accessible for non-scientists, and his book, A Brief History of Time, has sold more than 10 million copies. I have the Illustrated edition, and I've read it, picture captions and all. (So, I actually know what the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is: let's see, you can know the speed of an object or its location, but you cannot know both at the same time. Please, no questions.) Eddie Redmayne is superlative as Hawking, and Felicity Jones convincing as his devoted first wife, Jane. The film avoids the typical mawkishness traps, in large part because, as Rene Rodriguez says in the Miami Herald, \"Redmayne keeps you focused on the soul of a man trapped inside a malfunctioning body.\" The supporting cast is singularly excellent too.The movie is based on a book written by Jane, whom Hawking met at Cambridge shortly before the neurological problems began to surface. The couple have three children, and he is portrayed as a loving father. It ends some 25 years later, in the late 1980s.There's only a smattering of science and mathematics in the movie; in general, it's about coping against greater odds than a person might be expected to overcome. The movie suggests, not unreasonably, that Jane's determination was a significant factor in keeping him alive. Not just surviving, thriving.",

            "content": "Jane : What are you ? Stephen : I'm a cosmologist Jane : What's that ?Stephen : It's a kind of religion for intelligent atheists.I must admit that I've seen this film a few weeks ago. Probably the fact that Eddie Redmayne was nominated for an Oscar, prompted me to see if he was a worthy contender for the coveted golden statuette. And the only thing I can say is that he totally deserved to win with his magnificent performance. I love to watch a biographical movie now and then. The only drawback is that I'm always a little bit disappointed about the subject covered in such a biopic and that the emphasis lies on something I wasn't looking for. In \"jOBS\" I missed the philosophy this visionary had about the Apple phenomenon and the development of the applied interface (which is currently perfectly normal for everybody). The clash between Jobs and Gates was cited as a fait divers, whereas that interested me. Also in \"The Theory of Everything\" the focus was on other facets of Hawking's life. What applies to both these films is the fact that the protagonists physically look an awful lot like the corresponding character. It's creepy to see how they both manage not only to capture the emotional part, but also to match the characteristics and physical traits of these famous people. \"The Imitation Game\" is obviously also a biopic which, however, had a more adventurous twist rather than being a purely biographical sketch.You must admit that the performance of Eddie Redmayne is simply magnificent. Both excerpts from the college years, where he's still healthy,lively and the way he finishes his studies in a nonchalant manner, as the portrayal of a genius who's struck by a muscle disease, are brilliant and striking. A series of events wonderfully visualized using a variety of intense colors at certain times. The university professor who looks surprised at the solutions scribbled on the back of a timetable (10 math assignments which are almost impossible to solve I suppose, of which Stephen could ONLY solve 9). A family dinner Jane was invited to and where you already can get a sense of the intellectual atmosphere. The contradictions between Jane and Stephen when it's about religion. Hawking who excludes everyone after hearing the terrible verdict and the determination of Jane. These fragments stayed with me and made it a fascinating film. Which theories the brilliant mind of Hawking produced in that cripple body, isn't explained in detail. Here and there black holes, big bangs and the concept of time is mentioned, but eventually I was wondering what exactly Stephen Hawking's ultimate contribution was to mankind. What Jobs achieved you can discover in any computer shop. And from Turing we know that he has broken the Enigma code. But what abstract evidence Hawking delivered, wasn't clear to me. From one moment to the other he's a celebrity and a much sought-after guest speaker. That a woman who lives together with a paralyzed person can't really enjoy a thrilling,romantic life and that she's actually the person who's responsible for all practical matters in a marriage, is of course obvious. And that's the central theme of this biopic: a loving relationship slowly falling apart because of a fatal disease, the awareness of limitations and the danger to seek solace in someone else's arms. So it's mainly a biopic about the wife of Hawking, instead of about Hawking himself. An insight into the life of mathematical genius, who could explain the mystery of the origin of the universe by using his phenomenal intellectual brain, is thus transformed into an ordinary dime novel about an unhappy woman who feels abandoned by her ever loving husband. And that's something I wasn't waiting for.Despite the romantic approach, I think it's an admirable film. The situation Hawking is facing during his life, ensured that other qualities came up : humor and willpower. These two qualities are subtly incorporated into this film. Even the choice Hawking made at an older age about his marriage, took me by surprise (actually it wasn't much I knew about the life of Hawking). Once again this proves that he sees himself as a normal functioning man. \"The Theory of Everything\" is a beautiful film that actually moved me and should serve as an example to show what one can achieve with the right attitude and a big portion of perseverance.More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",

            "content": "Herb Blank Head, Business Development and Managing Director, ESG Solutions Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are nothing short of remarkable in the Theory of Everything. The supporting cast, cinematographic innovations, and costuming were all excellent. I learned a lot and recommend it fairly highly. However, the tedious piano score, relentless throughout, really started alternatively putting me to sleep and getting on my nerves. I know many of today's young filmmakers and critics have a disdain for overly dramatic scores. I don't personally but either way - this was truly the other extreme! The only other nit I'll pick I recognize as representative of the fact that I am from a prior generation. I found the dialog overly spartan and a lot of story blanks deliberately unexplained. To me and I daresay others from my generation, this creates distance and makes personal emotional involvement difficult. That said, I am aware enough of both the subject matter and today's artistic and industry standards to believe that was exactly what James Marsh had in mind. I've often heard today's highly regarded filmmakers and \"experts\" express disdain for verbal storytelling insisting that really talented directors should emphasize imagery and the visuality of the medium over story exposition. For those people in the reviews I've read, the DIrector didn't go far enough in that direction so I should be grateful - and I am. There also is a marvelous scene where Jane tells her mother (who inadvertently starts the new Chapter in Jane's life with the choirmaster) that \"She's never heard anything so English in her life.\" So indeed, the lack of outward emotion expressed on film and the economic and sterile dialog is quite illustrative of a very English family background and Cambridge-educated gentry. It also is consistent with the recurrent subtext of the film contrasting Jane's C-of-E morality and natural proclivity toward adherence to standards of decorum with Hawking's personal immaturity (dictated by circumstances), unconventionality and unrepentant atheism. So the understatement is quite appropriate especially from Jane's lens which is how we get to view most of what unfolds. In short, I have to recognize that James Marsh did a superb job of conveying in cinema the subtext of the film. So, I conclude that most of IMDb will appreciate what I found detracted just a bit from my personal enjoyment. But that's quite trivial overall. I enjoyed the movie and think most will as well.",

            "content": "The Theory of Everything is a 2014 British biopic romantic drama film directed by James Marsh, written by Anthony McCarten and was inspired by the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen by Jane Wilde Hawking. It stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones with Charlie Cox, Emily Watson, Simon McBurney, and David Thewlis featured in supporting roles. The Theory of Everything might seem a formulaic biopic for most, the type of film that is released by the end of every year to garner significant buzz coming this awards season. And now they featured a phenomenal scientist, Stephen Hawking,(Oscar buzz!), and his supportive wife, Jane Hawking, (More Oscar buzz!). But this isn't a sole biopic that shoves down our throats the fascinating-but-esoteric theories of this well-known scientist, but it's a restrained love story about Jane and Stephen overcoming their adversities as a couple, as Stephen heartbreakingly shatters with his disease. It almost serves as a character study, looking how well-directed, written, and acted the characters are, principally the two leads.Bolstered by an adroit, subdued direction from Marsh--from the ravishing, finely-tuned score and cinematography to sensitive care with each characters--and adept, profound writing from McCarten, who dived into the characters and layered them with unfeigned emotions. The supporting cast also did a great job, specifically Charlie Cox in a sympathetic role.But the real winning turns are Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, who gave contrasting flairs but still found common emotional footing. Redmayne is a revelation in his role, as he strips down into his immaculate form. A performance that could leave a mark in our hearts and in the history of cinema, a monumental transformation, he captured Stephen Hawking not only physically but his whole soul--he is the film's emotional core. Equally stellar is Jones, who in a less showy role, proves her full acting capabilities that once has been shown in \"Like Crazy\". If his co-star is the core, then she is the emotional spine. Without her, Stephen will fall, the whole film will shatter into pieces, I honestly believe that she is even more essential than his co-star. A subtle, transcendent work that shows a different side of a \"supportive wife\", facing the truth of being a human--we all have our limits--and she did that with deep ardency and valor even if the love wasn't genuine anymore.All these fundamental elements mashed together and formed something that is incandescent. The Theory of Everything doesn't seek for an answer on how the universe came to place, nor it pound by pound follows disease-driven dramas. But it's a story about love that was once genuine vanished in the air like tiny particles--it's utterly heart-piercing and vehement. As the final scene rolls, you will be eviscerated with tears.",

Tough to say if this is superior to The Imitation Game or Birdman, but it is easy to say that Eddie Redmayne's stunning portrayal of renowned scientist, Stephen Hawking is superior to all performances this year.Most people know who Stephen Hawking is. For those that don't, he is a crippled English physics professor who uses a computer to talk and who has come up with very insightful scientific theories. The Theory of Everything chronicles his life from his humble days figuring out science at Cambridge to his battle with the life threatening ALS/Lou Gherig disease. As far as I know, this movie is about as accurate as can be. Every biopic either adds to or bends the truth for dramatic purposes. This must be no different. It must reflect Hawking's life enough to be informative, yet different for entertainment's sake. I don't care how much is accurate, I loved this movie for what it was.I have not seen many reviews for The Theory of Everything yet. I have a hunch that the biggest pokes will be not enough look into his science work and too much focus on his love and life. Personally, I found the home and science aspects to be perfectly balanced. The Theory of Everything isn't a science class! Judging from the rating on this site being lower than other great movies of this year, I feel that my guess is right. But I still found it to be the best. Not much better than the others, but close. I have a bit of a soft spot for acting; many movies I have said to be the best of a year are just because of strong acting. This is one of those examples. If the acting portion of a movie is extremely strong, it outweighs all other aspects that make a great movie. Eddie Redmayne's performance is the best of the year and one of the best I've ever seen. He plays Hawking perfectly, with his deteriorating muscle delivery being flawless. It will take a long time for someone to top this portrayal.3/4",

            "content": "There was one major contender during award season that I couldn't quite figure out if I was interested in watching: THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. I am a casual fan of Stephen Hawking and I've read both his \"Brief History of Time\" and \"Universe in a Nutshell\" (as a layman, of course\u0085I've no formal education in the sciences). I am vastly interested in the workings of the universe, even if I can't totally wrap my mind around some of the concepts in their complexity. So, a movie about Stephen Hawking was guaranteed to get my attention. I don't know why I expected a focus on his contributions to the world of theoretical physics in a mainstream biopic (other than wishful thinking) but the movie was still an interesting vision into the man's battle with ALS/Lou Gehrig's disease. It begins near the end of his education at Cambridge where he is studying for his PhD, and it's around this time that he meets Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) at a local party. The two fall in love (abnormally quick) and it's off to the disease when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is diagnosed with motor neuron disease and given two years to live. Once the initial shock has worn off, Hawking becomes determined to complete his education, continue his studies, and live a life with Jane. The two are married and the film gives us a glimpse into their lives as Hawking's motor function deteriorates and the struggle to maintain a sense of \"normal\" becomes too much.THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is unabashed Oscar bait. There is no question about that. Period piece. Noble subject/biopic. Intelligence. Love. Everything the award voters could want. Thankfully, it's a good bit of Oscar bait. Again, I'm a fan of Hawking so there are few subjects more interesting for me in a biography. Eddie Redmayne won a series of awards for his performance as Hawking and it was well deserved. I won't lie: in the beginning of the film, he reminds me so much of a young Austin Powers (think the flashbacks in GOLDMEMBER) that it's a little distracting but it's not long before he disappears into the character. And he becomes more and more convincing as the movie progresses. It's Hawking's battle with the disease where Redmayne shines, giving a pitch perfect performance. Good thing, too, because Hawking's ALS is the main driving force of the movie. He gradually loses motor function, bit by bit, until he's eventually confined to the wheelchair and gifted the text-to-speech software we've come to associate with the man. The movie spends the majority of it's time on the relationship between Stephen and Jane and how the two of them manage to keep strong for the longest time until the stress becomes too much. I'm honestly surprised at how little recognition Jones has gotten for her part in the film. As incredible as Redmayne was, Jones was just as on point with her role as his faithful wife with her gradually fading optimism. Redmayne had the physical struggle; Jones had the emotional.Struggle. It's all about the struggle. As a result, this is actually a pretty depressing movie. Sure, it's got these themes of hope running throughout it but it's nearly drowned in the constant onslaught of sadness and hurdles. Almost every scene in the movie focuses on some new obstacle or the stress before moving on to the next. While it is an interesting movie, it's just such a downer. It is interesting to see the progression of the disease, and it's interesting to watch Hawking's career blossom. But, man, what a bummer. I guess it would've been difficult to form an engaging movie around the man's career alone, but I think I would've loved it more. THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING drops little tidbits here and there, showing us moments where Hawking finds the inspiration for some of his ideas but that's about it. And the film follows his story up until the point that he publishes \"A Brief History of Time\". But then that's it. Oh well. The movie accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's a very emotional story and it's wonderful to look at. It's got all the ingredients to bring home the gold during awards season, and it's tailor-made to do just that. It's\u0085I don't know\u0085.good. Go ahead and give it a watch. There's nothing here to offend any tastes and the performances are amazing but (for me, anyhow) it didn't take long to sink into the background noise of all the other award bait biopics out there, standing out only because the subject is an interest of mine.",

            "content": "The story of Stephen Hawking is truly remarkable. Overcoming such adversity to continue to be one of the finest scientific minds on earth is extraordinary. The main focus of the film is Stephen's relationship with his wife Jane, which is beautifully and tragically depicted. As much a story of humanity and life as it is science, The Theory of Everything is poignant and heart warming.My first thought after finishing this film was... God what a performance from Felicity Jones. Redmayne was great, a superb physical performance but the emotion and power from Jones was just something else. Spectacular. The love, admiration and care that she showed Redmayne in the film was marvellous. It was such a raw performance and really got to me. She was captivating throughout and really stole the show for me. As mentioned Redmayne was also superb, managing to bring so much to the performance.The story is very well presented, covering the beginning of Stephen and Jane's relationship, through to Stephen's illness and the subsequent adaption to their new lives. It's very well paced and covers a lot of their lives in the space of the film. Inspiring and impactful in equal measure, The Theory of Everything will stay with you for a while.One criticism of the film is the colouration. It seemed to be filmed with alternately a sepia or blueish tint, the reason for which I'm not quite sure. It certainly didn't add anything for me and was a bit off putting at times. Other than that the artistic choices were great, with solid direction and a magical soundtrack.Definitely a must watch film and worth watching for Felicity Jones's performance alone.",

            "content": "A filmed biography of Stephen Hawking was inevitable. A genius of cosmology and quantum gravity, he was one of the rare scientists to have acquired great public notoriety. Knowing moreover with which valor this exceptional being, supported by his loving wife, resisted the ravages of Lou Gehrig's disease, the novelistic side was guaranteed. It resulted in James Marsh's \u00ab The Theory of Everything\", not an exceedingly original work but quite a satisfying one for all that. It certainly deals only superficially with hard sciences, but could it be otherwise in a work intended for the general public? Inspired by Jane Hawking's book, the screenwriter Anthony McCracken has chosen - and rightly so - the only possible angle, that of the personal story of Stephen and Jane, closely united as they were in their struggle against an adverse fate. Thus considered, this \"The Theory of Everything\" proves to be as edifying as touching, thanks in particular to its two actors, Eddie Redmayne, amazing in his evocation of the physical deterioration of his character, and Felicity Jones, knowing how to ally the energy of the fighter to the expression of the unconditional love. Overall, not too much pathos, and even some humor. With such a potentially lachrymal subject, the finished product could have been worse, much worse.",

            "content": "THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING has everything you'd expect from the typical Hollywood biopic, and as such is rather predictable. Not only that, but its subject is still alive (and very famous) which robs it of a lot of dramatic tension. Still, Eddie Redmayne gives an extraordinary, transformative performance as Stephen Hawking, as does Felicity Jones as his long-suffering first wife Jane. The story starts with Hawking's years at Cambridge and up through the publication of \"A Brief History of Time.\" Instead of focusing on the accomplishments, the film is really about the relationship between him and his first wife, as the book is based on her memoir. The romance kind of comes out of nowhere, but after spending two hours with them you really begin to feel for them, especially Jane, who ended up having to put in overtime as her husband's caregiver (until help was brought in). The scenes which show the gradual progress of Hawking's condition (Motor Neuron Disease/ALS) were quite moving as well, but only in the most general sense. It also \"helped\" that the score hinted at just the right moments when you were supposed to be emotionally affected. So, while the film is sure to stir up emotion and possibly provoke tears at certain points, nothing the film does with those moments is that special in and of itself. What really makes this film worth seeing is for Eddie Redmayne's performance, which deservedly won him the Best Actor Oscar this year. Of course, the rest of the cast, which includes Emily Watson, Charlie Cox and David Thewlis, does outstanding work as well. Overall, it's not particularly groundbreaking in terms of the biopic and romance formula, or in its execution, but Eddie Redmayne takes it to another level with his portrayal of one of the world's greatest living minds.",

            "review_title": "A good film that mostly works because of two perfect leads",
            "content": "The Theory of Everything is a James Marsh's movie about the life, struggles and greatest discovery of today's greatest physic Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne). The movie starts when Stephen - a Cambridge science student meets Jane, his future wife, an arts student and leads to the point where they divorce and Mr. Hawking becomes widely acknowledged scientist for his black hole theory. Anthony McCarten's screenplay tells the whole story in between, how those two fought against motor neuron disease, Stephen was diagnosed while attending Cambridge.This movie caught my attention from the very first trailer, which gave a brilliant idea about masterful acting of Eddie. It's always fancy to watch an actor playing someone living in the same decade as you, a person you have admired, read about, watched and especially, if that person has such some kind of disability - it definitely makes acting work a lot harder. So, I was very much wanting to know how Redmayne, who I'd loved for Les Miserables, dealt with it. Accordingly, it would be fair if I start with performances and especially him.Eddie Redmayne would not necessarily be an obvious choice for this role. He has not done much before it and in the beginning, I could not fully get the idea of him playing such an important person in today's science. But then I watched The Theory of Everything and I was assured. I think he is good in every sense he could have been and especially in the second part of the film, where motor neuron disease takes over his life.To begin with, shooting of the film has not been as successive as events in the film, they had to shoot parts from the beginning and the end the same time and Eddie had to switch form \"healthy\" Stephen to \"disabled\" one. Surprisingly, he nails both part of his job. In the beginning he is a shy, nerdy student, having his own world and visions, meeting a girl of his dreams and falling in love. As the story evolves, Hawking becomes more attacked by his disease and his physical capabilities become more limited. Eddie perfectly captures both emotional and physical condition of persons having the same problems. On the one hand, he is a scientist who wants to live just become he has something to prove and other other hand, he is a person in love who want to live because of a woman in his life.However, his good acting is mostly defined by complexity of physical work, rather than emotional. But this struggle never goes away without mental stress and I think Eddie manages to bring the whole pack of feelings on the surface.Felicity Jones received raving reviews - good ones and bad ones. I think mine would be more positive, than negative, because I really liked her. She was not extraordinary, or did she neither have some big emotional moments. To the contrary, her character is a quiet act, a person behind everything and still invisible. She comforts every her scene in the movie and masterfully captures the devotion Jane Hawking had towards her husband.The rest of cast is not memorable at all, not in a good way, not in a bad way. They just were there, doing their job and I honestly don't remember most, even though I watched the film a week ago or so.Anthony McCarten adopted Jane Hawking's book and transformed it in quite a good piece of screenplay. I would not dare to say that it was brilliant, or something, but it had some witty dialogues, with a lot quotable lines. My favorite is this one: - I study marriage of space and time - A perfect coupleIt's somehow weirdly romantic, isn't it?So, the reason I only remember only romantic lines is far too obvious, this is where director and writer took it. I don't want to believe that biography of Stephen Hawking does not go further than his relationship with wife or children. I am sure there have been quite many ups and downs in his career or scientific works and telling a story about him, without actually showing Hawking working on something that made Stephen known, is just stupid. The only think I understand is that they filmed an award-bait movie, mostly focused on two leads and giving them anything that can grab couple of honors.The Theory of Everything was visually well built with some quality production and costume design, good camera shots (the one pictures above) and impressive makeups. Most importantly, music was very good. J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson created a romantic music that perfectly accompanied film's dramatic sequence and helped to tell the story a lot. I found myself pausing and rewinding the movie just to listen to specific track.To briefly say, The Theory of Everything is a good movie in the sense of two lead acts, who very much will be remembered this award season and I am sure, at least, Eddie gets a lot attention. I honestly hope for Felicity's big chances, but you can never be sure if such a quiet role gets huge feedback.",

The combination of these events makes Seagal furious. What follows is a terrifying martial arts tournament on an Island in which Seagal beats the living hell out of every single mathematician walking the planet (and believe me, there are more than you think. There are 11 of them). Seagal's delicate portrayal of Hawking culminates in him succumbing to his illness and being turned into a transformer, before killing his arch nemesis (some douche box called Jonathan) with a judo pinch.

We probably learn more about Hawking's wife and what she's thinking than Hawking himself, which is disappointing.

            "content": "This crowd pleasing biopic of physicist Stephen Hawking, a sort of cross between A Beautiful Mind and My Left Foot, is glossy but is also hard to dislike. Hawking's life story is by now known by most people \u2013 struck by the terrible and incurable motor neuron disease in 1963 when he was a Ph.D. student in physics at Cambridge University, and told he had just two years to live, he decided nevertheless to go ahead with his life, marry his girlfriend Jane (played wonderfully here by the sweet petite Felicity Jones) and become a world renowned theoretical physicist exploring subjects such as the nature of time and black holes. 52 years later, he is still alive, though virtually immobile and trapped in a wheelchair, communicating through a computer.This movie is based on Jane's autobiography, and so it focuses less on his scientific achievements and more on how Jane coped with his consuming illness, while raising three children (!). One of their differences was that Hawking was an outspoken atheist while his wife was a practicing Christian. Ironically, given his atheism, the movie suggests it was Jane's deeply religious belief that made her care for him despite his increasing disabilities. An atheist or agnostic girlfriend, might have balked at caring for him after learning about his illness. The movie also suggests that Hawking's strange allusions to God in his bestselling book \"A Brief history of Time\" was a concession to his long caring wife.Eventually, their marriage proved too difficult and exhausting, and after many years, they both end up settling with different persons, she with the choirmaster of her local church (played by Charlie Cox), and he with his full time nurse (Maxine Peake). Eddie Redmayne is wonderful in the starring role. He plays Hawking as arrogant, somewhat mischievous and not always likable, which is understandable given his crippling illness. Also with Emily Watson, David Thewlis and Simon McBurney. Directed by James Marsh.",

When diagnosed as a young man he was given two years to live. He is now 72 defying the odds. Stephen Hawking remains one of human history's most phenomenal minds of science and one of the most profound contributors to the science of astrophysics.Eddie Redmayne, as Stephen Hawking, deserved the Oscar for best actor and then some. His portrayal of a man with this degenerative disease was nothing short of brilliant. He turned into Stephen Hawking as I forgot, most of the time, this was an actor portraying him. Felicity Jones as Hawking's wife was excellently performed as well. One must, I think, see this film to grasp its all-encompassing resplendence.\"The Theory of Everything\" speaks to the deepest most enduring and profound questions of life -- how did we, our planet, and indeed the universe begin and will it end. It asks, too, the most unanswerable question -- why. \"The Theory of Everything\" of course cannot answer everything but man's big brain can make the generational attempt to try. Every day we live we see the relevance of physics and the leaps forward in history science has made.For those who love relationship films it had that too. His wife Jane's dedication to him through much of his ordeal was breathtaking. Having three children with him amid the onslaught of the disease defied credulity.In the end the message of the film speaks loud and clear to me as Hawking, through his voice synthesizer states: \"Where there is life there is hope!\" Indeed, the life of Stephen Hawking proves that hypothesis eminently true.",

            "content": "Not one to seek out romance, but a good one is so romantic :-) Early in The Theory of Everything, the student Stephen Hawking strides across the grounds at Cambridge University in the 1960s, his face dreamy. He is lost in thought about the nature of time. A pivotal incident early in the film triggers the battery of tests and the prediction that he had only two years to live.The rest of the film follows that grim forecast. It dramatizes how he achieved renown within physics because of his ground-breaking 1970s work on black holes. As he's grown older, Hawking has become progressively weaker as his condition wasted his muscles, but his brilliant mind continued to whir. In the process, a dominant myth took shape around him, a myth that presented to wider society a misleading view of the physicist and his research. The myth was best articulated by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mialet in her book Hawking Incorporated. She noted that the cosmologist is overwhelmingly presented in popular culture as an intellect \"liberated from his body and seemingly emancipated from everything that clutters the mundane mind (such as emotions, values, and prejudices).\" But his film debunks this myth. By showing Hawking cracking his head on the concrete, it inverts the central idea of the myth: Hawking's mind is not free of his body, but is instead bound inextricably to it. Moreover, the film makes Hawking's support systems visible and vivid. His wife Jane Hawking dresses him, feeds him and cares for him. She and, later, nurse Elaine Mason teach him to communicate after a tracheotomy takes away his ability to speak. A system of technology then grants him a new, robotic voice. With these systems, his science has flourished. Anyway without revealing anymore, my only disappointment was the lack of a little more exposition of Hawking's inventive mind",

            "content": "To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of a biographical film. The narrative tends to be linear and simple. Without strong writing, it will be a collection of small episodes over long span of lifetime. In addition, 'The Theory of Everything' is about one of the world's best scientists, so it will talk about science to some extent even though it puts more weight on his degrading health condition, romance & marriage, and family. However, imagification of science in the movies helps audience understand the concept Hawking tries to explain. Stephen and Jane holding hands and spinning, cream swirling into the center of the cup of tea, and flames burning in the fireplace through the holes of the sweater all illustrate the black hole. It is the difficult concept, but viewers can draw images of what it is after the movie. Jane citing the Genesis is a great analogy to Hawking's concept of time. He wanted to find the beginning of the time as well.I cannot compliment enough the performance of two protagonists. Felicity Jones expresses Jane Hawking's loyalty, love, dedication to family, and faith so well and so delicately. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking well deserved Oscar, one of the best performances in the whole films. He is Stephen Hawking himself on the screen for sure, expressing longing and desire for good health and not losing humor amidst struggles.",

            "content": "Blurred shapes in golden light. Round and round it goes, a figure, it slowly emerges, in a wheelchair, effortlessly transforming to a spinning bicycle wheel in soft blue light. This begins James Marsh's film about Stephen Hawking, the best-known science of our time, struck with a degenerating disease at 21 years of age, who has lived more than 50 years after being given no more than two by doctor. An unlikely story, a miracle, one might once have said, but first and foremost a story of perseverance and love. Love to knowledge and love between two humans, rolled all in one. The film centers on the relationship between Hawking and his first wife Jane who stuck with him through it all, stubbornly refused to turn off life support when doctors gave up and who eventually had to find a new life without him.Marsh and his director of photography, Beno\u00eet Delhomme, paint the story in soft pastel-like colors interspersed with grainy interludes of wordless happiness, and infuse it with the rhythm of a flowing ballad, a never-ending song, giving the film a dream-like quality. The story's harder edges \u2013 the fear, the overwhelming demands of a disabled husband, the eventual parting of ways \u2013 are not denied but they are not delivered as dramatic highlights or turning points, but rather as matter-of-fact stages in a life story unfolding in a time which is both linear as it is stagnate or, to return to the folk's opening, circular. There are no outbreaks, just a series of acceptances that life might do many things \u2013 but it never goes according to plan. But even in the most painful moments, there is a warmth to the characters that seems almost unreal. The Theory of Everything has the enchanted nature of a dream \u2013 and just like a dream it is as real as human experience gets.The film touches on and sketches the various stages of Hawking's scientific development but it doesn't focus on his theories. Instead, it embeds them in a larger narrative of human should looking for meaning: in science, love, religion or even themselves. At the center of all this is Eddie Redmayne who delivers an earth-shattering performance as Hawking. He starts out as a somewhat clumsy geekish youth who as the disease begins to encapsulate his body is more and more reduced to tiny, but telling movements of eyes and mouth. Redmayne never shows off, his acting is subtle, accentuating the stages of decay while at no moment allowing us to forget that his character's brain and soul are exempt from the implosion of his physical powers. If it's true that the greatest actors only need the slightest wink or twitch to convey a world of emotions, Eddie Redmayne belongs to the very best. Yes, The Theory of Everything at times appears to simple, to easily flowing, as in the triangle between Stephen, Jane and her eventual second husband Jonathan. But then again, it is not a naturalistic painting but an impressionistic sketch merged with a romantic landscape. A dream called life. Nothing less.www.stategescreen.de",

            "content": "The Theory of Everything is a biopic about world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde Hawking. I really enjoyed it. It was well made and often very moving.The film covers most of the important moments in Stephen Hawking's (Eddie Redmayne) life, beginning with his courtship and eventual marriage to Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones), a literature student whom he met at Cambridge University. Over time, Hawking begins to lose control of his muscles and he is unable to use his hands and feet to accomplish even the simplest of tasks. The doctors diagnose him with motor neuron disease, an illness which causes the human body to slowly and permanently shut down the ability to move limbs but is told his brain will remain unchanged. He is given 2 years to live. In that time, however, Hawking starts a family with his wife and gives lectures at universities on his theories of black holes and the birth of the universe. Despite his condition getting worse and worse, Hawking still tries to see the positive side of life and even manages to write his famous book \"A Brief History Of Time\", which becomes a bestseller.Eddie Redmayne's performance as Hawking was so convincing I often had to tell myself he isn't the real person. Felicity Jones was great as well as Hawking's loving and committed wife Jane Wilde. The love story between them always felt genuine and never forced.I rate it 9/10. I also recommend watching the 2004 TV movie \"Hawking\" starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a companion piece for this film.",

Rich in character and dialogue, \"The Theory of Everything\" is primarily a romance wrapped around a chronicle of a brilliant and beautiful mind trapped in a malfunctioning body. This film is a narrative of heartbreak, marital and emotional distance, with jagged edges and torn souls portrayed with great subtlety and craft. Using fireworks and cinematographic images of the star-filled sky to suggest Hawking's brilliant astrophysics theories , the viewer is given a glimpse of his theoretical physics, a quest for a single elegant mathematical theorem to express the system of the universe in all its glory, from inception to black holes and the beginning of time. A very light touch is given to his theories on cosmology.The poignancy and painful irony of observing a consummate mathematics genius, who theorizes about the infinity of space and time, crammed into a very confining capsule, wheelchair-bound, is portrayed without pity.

Her Jane Hawking is believably impossibly perfect - the wife who lovingly supports her increasingly frail partner and then with exquisite discomfort falls in love with somebody else. There are no scenes of violence or vitriol: Stephen and Jane's love survives the collapse of their marriage. The supporting actors in this quiet drama are not big names, which lends their performances added conviction.

            "content": "Turning someone's life into a film is as common as it is difficult. Trying to stay true to the story and, at the same time, leave it thought provoking for the viewer is a challenge faced by the biographies. In this take, it was Stephen Hawking's turn to have his career told by the seventh art. Directed by James Marsh, The Theory of Everything does justice to the physical and presents us with an immersive story of love and overcoming.The film features a young Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), who is at the peak of his academic life and starting a romance with young Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones), when he discovers he has a degenerative motor disease at age 21. Thereafter, Stephen and Jane have their love tested by something that, until then, was considered a death sentence for those receiving the diagnosis.There would be no better actor to play Hawking than Eddie. He deserved all the merits he has been receiving for his incredible interpretation, which goes far beyond physical characteristics - very well incorporated, by the way. Redmayne allows us to know Stephen far beyond the physical, humanizing him to the point of making the viewer feel intimate with the character. He manages to convey Stephen's feelings and emotions without the need for much dialogue, but through subtle gestures and looks. This, in fact, is one of the assets of the feature. Despite occurring in large quantities, Theory has its true culminations in brief conversations or even words. One of the most touching scenes, for example, has a \"thank you\" as its main line.Felicity Jones is also noteworthy for composing a strong and determined Jane who does not allow herself to be shaken by the progress of the disease or the negative predictions of doctors and faces everything and everyone to show that Stephen could have a normal life. She and Eddie work well and are convincing in the role of the young couple, thrilling the audience with subtleties. Stephen and Jane's marriage and the way they both struggled to build their family despite adversity is told in a short but detailed sequence of scenes. The impression we have is that we are watching a home video that shows the story of both.The film is realistic and does not try to alleviate the difficulties faced by both, but seeks to show that, contrary to popular belief, life is not limited to problems or a disease and it is possible to see positivity even in the most negative situations. It can be said that The Theory of Everything is a film about life and also about love and overcoming. It is not about telling the story of Stephen Hawking, but about showing how a woman's willpower helped him not to give up and overcome himself.The figure known to the public and his greatest achievements are an integral part of the narrative, but not its center. It is not a matter of exposing the story of someone remarkable on the big screen, but of showing how two people managed to build a firm and lasting relationship - it was almost 30 years of marriage - despite all the adversities. Before being a film about Stephen Hawking, Theory of Everything is a film about the human being in himself and how it is possible to overcome himself daily.Also worth mentioning is the great soundtrack by Johann Johannson, which brilliantly leads the story and is easily one of the best of the year. The script, however, runs at certain times and even leaves some loose ends, but nothing that harms the sequences in an extreme way. The feature film delivers what promises and delights the viewer, introducing him to the man behind the genius and the woman who helped him get there.I liked this criticism of CinemascopeFilm seen on July 8, 2020.",

As it was with Jamie Foxx' portrayal of Ray Charles this is acting at it's very best. Felicity Jones was also brilliant as Jane Hawking and all the supporting cast were all very believable.The film itself concentrates on the relationship between Hawking and his wife and touches on the arrival of the Nurse Elaine Maso who in real life he eventually married, although the controversy surrounding her is not covered in this film. A lot of the film touches on the relationship between Jane and organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones although there is some ambiguity over what actually happens. The conflict between Jane's religious views and Stephens views are also touched on. It is a shame more was not made of Mr Hawkins brilliance as a Scientist but then that might be hard to put over in a movie where human relationships are easier to portray. Over all though this is a good film and worth a watch if only to witness the amazing acting of Mr Redmane.",

It's the story of brilliant scientist Stephen Hawking's diagnosis with motor neurone diseas in his early 20s - and his subsequent persistence in getting on with life, and becoming a world famous celebrity physicist. The scientific aspects, to me, are still very weak. I.e. I feel they could have been explained in more detail, although still in a simple way, so we got some information about Hawking's work. However the acting, including Eddie Redmayne as Hawking, and Felicity Jones as his wife, Jane, is exemplary. Redmayne displays an extraordinary technical mastery and empathy with Hawking's disability, and Jones inhabits her role beautifully. Jane seems to have saved Hawking's life, several times, not least in how she convinced him, and enabled him, to not just exist, but to participate in life. I feel that their breakup was probably sanitised somewhat. Not much bitterness or sadness is portrayed, just a few tears, then getting on with life with new partners. The actor who played Jane's choirmaster love interest was great, and the relationship is portrayed in a tasteful way. I felt that this movie did justice to an extraordinary true story.

The short answer is \"No\", but that doesn't mean it is a poor film, only that those anticipating perfection and something truly outstanding will feel a little disappointed.There are few in the western world who are not aware of Professor Stephen Hawking and the impact he had on the scientific world with his multi-million-selling book, A Brief History of Time, even if they know little about his own history or that of his wife and support, Jane. If nothing else, Professor Hawking has touched the lives of the ignorant masses (and I count myself amongst them) through his omnipresence in contemporary entertainment such as Pink Floyd's Keep Talking, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Futurama, The Big Bang Theory, The Simpsons\u0085The Theory of Everything is a classic biopic pr\u00e9cising the remarkable life of a modern genius from his academic career at Cambridge, through the onset and development of his life-defining motor neuron disease (or more specifically, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis aka Lou Gehrig's disease) and his personal relationships with Mary, their children and the staff and students at Cambridge.A glance through Hawking's achievements makes it abundantly clear that a detailed analysis of his life would be both too long and excruciatingly dull for most of us, and so director James Marsh (Man on Wire, Project Nim) has sifted the sparkling elements to forge a film that enthralls and delights whilst, apparently, remaining largely faithful for the source material, Jane Hawking's book, Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.The two central performances are, indeed, outstanding. Eddie Redmayne is on a career high as Hawking with an empathetic turn that pours anguish and steely determination onto the screen filtered through a gauze of classic 'Englishness'. It is a performance that it is impossible not to admire for the control and subtlety in portraying such a pronounced disability and if 2011's My Week with Marilyn suggested stardom, The Theory of Everything pretty much confirms it.As his wife, Mary, Felicity Jones is equally absorbing and commands the screen every bit as much as Redmayne. Come award season, though both may land Oscar nominations, I predict a greater chance of success for Jones in the Best Supporting Actress category than for Redmayne as he, surely, jostles with Michael Keaton and Steve Carell.Though The Theory of Everything is an extremely good film with some fine performances throughout, there is nothing remarkable, nothing that grabs the viewer by the throat, forces tears or leaves one wanting more or repeat viewings. It is another very good film that, come year's end, the viewer will vaguely recall seeing and enjoying but about which is unable to remember specifics. There is nothing really obvious to point at and say \"Oh dear\u0085\" about; it's just that there isn't enough, it lacks that extra fire in its belly that the fanfare promised.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",

            "content": "Everyone's heard of Stephen Hawking. Not many people really understand what made him so famous or what his most notable theories are. Well, you won't find it here, either. Because, contrary to the many, many reviews whose commentary states this is a film about Stephen, this is actually a film about Jane, his wife, and their relationship. Therefore, the many, many reviews that claim the film is lacking are actually complaining that it was not a film about Stephen himself. Sorry for the rant, but the actual cover art literally says \"The incredible story of Jane and Stephen Hawking.\"I think those reviews were hoping that a film might clue them in on what Hawking actually accomplished since reading things like \"By the wave/particle duality of quantum mechanics...\" the average person's brain has already started to compress with pain without an ability to comprehend the most basic premise of these huge theories. Those are the people who were hoping a film would put it into some kind of entertaining simplicity so we could all have that aha moment.Instead, we find a beautiful love story. We find surprises we didn't know about and the simple things that we probably never stopped to wonder about - and some we did stop to wonder about. But nevertheless, almost none of it is actually about Stephen's work except to mark the years with his awards.Jane doesn't really tell the audience exactly how she felt as those predicted 2 years came and went or as they grew into decades. We feel that she truly loved and adored him. But we are shown the moment where Hawking lets her go knowing she has found a way to be truly happy outside of his huge languishing life.I found this to be a well-done film that is touching and worthwhile. Eddie Redmayne does a jaw-dropping performance as Hawking, which Hawking himself was very impressed by.",

            "content": "(Spoiler Warning!) Moving to a big city has its perks, one of them - social events galore. I was browsing Meetup.com when I came across a posting for a free prescreen of, \"The Theory of Everything\". Twenty-four hours later, I found myself in a half-empty theatre, watching a premium movie with a row critics sitting in front of me. For a guy who rarely busts out the big bucks for a new movie, I was in for a treat. As some of you many know, Steven Hawking is the founding physicist who pioneered the mathematics behind the Big Bang Theory. As a scientist and Christian myself, I was expecting this movie to rehash the ongoing battle between agnostics and creationists. But I was wrong. Instead, quite elegantly, this story focuses on the life of Steven Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) from the time he started his doctoral degree at the University of Oxford till late in his professional career. His wife, Jane Hawking (played by Felicity Jones), is a Christian. The balance between opposing views on the existence of God was not debated in the classroom, but in the home, over dinner. One could say, there were no proverbial knives thrown during these conversations, but plenty of silence. The main progression of this film is the generated by three plots. The development of Hawking's medical condition: Lou Gehrig's disease. It was only a few months ago we were all pouring buckets of ice water over our heads to raise financial support and public awareness. The videography displaying the slow decline of his physical health was heart breaking, and a suitable reminder for us that long-term diseases are not like social fads. The story of Jane Hawking: a strong and compassionate woman who cared for her disabled husband in during the 70s and 80s. This movie superbly captures her own internal battles as a mother, PhD student, and provider of a growing family. For example, when Steven finally accepts extra help around the house, Jane breaks down in tears. In my eyes, her story was just as incredible as Steven's. The academic achievements of Steven Hawking. If you're thinking this movie is too 'scientific' for you, think again. At no point was I overwhelmed, confused, or lost interest because of the science. Rather, this plot gracefully moves from the classroom, to his dissertation, to his publishing and hardly mentions any scientific \"mumbo-jumbo\". Would it be helpful to know a little about stars? Go for it!This is very stunning movie, but it could have improved in a few areas. I was unimpressed by the color casting on many of the romantic scenes. Either a dark blue, or deep orange masked Steven and Jane's flirty awkwardness. I found it very distracting. Also, the characters didn't age very well. By the end of the movie, she still looked like the cute college girl forty/fifty years earlier. And finally, nearing the conclusion of the film, Hawking is asked what his philosophy of life is, due to his disbelief in God. In response, he gives a short speech praising the hope of humanity. I'm not particularity against the contents of the speech, but its place in the film. If this film isn't a battle of world views, why claim victory in the end?I would recommend this film for anyone who's interested in an inspirational, romantic, and scientifically oriented flick. *oh yes, and it was lovely seeing professor Remus Lupin from Harry Potter, again (Hawking's professor is played by David Thewlis)",

But since then I've seen both, and while it still would've been awesome seeing Keaton win, Redmayne deserved it no doubt. Portraying ALS- conflicted physicist Stephen Hawking required some really complicated physical acting- not only portraying his deterioration, but at the same time, keeping that spark, wit and humor which has been widely witnessed in pop culture.Based on Jane Wilde Hawking's memoir \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\", the film at it's center is a love story. Felicity Jones is great as Jane. I like how she is not portrayed as the self- sacrificing saint we're kinda all expecting her to be. Looking into it a bit further at Wikipedia, I read that Stephen was actually more of a narcissistic jerk than Redmayne's interpretation. LOL Maybe they should've added a little more of that into the character?? But no matter, I really enjoyed this, and would actually put it up there among my favorite films of 2014!

In a way the film inspires to battle against the normalcy of life. The film in its way stands an excellent reference work on a great personality. Although it feels a bit slow in its execution, it's a very well made film with excellent performances and a superb background score.

He captures the mannerisms and flat out embodies Hawking to the nth degree.Jones holds the film together.

            "content": "I'm not usually a fan of biopic films - most of them are painfully boring and dull, as mostly the subject matter beyond the public persona, are also pretty normal, boring and dull. Then there's Stephen Hawking. I skimmed a mixed bag of other reviews on IMDb before writing this, and it's clear that some people were disappointed that they didn't really \"learn anything\" from the movie - mostly with respect to Hawking's career in Physics. They've obviously missed the fact that this film was based on the book written by Jane Hawking; \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\" - this is why it's Physics light and mostly all about their life together. It's seems to be a pretty honest tale as Jane doesn't come out of the story looking all that brilliant in the end. Bottom line, in the end, she has an affair with their live-in help Jonathan, ends up leaving Stephen for him, despite pushing for that life with Stephen at the time when the disease first takes hold whilst at university - whether this was because she genuinely believed that it would only be about \"two years of struggle\" before he died, we just don't know. It also reflects poorly on some of the Christian values that present as part of the backdrop of the film and story. It's also unclear whether this actually had Hawking's blessing - it sort of alludes to it in the film, but remains a little ambiguous for me. For me, this is an epic tale of struggle against adversity - quite how Stephen has managed to make it into his 70's now, and also manage to develop the lifetime theories that he has produced whilst only just barely being able to speak, swallow, move his eyes and so on as his bodies functions shut down, and whilst almost dying of pneumonia in the 80's is quite unbelievable - what an impressive human being Stephen Hawking is. It makes you wonder about the widespread whinging of most human beings in the Western World, who really don't have much to moan about but do so, quite loudly, regardless. It was so easy to watch Eddy Redmayne's performance and absolutely believe that you were watching Hawking himself as he travelled through key stages in his life. Redmayne's performance is utterly stunning - he's absolutely nailed the appalling difficulties of a motor neuron disease sufferer - with dignity and great respect. During the last 1/2 to 1/3 of the film, Redmayne barely utters any words, but delivers the performance with the most subtle and powerful of facial gestures, with are mostly the limit of Hawking's physiology at that stage of his life. With all due respect to Keaton for Birdman (which was somewhat boring incidentally) and Cumberbatch for The Imitation Game - Redmayne's is one of the best performances I've ever seen in my life, in any year - if he doesn't win the Oscar/BAFTA for best actor, it would simply be wrong. I hope that they can eventually create a second biopic with the same cast in the not too distant future, so that they can focus much more on the academic achievements and theorem of Hawking and less of the relationship side to complete the story and so that Hawking's impressive achievements can be completely conveyed.",

Because of his illness and his genius, it is difficult to understand Stephen Hawking as \"just another guy\" - but this movie shows us how he struggles with the same emotions as the rest of us. And he shows a difficult relationship in a way that respects both parties.That said, I do wish they could have explained Hawking's importance in the world of physics a bit more, as the movie shows that he is talented, but does not really delve into his talent.The main attraction in this movie is the acting. Redmayne's performance seems to be spot on. You realize from the moment he moves that he is the perfect choice. Felicity Jones did a great job too, balancing the emotions of the character. The rest of the cast had good performances too, but maybe less to work with.One thing that was a bit odd was the colors.

The life of the prodigy is smitten with misfortunes, wonders, eurekas, not to forget the love of his life Jane who sacrificed everything normal just to be with the polymath.The life of Hawking is in itself a melodramatic narrative which doesn't need any more filler to spice things up. It already reeks of mishap and tragedy. What is worth noticing is the fact that despite all the adversity that dangled around his life, it was still pulled off and buffed up brilliantly by Jane, without whom the master couldn't have made it.I place this biopic's direction above Morten Tyldum's work just for the fact that theories that people don't comprehend have been expounded brilliantly at different points of time in terms of simple examples one would understand, which was, in fact, missing in The Imitation Game. Marsh endeavors to make things relate to us by explaining Hawking's discoveries. Even whilst he does that he makes sure he doesn't miss out from the drama that the movie so gorgeously carries.Marsh captures every aspect, every crossroad and setback that Hawking faced in his life with perfection. People tend to remember only the renowned. But what Marsh did by manifesting the parallel life of Jane Hawking, the mental agony she had to go through, the dilemma of not leading a normal life, the vexation of all the work she did, the hope that lit up her dead verve, the broken chance to escape from everything, and the jilted emptiness are far more beautiful and worth commending.The story is also a beautiful reflection of mind's conundrum. It shows how at one point love dies and no matter what you do, and no matter how close you were at one point, it always meets the same fate. Comes a time when there is no other option but to let go. Sometimes for the sake of the happiness of your other half.Hawking is an epitome of hope. It just goes on to show us how a will to fight, a reason to live and the gusto to learn could never stop a brain from dying.Definitely worth our time!",

If so, it would be a rather neat touch, and an appropriate and appreciable nod to Hawking's Bestseller.Though this movie does suck one in quite a bit, it really did break my heart, in a manner that diminishes the film, and that too, sucks quite a bit. What's heartbreaking isn't necessarily Stephen's disease, though it is incredibly sad; no, what's heartbreaking is his and Jane's separation. It was inevitable from the moment she said she loves him, and the reason their divorce ruins this film - besides the fact that The Theory of Everything feels a lot like a story of love, is because she truly did, but life, as it loves to do and do so incredibly, unbelievably, amazingly and breathtakingly well, got in their way.After all those years of her taking such good care of him, their kids and their unity, for it to end period, almost demonstrates the uselessness and power of time. Maybe it's because it's a biography, but it really is quite dispiriting.Also, I feel as though this film arguably, somewhat brings Stephen Hawking's integrity into question. Jane could've left, but she didn't, however, the first chance Stephen got seemingly, and not that he did it purposefully, he left. Maybe Jane stayed out of obligation, but, did Stephen also then not owe her the same courtesy?With all of that said, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones exhibit some wonderful performances, and Johann Johannsson's composition is heartrending... It's moving. 7.3/10.",

            "content": "Screenwriter Anthony McCarten figures out what he wants to say towards the end, and even if his conclusions are somewhat literal, it helps immeasurably to bring \"The Theory Of Everything\" to its warm conclusion. McCarten's eloquent screenplay (based on Jane Hawking's book) and director James Marsh seem to want to match Stephen Hawking's theories about time's beginnings and, at the end, by running the films's main events in reverse, they cleverly compare the relationship between Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his first wife, Jane (Felicity Jones) to the big bang theory. McCarten's most interesting topic is perhaps the oddest when it comes to a biography of Stephen Hawking--sexual infidelity--and though he answers his questions about it childishly (he equates unfaithfulness with deathly illness in order to lay on the guilt), it's somewhat refreshing to find a film that eschews the traditional hagiographic view of romance when icons are involved. Redmayne and Jones are good enough, though you get the sense that there's no real degree of difficulty in their acting; in fact, as far as Redmayne is concerned, there's the distinct feel that acting is all he's doing.",

            "content": "I had high hopes for The Theory Of Everything. The trailer looked phenomenal, and judging from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb scores the critical reception was positive. Over All-I was expecting moreThe film follows the life of Stephen Hawkings, from his Oxford days to his offered knighthood.There are good things in this film. Eddie Redmayne's performance as Hawking was phenomenal. Every mannerism was perfect and I look forward to see more from him. Phenomenal portrayed Hawkings as somewhat arrogant, but with great charm, curiosity and a good heart. The score for the film is fantastic also. Johan Johannsson produces some wonderful piano pieces,and the score makes the film worthwhile. There other good things in the film, none that stand out as much as these two though. I laughed ,smiled, and got invested in the story in multiple occasions.But it wasn't enough. For a film that explores time so much, it has some serious pacing issues. The film slows down too much, and never quite refunds it's pace. It moves forwards and backward, pace wise, and that makes the 2 running time seem like 2 and a half. I found it hard to get invested in Hawkings' wife. Felicity Jones portrays her as uptight, and somewhat cold, although I didn't doubt her love for Hawkings for a second. The film does a great job of showcasing the effects that degenerate diseases have in both the sufferer and those around them. Some characters, like hawking's school friends and lecturer seemed 2 dimensional and boring. Emily Watson and Charlie Cox both appear and give solid performances, but nothing more can really be said. The film appears to be by a young, inexperienced director, who has potential to grow into a great one, however James Marsh has a good few films under his belt(none of which I have seen.) I'd definitely see what else he has to offer, but I hope his timing improves, as it was detrimental to the films success as a narrative.In short, the film has a great central performance, an amazing score, but its pacing and Ack of interesting characters drags it down.",

            "content": "Basically it is about the relationship between the physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife. It is based on Jane Hawking's book. For this I was disappointed. I wanted more his intuitiveness concerning the structure of the universe than his domestic life.However, some of his philosophical perspectives are brought to light. He believes that an equation linking quantum mechanics with relativity can reveal the mind of God - perhaps, but such is purely speculative. Also, his assertion that belief or disbelief in God is inconsequential for legitimate scientific inquiry reveals his scientific/theological perspective, and it is one in which I agree.At the heart of the film is the story of an absolute genius stricken with a catastrophic disease. A scene in the film brilliantly displays his rationale concerning a question given to him regarding the existence of God. The Holy Roman Church promoted scientific inquiry hoping to substantiate scripture, or more precisely a interpretation of scripture. Data didn't substantiate a geocentric universe so to hell with science. Centuries later, Christianity still demonstrates the arrogance of humanity by relying on science (creation science) to prove the existence of God. This, while they decry scientific findings that are contrary to, once again, a interpretation.Atheists are no less biased regarding science and theology. My philosophy suggests that if man, through his own reason, can prove or disprove the existence of God through science, then God isn't enough of a mystery to even consider.",

This movie is very emotional, heartfelt, and beautiful. If I had seen this prior to making my Best of 2014 list, it would have been on there. I really enjoyed the score, and everyone acting did a great job. I really enjoyed the 2 \"Doctor Who\" references, and the theory that was used in the movie \"Interstellar.\" It was amazing seeing how Stephen Hawking was suddenly diagnosed with this disease, and was expected to live for only 2 years as of the day of diagnosis, but defied those expectations and is still alive today. I really appreciate the care that the filmmakers took in making the film as accurate as possible. The real Stephen Hawking even said that at certain points of the film he thought he was watching himself. While I do disagree with the Academy, I still thoroughly enjoyed this film and am happy that it at least won some awards, even if I don't agree with the Best Actor win.\nGrade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars",

            "content": "I had high hopes for \"The Theory of Everything\", but it also had me worried. The plot of this film is based on the book \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\" by Jane Wilde Hawking and tells the story of how the author and her husband, famous theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, met and what their marriage and life together was like. I had some reservations about the movie initially because most of the people featured in the film are still alive, but the film is not a documentary. Could it be that they had such a compelling story to tell, and that the actors were just so talented that waiting any longer would have been a waste of time? This movie feels like one in a million. Not only in terms of overall quality, but also because it feels like all the stars have aligned and the people working here were all present at the right place, at the right time. If they hadn't seized the moment and made this movie, they would have missed a great opportunity. For some, the highlights will undoubtedly be the earth-shattering performances or the retelling of real-world events in such a frank and honest way, but for me it was what the movie was really about that had me hooked. This movie is about the life of Jane and Stephen Hawking, but what it's really about is people being prisoners of their own lives and how they manage, as best they can to escape their cells. What do I mean by this? Well, I don't think it's a spoiler when I tell you that real-life smart guy Stephen Hawking suffers from Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The man is trapped in his own body, barely able to move and presently, unable to talk except through the use of a computer. The movie shows you his physical degradation and the struggles that this entails as he becomes completely immobile. As Stephen becomes trapped, his crippling condition bears down on others as well. His wife becomes his round-the-clock caretaker, a a prisoner of her own responsibilities. This film has two parallel stories as these two people, struggle to free themselves, or make the best of the cage they had unfortunately found themselves in and as other people enter their lives, they also become inmates in this prison. I really enjoyed seeing the connections between all of the people between the people in their lives, how many of them also, in a way, ended up being prisoners because of their choices (like Jane's choice to marry Stephen despite knowing that he is affected by ASL) or Stephen's disease. I'm certain that the film would have been effective if it had focused simply on Stephen or Jane, but by showing us both of these stories, you really come to understand these two people and you fall in love with them.This movie could have dropped the ball in a number of ways, but I found that like any underdog story, it leaves you empowered and hopeful. Major credit is due to the two leads. The obvious actor to praise is Eddie Redmayne (fresh from the \"X-Men\" franchise) whose performance is so good it makes your average actor look like an amateur. Think about it. While at the beginning of the film we have Redmayne walking around and talking like your average guy, later the performance becomes much more subtle and much more difficult to pull off. You actually believe you're seeing the real-life Hawking because everything is bang on. The way his body is contorted on his wheelchair, the way he struggles with his words as the condition gets worse and in the end, the way that the tiniest movements in his only partially mobile face are used to convey real emotion are absolutely brilliant. I don't want you to focus solely on Redmayne though because Felicity Jones as his wife is just as good in a role that's even more complex. She convinces us that she's a woman that really loves her husband, but is in a way also mad at him for surviving the disease and robbing her of a normal life. I said earlier that this movie was about people being trapped; you almost feel worse for Jane because you see that she is a person that is both happy and sad at the same time, all of the time. Watching her, you can feel that she always has conflicting thoughts and emotions inside of her. All of her scenes are captivating.To wrap this up, I'll just list some of the other praises I have. I thought the score complimented the emotions and themes superbly. I never felt like I was being manipulated, as much as what I was feeling inside of me was being reflected musically by composer Philip Glass. I found the film to be very moving, but also quite funny at times, reflecting the fact that Hawking retained his sense of humor despite everything that happened. I thought everything was bang-on and I didn't even mind that because of Redmayne/Hawking's slurred speech, I missed a couple of lines here and there. I liked how the movie felt genuine, showing nobody as a perfect saint and never erroneously assuming that we needed to have someone do some heinous act and branding themselves a villain. I thought the screenplay showed profound intelligence and that it looked quite beautiful thanks to cinematographer Benoit Delhomme. Finally, I admire director James Marsh for bringing it all together.This film is sad at times, but more often than not it's very hopeful, very emotional and surprisingly, very funny. It really is something special and I bet the real-life Stephen and Jane Hawking would agree. Everyone's going to be saying this I'm sure, but watch out for this movie, you will be hearing about it again come Oscar season. (Theatrical version on the big screen, December 23, 2014)",

The award season that has really taken off now gave me the impression that Redmayne's acting would be of an immense quality. He didn't disappoint me. Redmayne delivers an outstanding piece of art. The way he moves as the movie progresses, the way his voice breaks down as we watch him suffer but mostly his face that shows pure emotional mayhem. There aren't a lot of actors who can pull of such an amazing feat by just using their face. This was of impeccable quality. This performance reminded me of Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Christy Brown. I never thought anyone could get remotely close to his portrayal, but Redmayne certainly does it. He is without doubt up there with the great performers. His win at the Golden Globes is very well- deserved. I will await with great patience to see if he wins the Oscar for this role, which I think he truly deserves. Furthermore, the rest of the cast adds to the story in a way that's just right. Felicity Jones' Jane makes a perfect counterpart for Eddie Redmayne's Stephen. Charlie Cox, who I had not yet heard of, does a marvelous job at portraying Jonathan and so does David Thewlis as the professor at Cambridge and Stephens push in the back. The scenery is great and takes you right to the story where it feels like your there and the music made by J\u00f3han J\u00f3hansson is extremely moving. All in all, one hell of a movie that I hope will never be forgotten.",

His slight facial expressions down to his minor feet movements were just so detailed and done with so much care and precision that I cannot give him enough credit. Felicity Jones as well, played her part really well and you could really feel her love emitting from her. The chemistry between them was just too good; it was heartbreaking to watch. This may be the best love story ever portrayed.Not knowing much of Hawking's life myself, I'm not sure how credible this film is, but Hawking himself seems to be satisfied that it mainly depicts the truth. It didn't really seem like much drama was added to it to make the film more 'exciting', so I'm going to believe that most of what was shown is the truth. My interest has definitely been peaked after seeing this, and I definitely want to give a go at reading \"The Theory of Everything\" as well as Jane Hawking's book \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\", which this film is based on.The cinematography was marvellous and I could really notice when great shots were taken. It added so much depth and feel to the film. Kudos to Marsh, this was brilliantly made.One thing I would've liked a bit more was probably to have more of an insight into Hawking's emotions. I got the feeling that the only one who was troubled was Jane, when obviously Hawking is the one with ALS and would've had emotional or psychological breakdowns as well. Or maybe it just wasn't known because he couldn't really speak, or that his coping skills are really top class as from what this film depicts, he has a humorous personality which might have helped him with the disease.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",

            "content": "When I first heard that James Marsh, the director behind inspiring documentaries like 'Man on Wire' and 'Project Nim', is directing a biopic of inspirational scientist Stephen Hawking, I was quite excited and had too many expectations since the story was set to focus both on Hawking's achievements as well as his love life. Marsh doesn't disappoint at all; with the help of Anthony McCarten's screenplay (adapted from Jane Hawking's book), he gives us such a motivational and heartbreaking story of love, with all its ups and downs.When Hawking was diagnosed with ALS, he was given only two years to live. Without the support of his lover at that time, Jane, he would have gone into a world of hopelessness and loneliness, and so would any man in his situation. No matter what our goals and ambitions are in life, we human beings are quite emotionally needy; we do need someone to be with us, as a companion.No relationship is perfect, neither was this one. It was a love between two people with such different tastes and ideologies. Hawking went on with his theories, fame, books, and Jane had to take care of him, his children, and manage her studies as well. Their relationship was strained but quite moving. The inclusion of Jonathan into their lives was quite heartwarming; the string of scenes the movie shows of all them spending time together was quite beautiful. So without revealing anymore about the story, all I could say is, the characters (people) involved as well as the story-writers handled the situations quite commendably.It's the two lead actors, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, that give the characters and the story the depth it demands. Redmayne was first properly noticed in 'My Week with Marilyn'; he has come a long way from there, and has completely transformed himself to get into the shoes and wheels of the character. There are moments you think how closely he resembles the actual scientist. He is remarkable. And giving him support is the talented Miss Jones; her performance is more nuanced and subtle, but conveys the desired emotions with such impact that it's hard not to acknowledge her. She's the emotional backbone of the film.The two other big strengths of the film are: the colourful and spectacular cinematography (by Beno\u00eet Delhomme), and the breathtaking original score (by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson). They help us delve into the world and lives of these fascinating characters. The movie is filled with heartwarming as well as heartbreaking moments, interspersed with lines of wit and humour which are sure to make one chuckle.I agree, few of the negative aspects of their love life may have been glossed over, and few terrible aspects of Stephen's life with second wife have been excluded, but as much as they've shown, it's quite commendable. It's mainly Stephen and Jane's story, everything else is irrelevant. Ultimately, the movie isn't about physics, the universe or its theories; it's about us humans, our dreams and goals, and essentially, love, the one thing that binds all these.The last sequence, recapping the major moments of Hawking's life in reverse (synced with the mesmerising music score), was terrific, and was the perfect ending the film deserved.",

The acting is some of the best I've ever seen and the musical score is fitting. Nothing comes across to me as sappy in the entire running time of the film. Still, I am left empty.Maybe the blandness of the film is derived from the fact that Hawking is not yet dead. Maybe, if he was it would be easier to pinpoint exactly what his life was about. Instead, we are left with a film about theories and scientific discoveries but are also left absolutely clueless as to what they are about. Personally, I do not know much about Hawking, but this film did not succeed in making me any more interested in researching him.Don't get me wrong. This is a very good film. It takes the viewer on a real journey and gently presses you to feel. Can we live with ourselves? If we had to carefully select our words, as Hawking does, would we have anything to say? I believe each of us would live much differently if we were truly grateful for what we have. I don't think anyone realizes this as much as Dr. Hawking.Overall, a well-deserved Oscar for Redmayne.",

Yes, but not in the traditional sense. Enjoyable? Sure, but it didn't leave you filled with joy necessarily. It pulls you in completely for two hours and doesn't let you go. Eddie Redmayne delivered one of the best roles I've seen in recent memory in his portrayal of Stephen Hawking. Not to be forgotten is Felicity Jones, whose genius in playing Jane Hawking is up to the task of matching Redmayne. Those two carry the film and director James Marsh does a brilliant job of harnessing their roles and creating the masterpiece that was this movie. From the acting to the score to the cinematography to the choking feeling you get at times, this movie is a must watch.",

HER LOVE CHANGED HIS. I did get teary during this picture and I'm not ashamed to say it. Hello Kiddies your pal The Cupid Critic here with the true life story of Jayne and Stephen Hawkin told mostly through the eyes of Jayne as she struggles to help her husband through over the years. What I like mostly about this picture is that its told through the eyes of two people. We see the toll it takes on Jayne trying to help her husband over the years through the tremendous acting of Felicity Jones. They could have easily alienated one of the two but no they don't. I love the first thirty minutes where Stephen is well and can walk and the time they share together is beautiful and its shot beautifully as well by director James Marsh. We can see how much of an impact Jayne makes on Stephen as well, I loved this film for that and I hope it wins for something at Oscars. I give The Theory of Everything a five out of five.",

            "content": "I really liked it better when there were only 5 nominees for the Oscar for Best Picture (even when Dark Knight didn't get nominated and fanboys went crazy) because it recognized a smaller collection of movies that were more deserving of the award, let alone the nomination. At first I felt like the Theory of Everything is one of those movies that is almost worthy of the nomination, but that it was only nominated since up to 10 movies can now be nominated for that Oscar. Now after looking at the list again and having seen all those films nominated for best picture, Theory of Everything triumphs over The Imitation Game, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and American Sniper - perhaps even Selma.I still think the two strongest films of the year were Birdman and Whiplash, but the acting in The Theory of Everything is phenomenal, especially Eddie Redmayne's performance as the brilliant yet handicapped Stephen Hawking. I felt guilty nearly giggling at Hawking's speech impediment when it is first introduced in the film, but shortly after realized it is how the physicist actually had to speak and that Redmayne must have a true gift to be able to recreate such a severe handicap.While I realize the purpose of this film was primarily the romance between Hawking and Jane, his wife who he eventually leaves, I would have liked to see more of Hawking's theory/work or at least see more into the theory with specific details. We have a film about one of the most intelligent people who ever lived, but the filmmakers wanted to dumb down Hawking's theory and his discoveries to \"benefit\" the audience.I'm not sure how I would have liked to see the film end, but I thought it was strange to have Hawking acknowledge his wife and family so abruptly after leaving Jane towards the conclusion of the film. It is a sentimental moment, but it is brief and simple before a \"rewinding\" sequence which looks back on the film (the lives of the two lovers) as a whole. A strong relationship story, but I would have liked to see more about the theory instead of that becoming disregarded for the sake of the love story.",

While there's life, there is hope.\" -Stephen Hawking.This film is Biopic/Drama+Romance about the famous theoretical physicist and cosmologist, Stephen Hawking. I really admire the guy and it was great to see that the movie did a great job of bringing his life story to the big screen. The main reason I admire him so much is the fact how he battled being diagnosed with ALS/Motor Neuron disease from his early age, defying the impossible and contributing greatly to the world of physics and cosmology. One of the greatest mind of our time. The film's main focus is not the achievements or genius of Hawking, but his relationship with his wife and his/their fight against the disease. IT is a really heartfelt story.It is hard enough to play as a Genius in movies since they mostly tend to be a bit socially awkward in one way or another, but it is a whole another thing to portray the effects of the said disease, and the decline into worse stages. And Eddie Redmayne did just that. He was just breathtaking in his performance. Not only does he look very similar to Hawking's younger self, he gave one of the best performance I HAVE EVER SEEN. It was like you were seeing Hawking himself. Last year has been full of great performances, but after watching this film, I'm fully supporting Redmayne for the best Actor Oscar, by far the best performance of last year. Beside Redmayne, Felicity Jones, who plays Hawking's wife, also gave a stunning performance. Not only that, she also stole away my heart, new celebrity crush. I don't know but I just found her immensely beautiful. The supporting cast was also great and contributed greatly in telling this tale and in heartfelt moments.Soundtrack was another thing that I really found captivating in this film. Was very well composed. The only complaint of mine with this film, just like The Imitation Game, is that I would have loved if they showed more of his work or genius workings.Whether you like Hawking or not (Can't see how can you not like him), or whether you even know about him or not, definitely give this movie a try. 8.5/10",

So it starts with their meeting and ends with their separation.The film centres itself almost exclusively on the minutiae of their married life and coping with Stephen's disability. As such it is a real tear jerker and at times their lives together seem to be an unremitting tragedy.I found the acting impeccable from the stars and supporting characters and the film evokes life in and around Cambridge university during the Sixties and Seventies well, quite nostalgically.Jane's religious faith compared to Stephen's atheism is a thread throughout which I felt added nothing to the plot, yet what is really uplifting in the film is the story of the simple heroism required in dealing with such an awful disability, whether you are one of the human race's greatest minds or not.There is little in the story to help us understand why Hawking is such a shining star in the world of science and I felt this was the movie's weak point. It is simply a given that we already know and accept he is one of the greats and for that reason we will be content to view the emotional details of his domestic life. That said the film often feels warm and intimate, that you have been invited in, like a talk through two decades of a family's photo albums given by them in their sitting room.Jane and Stephen come across as absolute heroes and it is their example and the feeling of being invited into a life which made the film worthwhile for me.",

            "content": "The year 2014 has brought us two popular movies dedicated to the lives of prominent scientists - 'The Imitation Game' about Alan Turing and 'The Theory of Everything' about Stephen Hawking. While the impression is still fresh, there's a big temptation to compare them both to each other and look for similarities. Yet, honestly, i could hardly name two seemingly similar films that are as distinct as these two.As i wrote in a separate review for 'The Imitation Game', it generally follows the steps of 'A Beautiful Mind', in a way that the hero is doomed to struggle, and no achievements or scientific success have a chance to bring him peace or happiness. The whole life of Alan Turing is shown as a fight with everything that's around him: bullying fellow students, impatient and short-sighted bosses, hypocritical society etc.On the other hand, in 'The Theory of Everything' we are given a completely opposite picture. The main character, who looks like a hipster male model, receives nothing but praise and love from everyone around him: hot girls swoon at first sight of him, colleagues and mentors only worship him for his bold endeavors with no sign of envy or disgruntlement whatsoever, the society is ecstatic whenever he makes a public appearance, random guys lend a helping hand acting like a non-staff nurse just simply because being near Hawking gives purpose to their lives. Even the queen of England wants to see him.All this is rather cloying. The movie portrays Stephen Hawking as some sort of a superhero prodigy who's the first at everything and is never wrong. It completely obscures the truth of his life, like that several of his bold theories were outright wrong, which he was annoyed to admit, and that his main scientific achievement - the Hawking radiation - still haven't been proved to exist, while the Higgs Boson, the subatomic particle whose existence he denied, was actually found.Just as real-life Stephen Hawking, the movie image of him suffers from the celebrity status. In the movie, his father tells him that he is world-famous. \"For black holes, not for rock concerts\", Stephen replies. But still the film makes a rock star out of him, focusing only on the strong sides of his life and completely striking out the rest.The filmmakers might have thought that Hawking's disability is enough of a downside to go with it alone. Indeed, Eddie Redmayne's performance of a man gradually losing control over his own body was brilliant, and there is no doubt that he deserved the Oscar he received for this role. But at the same time i can't help thinking that the way 'The Theory of Everything' portrays the life of a person with ALS is oversweetened and even cynical. There's no doubt about Stephen Hawking's suffering from it. However, he is constantly surrounded by people who view taking care of him as a source of joy rather than a burden, who literally \"worship the ground beneath his wheels\". I'm quite certain that a life of a regular person, neither wealthy nor famous, who suffers from the same illness is infinitely more gritty and dramatic.While 'The Theory of Everything' is a decent and captivating movie, it ultimately fails to go beyond the already existing myth of Stephen Hawking and to show some less glorious sides of his life and personality. And it's just too bad, because, in an ever expanding Universe, a public image of its Master would definitely benefit from some expanding too.",

            "content": "The Theory of Everything is an ordinary film about an extraordinary life. Director James Marsh takes a conventional approach to telling the complex life story of brilliant physicist Stephen Hawking, one of the most fascinating figures in modern history.The film's strength is Eddie Redmayne's terrific, consistent performance as Hawking, who goes from a carefree young student at Cambridge in the mid 1960s to a world-class thinker, even as his body succumbs to neuromuscular disease leaving him wheelchair-bound and able to speak only through a computer-enabled voice. Essentially an intimate marital drama rather than a career story, the film focuses on Hawking's first marriage to literature student Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) and her unwavering loyalty to him since the onset of his illness.Well made and incredibly acted, the film nevertheless falls short on account of its unwillingness to dig deeper. You can't help suspecting that you're being served a more cheery version of events, given Hawking's progressively deteriorating condition and the strain that puts on the marriage. Also, no matter how many times the words \"relativity\" and \"space time singularity\" are thrown around in conversations, you never quite get a sense of what Hawking's achievement really means.Yet, a few scenes in the film are excellently constructed, like the one in which Jane realizes her marriage is over. It's done without any melodrama or messiness, and yet it's a deeply affecting moment. Redmayne and Jones have excellent chemistry together, each doing their best work here. Not only does Redmayne get Hawking's condition just right \u2013 the awkward walk, the twitch, the head-tilt \u2013 he even gives us occasional glimpses of his sly sense of humor. Jones has a far less showy role, but she's just as impressive with a subtle turn that alternately reveals steely resolve and patience, and ultimately the heartbreak her character endures.For their performances alone, The Theory of Everything might be worth a watch. Evidently, this true-life story has been Hollywood-ized for awards recognition and mass appeal.",

The feeling one gets from watching The Theory Of Everything is that before his illness started leaving its mark, Hawking acted like an ordinary scholar. Of course his brilliance is now very much acknowledged and the fact is that his theories would have come to light whether or not he had to battle the disease.Anyways, this movie is adapted from Jane Hawking's memoir \"Travelling To Infinity: My Life With Stephen\" and is a story about the many difficulties that their marriage had to endure as Stephen fought to live and find a way to make his life's work meaningful, and on the other end, the commitment Jane gave to her marriage, despite everything going against it. With two heavy protagonists such as these, top talent was needed and suffice to say that Redmayne and Jones were more than up to the task. Redmayne gives one of the best performances of the year as he plays three stages of the character. The transition from one stage to another is phenomenal and brings the best out of our leading man. Felicity Jones does equally well, although her role isn't as flashy. Still her charming and charismatic nature allow for a great turn, when one could expect a less than good performance.While the movie does come together beautifully through it's two leads, the filmmaking process isn't as strong with the biopic structure being very normally used. Johann Johannsson's soundtrack is a delight to hear though and along with the performances, are the best part of the film. The Theory Of Everything isn't the most brilliant film in this year's Oscars, but it certainly is worth it to see some of the best performances of the year and hear a rich score that I hope, deservedly, wins an Academy Award.Rating: 8/10",

He is insanely believable as the real life scientist, and gives a really likable impression of his own in the performance. I feel like he really has the disease, because he goes out of his way to experience every level of difficulty that the real life scientist has to deal with.Felicity Jones as Jane is very supportive, likable, and heart wrenching. The rest of the supporting cast falls flat. They're not bad, but nothing really noteworthy. The cinematography is spot on, the lighting in particular.The film provides a subtle pace throughout, slowly covering all the difficulties with Stephen and his wife after their quick romantic development. In terms of the science, it displays and explains a lot, but it didn't have as much of a scientific edge as I thought it would. I thought a little more focus could have been put into what makes him a well known genius besides his disability. A lot of focus is between the relationship of him and his wife, which builds the tension in their marriage. I enjoyed it, but it could have balanced it out more in my opinion.The film's ending slightly annoyed me. They covered the Jane and Jonathan relationship well, but Stephen and Elaine's chemistry did not feel very strong, it felt very rushed, making the end of Jane and Stephen's marriage come out of nowhere.Overall, it retells the story of Stephen Hawking in an inspiring fashion.

The movie examines Hawking's life, paying particular attention to his personal life with wife Jane and their three children, all of whom were born after Hawking was diagnosed with ALS. The film features some of the strongest acting that you're likely to see in the 2015 Oscar field, with both Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne turning out stellar performances \u2014but, in the interest of being honest, it's Redmayne that really steals the show, as he becomes Hawking in a way that eclipses most any role that has ever been played on the silver screen. It would be a travesty if Redmayne were not to win the Oscar this year, and while I have yet to see the other films that the Best Actress pool of nominees is pulled from, Redmayne may win Best Actress for Jones as well. We shall see.That having been said, the film itself is overall quite well made and is ultimately time well spent. Still, the storyline itself ultimately makes the film take a bit of a hit, as its hard to make Hawking's narrative into as enjoyable of an experience as other films in the biographical genre, even those that are equally tragic in nature (such as its 2015 Best Picture competitor \"The Imitation Game\", which tells the story of fellow British academic and genius, Alan Turing). The end result here is a strong film with amazing acting, but one which ultimately only deserves 8/10 stars in terms of its overall quality\u2014granted that this 8/10 movie is yet a very impressive work in its own right.",

Some may feel the film is too sentimental or cloying, even though sentimentality has its place in films and our lives; but the bottom line in The Theory of Everything is that it's so incredibly inspirational. And who would argue the point that all of us have odds to overcome (odds likely to be much less severe than Hawking faced), and to face those odds, we need inspiration.",

Besides the drama it reminded me of \"The Imitation Game\" and \"A Beautiful Mind\", powerful films that illustrated people with great minds but corrupted lives. What I like about this film is the conflict that came between the two main characters. Here, a conflict that came between Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his wife, Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), was that he didn't believe in GOD but she did. Several times in the film he would say some scientific things to disprove the existence of GOD, in which I felt that's what the writers of this film was was trying to put forth, but his wife would say different. As this film moves on more troubling conflicts seep their way into their relationship. Since I love physical science I did enjoy listening to the theories Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his colleagues were discussing, but other than that it was simply a great film.",

Stephen Hawing is one of the greatest scientists of all time and his struggles and achievements are replicated pretty decently.

            "content": "To sort things out from the beginning, if you're looking for a movie for SH the Physicist, this is not one. This is a movie for SH the man and partly the Physicist. It's a well-made movie, focusing on his relationship with his first wife with whom they have three children. It's more or less a film about a relationship where one of the two partners is seriously ill and the other tries to support and be there. And then again, it's not completely about that. It seems to me that the intention was to portray this, but with SH being who he is, it could not be just a movie about his relationship. They had to have some background about him and his work. But then, incorporating this in the film, it inevitably took away time and depth from the depiction of the relationship and all its ups and downs. The result for me is indeed a touching movie with all the elements there, or at least most of them, and with an amazing role being performed in the best way possible. Apart from that, it seems that the movie remains superficial around the topics of the relationship, leaving out many elements of the cruel reality that could serve the purpose of the movie. We never got to find out how they coped, we never got to find out about the actual and real problems of the couple and the children. They are being heavily implied but not tackled with directly. Instead of that, the movie just shows the picture of Professor SH running around on his chair with the children hanging from it. I also missed the participation of the respective families in this or the declaration of their absence. His father and mother seem really distant from everything else other than some family gatherings, which looks odd when we do not have any indication of them having some tension or problems in their relationship. I mean, if your child goes through that, you are there the whole time, something we never saw in the movie. Don't let me be misunderstood, I really loved the movie. But, I would expect something more from it, given that it does have a really interesting and powerful story in its core. My problem is that in a way the director or maybe the script writer, chose the mainstream/in between path, of creating a film that shows a little bit of everything to capture diverse audiences, whereas this film should be about the relationship in all its depth and width... I would highly recommend watching it! And if a comparison could be made with the Imitation Game, which kind of resembles it in a way, I would give thumbs up to the Imitation Game any day of the week.",

Although, it's tastefully done, the story is does not shy away from the difficulty they faced. The Theory of Everything seamlessly shows their life, the personal side of thing, and it's no romantic comedy. The film tells a great deal of what this brilliant man and his wife had to endure. Jane married this genius man, on borrowed time, planning to cherish the little time they had but in time found herself with a husband, whose slowly crumbling body, demands a lot of her. Stephen, this brilliant young man, who had a bright future in front of him, found himself faced with a hurdle he can't possibly overcome and only live with. Their story is beautifully told, fascinating but also cruel.The Theory of Everything is subtle and clever. Like I said, it's not an overly sugar-coated and romanticized story of Stephen and Jane Hawking. They are portrayed as strong and determined people but they're also flawed, which makes them human and very likable. I was touched all the way through, immersed into the story and into their lives, but I did not pity them I admired them. The immersion into the story is wonderfully accompanied by the score. It gives an extra layer to such a beautiful story.The cast is just superb, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones really deserve the nominations and awards they got because they carried the movie. Redmayne was incredible and once you fathom the amount of work and details that went into this performance, you realize how impressive Eddie Redmayne's performance is. Felicity Jones, though, is the cherry on top the movie wouldn't have been as good without her in it. She's sweet and incredibly good as Jane Hawking her eyes speak for themselves in the movie. She's brilliant.As Biopics go, The Theory of Everything is a great one among the many we had this year with Unbroken, and The Imitation Game, or Selma. When the story's great and you have a very talented cast, the director is often overlooked James March did a stellar job.I now understand what all the fuss is about.

            "content": "It is a brilliant film, as good as a biopic can be in all honesty. It is sad in many ways, to the extent in fact that throughout the whole length of the film I sat with a heavy heart and with a lump in my throat, but at the same time it allows us to celebrate the career and the achievements of a man highly capable and most determined to fight himself more than anything/anyone else. The scene where he breaks down in tears when his wife suggests of herself finally wanting to part from him is just..... If I see that again it could potentially lead me to depression. I would need days to get over it.A special mention for Eddie Redmayne. For a moment I had myself asking whether this is the Professor himself acting in the film! Equally, I would like to mention the film-makers for making his physical appearance look so similar.I can relate to a thousand things from the film and his life, yet on the other hand a lot of the things not because I have yet lived a third of his life. Most memorable one for me keeping in mind my personal experiences, has to be the bit about tracheotomy and the loss of speech caused by it. I could have had to face exactly the same but since thankfully mine was a less severe case I went against the advice of the doctors and was rewarded for my hard work and determination by regaining the ability to breathe independently (except whilst asleep) within weeks by training so hard. So the moment it was mentioned and alongside it him losing speech, it hit me hard, as it did to elder sister who watched the film with me. I wasn't willing on her to join me knowing how for an impact it could have on her, but I couldn't ask her to leave the room, the result of which is that she keeps mentioning the film again and again and is finding it difficult to forget it.It is a overall a very sensitive topic to comment on much, so I would refrain from doing that, but there perhaps a few things that could have been done or managed differently in order for him to avoid a lot of troubles and the heartaches that he had to bear, but again we have to keep in mind that the events discussed are from many, many years ago and people back then thought differently about things as we might do in this age. Also, this is hindsight for you, and it is a lot easier to analyse others' lives than to be in someone else's place.Again, a brilliant film from every angle.

This fervent quasi religious hagiography starts out as a tender saccharine love story in Cambridge,1963, but soon segues into a Medical Horror picture. It ultimately became an ordeal to sit through because hitherto unknown actor Eddie Redmayne got Hawking so right -- down to the last twisted tormented detail -- that it became sickening to watch after a while. If Eddie doesn't stumble off with the Best Actor Oscar this year it will be a major mystery. He should also be decorated with a Purple Heart for heavy suffering sustained in the line of duty. Felicity Jones is a revelation as the totally dedicated long suffering wife and her unwavering steadfast support needs to be recognized as well. The most curious aspect of this based-on-actual-facts tale is that, bent out of shape as he was, Hawking managed to impregnate wife Jane three times -- although the third time might have been an end run by choir master Jonathan. Apparently his brain was not the only organ spared by the onslaught of Lou Gehrig's disease. Altogether a worthy ordeal to sit through had it not been so weighed down with a ponderous musical score that felt like gravitational collapse. Plenty of heady cosmology in there for serious students of spacetime singularities and black hole leakage and a must- see for all who purchased Hawking's famous bestseller, \"A Brief History of Time\" but couldn't get past page two. In the last scene at a well attended public appearance Hawking is asked whether he believes in God, After a painfully long pause he launches into a long non-committal answer and receives a standing ovation from an audience that would prefer to think he believes ~~ but we who have read his later works know he's as much of as atheist as ever ~ Thank God! Five Stars for the Lush Cinematography, but viewer Beware -- this is not about Jelly Beans! -- plus an extra two for the inclusion, however brief, of two other Important cosmologists, Dennis Sciama and Roger Penrose.Sent from my iPad",

Felicity did a great job too and had a beautiful chemistry with Eddie. The music of the film was very beautiful and a great companion to the performances and the screenplay was beautiful and careful too. The story only focused on his suffering with a small glimpse about his extraordinary theory and his genius mind which seemed to me as a story of a person that was suffering from a rare disease and was challenging to live and came up with a tremendous theory which could fill some parts where the story was away from him focusing on his wife and how in my opinion she was as he told her in the beginning that she was unaware and taken when she offered that they marry by what she did in the movie in the end of the movie and when he lived more than two years which was so awful and a very bad ending to such a great effort done with such a great person and I would rather It showed any situation including his children and how they dealt with him and how they got used to him in that condition without deviating from his story and facing the disease and how genius he was.

His perspective about the mysteries in our boundless universe have been always hugely thought provoking at least for me. But evidently here emphasis on the scientific aspect is far less compared to the drama and romance. Still watching sensational genius fight the motor-neuron disease struggling to keep up his social life was soul-stirring. Eddie Redmayne's performance is mind-blowing, both physically and sentimentally.The movie's main focus is the relationship between Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his wife Jane (Felicity Jones). It opens up in 1963, when Stephen and Jane first meet. The romance is very refreshing, credits to the outstanding acting by both the lead plus the beautiful background score. Stephen's ultimate goal was to deduce an equation that would explain all the mysteries of the universe and its functioning which he termed as 'Theory of Everything'. His path unfortunately hits a huge bump when he is diagnosed with motor-neuron disease which slowly paralyzes his whole body. Jane still loved Stephen for the person he was, giving faith and hope to him and they both get married. Doctors had earlier predicted Stephen would only live 2 years after the onset of the disease yet Stephen determinedly outruns that time (Well at 72 today he is still devoted with science). Jane is struggling to manage their lives with Stephen's disability. After this it gets slightly overdrawn with all the drama in their married life. The science and romantic aspect of the films are highly enjoyable while the drama felt a bit bland. Fortunately it reverts back to science in the ending where Stephen is giving a talk and then following with a beautiful rewind into the his back to time he first met Jane. It was so mesmerizing.Theory of Everything is not perfect. The performances by it leads overpowers the script adapted from Jane's biography. Now I have not read the book, so I can't have a good perspective on that. Felicity Jones as Jane is very charming and lovely, some may find the decisions she took a bit faulty but one must try to understand about the situation she was in. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking is definitely going down as one of best performances in recent times.Wow such great acting seen in 2014. Will be tough-fight at the awards. The lovely score consisting mostly of piano is simplistic still engrossing. The many moments where Stephen struggles with his disability were tear inducing. Even if I wished there was more science stuff included, I would say enjoyed it more considering it as romantic story. This films romance is much better than many romance films we get in recent times. Not forgetting its flaws, The Theory of Everything may not be the best films of the year. It definitely was a wonderful,emotional and inspiring experience. RATING: [3.5/5]",

I also can't help but give a hand clap to some major actors in the film such as Eddie Reymaine and Felicity Jones who are able to hold there respective roles very well in the film and make there ideals known throughout.

A brilliant young scholar is struck down by a serious ailment and it given a short time to live.He, and his young love strive to make the most of whatever time they have left. They marry, conceive and bear and raise children. There is so much extra for us all to think about in this movie, ie, How would I cope in that situation, if I was afflicted, or if my partner was? Not as stoically as Stephen and Jane do, I suspect.Credit has to be given to Anthony McCarten for writing the screen- play. We don't really know how much of the great scenes and lines come from Jane's book, but, wherever they come from, they are great.My favourite might be where Jane's mother suggests that Jane should join the church choir, \"So English\" says Jane, but goes to the choir, and meets Jonathon. Beset by the pressures of looking after Stephen and the children, and needing and seeking support, she and Jonathon become more than friends.When a nurse comes into the house to look after Stephen, she and Stephen become attached. A post-script tells us that Jonathon and Jane are now happily married. Rather oddly, nothing is said about Elaine and Stephen? Apparently, they did marry, but later divorced.A bonus feature of the DVD is the \"Descriptive Video Service\" in which a voice-over explains what is going on. That is really helpful as there are scenes which are not well explained. That's worth an extra rating point! And...

            "content": "'The Theory of Everything' is James Marsh's biopic of scientific genius Stephen Hawking. Eddie Redmayne plays Hawking as we learn about his early days at university, his diagnosis of motor neuron disease, and the rise to his now iconic status. Marsh's direction is very good and he uses many point of view shots to create a huge sense of empathy for the main character. Marsh uses stunning visual effects in order to express Hawking's inner feelings and torment whilst highlighting his genius. The choice of music is also uplifting and echoes the key themes throughout the film.The screenplay is a really interesting piece of work and tells the story in a funny yet intriguing way. However, it does seem to lack a certain something as it tries to alter the source material in order to create some very conventional scenes.The performances in 'The Theory of Everything' are truly exceptional. Eddie Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking in a transformational and moving manner. You can barely recognise him as he highlights his illness with complete sincerity and plausibility. Felicity Jones plays his wife, Jane Wilde. I thought her role would be a simple one as she would work off of the powerhouse performance from Redmayne but the way she shows her strength and compassion is very moving and she does an excellent job.Overall, 'The Theory of Everything' is a fascinating film about a genius as he deals with his dibilitating illness. The maturity of everyone involved in this make it a remarkable movie.",

            "content": "Many people know Stephen Hawking for his groundbreaking discoveries, such as the discovery of black holes or his theory about the Big Bang. Others know him only as the British man in a wheelchair suffering from ALS who communicates through a computer voice with an American accent. James Marsh's biopic The Theory of Everything is about much more than these unique characteristics. While his illness is a strong focus, the film is primarily concerned with the impact it has on Hawking's private life, particularly on his relationship with his first wife Jane. Jane Hawking created the basis for this film with her book My Life with Stephen Hawking: Love Has Eleven Dimensions.Eddie Redmayne is tailor-made for the leading role of Stephen Hawking. Not only does he look identical to the real person in his younger years, but the way he communicates the continual loss of his motor skills is absolutely thrilling. This is why Redmayne's performance is so highly rated, as the illness in the film does not suddenly hit rock bottom from one scene to the next. His performance is especially close when you see that he wants to, but can't. This is especially difficult to watch in the interactions with his wife Jane, played by the great Felicity Jones. The chemistry and love story of the two main characters carries the film for long stretches, in which joy and sorrow are always right next to each other. Their coexistence is also further challenged by the implementations of important supporting characters from family, friendship and care-related backgrounds as the film progresses. It is clear to see that Redmayne and Jones were closely advised and informed by Jane Hawking on the details, as their performances always seem authentic and almost eerily real.In the end, The Theory of Everything is not a pure biopic about Stephen Hawking alone, but is just as much Jane Hawking's story. This is a welcome change, as films about so-called geniuses tend to aim to explore only this and the people directly involved tend to take a back seat. There is a lot of humanity in this film, which makes the person Stephen Hawking very tangible. The respect one has for this man, but also for his wife and family, is enormous. Nevertheless, it would have been just as important to focus more on Hawking's fundamental theories and inventions and not just to address them superficially. After all, the person Stephen Hawking is by no means defined only by his illness.",

The acting depicts the era very well with the very reserved attitude towards sex by people with this type of background. Stephen Hawking is an incredible man both physically and mentally. His concepts of Physics go way over my head. But the movie doesn't concentrate too much on the scientific side, it's more about their relationship. The make up team have done an incredible job making Eddie Redmayne look like Stephen Hawking! I do have one criticism, and that is I don't feel the movie truly portrayed the difficulty his wife had to take care of him and bring up three children at the same time. Surely, she had more help than was depicted in the movie? Having worked myself with severely physically disabled people, I know just exactly how hard the work is. His first wife deserves a lot more credit than she is given - both in the movie, and in real life.",

            "content": "The film is a biopic of Steven Hawking and concentrates on his personal relationships from his undergraduate days, right up to the present day, although this passage of time is never made entirely clear.I have an inbuilt aversion to biopics, so it will take a very good one to get me going and hold my attention. But at least I can be thankful as I was spared the usual nonsense of actors ageing before my eyes by the clever application of make-up, prosthetics, different hair styles, older clothing and so on. For me that never works - the aged characters just look like young characters in heavy make-up.We watch as the admirable Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking, slowly becomes physically afflicted by the crippling motor neurone disease, without visibly ageing. His wife, Felicity Jones, also barely ages at all, and I suppose we should be thankful for that.It really is an astonishing performance by Redmayne and his co-star, Jones is not only very pleasing to the eye, but is also very believable as his loving and long-suffering wife. The leading pair really do act their hearts out. The film garnered a large number of award nominations, and Redmayne scooped up a host of gongs for best actor, including the coveted Oscar.There is a lot of emotion in The Theory of Everything and there were even moments in the movie that I admit brought tears to my eyes. For the most part, I remained immersed in this utterly touching love story.It is the story of one the world's greatest geniuses being struck down in his teenage years by a fatal disease \u2013 which would usually have meant a life expectancy of two years - and of his gallant wife, who insists on marrying him, and is determined to stick by him, no matter what.We see how Hawking is undeterred by his terrible disease and becomes a world famous genius and celebrity, and how in the end, it becomes too much for his wife, who is eventually 'replaced' by one of his adoring carers.It is a good movie and it taught me a few things about the great man that I had not previously known, and it also told me a great deal about the struggles in his personal life.Yet, I wasn't 100% sold on this admittedly superior biopic. When all's said and done, it is a biopic, and as with any biopic it is difficult for a film in this genre to rise to movie greatness.If it had been made for the History Channel, it would quite possibly been a better film, as certain aspects of the story wouldn't have been compromised for dramatic effect. As a piece of entertainment the film, which celebrates Hawking's genius and triumph over impossible odds, is a success. As a biopic, telling us the life story of an extraordinary man, it is deeply flawed.For starters, there was an unanswered question that stuck with me throughout the movie. Why is Hawking still alive in his 70's when most sufferers of this disease die within two years after the onset of the illness? The question was never asked or discussed in any way, yet I imagine in the real life, everyone would be asking such a question. How is it that he continues to live? How many more years can he survive?After much Google research, I eventually found an explanation \u2013 but I shouldn't have had to do all that\u0085 I'm quite sure that I'm not the only one who was puzzled by this glaring omission.Even more annoying were the parts of his life story that were deliberately omitted and which I wasn't aware of until I read Hawking's Wikipedia page.There is a lot of detail in Wikipedia that is not included in the movie, including the need for a team of nurses to provide round the clock care to Hawking from a very young age. We didn't see so much as a single nurse in the entire movie \u2013 except when he was in hospital. We were left very much with the impression that his wife provided all the care, single-handed, although quite how she did it, with her need to bring up 3 children and study for a degree was never explained.Even worse was the omission of Hawking's relationship with one of his carers which turned so sour that there is a strong suspicion that he was abused. This eventually resulted in police intervention and for a few years, he became seriously estranged from his ex-wife and children. There is much more in his private life that is not mentioned and although the film deals sensitively with the breakdown of Hawking's first marriage, all the nasty, unpleasant stuff is well and truly swept under the carpet. The truth is well and truly sanitised. If it is supposed to be a biopic \u2013 then it does us a disservice.So as long as movie-goers understand that the movie is 'roughly based' on 'parts' of the life of Hawking, then go watch it and enjoy it. For me, it's a shame that such a good opportunity to tell the world about the real Stephen Hawking - warts an' all - has been wasted.",

            "content": "This film is about the life of Stephen Hawking - played by Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne - and his wife Jane - played by Academy Award Nominee Felicity Jones. When he was at Cambridge, he was diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease, with the doctors giving him only two years to live. Needless to say, he was distraught. But it was his love for Jane and her love for him that pushed him forward. Needless to say, he lasted way longer than two years. As his condition deteriorated, his mind soared to new heights and he is considered to be one of the best scientists of all time. But it was the struggles and the triumphs with Jane at home that really tested their relationship.You can't review this film and not talk about the phenomenal performance that comes from Eddie Redmayne. I simply cannot say ANYTHING bad about his performance here. He throws himself into the role and his dedication to it was absolutely astounding. Apparently, he sat in that wheelchair for so long that he altered his spine. But in the end, it was worth it, as his dedication and performance earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It was well earned and well deserved, as his performance reminded me of Daniel Day-Lewis' Oscar winning performance as Christy Brown in My Left Foot. Yes: Redmayne was THAT good.However, what makes this film truly great is that neither of the two leads outshine each other, which brings us to Felicity Jones' performance. Her performance provides the other half of the emotional weight of the film. As Jane, you can see how much she loves Stephen...how much she cares for him...and how much it crushes her to see his condition deteriorate. You can also see the emotional toll that it takes on her, as she balances dealing with a husband whose condition is worsening and kids running around the house. You can see the struggle that she faces while juggling all of these things. While Eddie Redmayne's performance was superb, Felicity Jones was just as good, and both of them provided the story with an amazing amount of drama.Absolutely go and see this movie. Go and see it for these two performances. While there were many great things about this film, it's really Redmayne and Jones that bring out everything great about it. It's the chemistry between them; it's the sadness between them; it's the joyfulness between them; it's everything between them. They are the film, and they truly shine!",

            "content": "Let me state the good things about \"The Theory Of Everything\". First, Eddie Redmayne does an excellent job of conveying the progressive degeneration of Stephen Hawking's condition. Felicity Jones is good, if a touch too saintly, as Jane Hawking. Secondly, the storyline of the film is formulaic but competent. This makes \"The Theory Of Everything\" pleasant, occasionally funny and occasionally emotionally involving.It is neither Redmayne's nor Jones' fault that that their parts bear only a passing similarity to the people they are depicting. However, it is wholly the writers' fault that the story departs grossly from Jane Hawking's book, upon which the film is said to be based, in several places. Characters are invented, scenes that never took place are interpolated into the story and some real events are shifted in time for purely dramatic effect in a way for which not even Stephen Hawking could provide a proof! In short, \"The Theory Of Everything\" has to be taken as mostly a fictional representation of the lives of the Hawkings.If you go to see this film simply to be entertained and don't mind whether or not what you see is accurate, then you will be entertained. However, if like me you dislike wondering whether or not one scene is reasonably true to the facts but the next one is an invention - or vice versa, or that both are true, or that both are fictional - you may be irritated.I find it troubling that so many films purporting to depict the lives of real people or historical events distort the truth with a total disregard for the consequences of spreading what, in effect, are lies. \"The Theory Of Everything\" falls squarely into this unedifying category.",

            "content": "\"There should be no boundaries to human endeavour. We are all different. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.\" - Stephen HawkingWho is Stephen Hawking? If you have to ask, you have not been paying attention for the past few decades. He is the world renowned physicist, cosmologist and author of A Brief History of Time and The Theory of Everything. Yet, what makes his life fascinating to those outside of the scientific world is that he contracted motor neurone disease (Lou Gehrig's Disease) at the age of 21 and was given two years to live, but has survived for many decades. His story expands beyond these components, but the film The Theory of Everything does a wonderful job of the telling of the relationship between the famous physicist and his wife, Jane. The film refers to his role and influence in the scientific world, but the primary focus of the story is their relationship and the influence they had on each others lives. The drama travels through how they met, to the awareness of his eventual handicap and their lifetime battle for his life, career and family. There might be apprehension with the documentary director, James Marsh at the helm, but it is unfounded because he manages to bring this docu-drama to life. With a central character that is restricted to a chair for the majority of the film, Marsh creatively capitalises on the character of Jane and the others that surround Hawking in his lifetime. The combination of the story and the actors masterfully playing their roles, this is a captivating film. The strengths of the film rely on the depth of the relational story and the brilliant casting. There are a multitude of characters in this tale that travels through six decades, but the heart of the story is reliant on Stephen and Jane. When their relationship is strong, the story is rich and engaging and when their relationship fails, the story suffers and brings in a necessary, but undesirable reality. This might sound strange in the realm of biopics, but the Hawking's story is appealing when they are closest and when they look outside of their relationship for comfort and solace, their gravitational appeal wains and the story loses footing. Eddie Redmayne (Les Miserables) and Felicity Jones (The Invisible Woman) are perfectly cast for the lead roles. They capture the attention and passion of the Hawking's relationship and travel through the time line with brilliant skills. The only weakness in their performance is their physical attractiveness. It is hard to imagine the actual characters were this good looking, but it does not hinder the tale. The director, James Marsh, manages to move the story through time without much difficulty. He keeps the story moving at a comfortable pace that helps to show the love and challenges that permeated the Hawking's lives. This story has the potential for the overly dramatic, or even worse, a boring narrative, but Marsh manages to keep the correct pace that is believable and engaging. Based on the commentary of the film, there are some nuances and artistic license that needed to occur to bring the story to the big screen, but none were compromising to the story or the characters. The Theory of Everything is a biopic of a world-renown physicist, but the intriguing component of the film is the philosophical and theological tracks that it travels down. Stephen is a firm believer in science and is an outspoken atheist and socialist. He is brilliant within his field, but when entering into the theological he is outside of his realm of expertise. The journey of his life portrayed in the film continually comes back to the necessity to answer the 'God' question. Jane is a Christian and their differences in belief of something beyond this world continued to be a source of conversation and study. In the attempt to define and discuss time and how the universe was created, he is continually confronted with the consideration of God and a creator. It might be easy to dismiss these considerations as part of Hawking's history, but the questions of sin, creation and God should be a consideration for anyone. The primary points of contention in the film came back to many of these universal questions that transcend time. The film is entertaining and educational, but do not be dismissive of the bigger questions that this film brings to light. Leaving the cinema... You do not need to be a scientist or a fan of The Big Bang Theory to enjoy this film. It will strengthen the fan base for Stephen Hawking, but it does humanise the man and his life. Eddie Redmayne will receive a multitude of award nominations for his portrayal of the chair- ridden physicist, but the heartbeat of the story is found in the relationship between Stephen and Jane. A film about science should challenge the brain, but who would have thought it would challenge the theological considerations of this world. This was a good film that will cause you to think more about life and God. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. How did the world come into existence?

In many ways this movie is a privilege for us to see things about Stephen and Jane Hawking, but also in many ways this is difficult to watch because we do not like to see anyone struggling with a non curable disease and also to see what wife Jane, as caregiver, goes through as well. We will see that our doing the most simple of things is quite difficult and complicated for Mr. Hawking to perform. I would suggest you keep a box of Kleenex handy as you will need it at times. Once Stephen Hawking is diagnosed to have ALS he is projected to live 2-years more. As we can see this did not happen and why he survives more than the 2-years is never explained or can be explained. Love? Divine Intervention? We needed to know his theories? Hmmmm\u0085\u0085The main focus for Stephen Hawking is that he wants to find an equation that will explain everything in the Universe. He believes he needs to prove that TIME had a beginning. The movie is about his marriage with science thrown in all the way through.

But here is what we do know: Mr. Hawking is a genius in our time and also has a great sense of humor. He has guested on The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory TV shows and some of his comments herein will also show his wit. Eddie Redmayne who portrayed Mr. Hawking did so flawlessly to such a point we only saw Stephen Hawking, not Eddie Redmayne. What a great job. Kudos. Felicity Jones as Jane Hawking brought tremendous amounts of compassion to this story and sometimes we felt what she felt as we reached for that Kleenex box. We see many scenes between Stephen and Jane that are more than touching and are Pure Gold. Mr. Redmayne won the Oscar for Best Actor and Felicity Jones was nominated for Best Actress and it should have been awarded to her. (and not because you think she is very pretty?) The movie itself was nominated for Best Picture and it should have won for that. In our lives we tend to pray for family and friends at times. Keep in mind that it is okay to pray for geniuses too. Even though Doctor Stephen Hawking is an avowed Atheist, I don't think he would mind. At least I hope not. (10/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No Language: No.",

The film tells the story of Stephen Hawking from his Cambridge period days onwards ..Hawking was given 2 years to live when he was first diagnosed with the motor neuron disease that he has and the Love of his first wife kept him alive no doubt. The fact that he only had 2 years to live and had over ran that was brought in only at the last section of the film and it should have been brought in much earlier its omission and misplacement in the story line was as noticeable as a toothless grin. I had also expected a bit more conflict , angst from his first wife when the 2 years came and went and Mr Hawking was still alive and she had no home help to assist her ...Notwithstanding the film is a good one and Eddie deserves both a Bafta and an Oscar for his acting abilities as he really honed in his skills and talent. Where there is life there is hope and this film does try to give hope to all",

            "content": "\"There should be no boundaries to human endeavor. We are all different. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.\" From British director James Marsh's definitive storytelling (Man on Wire) and from former wife of Hawking's Jane Wilde's book 'Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen' unfolds the beautiful, bittersweet tale of an extraordinary human being with an extraordinary mind of whom would revolutionize the world of theoretical physiology and cosmology as we know it and of whom cherished life's most precious gift: time itself. Does time play a main character in and of itself as does Redmayne Dr. Hawking? Let's take a look. Dr. Stephen Hawking is played to a demanding, poignant and nuanced perfection by a bravura performance delivered by Eddie Redmayne (Les Mis\u00e9rables). From prestigious beginnings at Cambridge University in the early 1960's, to falling in love with the beautiful church-going Jane Wilde played by Felicity Jones (The Amazing Spider-Man 2) to encountering Lou Gehrig's disease later on, he earns his doctorate in cosmetology, marries and becomes a father, only being told by a doctor he had two years left to live. Through this, we with Hawking begin to see and sense the world as he does for the two hours we spend with him: we laugh, we emote concern and get a lump in our throats when we see this unshakable human being embrace his fate and choose to live even more so than ever before. His wife also chooses to love him despite what is going to take over his body, but raising children and taking care of his personal needs grows wearisome. Help comes in the form of a church choir leader named Jonathan Hellyer Jones(Charlie Cox), a kindly man of whom lost his wife to leukemia a year prior. Eventually he becomes as one of the members of the Hawking family, teaching the children piano to sharing a holiday on the beach through a voyeur's eye of a Super 8 lens. Though permanently confined in a wheelchair with his condition worsening, and with only an American computer to speak for him after his voice is lost due to muscle tissue damage in the throat, Hawking decides to write his bestseller A Brief History of Time. He goes to America with his personal nurse Elaine,leaving Jane to stay with Jonathan, of which they started showing mutual feelings towards each other and would prefer the children have a new father who will help Jane with her tasks in parenthood as well. Despite all the fame and fortune one could ever receive in a lifetime, no one can ever buy back the untouchable, vast entity that is time. We either have too much or either too little. It is invisible yet all around us at every waking moment. Though we can never touch or grab more in our clutches and store it away in a vault for the future, through the bespectacled \"always dirty\" but rose-colored glasses, Hawking can smile despite his disease and accepts it for what it is, as we do when we watch him conjugate ineffable theoretic notions of galaxies and black holes while also keeping an edge of humor to nourish and enlighten the lives and souls of those and around him. In this bittersweet story of love, loss and life itself, time does indeed have its way of changing the world and people around us, but is never able to penetrate the will of appreciating every moment for what it is truly worth. So...'A Beautiful Mind' meets 'My Left Foot'? Maybe, maybe not. For me, spending two hours in a theater watching the life a paralyzed genius unfold was a very brief history in time indeed, but a truly memorable one spent at that, and, at age 73, the life of Dr. Hawking still continues to go onward even still.",

            "content": "Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for his performance as the cruelly disabled Stephen Hawking in this film, and you can see why. He has mastered amazingly the contortions and ticks that advancing Motor Neurone Disease inflicted upon the increasingly famous cosmologist. But his depiction of Hawking's earlier days at Cambridge is also impressive, helped by careful attention to detail and also by a fairly strong physical resemblance.Sadly, though, this performance alone cannot make for a great film. The story here is not really about Hawking's scientific breakthroughs, nor about his perhaps less appreciated role in popularising science with his hugely successful books; but mainly it centres in his first marriage to Jane Wilde, played by Felicity Jones. Hers is also a bravura performance, but, as many people have noted, she does not appear to age over the decades' span of the story.The real problem though is a nagging feeling that something is missing. Many people will know already the key facts of this story, and the film, in reality, does not reveal much more. It's not just the lightness of the science, nor the way in which his earlier public appearances do not appear to figure in the story, but even the main theme of the marriage feels incomplete. Perhaps it's because the screenplay is based largely on Jane Wilde Hawking's own book, and all the major players were alive when the film was produced.Inevitable pressures in the relationship are hinted at, but what we see still seems rather sugar-coated. When Jane is challenged as to the fatherhood of their third child, we realise we've seen little of the intimacy of their marriage, but also we barely seem to have scratched the surface of Jane's other ambiguous relationship with choirmaster Jonathan Jones (played by Charlie Cox).It's a shame, because no one's about to revisit this story since there's little chance they will be able to match Redmayne's central interpretation.Still. The film is worth watching for its strong performances. 6/10.",

We do not see, but feel so much. This is why a film without so much plot can get away to become an art piece. What is best in this film is the sense of restraint, owing, I believe, to Mr. Marsh. He must have directed Eddy Redmayne and the rest of the cast to feel first and act later. Probably an act is not necessary, if you feel so accurately. I am always marveled by the English school of acting. Big or small screens. They do wonders with the mundane of lives in particular. While Americans look for something extraordinary, English instead eye for the normality, which always turns out to be not so normal. Professor Hawking, as well as his beloved Jane, come alive in this film. They are actually alive, and this film will ensure that they are, even after they no longer are. A scene of their breakup is amazing. Loving, painful, understanding, and heartbreaking. How can four feelings be incorporated into one scene, I still wonder? That's life, isn't it? Bittersweet at best, and always conflictual at extremes. If there is a caution for Eddy Redmayne, it is by way of being tied to the same or similar character. Felicity Jones, on the other hand, will continue to be versatile and multi-purposed. The Oscar-winning brand can also be a curse, one of which I wish all the best for our dear Mr. Redmayne.",

Meanwhile, the story is already moving on to the next stage of life.In a biopic about Stephen Hawking, the subject matter of his illness must not be missing. Here the movie manages to keep the balance between drama and positive/funny moments. There are well-dosed elements from both sides.On a positive note, the acting performance of Eddie Redmayne has to be highlighted. It was really good. His portrayal of Stephen Hawking was authentic and genuine throughout and never seemed forced. The increasing physical deterioration is touching and shows strength to still want to make the best of his life.The movie is interesting, well made and entertaining.

So there is very little science, all things considered, which was kinda disappointing. You know very little about his colleagues, about his own discoveries. The actors are great, and some scenes are memorable though. But all in all it was disappointing in one particular aspect: accuracy.It shows Hawking as very understanding, and as his wife sacrificing everything once she knows he has the disease. Except she KNEW he was sick BEFORE dating him in real life, while the movie shows the opposite... Moreover, you don't feel the years she had to suffer taking care of himself and the kids alone while he refused exterior help. In the movie you feel like the first time he sees her suffering he says \"ok we need help\". That is not what happened. This is the issue when you wanna show a period of 40 years in one movie, you can't show all the suffering and disputes, as it would be too much to take in for the audience. I've heard that Hawking had a great sense of humor which is shown here, but I've also heard that he can be a jerk, and you don't see that here at all. It's too mellow, despite the disease, and the complex platonic relationship with Jonathan. It's also too Americanised: a lot of orchestral music to trigger emotions at specific moments, I hate that.It was the exact same issues with Les Intouchables: the music is too present, and they don't show the reality. In the real story of Les Intouchables, Omar Sy's character was closer to a real criminal, was violent. Once there is a discussion where you hear \"maybe we should tone it down for the public\" it's over, you can't make a great movie out of it.",

But I'm glad I did see this wonderful film. For his deeply-moving story is a revelation, exquisitely realised by Eddie Redmayne, as Hawking, and Felicity Jones, as his wife, Jane, under the direction of James Marsh.Here is this amazingly bright young man on the verge of a brilliant academic career as a cosmologist. He falls in love with a beautiful, intelligent girl and she with him. Their life is set on course for a glittering future when he is struck down by a tragedy of Beethoven-like proportions - a man who may well be about to produce the 'theory of everything', the holy grail of physics, is diagnosed with an incurable terminal disease and is given but a short time to live.And yet somehow, against all predictions, he does not die. Not only that, he manages to fulfil and exceed all expectations, both professionally and personally. He writes books, he wins prizes and accolades, he fathers a family. With the loving support of his wife, Jane, he becomes truly The Man Who Refused to Die. But even then there is still a heavy price to pay ...It is no surprise to see that Redmayne won an Oscar for his performance here. His portrayal of Stephen Hawking's gradual faltering collapse is totally convincing, as is Felicity Jones's depiction of Jane Hawking as the exuberance, optimism and energy of youth are eroded away as the years pass and the sheer strain of keeping her husband and family functioning leaves its mark. How cruel life can be!But there is nothing mawkish about this film. It looks unflinchingly at the sadness and the joys, the successes and the failures, the beginnings and the endings.

Do you know who won Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role? That's right, it was the wonderfully talented Eddie Redmayne! He plays in the movie The Theory of Everything, the role of the fascinating Stephen Hawking. This is one movie that is hard to forget and Eddie did a fabulous job in painting Stephen's portrait for future generations to come - the way he walked and talked made me instantly feel like I was watching the real Stephen. Based on the book 'Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen' - the memoir written by Jane Hawking - the film catches the transformation of Stephen, along with their relationship.*** Jane was his first wife and she was the one who supported him throughout his growing illness. The movie - to the regret of many - does not follow the scientific discoveries or his theories in detail, but rather focuses on his human side and his relations with other people. It is to be expected, I believe, knowing that the movie is after a book written by Jane. She wanted the world to know Stephen from the human side, and not see him as a robot / as someone who could not be touched. The great center of the movie most believe it to be Stephen, but I believe it is Jane. Even though she wanted us to see him in a different light, what I can see - more than anything - is her wonderful personality and the way she cares about him. Jane is not the kind of person who would stand out of the crowd and I believe she does not like publicity either. She wanted people to know Stephen more and respect him as a human being. In return, somehow, she managed to let us see her as she truly is: a powerful human being! She is stubborn in her decisions and also has enough courage for the both of them - without her I believe Stephen would not be the man he is today! *** The Theory of Everything is a love story, and as you know not all love stories have happy endings. I must admit I wished somehow for a miracle and Stephen to be able to walk and talk again and be with Jane and have a wonderfully talented family, but God works in mysterious ways! After 25 years of marriage, Jane divorced Stephen... Should I mention that Stephen Hawking actually had to have his tears wiped away after viewing this movie?

When watching the film you sorry for Jane and even understand her want and desire to still be loved and touched, and for some reason when you see the connection with Jonathon, you almost want it to happen. There is nothing awful or \"Cheat\" or cheap about it, and most films when trying to show the whole \"Burning candle\" of love from when it is lit-ten to when it is blown out, always makes one person seem cheap, or dirty or bad and make you hate them.

I was also surprised to see the story was written by his wife, Jane, which made it all the more interesting for me.

I have seen so many biopics earlier each had its own place in a way but this one will always stay special to me, the actors, story, narrative, even the landscapes, photography, the very lights in each frame just blew me away. And It wasn't done yet, I still listen to the OST of this film, after 2 years since I saw it, and Arrival of Birds is one of the top played songs on my playlist. I would love to elaborate on the story and how fascinated I was to watch this beautifully crafted film but that wouldn't be called a review, it would be called a thesis, Just kidding.

Felicity Jones, however, was utterly amazing and deserves all the awards she has been nominated for. There were a couple of excellent lines of dialogue in there, but on the whole the script felt as if it was still in the drafting process. The camera-work was above average, yet at times felt like an Instagram submission. On top of this, I now feel guilty for not enjoying a film that's supposed to be awesome.

Everyone knows Stephen Hawking is beyond gifted but I was struck by how strong and extraordinary Jane Hawking is. Stephen defies the odds both medically and scientifically. Eddie Redmayne puts in a fine performance, bringing out the humour Stephen possess that captivates the women in his life. I would quite happily support his winning the Academy Award this year but I suspect the Academy will want him to pay his dues a little longer. This is a lovely movie that captures the essence of a love and the realities of dealing with a terrible illness alongside great triumphs.It is quietly powerful and touching without being mawkish or clich\u00e9d.

            "content": "There are only two biopics that have been about Stephen Hawking \u2014one of the biggest figures in scientific history and the most famous scientist in the world. The first was back in 2004 where he was played by Benedict Cumberbatch for a TV movie, and now, ten years later, we have The Theory of Everything. Where the former, simply titled Hawking, focused on just the early days of Hawking's career and dealings with motor neuron disease, the latter follows Hawking and his wife, Jane, over several decades. The result is a powerful, often heartbreaking, yet nonetheless hopeful movie about love and the hope that life gives, but it also tends to aim too high for the stars at times.We start the film in 1963 where Stephen is working on his PhD. The symptoms of his disease are already apparent; we can see it in his walk, the way he holds things. He meets Jane, and awkwardness aside, they strike up a lovely relationship. Stephen is shy, yet oddly charming. Jane is beautiful and timid. When he finds out he has motor neuron disease he attempts to push her away because he is predicted only two more years of life. She resists, the two get married, and we are whisked away into the future.This movie, not propelled by the story, is rocketed forward by its performances. Eddie Redmayne, who is surely going to get an Oscar nomination, brings life and hope to a person we have only seen portrayed once before. There are such things as a career- defining performance, and this may just be one of those. His deterioration is painful and hard. It is hard for Jane, it is hard for him, and it is hard for us. Yet there are moments where Stephen's shining light comes through and he pushes past the pain and hardships. He cracks jokes and is often quite funny. The disease is not in control of him because even though he can't control his limbs, he can control his mind. The amount of dedication put into his role is astounding. He brings the early years of Stephen Hawking to life with such lucidity that we feel as though we might actually be watching a documentary.Felicity Jones, who plays Jane, is utterly delightful at the beginning. She is that type of person you want to meet and be with. She is caring and loving. As the years go by and Stephen gets worse, she has to go with the blows and try to maintain the promise of love she gave him. She sacrifices everything for him despite having the opportunity to get away. Jones, also a shoe-in for a nomination, brings the compassion and loving we expect but also the conflicted and sometimes bitter resentment of the life she lives. Her character could be considered more painful than even Hawking because of the life she has chosen to live, and Jones delivers a powerful performance where we both pity and support her.The story, though, suffers at times when it seems like it cannot decide its focus. Aside from focusing on their relationship, we also see the deterioration of Hawking, his attempts to make a breakthrough in astrophysics, and several over moments that might be considered as spoilers. For a title that evokes a sense of grand scope, it never can pinpoint one emotional core of the film to focus on. The film is advertised as the story their marriage, so the other threads feel like an attempt to add material about what Hawking actually did but it never goes into a huge amount of detail about what a huge impact he had in his realm of studies.The supporting cast is substantial as well, but it often feels overpowered by the magnificent leads. David Thewlis, Charlie Cox, and Maxine Peake all do great jobs in their roles, but they cannot quite stand up to Jones and Redmayne. Beneath all of the powerful performances are a wonderful score and beautiful cinematography. Time is ever-apparent on screen and we get many ways in which the camera manipulates time which leaves us dazzled and full of emotion.In the end, The Theory of Everything is all about the performances \u2014it has some of the best you will see all year. It is a film about love, time, and the bonds that last throughout the years. It is about the power of the human mind\u2014and heart\u2014despite harsh adversity. The actors are so spellbinding in their roles that even the issues with the story hardly detract from the powerful message the film has to send. So, if you have a love for science, romance, or Stephen Hawking, The Theory of Everything will leave you dazzled and inspired.for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com",

The film takes a looks beyond Hawking's genius and into his life, its trials and tribulations and how he took on every challenge life threw on his path. It is inspiring, so the very least. The film is beautifully shot with heartfelt performances from the two lead players. I was especially impressed with Eddie Redmayne, who clearly invested a lot in his performance to bring Hawking to life. He never breaks from the character physically and is yet able to emote perfectly. A special mention for Felicity Jones' portrayal of Hawking's wife Jane. She is treat to watch on screen.

            "content": "What one must be aware of before stumbling into the cinema was the genre of this film; with all the publicity surrounding the scientist Stephen Hawking and this movie based on the book written by his ex-wife Jane it should be pretty obvious that this was a love story, yet there were still grumbles from moviegoers expecting to see a motion picture version of \"A Brief History of Time\" and were thus disappointed. This was a moving tale of love and perseverance and was nevertheless saddening as the relationship was doomed from the start. Not from the disease crippling Stephen, but from the clash of personalities. It was crystal clear that these two were as different as \"black and white\" (pointedly stated by Stephen's sister at Jane's first visit). He came from a family with professional and scientific training and rationality and logic flow in their veins. She was a devout believer and flourished in the domain of the Arts - Tennyson, Blake and medieval Spanish poetry. They might have been attracted to each other as opposites at first, but this was likely going to have dwindled with further courtship - that did not occur as they were forced to gamble with Stephen's \"numbered days\". And there lay the real tragedy. With Jane's sense of responsibility, her commitment, her integrity, her docility and her love for Stephen, she had made this marriage work much longer than it would have if Stephen had been able-bodied. He, of course, being the domineering partner, had often used this to his advantage. Human nature being what it is, one could not blame Stephen. Even when with his intelligence and cynicism, he would have foreseen Jane's predicament when they accepted a stranger and his help into their family. Yet Stephen \"did not object\"; I tend to be kind and do not think Stephen tried to manipulate Jane with her \"predictable affair\", instead it was perhaps Stephen's way of finding someone to take care of the family with his decline and his impending demise. Accolade must be given to the actor playing Stephen, his accurate depiction of the disease progression and his stunningly realistic portrayal of the muscle twitches and the loss of voluntary control reflected hours of studying anatomy, kinetics and choreography with endless practice. This was performance worthy of an Oscar. I quite enjoyed the movie despite feeling wistful afterwards.",

The film really is first class and tells a story of Hawking's life (I say \"a story\" not \"the story\") extremely well. As a piece of story-telling it is an example to hold up to other film-makers. It is of course a crowd-pleaser and a tear-jerker, but what is wrong with that - it is what we expected after all. It keeps well clear of the \"science\" of course - again, to be expected. The main focus is on his terrible disease and the impact on his marriage. Hawking's attitude to his wife however is shameful and I suspect that the film and indeed her book glosses over some things - after all, who could be critical of a man who has suffered so much? I watched this film in an excellent VUE cinema with a 4K Sony projector, and the images shot by Beno\u00eet Delhomme on the Alexa were beautiful and very subtle. A few close-up shots suffered from poor focus and others from clumsy focus-pulling but in an average cinema I doubt anyone would notice. His colour palette and the colour grading was very clever - quite a bright sunny almost Kodachrome look which contrasted with Steven's terrible disease but fitted with his amazing smile. This is a very good film indeed.",

It's a shame because it's a lot nicer than St. John's college, as Hawking would no doubt agree. I feel bad for the actors like Redmayne and Jones who had to film right outside Cripps Court (Google that building and you'll see what I mean).It's safe to say that Felicity Jones carries the movie. She deals with the emotional side, the unseen part of Hawking's life and the burden of having to study MML at Cambridge. I think Redmayne is good in his role but not outstanding or Oscar worthy. I've heard reviews saying his eyes were doing incredible acting when he was in the later part of the film, but I think a lot of that had to do with the hair & makeup rather than him.On the whole it's not a bad film but it's definitely Sunday afternoon viewing rather material rather than Academy Award material.

The story takes a natural run and the dedicated stakeholders find themselves in a relationship that has exactly opposite connotations; it edifies and strengthens, while slowly debilitating the long lasting promise of the female spouse. From the start, James Marsh perfected in being banal and ordinary, doing nothing fabulous with the movie except comprehensible story-telling, and one of the most astounding and cherished performances of all time. The latter holds utterly true for the male performance.

This diagnosis follows Eddie Redmayne's (Hawking) collapse, which is backed by Johann Johannson's Chalkboard. It was this scene that came out of the screen to hold my right ear and whisper, \"How you like me now?\" The next ninety minutes have been inscribed on my heart and mind almost permanently. Eddie pulls off a Daniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot) performance. What other complement does he need than Stephen Hawking's own tears dripping down his cheeks while watching the movie (this actually happened).Back to the movie. Stephen's then companion, Jane, offers to accompany him because she loves him and they get married. Partly restricted by his physical state, Hawking starts to focus on the origins of time in his PhD thesis. His work opens new horizons to the study of time and cosmology. Although he is initially undermined by a few renowned professors, his work is regarded with global appreciation. Hawking, when asked by Professor Dennis of he would like to do after his PhD, responds that he would prove his theory that even time had a start.Concurrently, the physicist finds his illness worsening but Jane's dedication continues to be conducive to his mental and physical upbringing. Hawking decides to write a book on \"time\" and titles it \"A Brief History of Time\". He colleagues and admirers assist him with an exclusive gadget on which he can write with the properly functional body parts, his fingers. Finally the book is launched, and Hawking's cerebrum dominates the intellectual market. His book goes viral and over ten-million copies were sold. At this stage, he is left terribly desolated by his own \"self\". He can't speak, he can't breathe in the way a normal person does (he has a ventilator for that), and is entirely guided by his intrinsic cognitive incandescence, affection, and support from kins and peers. But even that starts to fade away as Hawking's dearly celebrated \"time\" passes and his wife gets concentrated with love for Hawking's former caretaker, Jonathan. This is juxtaposed with Elaine, her current caretaker, who is affectionate towards Hawking, and later in time, they both get married (not shown in the movie).Hawking is invited to the Queen as a gesture of appreciation from the royal family for all his astounding achievements. The last scene shows him and Jane, who are still married, just outside the royal palace, and Hawking writes the most sentimental comment of the movie, \"Look what we made\". The screen shows their three children, and then \"time\" reverses, metaphorically asserting his stance on traveling back in time. The curtains close with a sound cadence of music that culminates the very content of the movie and leaves audience with a contradictory state of happiness and emotional distress.Throughout the movie, I didn't think of the direction, nor the script. Therefore, I didn't think The Theory of Everything had any chance of winning when it was finally nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, and I was quite appreciative of the Academy for not nominating the James Marsh for Best Direction, which otherwise would have been an unnecessary and sympathetic nomination. If you look at it, the movie had nothing except Eddie Redmayne's so \"cussying\" real-life depiction of Stephen, Stephen's original life that he lived, University of Cambiige's prodigious establishment(for the first quarter of the movie), and Johann Johannsson's goose-bumping score, which unfortunately lost to Alexander's comical for The Grand Budapest Hotel (I wish Academy starts giving runner-up awards too.) But just this was enough to qualify it for \"thumbs-up\" from me.What I can never forget is how the movie ends. I was in tears. It was a conundrum for me\u2014I felt shivering, because I long for such a moment myself, where I can say \"Look what we made,\" and follow back on my steps to see accomplishment, and struggle, because anything that comes without it loses its charm. I'm feeling the same thing while writing this review. Maybe I'm being melodramatic, but it feels really strong.",

Overall, it is beautifully done as I much enjoyed watching it.Jane supposes Stephen is only able to carry on with his life for 2 more years. Her rushed and maybe a little bit impulsive love for him compels her to get married with him. Through the depiction of the movie, even though Stephen's life lasts for many more years, Jane doesn't regret her decision. Indeed, they have 3 children, implying that their sex life is quite vivid. However, she alone has to bear too much. From looking after her children and her husband, she still pursues her personal career. I believe this is much appreciable. Education is in fact endless; one's family should not be an obstacle to impede one's ability to reach beyond the limit. Furthermore, maybe the fact that Stephen has become a well-known scientist worldwide, Jane also finds it imperative to hold an equivalent position. No matter what motivates her, the desire for higher education is highly admirable.Accumulated pressures shout at her the need for a person to confide in. That's when Jonathan appears. He shares the burden, helping her bringing the children up. More importantly, his presence allows her not to have all her time consumed by Stephen. It greatly relieves her stress, alleviating her circumstances. The story reminds of the life of Nikolai Ostrovsky. He was a disabled veteran and largely depends on his wife for the living. He published a book, thanks to his wife's efforts writing whatever he says. Together, these two instances illustrate the role of a wife in the family. Imagine the same man without his wife, would he be able to achieve what he has done? It is indeed beautiful to see how love is still capable of empowering us, at the same time waiting hopefully when our turn comes",

While Redmayne has been rightfully nominated for an Oscar, and gives audiences plenty to marvel at and weep about, ultimately this film is too simplistic and formulaic a vehicle to justify him winning Best Actor. Running over two hours, the film is slow-paced, sentimental and sugar coated throughout. The action centres on Stephen Hawking's marriage with Jane Wilde, and was based on Wilde's book. This is probably the central weakness of the film. Hawking's affliction with motor neurone disease, and Wilde's heroic efforts to hold Hawking and his family together, provide much of the dramatic interest. However, we are never privileged with a revealing account of the marriage and developments later in Hawking's personal life are left unexplained. You get the sense that the writers are simply not willing to share these details, and the film's direction is either too hamstrung or unimaginative to suggest what might be going on in other ways.",

            "content": "I already started crying in the beginning and I simply could not stop. I never thought this would be the most emotional movie I've watched.This movie tells the story of the famous physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane. At a young age Hawking gets a muscle disease and doctors assume he only had 2 years the life. This is were I started crying. I think it's beautiful how his, then still, girlfriend told him she'd stay with him until the end. Here I cried even harder. They try to live their life the best without thinking to much about the future and the even start a family. You can see how they both struggle, but still manage to stay strong. That's a thing I really liked about this movie, how well the emotions are portrayed. I also loved how Stephen's personality didn't change because of his condition. He still had a good sense of humour and everyone loved him for it!So the storyline started off strong, but it stopped getting better half way through. I still cried, but I didn't like how they focussed more on the relationship between Jonathan and Jane than her relationship with Stephen. His relation with Elaine on the other hand, happens very fast and we don't really get to see how it ends, nor did they give them a happy ending like they did with Jane. The whole ending was actually a big anticlimax, because I literally stopped crying.As I said, the movie involves their love story, so it doesn't focus too much on his discoveries and theories. If you've read the description before watching the movie, that probably didn't bother you, but if you haven't, like me, the title is very misleading. I thought it would be more about his work, while it's actually only about his disease and his relationship with Jane.The movie is visually so beautiful and the acting is simply outstanding. Redmayne did a great job, he really made me feel things. The rest of the cast was decent too, but I don't think anyone can surpass the lead in this.It's a good love story though and I also love how his friends helped him so much. I'd defend recommend you it if you want to see a story about love and friendship and need a good cry!",

            "review_title": "\"Theory Of Everything\" Is Fascinating Biopic Of Stephen Hawking",
            "content": "I've read that some biblical scholars don't consider the New Testament to be a series of books about Jesus, but rather a series of books about Paul. Sure, the four gospels take us through the life of Jesus, but the remaining books either document Paul's ministry following Jesus' death, or they are Paul's epistles. These scholars have a point. While Jesus is the central figure, his acts and his teachings are seen through the recently-converted eyes of his greatest disciple.The same could be said for James Marsh's new film biography of physicist Stephen Hawking. Yes, Hawking is the central figure, but the story is told through the eyes of his wife, Jane Hawking. At first, I was bothered by the fact that Hawking's wife was given so much prominence in a film that should have dealt more with Hawking's scientific theories. But about halfway through, it dawned on me that this is not so much Hawking's story as it is that of his wife.Now, why would Marsh choose this approach? First, the film is based on Jane Hawking's memoir, so it's automatically as much her story as it is his. But I believe Hawking is a difficult character to ask the masses to relate to. His brilliance exceeds the mental capacities of most viewers so much that another character must be used as a conduit to bring Hawking within our mental grasp, if you will.Try to imagine a motion picture about Albert Einstein. A filmmaker could spend two hours attempting to explain the theory of relativity to the masses \u2013 a difficult, and not particularly interesting approach \u2013 or he could spend two hours disseminating Einstein's genius through the lens of another \u2013 a spouse, childhood friend, or professional colleague. Remember Milos Forman's \"Amadeus?\" A film biography about Mozart would have been fine, but it was Oscar-worthy when told through the jealous eyes of his less-talented rival Salieri. And the New Testament would have been fine had it stopped after the fourth gospel. But it only becomes tangible when filtered through the first great promulgator of his teachings.Young British actor Eddie Redmayne plays Hawking, and perfectly captures his genius, which becomes more focused as the years progress. At the same time, of course, Hawking's ability to communicate diminishes due to his motor neuron disease. Some critics have complained that Redmayne's performance isn't as strong as that of Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of artist Christy Brown, who suffered from cerebral palsy. I say Redmayne has, in a way, a more difficult task than Day-Lewis, because Hawking simply doesn't possess the fiery personality of Brown. Hawking is a fairly easygoing guy \u2013 especially considering his physical condition \u2013 and Redmayne does an excellent job of showing us his sly sense of humor, even without a voice. It's a great piece of acting, which is deserving of a Best Actor nomination.Meanwhile, it would be a crime if the academy does not also nominate Felicity Jones as Best Actress, in what I consider to be the best performance anyone's given in any film so far this year. Jones perfectly captures Jane Hawking's tender and supporting love for her husband, coupled with the inner strength she summons to live her own life. She is, at once, the gatekeeper of her husband's growing legacy, the strength he requires to lead as \"normal\" a life as possible, and a woman determined to carve her own niche in this world. The understated nuances of Jones' acting are a joy to watch.While \"The Theory of Everything\" suffers somewhat by never even making an attempt to explain Hawkings' teachings, that fault diminishes as the film progresses. Jane's independence and Stephen's stubbornness eventually lead to a split in their relationship and, eventually, their marriage. This turns out to be the most interesting section of the film, because their love and respect for each other never wavers, even as their lives begin to take on different trajectories.\"The Theory of Everything\" is more a love story than it is a story about science. Don't expect to learn about what's inside Hawking's brain, but rather how it relates to those around him. Do expect to see a fascinating story about a modern-day genius and the independent woman who always has his back.",

I didn't know anything about the Hawkings prior and was expecting a documentary of Hawking's life with loving wife. So I was surprised to see how their relationship evolved and the struggles they encountered. Contrary to popular belief, their relationship is not one one would aspire to.

            "content": "I know almost nothing about Stephen Hawking's real life, so I have no comparison between that and the movie. However, I thought the transformation the actors underwent was breathtaking. Eddie Redmayne WAS Stephen Hawking in this movie (and has already been nominated for a 2015 Golden Gold award for best actor). Hawking is adorable and charming only to discover he has a disease that will cease muscle function. The true scientist, he asks if it affects his brain (no, it doesn't). Redmayne changes from a bit clumsy to nearly completely immobile in an electric wheelchair with a computer to speak for him. If you compare pictures of the actor and the physicist, they are amazingly same.Hawking had already been courting a young woman named Jane (played by Felicity Jones) when he learns he has 2 years to live. When she hears what will happen to him, Jane says she loves him. The two are married, and while Hawking's muscles stop working, the family grows (the couple have 2 children; there are no muscles in the penis, of course). Hawking, though almost completely immobile, is shown as funny, loving, and a good father. I watched as Felicity Jones changed from a bright, strong young woman working toward a degree in Literature to a woman who was so strong that it was often difficult to tell if she was struggling; she seems to know what Hawking wants before he can ask for it.Jane is struggling to care for Hawking and 2 kids. The film suggests she doesn't want to seem a failure because she is working so hard, but how can she not face difficulty? Not only are there physical issues and typical family problems, but Hawking is invited to lecture and travel, too. When Jane joins the choir at church (at the suggestion of her mother), she meets the director, Jonathan (Charlie Cox), a man who is handsome, widowed, and helpful. One can't help but wonder if the mother knew Jonathan had all those qualities, which was the motive behind her suggestion. You want to hate Jonathan because you know he's going to encroach on Hawking's family, but watch as Jonathan actually does help the family. Hawking is friends with Jonathan, who is ever the gentleman. Really, it felt ingenious of the director to choose Cox; he was the lovable, adorable Tristan in Stardust. It would almost be too much to believe Cox was capable of hurting the Hawking family. However, once a 3rd baby is born, the couple's families want to know if the baby's father is Jonathan or Hawking. Jane says there is no way the baby could belong to Jonathan, and Jones makes you believe her with her steely gaze and stern mouth.Eventually, the Hawkings must accept help from a nurse, and this is when Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake) is hired to care for Hawking. After meeting him, Elaine tells Jane that Hawking is brilliant and the model patient, and that Jane is lucky. After years as his personal nurse, this is not what Jane wants to hear from the new lady. Elaine seems to \"get\" Hawking's non-scientific side in a way that makes Jane seem impatient. When a copy of a pornographic magazine arrives, Hawking types into his speaking machine, \"That is for a friend.\" The scene shows Hawking's humor, and Elaine, also amusing, puts the magazine for him on a music stand and asks when he wants the pages turned. Peake is delightful as Elaine Mason, but I've read that a nurse accused Peake of abusing Hawking, so I felt suspicious of the woman in the movie (even though the film depicts her so that we like her).Ultimately, time tells us that Hawking marries Elaine, and that Jane marries Jonathan, though Jane and Hawking remain good friends.The film is based on Jane Hawking's book Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen Hawking. If you look on Goodreads, the book has 100+ reviews, meaning it's not well-read (in comparison, Fifty Shades of Gray has 965,000+). The film might change that. She also has a number of 1- star reviews, and readers confess they felt Jane knew what she was getting into when she married Hawking, so why \"complain\" (to me, this is unbelievably cold).However, there are noble moments in the movie that would contradict what readers claim: when Jane is offered the chance to turn off Hawking's life support after he can no longer breathe on his own (yes, it is presented as a \"chance\"\u2014doctors can see that caring for Hawking is the horribly difficult and draining his young wife), she doesn't think about it for a second. Also, the movie implies that Jane possibly cheated on Hawking only after the couple realizes they aren't going to make it together. Jane remains a strong figure in Hawking's life, and never once did I dislike her in the movie. Of course she struggling; anyone who rubs that in her face (either after reading the book or watching the movie) is pretty unforgiving.The pacing of the movie is steady, indicating time has passed by showing the children growing or Hawking faring worse (physically). We also see stores stocking Hawking's writings. The story begins and ends in the fashion that Americans love: happy. Hawking says, \"Look what we did\" as he and Jane watch their children play together.Overall, The Theory of Everything was worth the watch. The cast was strong and carefully chosen, and the story was contained in the right amount of time, and an interesting look into the romantic, personal side of a world-famous physicist.",

I can kind of understand embellishing some action for visual effect to keep the audience interested. If the story can't be factual and keep us interested it is not worth telling.At 2 hours in length it seems we got to see all the good side of SH. I am okay with that as long as it's truthful. The movie makers decided not to focus on any negatives about this guy and that is their choice. I thought the movie was sweet I thought the relationship with him and his wife was great.It doesn't take a genius to figure out that caring for SH would have eventually taking a toll on his wife no matter how much she loved him. Trying to care for a loved one who required the kind of attention he did and raise a family would have been exhausting for one person. I am sure did the best she could and there is no doubt in my mind that she loved him. I don't think the movie made his wife look bad, nor do I think the movie made SH look like a saint. I think the writers simply chose to focus on the good in a great man and the good in his great relationship. They did it very well. We do need to see the flaws of people displayed for us on a screen.

The beautiful scene when Hawking first sees Jonathan, a very good looking and healthy young man, in his house, invited by his wife, innocently teaching music to his kid, he easily analyzed the math and predicted the future. His theory was proved by the scene he saw through an airplane window, years later. The movie; however, has a very slow pace and in many occasions, traps into repetition.

Eddie Redmayne's incredible performance made me watch without a blink. It's a difficult balance: To honor a legend, understand his mind, act without being disrespectful. ALS is NOT a disease to make fun of, or dump a bucket full of ice and laugh!! It makes you lose control of your muscles and even makes you stop breathing and choke. It doesn't affect your brain so you know what's ahead. Eddie Redmayne made a perfect job of reflecting the hard stages of ALS. Steven Hawking sacrifices his own needs, loves his wife and loved back. His wife takes care of him all these hard years. So Theory Of Everything is a movie about love, sacrifice, intelligence and in my opinion, asks this question: WOULD YOU GO BACK IN TIME? DOES IT WORTH IT?",

The actors perform well, especially the stubborn and painful entanglement in the eyes of the Jane. There was a lot of soft light and warm light throughout the movie, and the covered filter diluted the pain of the disease he endured. As an ordinary person, I can't help but think, when he suffered such torture and hardship, did he really think of giving up? Fortunately, he is not an ordinary person, but a person who wants to explain everything with a simple and beautiful equation. The cosmic stars at the end are magnificent, how can the person who holds the universe in his mind be an ordinary person?",

Adapted from a book written by Dr. Stephen Hawking's wife, it is a heart-wrenching account of their life together.Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of the advancing disease is simply dazzling. The young actor takes us through the transformation from a quirky student before he had any signs of the illness to a world renowned scientist living in the physical confines of his deteriorating disease. Even though the movie skims over some of the events and motivations of the central characters, it has told the story in a touching way. Stephen Hawking's accomplishments are not as much the focus of the story as is his humour, his stubbornness and his continued exploration of the larger questions, mixing science with philosophy. He is portrayed in a sympathetic light, perhaps at odds with the accounts of others who know him.Even if the film skews from reality, it is worth seeing. The acting deserves an Oscar for a male actor in a leading role.I give it 7 out of 10.",

The movie shows all aspects of the suffering that both of them dealt with due to his ALS. It just feels very human and the character development is great. Some of the grander scenes were visually stunning as well, especially the May Ball. I have seen Eddie Redmayne in several other things, but this is a masterpiece. There are no words eloquent enough to describe how well he played this part. It is incredible the way he portrays the slow debilitation that happens with ALS. His walk, his speech, his facial expressions, and everything else are incredibly in depth and very accurate to what I've seen of Stephen Hawking from videos and interviews and so on. I really hope to see more of him as he is a very talented actor. I loved this film. Stephen Hawking is a truly inspiring human being, and the movie was cast perfectly. I was caught up in the story and the passion and the ambitious natures of Stephen and Jane. The minor characters all served a purpose and played their parts beautifully. It really is a great film and reminds us that all of everyone suffers in different ways, but you can overcome almost any obstacle set in your way.",

Most of the rest of us were mesmerized by a great cast presenting not one but two love stories. Eddie Redmayne, in particular, gave a subtle, nuanced performance of a man who defied tremendous odds and daunting physical ailments to let his mind soar where few can go. Felicity Jones gave a great counterpoint portrait of the woman who stood by him and helped him climb that mountain.

It was like the movie was trying to send the message that if it weren't for her, Hawking wouldn't made it.\nIn fact, behind a great man there's always a great woman and vice versa, but since we were seeing a biopic about Hawking, kind of would made more sense for the argument and the camera to spend more time with him and less with his wife, particularly spending so much time around the obvious infidelity, of which we are deprived to see acomplished probably out of virtue signaling from the director.\nFrom a \"i love you no matter what\" we come to the conclusion of \"i have loved you\", once again giving Jane almost a moral power over Hawking. Something like \"you couldn't done it if it weren't for me, so i'm free from all my sins\". It's a subversive dialogue of a woman having power over a crippled man. And it all happens when Hawking admits God exists, giving Jane a triumphant final moment. Hawking seems to come to the conclusion, that she stayed more out of stubborn faith than for love.\nAll these dilemmas together with stellar performances, made this movie a very gratifying watch, even if i don't agree with paths taken.",

The casting was perfectly matching with real person even trivial details of the characters, such as personality, the way they act or even clothes.

Mixed with Drama, which shows the intimacy of characters in a web and a strong moral dilemma that \"blows\" in the Climax Sequence, the Memoir/True Story is like a detective story. Uncovering clues to a person's psyche is the detective aspect of this genre. And when one uncovers enough clues and is able to arrive at \"the truth,\" what oftentimes happens is that \"the truth\" can be problematic. In the case of The Theory of Everything, the wife of Stephen Hawking made the conscious, if not romantic decision to \"stand by her man.\" A religious woman by nature, this entered into her decision as well. After 25 years of devotion, with literally life-threatening decisions she had to make while a parent of three of their children, they end in divorce. The flip or transcendence of the usual beats of a deteriorating marriage are as follows: Stephen is not a disabled man in his heart or brain. His wife helped him to rise above that depression, which would have killed him had she not been by his side. His wife is not just a \"caregiver\" bleeding heart, but rather, a deeply spiritual woman who rose above what most young women look for in a marriage partner. This giving nature caused her to grow with an enormous character arc. She walked away from a long adulterous relationship when Stephen's life hung in the balance and she knew where her duties lay. Stephen knew where her heart really was though after many years of marriage. He was saddened by it, but he had an enormous respect for his wife's courage and strong moral values. The third transcendence occurred when Stephen finds himself falling in love with his new caregiver. He is a man falling in love - not a disabled, helpless victim. This is new to him and it empowers him. The caregiver replaces his wife in emotional importance. It's an evolution that is both poignant and painful at the same time. Both characters grow in wisdom and respect for one another. The concept of \"time\" is woven into this script as a type of symbol. Whether time goes forward or backward is not of the essence. Time is a chronological measure of growth and happiness. The real measure is ephemeral and everlasting. The two characters go through a moral epiphany that is called a Double Reversal at the end of the story. Stephen pushed away the possibility to survive in the beginning. In the end, he believes that his horizons are endless. Jane was committed to a moral and ethical way of behavior with a man at any cost in the beginning. In the end, she allows herself to follow her heart.",

            "content": "When we first see the hero is Stephan Hawking's well-deserved biopic we see him happily riding his bike carefree with his friend. The ability to do this is short lived as we all know his physical condition will slowly deteriorate. Nonetheless he maintains his will to live for although his motor skills go away, he will he have the ability to think and do his best work as a physicist and arguably the smartest human being alive. Eddie Redmayne is absolutely superb and Oscar-worthy as Hawking. Even before he's given the tragic news, his body language suggests he has this disease. As his speech grows more intelligible, I was reminded of Daniel Day Lewis's Oscar winning performance as Christy Brown in \"My Left Foot\". In the last half of the movie when he can't talk, he provides enough emotion in his facial expressions for the audience to feel for him.With all the brilliant work Hawkings has done in his life, the main focus is the love story with his first wife Jane (well acted by Felicity Jones). It starts with a Meet Cute at a party where it's revealed they have not much in common. He's a secular atheist, she's a member of the Church of England. However what they do both have is an interest of the creation of everything. This is shown in a party scene while as they're looking at the stars, she quotes Genesis.In describing Hawking's thought process the movie uses what I thought were pretty clever visuals (including one shot with his coffee) though they could be too obvious for other people. He is also always changing his mind and challenging himself. His college thesis sets out to prove an existence of a being (like God) that created time while he later argues against it. It is implied that his deteriorating condition could be the reason for the change of heart. As his story with his wife and family are shown, it at times feels pretty conventional. For example we see footage of his family growing up like they were home movies. Jane is a character who loves her husband and tries to cope with his condition while maintaining their marriage. Her character is not dissimilar to the one Jennifer Connelly played in \"A Beautiful Mind\" who faced a similar struggle with her brilliant but medically unstable husband. There are a few interesting things about Hawking I didn't know like the fact that he's British. There's a humorous scene when he first gets his computerized voice machine and they note: \"It's American.\" What happens to their relationship and Hawking's life as a physicist and best-selling author I will not spoil for you, since as a true story I'm sure it is fairly common knowledge. Though the film often feels conventional and derivative, it is still a brilliant acted, well shot and directed, inspirational film and will even make you think a little bit afterwards.

Stephen told himself that when he watched it, sometimes he was just looking at himself.-It has a well written script and interesting story of itself. This movie is not boring at all.

But, it's not what should be focused on.We do not need another romance drama blended with the tale of how he came to be disabled. People should be focused on his ideas and scientific principles instead of his disability and relationship. This is a man who revolutionized the way we think about the cosmos and they made his life a romantic drama?! Seriously?, common. There's a hundred movies just like this and there will be a hundred more. No one needs to know about his personal life. We need to know about his work.

Have a look at the synopsis before watching the movie - it is about the relationship between Hawking and his wife. It is not about his role in science. Sure, science is sprinkled in there simply because he was a scientist, but that was not the goal for this film.Having known somebody who passed from Lou Gehrig's Disease, this was a heartbreaking movie to watch at times. Even so, it was also inspiring. Of course without significant in-depth research of his personal life and struggle with the disease, I don't know how spot-on facts are, but given Stephen Hawking's accomplishments in the field of physics, I imagine the dedication in his personal life is not far off here.Eddie Redmayne's performance was incredible - I can't imagine it is easy to capture the physical deterioration of Lou Gehrig's Disease. It is not surprising he won an Oscar for this role. If you have any interest in the field of science and/or history and appreciate phenomenal acting, this is for you - Fantastic movie! They even throw in some bits or comedy here and there.Though I do not agree with or believe in his atheism, I still enjoyed this movie because both God and science do exist, and there is something to be said about his brilliant mind (when it comes to science). This part of his life was briefly touched upon a few times in this movie.So why not a 10/10? I have a movie rating system and this simply fits the criteria of a 7 for me.",

Now, getting to the plot. For those who read the biography of Steven Hawkin, you'll realize that some parts of the movie were so lame and so chaotic that it doesn't even make sense. Take for instance, for me, the main \"sin\" of the movie, was the relationship he had with Jane and the lack of information on his relationship with the nurse, which he eventually married. It seems like they took their time to make the first part of the movie but since the third kid that they just rushed time until the end.

This week's offering was the James Marsh directed \"The Theory of Everything\" with Eddie Redmayne undertaking the role of Stephen Hawking and Felicity Jones, the part of Hawking's first wife. I had been waiting for this film to reach Reno. The biggest little city in the world is growing, but can still be a little bodonk when it comes to receiving some of the smaller pictures (one member of the movie group decries every film that is short of a generic action film as being \"bizarre\".) I went into the theater already primed, having recently watching the excellent PBS documentary from earlier in the year simply entitled \"Hawking\". \"The Theory of Everything\" matches much of the arc of the documentary, both choosing what to highlight. Stephen Hawking, who apparently enjoyed \"Theory\" did describe the picture as \"broadly true.\" The film begins shortly before Stephen show serious symptoms as he struggles with in which way he is going to finish his academic career. He meets Jane (Felicity Jones) at a party and immediately begins courting her in earnest. Not long into their relationship Stephen has a serious fall and is diagnosed with motor neuron disease that leaves him with a life expectancy of two years. What follows is a force of mega adaptation for both of them. In one scene between Jane and Frank Hawking, Stephen's father, she tells him that she may look like a weak girl but she will prove that she is strong. This she does in a herculean effort. Although Redmayne has garnered most of the buzz for his performance and physical transformation, Felicity Jones is the heart and pulse of this movie. We can see her love, her struggle, her determination, and finally her frustration and heart break. This is not done through dialog, but shown through minute visuals, the type of acting that motion picture was made to capture. Although the emotional arc of this movie largely follows a man and woman falling in love and then eventually losing touch with each other, I never felt overly dragged into these pangs myself. The points that were meant to be visceral daggers, I felt were just a tad bit forced, pushed, as typical in many films, by a manipulative score. It's not as much that these scenes didn't feel sincere as much as they just tended to not dig deep and the scenes fell away like dead leaves in a gentle breeze. This film is definitely worth a watch, if for nothing else than at least a snippet view into the life of an amazing, determined, humorous, brilliant man. I am very curious what projects come Eddie Redmayne's and Felicity Jones' way now that the world is even more aware of these actors and their ability. Again, I highly recommend looking into the PBS documentary that is narrated by Hawking himself to contrast with \"Theory\" which is adapted from Jane's Hawking's biography.Blarv Score 8.6/10",

            "content": "Here is the sad and frustrating irony of \"The Theory of Everything\": it's a biopic about one of the most brilliant people in the history of the planet, the renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking a man famous for thinking in boldly innovative ways yet his story is told in the safest and most conventional method imaginable. This is ironic given the director: James Marsh, an Academy Award winner for the 2008 documentary \"Man on Wire,\" which was so thrilling and so clever in its narrative structure that it made you leave the theater feeling as if you would actually witnessed Philippe Petit walking across a tightrope between the World Trade Center Towers.(You did not the film features photographs and reenactments but no film footage of Petit pulling off his daredevil stunt. Here, he's made a strongly acted, handsomely crafted film that nonetheless feels bland and unsatisfying. It falls into the trap that so many biopics do: It hits all the key moments in the life of the author of \"A Brief History of Time\" and skims the surface of a complicated existence without digging deeper, without taking chances. Everyone involved does everything they should, and the result is just sort of...fine. Of course, Hawking's story is inspiring the way he's battled motor neuron disease over the past 50 years and defied the odds not only to survive, but thrive. And in playing Hawking, Eddie Redmayne more than rises to the challenge of portraying the man's gradual physical deterioration but also conveying the spark of mental acuity that has remained, and marked all of Hawking's important work. Nothing the 32-year-old actor has done previously (\"Les Miserables,\" \"My Week With Marilyn\") suggested he had this sort of complexity in him. It's an impressive performance, so much so that it makes you wish it were in the service of stronger material.\"The Theory of Everything\" comes from screenwriter Anthony McCarten, based on \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen,\" the memoir by Hawking's first wife, Jane. A general feeling of tastefulness permeates the proceedings, as if everyone wanted to be overly respectful toward these people, and their life, and the access they provided, at the expense of revelations that might have seemed inappropriate or startling or, heaven forbid, thought-provoking. The love and support we see from Jane Hawking are tireless; as portrayed by a fresh-faced Felicity Jones, Jane is a woman of both grace and strength. And what she went through in taking care of him while raising their three children and trying to focus on her own intellectual pursuits must have been exhausting, and often discouraging. But the early scenes between Redmayne and Jones positively crackle. He's fumbling and funny, she's pretty and perky. He's an atheist, she's a devout follower of the Church of England. But they are mutually curious and seem to bring out the best in one another. Their preliminary days include a romantic scene involving the little-known properties of Tide laundry detergent. Everything seems possible for these two young and brilliant minds, until Hawking experiences a series of increasingly clumsy moments, followed by a serious spill on the campus courtyard. Then comes the diagnosis at age 21 that he has motor neuron disease, or ALS, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The doctor also gives him just two years to live. Hawking tries to withdraw but Jane will not have it; she forces her way into his life and insists she's ready for whatever comes their way. But as Stephen's body weakens and the family has to make continual adjustments to his physical status including the famous computerized voice he creates when he no longer can speak, which is the source of some of the film's precious few laughs his mind stays sharp. He continues his pursuit of the one simple, elegant equation that will explain everything in the universe.(And it should be noted that \"The Theory of Everything\" is one of three films opening this week in which black holes figure prominently, alongside \"Interstellar\" and \"Big Hero 6\"). Not unlike our own dear Roger Ebert, Hawking's mind became even more expansive and powerful once he began losing his physical abilities. Eventually, \"The Theory of Everything\" reaches a point where it toys with a challenging notion: the possibility that Jane and Hawking each had dalliances on the side with the other's tacit approval, once it became clear that their marriage had changed irreparably. Jane sought solace with Jonathan Hellyer Jones , the hunky, widowed choir director with big, brown puppy-dog eyes who served as Hawking's caretaker, and the family's de facto husband and father figure. Hawking later had the pleasure of spending time with the beautiful and vibrant therapist Elaine , who flirted with Stephen and even leafed through the pages of a Penthouse magazine for his perusal. But the film glosses over these extra-marital relationships and their resolution with little muss, fuss, or emotional distress. It tiptoes toward the fire and then scurries back. It's unfortunately an apt metaphor for the film as a whole.",

Eddie Redmayne did an AMAZING job of portraying this disease and pulling on the heartstrings of anyone who watches the movie.

The film reduced her massive care-taking role to one scene of exhaustion. The rest of the relationship - and others - are diluted to the point of misrepresentation if not near-fiction. Every emotional conflict follows the script of \"now weep with love in your eyes.\" There's no dimension, no nuance, just caricatured human tolerance.I gave it 3 stars instead of fewer because Theory was a watchable movie while I did cardio in the gym. (Don't let that fool you into thinking I did 2 hours of cardio; it was easy to walk away from and start again the next day.) The acting itself wasn't painful and if I could pretend it was a fiction it was decent. I think I also clung onto hope it could get better.

            "content": "Make no mistake, The Theory of Everything should not be dubbed the Stephen Hawking Biopic or anything similar for that matter. In fact it is quite the opposite; it is a love story between two people, one of whom later is struck down by a crippling condition, and how their love was prolonged in light of such a factor. For that matter, praise must be lauded on the writers for taking a chance with the story by placing the achievements of Dr Hawking to one side, instead focusing on an unfamiliarly emotional side of his character. My initial thoughts about the Theory of Everything appear to be my only concern with it; it has a Sunday afternoon made for TV feel to it, and whilst this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it does suggest that the production team have tried to create that particular effect, a homely, warm story of love and defiance - and it works.If anything, it is the brilliant acting of the leads, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, that help the film garner the appraisals it has generated; and rightly so. Redmayne appears to have taken a page out of Daniel Day Lewis' book (see 1989's My Left Foot), with a performance so committed yet credible, its no surprise he took home the Academy Award for his portrayal. Whilst I am tempted to proclaim his performance as one of the best of the decade, I still feel that the actor is consumed by a stereotypical bubble of being cast as the Nice Upper Class English Gentleman; it would be interesting to see how Redmayne's career pans out from this performance - especially so as he has now etched himself in award history. Credit must be given where credit is due and make no mistake, the acting is phenomenal.In light of Redmayne's physical commitment to the role, its easy to forget the grounded albeit more restrained performance Felicity Jones gives as Jane Hawking. If anything we are made to feel a closer association with her character than Dr Hawking's as she ultimately represents the notions of pain and hardship in a way that is completely relatable. This is a solid film; one which is given real flavour with its central performances; highly recommended just for the acting alone.",

I didn't know much of the story of Hawking's life going into the movie, so I didn't really know what Jones' role would be. However, her performance equaled Redmayne's in every way. Her pain was so real and the conflict she felt was evident and touching. I had tears in my eyes for the majority of the film. There were parts of the movie that bothered me slightly, such as the clich\u00e9 way they showed Hawking getting his ideas and the sequence at the end where he imagines that he can stand.

            "content": "The 2014 film The Theory of Everything, based on Jane Hawking's memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, depicts the life of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). The film does not just focus on Hawking's progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that causes him to be in a wheelchair and speak through a computer system. It shows his relationship with his ex-wife, Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), and his successes in physics. ALS is fittingly shown as just one part of Hawking's extraordinary life.The movie has received criticism for casting Redmayne as Hawking and being \"the latest\" performance \"in a long line of what detractors call 'cripping up': able-bodied actors taking on disabled roles, which some critics find as deplorable as the thankfully outdated practice of white actors pretending to be black\". I too would be critical of this casting decision were it not for the special circumstances of this film.The film is meant to reflect Jane Hawking's memoir, a story that shows Hawking's life before and after his diagnosis and through every stage of his ALS's progression. This situation is not identical to a character who is always seen in a wheelchair being played by a nondisabled actor or a character who is born blind being played by a seeing actor. When the circumstances prevent the role of a disabled character from being filled by a disabled actor, there are certain steps that must be taken to ensure that the experiences of disabled people are as accurately portrayed as possible. The Theory of Everything does a very good job of fulfilling this criteria.First of all, Redmayne spent over four months studying Hawking's life, watching every video he could find on him and reading books written by him. Redmayne worked with a choreographer to record and analyze every movement from picking up a pen to drinking to walking. To understand and accurately portray how the disease affected Hawking throughout the different stages, Redmayne met with over 30 people affected by ALS and viewed photographs of Hawking throughout his life.Most importantly, Hawking was consulted during every stage of the movie's production. Redmayne met with him before starting to film, and he visited the set during production. Before the movie was released, Hawking viewed the film and gave his approval. Redmayne's hard work paid off, as Hawking called the film \"broadly true\" and that there were \"certain points when he thought he was watching himself\". After the screening, \"Hawking was so pleased with the movie\" that he let the filmmakers use his own, trademarked computerized voice.In instances when disabled characters cannot be played by disabled actors, it is crucial that people affected by that specific disability are included in the process and that their concerns are listened to. Since everyone's experiences are different, multiple people must be consulted. The experiences of disabled people must not be misrepresented, and the reinforcement of stereotypes must be avoided. The motto of the disability rights movement, \"Nothing about us without us\", applies to media representations as well.When portraying disability, care must be taken to ensure accurate representation and people within the disability community must be included in the process.",

            "content": "The life of the most famous physicist of our time, Professor Stephen Hawking, is given the biopic treatment in the poignant and outstandingly acted 'The Theory of Everything' which won Eddie Redmayne an Oscar in 2015. Detailing Hawking's physical decline upon diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and his struggle to maintain a marriage, career and legacy, this film is a touching but occasionally difficult to watch portrayal of a genius defying the odds.The acting on show from the cast is truly outstanding and Redmayne's interpretation of Hawking at the various stages of his life is extraordinary and worthy of his Oscar recognition. The wide eyed wonder he portrays when finding love with Jane (a brilliant Felicity Jones) feels as genuine as his physical acting performance in dramatizing Hawking's diagnosis and subsequent collapse with his illness. It is a multi-layered performance that captures a range of emotions in a way that can engender feelings of empathy and repulsion in the audience.The biopic seeks to walk a tightrope between the personal drama and the context of the cosmology theories and interplay between characters in the University of Cambridge setting. The complexity of the scientific interplay is not particularly accessible to the uninitiated and the opening acts are somewhat difficult to wade through. However, Hawking's personal journey is a compelling narrative that takes a raw and honest look at the issue of disability and its impact on a person and their loved ones. Particularly praiseworthy is the depiction of Hawking's wife's flirtation with an affair and the moral quandary this places her in whilst the Professor's physical condition deteriorates and his relationship with his carer grows increasingly complex. The result of both scenarios is depicted in such a way that the film negates judgement on the rights and wrongs of the situation. The final scene of the movie between Hawking and his wife is genuinely beautiful and wraps up the drama with a moment of reflection on the human experience, rather than cosmological science, of time and creation.The Theory of Everything is not likely to be top of any date movie lists but it is a compelling drama featuring a cast delivering outstanding performances, none more so than Eddie Redmayne. The film does have a whiff of Oscar-bait in both its script and cinematography but there is much substance to admire in the production and it is well worth a watch.",

And some people like to critizice the film for his lack of \"Science\" like seriously? the film is about the LIFE of Hawking based by the memories of his ex - wife, i think we know enough about his Theory, but of course the film show us the origin of that Theory, but much more focused on his Illness, and nobody know till today Hawking's personal, sentimental life, like this film potray.

It is about so many things,that it's about the hardships of life itself. The story,the life of Stephen Hawking has inspired many,and made them wonder. It made me wonder. It made me wonder about what is worth fighting for in life,what is right,and what wrong. It told me that love has immense power over people,and over universe itself. We find purpose in life in small and in great things,we struggle,everyday,and every moment. And his life,his hard,difficult,and painful life is teaching us about what moments should we fight for,when to struggle,and when to give up. And we need help from others,we can never make it alone,and we never will. Universe itself is draining power from small particles,quantum. We need that particles in our everyday life,because they inspire us to do unimaginable things. We are all capable of doing wonderful things,which we have to fight for. Stephen Hawking did,and he won.

Throughout the whole movie, you have the feeling of watching family tapes of the Hawkings family. The film also creates a wonderful, emotional atmosphere which makes it even more compelling. Another reason why i gave 10/10 points, is the breathtaking score by the Icelandic Johann Johannsson. Especially \"Arrival of the Birds\" will give you chills. So all in all a very well deserved Oscar win for Eddie Redmayne who portrayed Mr. Hawking perfectly good and made a job, which may seem impossible, perfectly good.",

Although I may not completely understand A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes, and has not penetrated to the physical basis that Hawking invited the future human to attend a party, the film should not omit the part of Hawking, or he would not be the world-famous Hawking.While then the film won the Oscar for Best Actor, and even Hawking said, \"The protagonist is similar to me\". I finally went to watch the movie. Of course, it is the modeling that helped Edward John David Redmayne, but the trademark glasses of Hawking was removed at least several times, therefore, what really created a real Hawking was the eyes, speaking rhythm and the simulation of muscle hardening of the actor.When compared with \"A Dangerous Method\" of Keira Knightley, you will know a world of difference on the acting. Both of the characters have language and physical problems, while Keira Knightley is not more than overacted, but created the most horrible performance in history.Love in the movie is also very unique, talking love as well as the mysteries of the universe. For example, when looking at the stars in the night, Jane thought of the Bible \"In the a beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss. God saw that the light was good; and he separated the light from the darkness\"; Hawking did not believe that there was a transcendent god. While they did not argue, but just kept the curiosity of the unknown.Even the movie scenes are very sincere, for example when Jane went the cyclotron stairs, the lens rotated too. In addition to echoing the study of black hole of Hawking, it also can make people associate with the man-made things inspired by nature invisibly, which contains the laws of physics.In the end, Jane was divorced from Hawking and married other. She said 'I do my best', and the audience could feel she was physically and mentally exhausted when taking care of Hawking. Hawking was silent, however the screen appears \"until now, they are good friends.\" As it turns out, true love is not to bear but to sacrifice.Suddenly I remembered that the real Hawking came to visit Hong Kong years ago . My friend was a reporter, and grabbed a split to ask him 'Do you believe there is a God? ' Hawking said, 'Maybe'. The scene came into my mind through memory.In order to \"turn back the clock,\" Hawking relies on an equation; Jane relies on being immersed in literary works of the 1920s; while I rely on my memory.",

I expected to learn more about Hawking's discoveries and why he became so famous, but in the end, I can't say that I haven't enjoyed the movie.Knowing that Stephen and his wife got divorced later in their marriage, I expected to see more jealousy and conflict. I was pleasantly surprised to see that both partners continued having happy relationships afterwards and that they remained friends. The characters were all extremely likable.The cinematography is superb and the score very well fitting. The costume design is also one that deserves mention.Seeing how even a person suffering from an autoimmune disease can have a relatively normal life gave me a lot of hope. The intellect of a person is truly the most interesting thing about them. I'm happy that Hawking got to live and experience life the way that everyone should.In the end, this movie was a very emotional one, that even though doesn't get into too much detail about Hawking's work, it shows his character and the environment that he lived in, and it truly inspires us to always look forward in life and have hope.",

            "content": "It is an encouraging sign, for those who doubt cinema's capacity for intelligence, that two films within a couple of months have examined the human condition through the medium of astrophysics, incidentally making reference to the works of Kip Thorne. For those who found Interstellar a little cold or its scale a little overwhelming, this biopic of Thorne's great contemporary and friend, Professor Stephen Hawking, may be the warmer and more human option.Aside from a brief flashback framing device, this is a fairly straightforward account. The young Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student working towards his doctorate. When we meet him, he is remarkable as much for his haphazard work ethic as his aptitude; a sort of Oxbridge everyman, he cheerfully coxes the rowing team and plays Wagner too loudly. But Hawking describes his subject as \"everything\", narrowing it down only as far as \"time\", handily showing that his ambition has already outstripped his diligence.Tragically, there are foreshadowings of a different sort: a lurching walk, a shaking hand. While Hawking's romance with Felicity Jones' Jane Wilde initially has a tinge of fairy tale - dancing on a bridge, bathed in the glow of fireworks - shadows threaten. Even as the arts graduate adjusts to the social oddities of her scientist admirer, she has to decide whether their relationship can endure a disease that seems certain to end his life, and soon. She sits, steely-eyed, to declare her devotion when his father tries to warn her off, and forces Hawking himself to find a path through.The realities of that steady erosion test both their limits, as the disease rides roughshod through Hawking and strips away his independence. Unquestionably the physical transformation of the year, Redmayne adopts Hawking's ravaged form as he shrinks into the familiar figure of modern times. A stick becomes two, a wheelchair looms, and then as Jane is teaching their children to walk, Hawking is losing the same capacity. Finally, his voice is silenced and his work thereby threatened, the hardest trial of all for the gregarious scholar.Jones' performance communicates the subtle sense that Jane thought she could endure the short life sentence Hawking was initially given but begins to quail when she realises that he will survive decades more, steadily needing more and more care. Hawking, meanwhile, obsesses over his great work and sometimes neglects the strains on his less lauded other half - but he never loses his humour, or his charm, a twinkle in his eye surviving through all but his worst days. Perhaps, like Beethoven losing his hearing, Hawking's disease didn't so much hinder his work as remove the distractions. Still, these two extraordinarily intelligent people display a mutual respect and consideration, even as their marriage threatens to fail, that would put many more traditionally successful marriages to shame. There are moments where they seem too easy on each other, as if this story has been lightly sanitised for public consumption somewhere between history and memoir and screen, but the overwhelming impression is that of a couple trying hard to do what's best, and sometimes not quite managing it. With so many movie marriages either flagrantly unhappy or barely sketched, it's inspiring to see a deeply felt commitment that proved crucial in unlocking some of the secrets of the universe.A compassionate and inspiring look at an extraordinary life, anchored by two of the best performances of the year.",

Maybe we can relate to that, but we certainly can relate to a human being watching and feeling pain, unable to do something about it. Still not giving up though...

I didn't know s lot about Stephan Hawkings personal story but this was a very moving and yet funny at times story telling of his romance with his wife, who has told this story. Amazing what they both went through over the years and were able to bring up children throughout it all. Jane Hawking must have been extremely strong to have dealt with her husbands illness a lesser woman could not have coped. Felicity Jones' performance was amazing and both characters reduced me to tears several times. Eddie Raymayne brought emotion to a character with no voice now that is talent. I shall be watching this film again and again and I will keep the tissues to hand as I wasn't expecting it to have been such an emotional ride the first time.",

This film pays a wonderful tribute to the physician who struggled in life like nobody could ever imagine and yet he has proven that time is enough for everybody to succeed. This craft of direction is supremely appreciated. Direction wise, it gives us what we exactly need. Emotions, pride, happiness, anxiety. Music is one of the aspect where it hasn't been too exaggerated but, served what the screenplay needs . Technicalities are never an issue for this kind of film because the story is the stakeholder here.Eddie Redmayne hence proved why is he my favorite actor and now he has established himself as my favorite actor of all time. Every frame, he has this immense amount of acting which exactly resembles the emotion or feeling Stephen going through at that time. A brilliant actor indeed. The part where he sees his son playing guitar in the guidance of Jonathan breaks my heart. The moments where he wants to cry but he couldn't, his love and sacrifice for his wife, every pinch of acting is appreciated which is why he gained his first Oscar after all.This film gave me the strength to live life in the happiest way as possible. No matter who you are and how your disability pulls you down, you can still find a path of hope through love and this is exactly the proof of it. Thanks to the entire cast of this film coming by and gathered to produce such a fantastic art which will live for years .",

Jane (Hawking's wife) overcame herself, she gave all her vital energy to her husband. The actors played superconvincing, the events of the film are memorible.It cannot be said that the film is fast-moving, because there are few special effects in it, of which there are too many in new films. There are no sharp twists and turnsin the film, which can scare away the audience, because everyone loves gripping films. But with these disadvantages, the film wins in that it is thought provoking, the viewer sees all the impossible tests that stand in the way of a up-and-coming scientist and his wife, and they do not give up, which sets a good example for postgenerations.I can't call this movie a masterpiece of cinema, but if you want to watch a mesmerizing film and want to get a new subject for reflection, then be sure to look at the \"Theory of Everything\".",

And you may see full emotions on the actress' face.And of course I need to point out Eddie Redmayne's acting. I doubt anyone else could play Stephen Hawking as convincing as he did.The thing I most liked is the idea that we all are different, but everyone has chance to get succeed at something. And it is no matter what problems you meet on your way, just don't give up and you will see the happiness.Well, \"The Theory of Everything\" is moving and thought-provoking film.

It will tell about how he met his future wife, about how he found out about his illness and how he overcame it, about what mind-blowing discoveries he made, about how, thanks to his wife, he became indesperate and how he became internationally popular.This is actually an impressive film, it's not for nothing that it grossed over $ 100 million. Critics panned the film. But, do not forget that the story was originally told by Stephen Hawking's wife, so it is not super-objective.I would recommend this film for person who like to look at the life of world celebrities from the other side, to look into some secrets, to learn the subtleties. And of course, the film inspires to not give up, even if it is a serious illness. Despite the misfortune, Hawking was able to live a very fruitful and long life with it.",

There were too many things that surprised me all at once. It started and I felt, this would be one of those films I could rave on and on about...I was right.The first thing that I noticed was the beautiful music, written by the composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson. Rich but simple, it guides and carries the movie. And I mean that in the best possible way, as the movie doesn't lack in the other departments.The cinematography is unique and charmingly expressive. Every frame a painting as they say. The use of color and shape, exquisite. Every scene a whole different feel and atmosphere, every shot meticulously crafted. I lost count at the times I said to myself, what an amazing shot! Then we have, of course, Mr. and Mrs. Hawking. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones portray the couple in a way that exudes a tenderness and intimacy I have never seen on screen before. They both make you fall in love with their love instantly. Their relationship is indubitably what makes this movie unforgettable. A bond that was tested by faith, sickness, and ironically; time.Felicity Jones is absolutely fantastic as Jane. We slowly see her going from an optimistic, strong, and perhaps naive young woman, to a tired and frustrated mother, trying to keep her family together. However, it is impossible not to mention Redmayne as Stephen Hawking. What a raw, genuine, phenomenal performance. You can see the enormous amounts of work he has put into this role, and seeing him portray the professor fills you up with what I say is great awe and admiration. I'd say he deserves an Oscar, but the Academy has already agreed with me! This is definitely one of the most promising actors of this generation.The story of the great Stephen Hawking is well known. Though this film has made changes to some events in his life for dramatic effect, he is still a man who has changed the world of cosmology forever, and changed the way we see the universe. An extraordinary man with an extraordinary life. Thankfully, this movie telling his story is just as extraordinary. 9/10",

This also made me think about how much more difficult it must have been for Hawking to write books in comparison to a healthy person (the actual act of writing). So I really liked the movie for making me think about those kind of things.In my opinion, the actors did quite a good job, especially Redmayne managed to play Hawking convincingly and also to convey Hawking's feelings in a probable mannerMy major point of critique is that the movie is quite slow and during some scenes my attention slipped away as the movie was a bit boring to me at times.",

I'd have scored this higher if it hadn't become like snippets the further towards the end of the film - I know getting everything in to a standard movie length can be a challenge but I'd have liked this to be bulked out a little more.

I need not have been concerned.The film has been scripted, shot and edited to perfection, telling the highly emotive story in way that is not only captivating but beautiful to watch. Eddie Redmayne is incredible and plays a very challenging role accurately and sensitively alongside Felicity Jones who is equally brilliant in her depiction of Jane Hawking.To be honest I could not find fault with any of the performances and they combined excellently to produce one of the greatest pieces of British cinema ever. Strongly complemented by a Johann Johannsson's beautiful original score, which I had purchased before leaving the cinema!In short this is a must see film and, contrary to my initial apprehension, I left the cinema feeling inspired and motivated in both my personal and professional lives.",

For a Hollywood screenplay, the film authentically portrays (with minimal discrepancies) the actual lives of Stephen Hawking and his family, verified by his former wife Jane (of 30 years) and Stephen Hawking himself. It is important to see this film even though it might be difficult to watch at some points. Hopefully afterwards you might see things/life in a different perspective? Jane is the absolute epitome of devotion and fortitude as well as Stephen with his ambition to effectuate boundless achievements despite his circumstances. As Stephen Hawking says, ...\"while there's life, there is hope\" also known as \"where there is life, there is hope\" in a related speechDo not listen to negative reviews people seize to amaze me on how ignorant they are to an extremely rare and precious film. The main character, Edward Redmayne (so talented and adorable), won countless awards for his performance. Just outstanding...",

From 1979 to 2009 he held the post of Lucasian Professor at Cambridge.In my opinion he is someone who really deserves to have a movie made about him , how he lived , and what difficulties he had in his life , he passed everything because he was so patient .There are some people who really wish that they have his patience , his intelligence , his wisdom.Finally, after reading Stephen Hawking history , I advise everyone to work harder , and didn't give up because he was sick or any other silly reason , because Stephen Hawking is the right man who can be shown as an example of this world's heroes .",

Spoiler alert...In the history of the world, there has never been a woman who so much did not deserve to be dumped as Jane. She loved Stephen dearly. She devoted her life to, and made huge sacrifices for, Stephen. She was beautiful too. I'm not satisfied with: Jane got in the tent with Jonathan, Stephen was very attracted to Elaine, and the movie a true story. When a man in his condition dumps a woman like her, that part of the story needs a lot more fleshing out. The movie let Hawking off easy because he is such a remarkable man. This would never fly in a purely fictional movie about a more ordinary person.",

I expected something different from 'Theory of Everything' but I was not ready to see what I have seen here . The struggles of Hawking, his miraculous survival against all odds, the sacrifice of Jane, her true love for Stephen- everything is overwhelming. I have a strong feeling that Hawking intentionally let Jane go from his life so that she can have the taste of a normal life at least before she dies. The most beautiful time of her life has been spent to look after Hawking. At such a young age she has sacrificed all her strength and enjoyment to support him. And then when he realized there are more people to look after him, he emancipated Jane from this burden of love. It kind of resonates Maya Angelou's poem \"love liberates\". Everything in this movie is extremely honest, humane and humble. It shows our weakness, struggle and vulnerability to our desire, passion and people we care about. An extraordinary tale of love and sacrifice- Theory of Everything.",

Eddie Redmayne offers the performance of his life in a plot showing us who Stephen Hawking is beyond the bright physicist that we already know. Throughout the movie, You learn to love, hate, side with and contradict Hawking as he goes in his journey of love and science. This movie is also about Jane as much as it is about Stephen, the patience, love, help and compromises she endured to stay next to him and make him the person he is, until he falls in love with someone else and makes a decision that will break her heart. Felicity Jones outstanding performance matches the Eddie Redmayne in a movie, that leaves you satisfy despite a heartbreaking ending.",

It was directed by James Marsh based on Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen by Jane Wilde Hawking. Throughout the movie, it had shown the struggles that Stephen had faced as well as his achievements and his personal life that many weren't aware of.We all know that Stephen's character is very hard to be impersonated hence the fact that he had the motor neuron disease. Unfortunately, this disease causes problems to his physical appearance and abilities when his muscle and neuron began degrading one by one. In the movie, not only did Eddie have portrayed the emotions well but he also had transformed himself physically so that the audience could understand how this disease brought so many changes into his life. The actors did a wonderful job at playing their roles which I found really captivating and I admire the efforts and emotions that they had put into this movie.There were uphill and downhill. The ending could have been more realistic but overall I think it was great. Stephen had a lot of important events in his life and the director did a good job at keeping the film at a considerable length. It is definitely the best biopic I have seen so far.I would recommend this for those who would like to learn more about Stephen but also want some entertainment along the way. This film will be worth the hours you spent watching it.",

It was most certainly an interesting film. The dialogue was good, the references to pop culture were placed appropriately, and the acting was phenomenal. The viewer will really get the impression that this film accurately Stephen and Jane Hawking. In terms of heartwarming, well...The trailers for The Theory of Everything were incredibly misleading. They did not make any mention of the relationship between Jane Hawking and Jonathan Jones. In fact, by only viewing the trailers, you will be under the impression that Jane remained with Stephen for the rest of their lives. In reality, they both cheat on each other and they separate, with Jane marrying Jonathan Jones.If you have the time, go ahead and view the film. It's really well done and worth the watch. But, please do not see this film if you want a sappy/romantic love story. It's not what happens.",

The main roles were played by Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking and Felicity Jones as his wife Jane. This film is based on the Jane's novel \"Traveling to Infinity:My life with Stephen\". You know, Jane refused for three years to screen her book. In this film we can see first Jane's and Stephen's meeting and evolution of their love. In my opinion this film is full of feelings. Some people like to compare this film and another with Benedict Cumberbutch, but I think it is silly, because \"Hawking\" (2004) is about science. I think, the main point in this film is Stephen's discovery about black holes, little time is allotted for Jane. And another situation in this film is that Jane is the main character, after Stephen of course. James Marsh's movie allows us to look at family life. Eddie Redmayen is a good actor. His reincarnation into the famous physicist is worthy to see: his mimics, his actions. You must see this. The camera-work was sometimes fantastic, but another moment are not so good. In some scenes you can feel the whole tragedy or importance of actions. Some moment were funny and some - sad. Also there are some minuses in this film. For example: the camera-work or actors works, in some moments. In conclusion I want to say, that I like this film and I will watch it again. P. S. Costumes are great! Time rules are complied.",

It dwells upon the part of his life when he meets his wife Jane and gets to suffer from a severe disease. The story begins with his life in Cambrige, when he met his future wife on a party. After he was diagnosed Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which further led to paralysis, the doctors made a frustrating prognosis that he would have only 2 years to live. But nevertheless Stephen and Jane never gave up hope and kept fighting the disease. Stephen develops a theory about the visibility of black holes and becomes a world-renowned physicist. Watching this film, I was impressed by Jane's love for Stephen. In my opinion many girls would have left the disabled boyfriend. As a wife Jane was a very responsible housekeeper. Moreover, she consequently had three children with Stephen. That shows great devotion. She loved him despite his disability. The movie earned several awards and nominations including the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film received four Golden Globe Award nominations. It was well received by critics and viewers who noted excellent acting of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. In conclusion, I'd like to say that this movie shows that while you live you have hope.

The direction and locations are great, but i didn't really like the color correction, the blue, the yellow, it was all a bit to dramatic.

            "content": "Many people know Stephen Hawking for his groundbreaking discoveries, such as the discovery of black holes or his theory about the Big Bang. Others know him only as the British man in a wheelchair suffering from ALS who communicates through a computer voice with an American accent. James Marsh's biopic The Theory of Everything is about much more than these unique characteristics. While his illness is a strong focus, the film is primarily concerned with the impact it has on Hawking's private life, particularly on his relationship with his first wife Jane. Jane Hawking created the basis for this film with her book My Life with Stephen Hawking: Love Has Eleven Dimensions.\n\nEddie Redmayne is tailor-made for the leading role of Stephen Hawking. Not only does he look identical to the real person in his younger years, but the way he communicates the continual loss of his motor skills is absolutely thrilling. This is why Redmayne's performance is so highly rated, as the illness in the film does not suddenly hit rock bottom from one scene to the next. His performance is especially close when you see that he wants to, but can't. This is especially difficult to watch in the interactions with his wife Jane, played by the great Felicity Jones. The chemistry and love story of the two main characters carries the film for long stretches, in which joy and sorrow are always right next to each other. Their coexistence is also further challenged by the implementations of important supporting characters from family, friendship and care-related backgrounds as the film progresses. It is clear to see that Redmayne and Jones were closely advised and informed by Jane Hawking on the details, as their performances always seem authentic and almost eerily real.\n\nIn the end, The Theory of Everything is not a pure biopic about Stephen Hawking alone, but is just as much Jane Hawking's story. This is a welcome change, as films about so-called geniuses tend to aim to explore only this and the people directly involved tend to take a back seat. There is a lot of humanity in this film, which makes the person Stephen Hawking very tangible. The respect one has for this man, but also for his wife and family, is enormous. Nevertheless, it would have been just as important to focus more on Hawking's fundamental theories and inventions and not just to address them superficially. After all, the person Stephen Hawking is by no means defined only by his illness.",

This film highlights the struggles in Hawking's life caused by him having ALS. His marriage with Jane is troubled very much by the disease, and the more he physically deteriorated the harder the marriage seemed to be. When he was first diagnosed with the disease while in college, he was given only two years to live and he ended up living many years beyond those two. The movie is very inspiring showing that even when the odds are stacked against you, you can still have the strength to accomplish what you want. Eddie Redmayne is phenomenal as Hawking and is 100% deserving of all the awards and accolades he obtained from his performance. Felicity Jones plays Jane Hawking and she does very well also. She is aptly able to convey the range of emotion that Jane surely felt over the course of her 30-year marriage to Stephen. The movie is a bit slow, but it does keep the viewer engaged with dramatic and compelling storylines. The biggest flaw with this film is that it does feel a bit overstretched, and then to compensate the last half of Hawking's life is rushed through in a very brief amount of time. Other than that, this is a fantastic film. James Marsh directed it very well and really helped bring out the best in the actors. Overall I give this film an 7.5/10.",

Seeing how distraught and sad she was to see him struggle to play was a real teary eyed moment. \n\nIt's incredible to see how much determination and strength he had to keep going, where most people in his situation would give up on everything. I think what's even more incredible is how he still managed to have that many children. What a champ! I think the person we should be admiring, if not even more than Steven, is his wife. If it wasn't for her, nothing would have happened. It was her that compelled him with the love that she gave him and motivation, to keep going. How committed she was to him in all aspects of his life. \n\nI think one of the most amazing things film can do is when the music and the visuals work together in unison to create a memory, an emotion if you will, that perfectly captures a moment. This movie does it with ease almost as if it came about naturally from the composer. Eddie's performance is outstanding. His commitment to playing Hawking is compelling.

            "content": "A film that exemplifies everything wrong with the \u2018Great Man' biopic genre this film has a long way to go in attempting to encapsulate the brilliance and inspiration of Stephen Hawking or the odd dynamics that existed inside his strained relationship with his wife. The film takes what could have been a complex relationship drama and reduces it down to the weakest, most palatable version of this tale with all of the rough edges sanded off. At the center of the film are two highly calculated performances that are never given room to breathe and start feeling like more than stilted impressions of famed figures. I wish that just one of these biopics could have had an ounce of inspiration considering how many of them are made.\n\nAspiring astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, Eddie Redmayne, studies to gain a doctorate at the University of Cambridge where he excels in an environment that fosters his desire to learn. He finds love with languages student Jane Wilde, Felicity Jones, with whom he disagrees on many issues including religion but the two form a strong bond as they get to know one another better. His professional and romantic ambitions would appear to be dashed when he discovers he is suffering from motor neurone disease but with the support of his sweetheart he continues with his training and gains his PhD. He becomes world famous as he makes new scientific breakthroughs and his theories become popular due to the publishing of his novels. His relationship begins to suffer under the weight of his illness however and choral director Jonathan Jones, Charlie Cox, emotionally supports his wife and children before entering into a romantic relationship with Wilde. In his later years Hawking leaves Wilde for his kind nurse Elaine Mason, Maxine Peake, while it is acknowledged that his work has changed the scientific landscape.\n\nIndulging in one of my least favorite cinematic tropes, especially within this genre, the film employs Wilde not as a regular, flawed character but as a saintly figure who exists to support her talented husband. This is detrimental to the film because we spend time watching this supposedly angelic figure endure the difficulties of her husband's condition instead of considering the anger boiling up inside of her or her own self destructive desire to support those in need of extraordinary amounts of care. Wilde could have gone through a proper character arc when the opportunity for a new romance with a considerably less demanding man is introduced that would require her to value her own needs over those of others. Oh no, screenwriter Anthony McCarten says gleefully, we will instead see Hawking rather unbelievably consent to his wife's affair without a moment's consideration and include the \u2018tasteful' implication of sex in a tent during a family outing. She is the character through whom most of the events in this film are viewed and because she is never a real character herself the film never has a strong perspective on it's ostensible subject and we walk away knowing little about him or her.\n\nThe performances of the two lead actors fall squarely into \u2018oscar bait' territory as Jones is reminiscent of Jennifer Connelly in A Beautiful Mind (2001) and Redmayne gets to play both tortured genius and disabled person. With his pouty lips and impressionable grin Redmayne has never been my favorite actor as he always appears to be pushing too hard for emotion as opposed to simply relaxing into his role and making us believe in his actions. He jerks and writhes, delivers his lines in that irritating high voice that suggests he views the world around him with childlike wonderment but none of it feels genuine or believable. Jones seems equally lost with what little she has to do and has none of the chutzpah of other supportive wives in films of this sort. We have seen other, more talented, performers go through all this before and because these second rate hacks fail to bring anything new to the table we are left feeling as though the film itself has not been a worthwhile effort. \n\nAll in all there is really nothing to recommend the film as it boasts nothing of note and will most likely be forgotten in a matter of decades.",

It brings romance to life with vibrant blues and greens next to cinematographer Benoit Delhomme's stunning cinematography. Many images from The Theory of Everything have stuck with me. The positive outlook of Hawking's and his willful perseverance should reinvigorate any audience. \n\nJames Marsh's direction is truly gorgeous as the bright vivid colors choices, beautiful costumes, long steady shots, emotional close ups, and creative editing make The Theory of Everything one of my favorite biopics. This movie looks so bright and cleanly shot that it is a testament to great filmmaking for such an inspiring story. Marsh captures the necessary parts of Hawking's incredible life, never afraid to mention the saddest or most harrowing aspects to Professor Hawking's condition. Marsh will hold on Hawking unable to climb stairs or staring at a fire that convey a dismal situation with a respectful understanding.\n\nAdditionally, Marsh's subtle use of visual storytelling is impressive as many scenes do not even need conversation, but reveal much of the characters' feelings through their eyes, faces, and body language. Marsh is an excellent director as The Theory of Everything is a wonderful film!\n\nEddie Redmayne is simply phenomenal as Stephen Hawking. He recreates Hawking's spontaneous youth to his restricted infliction. Redmayne delivered his greatest acting performance as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. His accent, slurs, hindered steps, slight eye and mouth movements, and careful eye expressiveness all convene into a thoroughly convincing portrayal of the legendary theoretical physicist. Redmayne adds a likable charisma and serious thoughtfulness to the role. He is truly astonishing as Stephen Hawking.\n\nLikewise, Felicity Jones gives her best performance as an actress to date in The Theory of Everything as Jane Wilde. Her radiant personality matches her peerless wit in order to depict a believable empathy. Jones is enchanting with her lovely appearance and sympathetic face. She effectively utilizes her eyes and face to reveal a deep sadness and unhappiness in her character. She enthralls you with her kindness, patience, selflessness, and sorrow. Jones beguiles the viewer with a passionate plea for the joys of life. Felicity Jones is just dazzling like the stars in The Theory of Everything.\n\nI must mention besides the riveting direction, fascinating edits, captivating performances, and gripping narrative, The Theory of Everything enamored me with its brilliant score. The classical styling from composer Johann Johannsson is astounding. His rising crescendos and sweeping symphony brings delight and magic to The Theory of Everything. His score echoes the methodical scientific sequences alongside the mesmerizing romance passages. I simply adore Johannsson's score to The Theory of Everything!\n\nIn all, The Theory of Everything is a beautiful romance film that doubles as a shocking biopic. I believe that this film will give you hope and a better appreciation of your own life.",

            "content": "The 2014 film\u00a0The Theory of Everything,\u00a0based on Jane Hawking's memoir\u00a0Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, depicts the life of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). The film does not just focus on Hawking's progression of\u00a0amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\u00a0(ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that causes him to be in a wheelchair and speak through a computer system. It shows his relationship with his ex-wife, Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), and his successes in physics. ALS is fittingly shown as just one part of Hawking's extraordinary life.\n\nThe movie has received\u00a0criticism\u00a0for casting Redmayne as Hawking and being \"the latest [performance] in a long line of what detractors call 'cripping up': able-bodied actors taking on disabled roles, which some critics find as deplorable as the thankfully outdated practice of white actors pretending to be black\". I too would be critical of this casting decision were it not for the special circumstances of this film.\n\nThe film is meant to reflect Jane Hawking's memoir, a story that shows Hawking's life before and after his diagnosis and through every stage of his ALS's progression. This situation is not identical to a character who is always seen in a wheelchair being played by a nondisabled actor or a character who is born blind being played by a seeing actor. When the circumstances prevent the role of a disabled character from being filled by a disabled actor, there are certain steps that must be taken to ensure that the experiences of disabled people are as accurately portrayed as possible.\u00a0The Theory of Everything\u00a0does a very good job of fulfilling this criteria.\n\nFirst of all, Redmayne spent over four months\u00a0studying\u00a0Hawking's life, watching every video he could find on him and reading books written by him. Redmayne worked with a choreographer to record and analyze every movement from picking up a pen to drinking to walking. To understand and accurately portray how the disease affected Hawking throughout the different stages, Redmayne met with over 30 people affected by ALS and viewed photographs of Hawking throughout his life.\n\nMost importantly, Hawking was consulted during every stage of the movie's production. Redmayne met with him before starting to film, and he visited the set during production. Before the movie was released, Hawking viewed the film and gave his approval. Redmayne's hard work paid off, as\u00a0Hawking called the film\u00a0\"broadly true\" and that there were \"certain points when he thought he was watching himself\". After the screening, \"Hawking was so pleased with the movie\" that he let the filmmakers use his own, trademarked computerized voice.\n\nIn instances when disabled characters cannot be played by disabled actors, it is crucial that people affected by that specific disability are included in the process and that their concerns are listened to. Since everyone's experiences are different, multiple people must be consulted. The experiences of disabled people must not be misrepresented, and the reinforcement of stereotypes must be avoided. The motto of the disability rights movement, \"Nothing about us without us\", applies to media representations as well.\nWhen portraying disability, care must be taken to ensure accurate representation and people within the disability community must be included in the process.",

More than anything, it was a theory of something. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to young Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), a graduate student at Cambridge University in 1963. He s a gangly young man and socially awkward. He goes to a mixer where he meets young Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones). She s studying the arts. The two seem to have nothing in common. But when they go to the fall gala, Stephen starts talking about the stars. Jane quotes poetry back to him. The two quickly fall in love.\n\nSCOTT: But all is not well with Stephen. He has a clumsy gait and grabs awkwardly at flatware, pens, and chalk. One day he falls flat on his face on a walkway and is sent to a doctor who diagnoses him with ALS, a deadly neurodegenerative disease. Although Stephen is given only two years to live, Jane marries him and the two make the most of the time they have together. Jane volunteers to sing in her church choir and strikes up a friendship with the choir director Jonathan (Charlie Cox). Soon Jonathan helps out with Stephen and Jane s children. But trouble is brewing in the family.\n\nGREG: Scott, this movie is problematic as it s not clear who the hero is. It looks like Stephen Hawking may be the lead character because its all about his genius and his battle with ALS. But then they quickly bring in Jane and strangely, the story seems to focus on her. Hawking become a bit of a prop, scooting around in his wheelchair. We get to see him at the chalkboard here or there, or in a lecture. But after the point where Hawking is confined to a wheelchair, this becomes Jane s story. In our book Reel Heroes: Volume 1 we break hero patterns down by the number of characters who are in the lead of the story: the lone hero, the duo, and the ensemble. And I think I have to land on this being a duo story, even though Hawking seems to fade into the background in the second half. Further, we break the duo down into the Hero/Sidekick, the Buddy Heroes, and the Divergent Heroes. And I think that last one is where Theory falls. This is the story of how two people came together and ultimately fell apart.\n\nSCOTT: I agree that Stephen and Jane are divergent heroes who travel much of the journey together but then go their separate ways. This movie tells a poignant love story of great triumph over significant obstacles - for both characters, not just for Stephen. It also tells a story about the collapse of a family and the loss of love. The film boldly portrays Stephen in a less than positive light in that he shows less loyalty to Jane than she shows him. We re presented with a realistic view of human resilience and human weakness. While I was impressed with the heartwarming story and with the performances of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, I was a bit underwhelmed with the movie as a whole. The film ventures perilously close to Hallmark-made-for-TV territory. Moreover, we re not given any more than a fleeting glimpse of the scientific breakthroughs that Hawking is known for. I felt a bit cheated by the constant stream of puns about time that apparently (according to this movie) is the foundation of Hawking s genius. A lot of smart professors in the movie clap and shake his hand, and that s about the only indication of his greatness.\n\nGREG: I think you ve really struck the nail on the head. This was a love story. I was surprised that the teen-aged ticket taker said that she had seen this movie and it made her cry. Clearly, this movie was more aimed at an audience more interested in the relationship than the story of a man s genius. And since the title is The Theory of Everything I think we re right to feel a bit cheated that we didn t get any insights into Hawking s genius, or at least his thinking process. If there s a villain in this story it s ALS. This is the thing that is stealing Stephen s physical self. It s also the thing that promised to be done with him in two years. By some miracle, he lived and continues to live well into his seventies. And this is the diabolical turn this villain takes. At the beginning of the story we meet two young and idealistic people who are in love. Jane essentially signs up for a two-year stint. But it is the ongoing and debilitating disease that ultimately destroys their relationship. And this is truly heartbreaking.\n\nSCOTT: The Theory of Everything is a commendable story of two people whose love and loyalty carry them through decades of adversity, but alas, not forever. The movie is interesting in its focus on one of the greatest minds of our generation but there is a lack of depth here that left me wanting more. On the strength of the performances of Redmayne and Jones, I can award this film 3 Reels out of 5. The two divergent heroes travel a remarkable journey, and I was moved and impressed by these characters  strength, loyalty, and resilience. The couple does receive help along the way, and ironically two sources of help (Jonathan and Elaine) end up being the source of the couple s demise. Our two heroes travel a remarkable journey and hence I give them 4 Heroes out of 5. As you point out, Greg, the villain here is a horrid, destructive force of nature that doctors have labeled ALS. As villains go, this disease is formidable even if it isn t quite as interesting as, say, a human villain might be. As such, I will award ALS a rating of 2 Villains out of 5.  Movie: Villains: Heroes:\n\nGREG: The Theory of Everything doesn t deliver on the promise of its title. I kept comparing this movie with a similar story A Beautiful Mind. There are strong parallels. John Nash was a brilliant mathematician plagued by schizophrenia and was helped and supported by his wife. But Mind succeeded where Theory did not because it focused on the struggle of the hero overcoming his obstacles. Theory got divided between the struggle with the disease and the loss of the relationship. The goals of the movie were divided and that splits our attention. I give Theory just 2 out of 5 Reels. This is a divergent hero story but unlike other such heroes we ve reviewed, the focus starts on one hero and the shifts to the other. The first half of the movie is really about Stephen and the second half is about Jane. It s a weak approach and leaves us wanting more. I give this pair 3 out of 5 Heroes. Finally the villain is ALS (or time itself) and is not given much screen time. We watch Stephen lose more and more physical ability, but we really don t see much about the disease or how he overcomes it. What we do see is how Jane is increasingly overwhelmed having to take care of not just their three children, but Hawking as well. I give ALS 3 out of 5 Villains.  Movie: Villains: Heroes:",

HER LOVE CHANGED HIS.\nI did get teary during this picture and I'm not ashamed to say it. Hello Kiddies your pal The Cupid Critic here with the true life story of Jayne and Stephen Hawkin told mostly through the eyes of Jayne as she struggles to help her husband through over the years. What I like mostly about this picture is that its told through the eyes of two people. We see the toll it takes on Jayne trying to help her husband over the years through the tremendous acting of Felicity Jones. They could have easily alienated one of the two but no they don't. I love the first thirty minutes where Stephen is well and can walk and the time they share together is beautiful and its shot beautifully as well by director James Marsh. We can see how much of an impact Jayne makes on Stephen as well, I loved this film for that and I hope it wins for something at Oscars. I give The Theory of Everything a five out of five.",

No doubt Stephen found in Jane, their three beautiful kids, a supportive family, caring friends and last but not least his subscription of Penthouse magazine the courage and interests in life to face every day as a cripple and one dependent on people for everything from feeding to ablutions for the rest of his life. Eddie Redmayne played Professor Hawkins brilliantly and one could see why he was the prohibitive Oscar winner, just as Daniel Day Lewis was the prohibitive winner for My Left Foot.

THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING tells the story of the world's most famous theoretical physicist and cosmologist, Stephen W. Hawking, from his time as an able-bodied Ph. D. student at Cambridge University in the early 1960s, his relationship with his girlfriend and later wife Jane, his personal and professional challenges over the years dealing with his ALS affliction, and up to his receiving the Companion of Honour from Queen Elizabeth II in 1989.\n\nThe film is adapted from Jane Hawking's 2008 memoir, Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen. As the film opens, we see Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) as a wild and carefree student, coxing the university's rowing team, leaving his school work to the last possible moment, and going to coed parties. It is at one such party where he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is also at Cambridge, where she is reading Spanish literature. On the surface, they seem like chalk and cheese. She's a devout member of the \"COE\" (Church of England); he has \"a slight problem with the celestial dictatorship premise.\" But Jane falls for Stephen's geeky confidence and the two start dating. It is not long after, when his body begins to fail him, that his doctor gives him the bad news - he has, at most, two years left to live. Jane doesn't care and decides to marry him anyway, promising to look after him for as long as he is alive.\n\nLittle did she know at the time that Hawking would defy all expectations and live well beyond that prognosis. As the disease continues to ravage his body, Hawking goes from relying on one cane to two to being forced to use a wheelchair. Feeding himself becomes increasingly difficult until it becomes impossible. His mind, however, is just as sharp as ever and he completes his doctorate. Jane, meanwhile, has to forego her own doctorate studies to look after Stephen and their children. As Hawking tells a friend, not every part of his body is affected.\n\nWhile at a conference in France in 1985, Hawking contracts pneumonia and, once again, the doctors give him no chance of survival. Jane, however, insists that her husband will recover, which he does. The price of that recovery, though, is a tracheotomy which leaves the physicist unable to speak on his own. Fortunately, American Walt Woltosz comes along and he provides Hawking with an \"Equalizer\", the world's first portable speech synthesizer - the method of communication Hawking uses even today. (Woltosz built the Equalizer for his own mother, who had also suffered from ALS.)\n\nYears of looking after Hawking's needs takes its toll on Jane though. At her mother's suggestion, she joins a church choir where she strikes up a platonic relationship with the choirmaster, the recently widowed Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox). When Jane decides to finally complete her degree, Hawking agrees to hire external help. Hawking takes a shining to one caregiver, Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake), who seems only too pleased to turn the pages of his Penthouse magazine for him. It's only a matter of time before the Hawkings' marriage falls apart and the two separate in 1990. (They divorced in 1995.)\n\nThere is a fine line a director has to walk if he/she is going to make a film about a character with a physical disability. If the story is too teary, it risks being a sob fest. Not teary enough, and there isn't an emotional connection to the characters. The latter is the problem I have with THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. At its heart, this film is a love story, albeit a very complicated one. But there is something too clinical about the story. We don't feel either of their pain. The science-y parts are cinematically reduced to swirling coffee cups, fireworks in reverse and a blazing fire as viewed through a wool sweater. Similarly, the disability parts are limited to seeing Hawking's body atrophy as the disease progresses. There are no scenes of Jane spoon-feeding Stephen, putting him in the bathtub or cleaning him up after he goes to the toilet. The story could have benefitted from a bit of tasteful schmaltz - but just a bit.\n\nBut this is my only beef and THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING really is a good film thanks to the competent performances from both Redmayne and Jones. Together they elevate the film from what could easily have been movie-of-the-week melodrama to something artful and entertaining. I predict that the two actors, as well as the director (James Marsh, MAN ON WIRE), will take home BAFTAs (R) in February. \n\nFree up some \"space\" in your calendar and go see this film. It's definitely worth your \"time\". That's my pun for the week.",

            "content": "For over one hundred years the silver screen has been bringing us stories that chronicle the lives of well-known individuals; some choose to veer off the facts for a more entertaining viewing experience whilst others are often inspiring in their nature. The Theory of Everything is the newest addition to the long line of biographical films and it's another moving example of why the genre has endured for so long.\n\nThe Theory of Everything (based on Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen by Jane Hawking) follows the life and exploits of Professor Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) as he deals with the sudden onset and progression of motor neurone disease, the relationship with his wife Jane (Felicity Jones) and his studies and theories of astro-physics. Beginning in 1963, we are taken through the entirety of Stephen's adult life and are given full witness to the pressures and struggles he and his wife endured over the years. Their bond is kept as a central focus at all times with Stephen's family life and contributions to science running alongside, allowing the film's emotional scenes to draw immense sympathy and even a hint of heartbreak from the audience. Yet just as Stephen feels intense frustration at first and then accepts and learns to transcend his condition, so too will audiences move beyond the sad nature of Hawking's situation and be instilled with a feeling of hopefulness; the final scenes especially are filled to burst with emotional resonance, seamlessly putting across the film's inspirational message. The film also integrates the theme of science verses religion at certain points, with the intellectual dialogue drawing the viewer in even more. Audiences will be endlessly drawn to Hawking's tale; between the titular professor's seemingly impassable constraints and ultimate overcoming of difficulties, The Theory of Everything is delightfully absorbing from start to finish.\n\nLooking at the film's production details reveals that Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones spent quite a bit of time learning their roles and the results are something to behold; with a combination of facial expressions, muffled speech and awkward movements, Redmayne comes as close as possible to the real Stephen Hawking, delivering an uncompromising and compelling performance all around. By contrast to Redmayne's restricted expressions, Jones conveys a great range of emotions for Stephen's wife; most notably her determined and resilient nature in being with Stephen and promising to beat his condition. But despite her steadfast dedication to Stephen, Jane isn't a perfect individual; she does feel the frustration and pressure starting to mount and she does come to question just how long her marriage to Stephen will last. These are the kinds of performances which are both highly relatable and reinforce the film's realistic portrayal of its source material. The side characters played by the likes of David Thewlis and Maxine Peake make good use of the material they're given and never distract from the central chemistry between Redmayne and Jones. The cast members are every bit as engaging as the plot they inhabit and are most definitely the greatest aspect of the film.\n\nDespite being a drama as opposed to a genre with rapid cuts and framing, The Theory of Everything also mixes in its own style of cinematography. To link in with the film's scientific undertones, the camera often spins and homes in on circular objects to reflect Stephen's theories of space and time, which transports the viewer into the inner workings of his mind. The music is a delicate blend of emotive undertones and hopeful rises, perfectly complimenting Stephen's climb from frustration to overcoming the greatest of personal challenges. The make-up and costuming team also deserve high praise for their authentic designs and the very convincing way in which they show both Stephen and his wife aging and changing over 30 long years. Technical presentation isn't really such a major component in dramas but The Theory of Everything takes pride in going the extra mile to engage the audience that much more.\n\nThe Theory of Everything has a heartfelt and emotional story, a symbolic cinematic style, and brilliant characters brought to life by the outstanding performances of Redmayne and Jones, culminating in the first big hit of 2015. As an inspiring biopic on an extraordinary individual, it has very few equals.",

The movie begins in 1963, we get an insight into the everyday life of a young genius, he's fun, he's flirty, he's a messer just like most young college kids. His charm and intellect captures the heart of the poetically sensitive Jane Wilde and love begins to bloom, but the tide soon turns on Hawking as he's diagnosed with motor neuron disease and given two years to live. Hawking comes to terms with his mortality over a game of croquet with the very lovable Jane, I have to say I don't really understand croquet very well so I think I missed out on some of Hawking's game but he ends up with the girl in his bedroom so he obviously plays it just right. I think the rest of the movie plays out a little like 'Love & Other Drugs' but it replaces risqu\u00e9 romance with risqu\u00e9 mathematics. All in all the film is a slow moving drama, it's concerned with the decline of the human body when afflicted with Motor Neuron, it's about changing views in science, the depth of the cosmos and the more complicated intricacies of love. \n\nThere's a brief Michael Jackson moment where Hawking is left holding his baby and you're not sure what's going to happen, but other than that the film doesn't really deliver on suspense. The movie doesn't challenge the various relationships that develop within the household and fails to really deliver on the science kicks, it's too appeasing to be entertaining and you'll get more insight on the life of Hawking from Wikipedia. The movie is well acted and pays huge respect to a man who's dedicated his life to scientific development, but if your inclined to see the film I'd recommend waiting for the DVD or for free-view tv to pick it up because it's not going to have you on the edge of your seat, it's not going to change your life and it's just not worth venturing to the cinema to see. \nRead more reviews @ http://www.thechampsvoice.com/movie-reviews",

Both leads, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are superb as the central protagonists. Redmayne won the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of the cosmologist and it is perhaps easy to overlook the brilliance of Jones' performance. This is a moving story about how love can conquer every obstacle but that is doesn't necessarily always turn out in the way we would have expected.

            "content": "The life of Stephen Hawking makes for an amazing story, which probably explains why Hollywood finally got onboard and put together 'The Theory of Everything.' The elegant biopic, directed by James Marsh, is a look at the trials and tribulations Dr. Hawking and his family endured as he was diagnosed with ALS.\n\nIn 'Everything,' Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones light up the screen as Stephen and Jane Hawking. Their story is told from the beginning of their relationship, when they met at a party at the University of Cambridge. From the beginning, Stephen and Jane are the definition of opposites attracting, and a central point of 'Everything' is the duality between religion (Jane's Christian faith) and science (Stephen's constant conquest for solving the origin of the universe). This theme surfaces at multiple points, and helps to humanize the two of them. The rest of the supporting cast is good, but no one even comes close to distracting the audience from Redmayne and Jones (Redmayne of course won an Academy Award for his portrayal).\n\nOther elements that help 'Everything' include a simple, yet touching soundtrack and beautiful cinematography. While it's a dialogue-heavy film and there isn't a whole lot of \"excitement\" to speak of, that does not detract from the story that is told. There are no scenes that feel like a waste of time, and importantly, 'Everything' does not turn into a bloated vanity project, which is what happens to many similar films. Fortunately, Dr. Hawking's life is interesting and the central role that his family plays in the film is definitely touching to see.\n\n'The Theory of Everything' garnered quite a bit of Oscar buzz last year, and for good reason. While few actually saw the film in theaters, it will likely build a larger audience from here on out.",

Director James Marsh's film is lovely looking, but it's sorely lacking anything that doesn't feel cliche, misleading, or inert. Eddie Redmayne is...fine. Felicity Jones is...fine. The screenplay, score, Marsh's direction...all fine. But it's hard to feel inspired watching this movie. Everyone seems like they're going through the motions, hitting all the beats someone deemed necessary to make the audience feel some feels.\n\nThe film is a biopic chronicling some of the life of world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking (Redmayne). We meet him as a young student, brilliant but cocky. He's interested in finding a unifying \"theory of everything,\" something that binds the laws of quantum mechanics (micro) with the laws of general relativity (macro), when he meets Jane Wilde (Jones), a God-fearing young woman who clicks with Hawking despite their opposing sets of values.\n\nNot long after their meeting, however, Hawking collapses. His doctor tells him he's suffering from a motor neuron disease (one that's similar to ALS) which will rob him of all muscular function but leave his brain unaffected. He's given two years to live. Wilde is offered an out, but she won't have it. She does love Stephen and vows to be with him, care for him for as long as they have together. So they marry and have a few children, and Stephen continues his work-physically handicapped but as mentally sharp as ever-unlocking the mysteries of the universe.\n\nThe film is at its best when it's simple. Its first 20 minutes tell a delicate story about a man and woman laying the groundwork of a relationship with potential. Two gentle souls date, meet their families, and learn about the other's interests. It's nothing new, but it's very well-executed.\n\nPerhaps that's why the rest of the film's running time-when you're being blugeoned to death by overcooked ham-feels interminable. From the moment Hawking is diagnosed, the film falls into a series of predictable and socially regressive traps. Conversation about a suffering wife's faithfulness? Check. Diminishing complex science by using everyday objects as examples? Check. \"Love conquers all\" platitudes? Check.\n\nBut those platitudes (handled so uniquely in Interstellar...seriously, anyone doubting Nolan's ability to script emotional plausibly need only watch this film to observe the power of what he pulled off) are unproven before the film even reaches its conclusion. A Brief History of Time-Errol Morris' great Hawking doc-went there, but I wasn't sure Marsh and company would. That said, every line is phrased in a way that prevents the audience from feeling anything other than exactly what the filmmakers want them to. The Theory of Everything's final act could have been really interesting, but all that is eschewed for overcoming-the-odds biopic sappiness.\n\nEddie Redmayne gives a performance that's impressive physically, but his Hawking, even in older age, is just a boy. It's disappointing because Hawking's life is such an astounding one, and this film covers more than thirty years, yet Redmayne never lends his character the gravitas the film's second half so desperately needs.\n\nFelicity Jones is better than her co-star on that front, but she's let down by a screenplay that never sees her character as more than a facilitator. She helps a (male) genius do his genius work, but when she's afforded a chance to talk about something other than her husband or the man she's accused of being unfaithful with, she is forced to demonstrate scientific principles on the level of a fifth-grader.\n\nTechnically, the film features some great cinematography, as I've mentioned, as well as a decent, delicate score from composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson. But ultimately, there's very little inspiring about The Theory of Everything. It's content being a straightforward biopic because it assumes its emotional power is enough to overcome the trappings of the genre. It doesn't, and its startling lack of originality makes it come across as lazy. What a shame.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/the-theory-of-everything-review/",

Part of my interest in the film is that it's not merely focused on Stephen himself, but also on his wife Jane Wilde-Hawking as the two individuals feel first pulled together in the same direction before fording differing paths. Part of the praise must go to the unbelievable story and the two people behind it all, and part to the two amazing actors who gave the film life on multiple layers.",

I realized that that computer tone, for one reason or another, represents a higher learning and understanding of ethereal concepts and lofty thinking.\n\nThis playing of Stephen's life, essentially, also made me realize how my thinking of Stephen Hawking has changed as I've learned about him and understood how his life has changed as well. The film is absolutely beautiful; the cinematography and drama laces together so perfectly and the time passes effortlessly over the course of Stephen's life. First and foremost the film is about Jane and Stephen, and THEN how motor neuron disease affects them. That turn hits so early, like in the first 20 minutes, where Stephen trips and gets his diagnosis, which is GREAT - i love a film that is almost exposition-less and gets right to the interesting parts.\n\nI think there's a lot to learn about patience and dedication from Jane and Stephen's relationship - if you put yourself outside of the situation and look at what it means to be a loving and forgiving partner you'll see that being caring and taking care of each other is far and away the most important part of being supportive and significant.\n\nThe other huge takeaway was the wonderful score; god, it supported the story and transitions so well. It's also interesting how time is so integral to a film and how Stephen's studies and theorizing fold into his life and then the exploration at the end (you'll have to see it to know) really brings the whole story full circle.\n\nIt's such an interesting mind and character that Eddie Redmayne brings to life as Hawking; he never loses his humor and insight and in his final monologue at the end of the movie, it really hits you how influential his work has been over the course of his life. He's really a visionary mind that the world will sorely miss when he's gone.\n\nNot worth the theater, but worth your time. Don't be foolish - see this soon!",

When he divorced her, no allegations of abuse of him on her part were made, but once again he started to maintain a closer relationship with his family.

What is less obvious is the love story between the religious Jane (Jones) and the agnostic genius. \n\nWhen he is diagnosed with fatal (well, not yet) MND and given 2 years to live, Hawking tells his new girlfriend to go away. She refuses and tells everyone just how tough she is. But Jesus cannot save her from weak flesh. Years down the line, with Hawking a physical wreck, she falls for the widower priest who leads the choir. At first, he becomes their dearest friend and helper, but when Hawking's family sees what's what, they question the paternity of the couple's third child. Their romance is portrayed as an innocent platonic dalliance. But when Hawking gets a full time maid, his affections from the Mrs. waver, and they split up. And back together go the able bodied, Jesus loving lovers.\n\nThis is all well played, but frankly, is dramatically tepid at best. There had to be smoke, and if there was no smoke, it detracts from the film.\n\nI found Redmayne very watchable, sympathetic and a shade too good to be true. Jones is also very good indeed. I usually don't go for this sort of thing, all too English and bland, but he is a real hero. \n\nWell done everyone.",

It's a well-made movie, focusing on his relationship with his first wife with whom they have three children. \n\nIt's more or less a film about a relationship where one of the two partners is seriously ill and the other tries to support and be there. And then again, it's not completely about that. It seems to me that the intention was to portray this, but with SH being who he is, it could not be just a movie about his relationship. They had to have some background about him and his work. But then, incorporating this in the film, it inevitably took away time and depth from the depiction of the relationship and all its ups and downs. \n\nThe result for me is indeed a touching movie with all the elements there, or at least most of them, and with an amazing role being performed in the best way possible. Apart from that, it seems that the movie remains superficial around the topics of the relationship, leaving out many elements of the cruel reality that could serve the purpose of the movie. We never got to find out how they coped, we never got to find out about the actual and real problems of the couple and the children. They are being heavily implied but not tackled with directly. Instead of that, the movie just shows the picture of Professor SH running around on his chair with the children hanging from it. \n\nI also missed the participation of the respective families in this or the declaration of their absence. His father and mother seem really distant from everything else other than some family gatherings, which looks odd when we do not have any indication of them having some tension or problems in their relationship. I mean, if your child goes through that, you are there the whole time, something we never saw in the movie. \n\nDon't let me be misunderstood, I really loved the movie. But, I would expect something more from it, given that it does have a really interesting and powerful story in its core. My problem is that in a way the director or maybe the script writer, chose the mainstream/in between path, of creating a film that shows a little bit of everything to capture diverse audiences, whereas this film should be about the relationship in all its depth and width... \n\nI would highly recommend watching it! And if a comparison could be made with the Imitation Game, which kind of resembles it in a way, I would give thumbs up to the Imitation Game any day of the week.",

Eddie Redmayne won the Best Actor Oscar as Hawking but the film belongs equally (if not more) to Felicity Jones as Jane his wife (from whose book the script was derived).  The story is less about physics than about human relationships (check Errol Morris's A Brief History of Time for a bit more science) and it plays pretty well given the heightened emotions that motor neuron disease adds to the story.  Somehow it is hard to believe that Hawking is 72 now.  At any rate, it is probably a stereotype-breaker to see Hawking as sexually active and leaving his wife for his nurse, but it really happened (with no ill will apparently).  The film itself has the strengths and weaknesses of all biopics but it is stylishly done (with almost experimental \"inserts\" between scenes).  Enjoyable enough for a night in.",

It's a love so romantic and deep that not even Hawking's ALS diagnosis and a prediction of his death in about two years can derail it. The couple marries and ends up having three children together. He, of course, lives much more than two more years and her self-sacrificial devotion enables him to earn his doctorate and pursue some of the most important scientific research of the 20th Century, culminating with his best-selling book \"A Brief History of Time\".\n\nThe story is based on Jane Hawking's book \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\" and takes its title from an unauthorized compilation of Hawking's research as he looks for a single formula which would tie together the main fields of study within physics. The stories of Jane and Stephen's relationship and Stephen's work are interwoven so that the two narrative threads are inseparable, as they were in real life. Stephen's deteriorating condition is dramatically portrayed, but not exploited. The story of their marriage is both uplifting and unsettling, as both partners provide what the other needs, but each of their hearts eventually drifts toward another.\n\n\"The Theory of Everything\" is both realistic and artistic. The skillfully told story is laid out with exceptional emotional depth by both of the leads and by the extraordinary commitment on the part of Redmayne to portray Stephen Hawking's physical and vocal deterioration with both accuracy and Hawking's characteristic humor and well-known humanity. At a few points in the movie, director James Marsh uses a subtle color tinting in his cinematography to help enhance the mood of the scene. He also gives the movie an ending that is perfectly suited to the subject matter. Although, the film has a few dull moments, most of it is positive, enlightening and beautiful to behold. I'm giving \"The Theory of Everything\" an \"A-\", and I'll be looking for it and for the names of Redmayne and Jones on nomination lists during the fast-approaching awards season.",

We all know that Dr. Hawking will surpass the given life expectancy and so one of the challenges of the film, adapted to the screen by Anthony McCarten from Jane Hawking's memoir, is to construct an arc that feels complete, from the moment Hawking received the terrible news until the publication of his book, \"A Brief History of Time.\"\n\nThroughout the course of the picture, I admired Redmayne's very human performance. He is able to turn a renowned astrophysicist into just another person afflicted by a disease that has no cure and yet provide colorful, complex layers, especially during the final third in which the subject is no longer able to speak. I imagined how difficult it must have been to play the character convincingly because every limb and facial expression must be on point-even if the camera is capturing images only from the chest up.\n\nTo be consistent in his portrayal take after take must have required a lot of effort, research, and determination. The way he is able to contort his face and fingers appears highly uncomfortable but nonetheless convincing. To top it off, not once does Redmayne forget to communicate with his eyes. They are always strong and alive even when the character's body is weak and frail.\n\nI was surprised and disappointed that the picture is not really about the science behind Hawking's theories. There are some science, simplistic enough to be understood by laymen but still interesting enough for those who would like to know more. The movie is more about the relationship between Stephen and Jane (Felicity Jones) and the love they shared. Although their partnership comes across as too glossy at times, there are enough moments of honesty that are painful, like Jane having to push herself to be with Stephen in their later years even if it no longer felt right. The push-and-pull between Jane wanting to stay and leave is great drama because it is essentially a question of doing the right thing. But for whom?\n\nAlthough the score is a bit overbearing at times, the picture is beautifully photographed. The first half is bathed in a bright yellow glow, signifying optimism, youth, a surplus of energy and inspiration to tackle what the world has to offer head-on. The second half, on the other hand, is considerably less saturated, as if to reflect the subject's physical decay. The characters move a little slower, their faces more saggy, a bit grey. A certain level of acceptance is in the air.\n\n\"The Theory of Everything\" is able to hone in on what is important to Stephen and Jane, together and respectively, and that is why it works. I felt a bit of dread when I began to realize that the romance would comprise about half of the running time. Instead, it surprised me because I grew to invest in Jane and Stephen as a couple, that romance is not just reflected in maintaining a marriage but in the compatibility of souls.\n\nFilm-Review.org",

            "content": "I really liked it better when there were only 5 nominees for the Oscar for Best Picture (even when Dark Knight didn't get nominated and fanboys went crazy) because it recognized a smaller collection of movies that were more deserving of the award, let alone the nomination. At first I felt like the Theory of Everything is one of those movies that is almost worthy of the nomination, but that it was only nominated since up to 10 movies can now be nominated for that Oscar. Now after looking at the list again and having seen all those films nominated for best picture, Theory of Everything triumphs over The Imitation Game, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and American Sniper - perhaps even Selma.\n\nI still think the two strongest films of the year were Birdman and Whiplash, but the acting in The Theory of Everything is phenomenal, especially Eddie Redmayne's performance as the brilliant yet handicapped Stephen Hawking. I felt guilty nearly giggling at Hawking's speech impediment when it is first introduced in the film, but shortly after realized it is how the physicist actually had to speak and that Redmayne must have a true gift to be able to recreate such a severe handicap.\n\nWhile I realize the purpose of this film was primarily the romance between Hawking and Jane, his wife who he eventually leaves, I would have liked to see more of Hawking's theory/work or at least see more into the theory with specific details. We have a film about one of the most intelligent people who ever lived, but the filmmakers wanted to dumb down Hawking's theory and his discoveries to \"benefit\" the audience.\n\nI'm not sure how I would have liked to see the film end, but I thought it was strange to have Hawking acknowledge his wife and family so abruptly after leaving Jane towards the conclusion of the film. It is a sentimental moment, but it is brief and simple before a \"rewinding\" sequence which looks back on the film (the lives of the two lovers) as a whole. A strong relationship story, but I would have liked to see more about the theory instead of that becoming disregarded for the sake of the love story.",

            "content": "Who really is Stephen Hawking? \u00e2?? That is the question you should really ask of this man who has made his mark on the world both scientifically and personally. Many will be able to recognise the name Stephen Hawking and even remember his wheelchair-bound appearance, yet not many people will be able to elaborate on his scientific endeavours or his personal struggles. So it appears that the world needs a nourishing of knowledge as to who really was this great scientific mind of the last 50 years. There are no visual depictions of Stephen Hawking therefore now at the age of 72, it seems apt that his life should be hailed scientifically and investigated personally as to how he experienced his physical transformation. Well, 2015 has just begun and brought along a film exploring the younger transformative years of Hawking up until his worldwide recognition as a disabled genius.\n \nJames Marsh\u00e2??s The Theory of Everything falls into the category of a biopic, and considering the life of Stephen Hawking encompasses 50 eventful years starting form his university career at Cambridge to his scientific breakthroughs of black holes, The Theory of Everything does just about enough to satisfy your understanding of the enigma that is Stephen Hawking. The film explores Hawking\u00e2??s relationship with a fellow student Jane Wilde perhaps a little too over-zealously, his tragic physical deterioration as a result of his Motor Neurone disease gradually paralysing him and his scientific endeavours that have shaped modern cosmology. The Theory of Everything places so much emphasis on Hawking and Wilde\u00e2??s relationship that it has shaped the film as a romantic-led drama. Often, romantic-drama\u00e2??s are the paramount amalgamation of boredom, but this film manages to keep its head just above water and produce an intriguing depiction that enriches your knowledge of Stephen Hawking.\n \nEddie Redmayne, star of Les Mis\u00c3\u00a9rables and My Week With Marilyn, literally buries himself into the role of Stephen Hawking as by the end all you see is the scientific genius himself. Redmayne\u00e2??s physical transformation is truly a marvellous piece of acting as he scene by scene excellently calculates Hawking\u00e2??s gradual frailties making his downfall appear realistically tragic. Redmayne needed to accustom himself to the habits of Hawking in order to even attempt the role. He has transformed his stature, his voice, his movements but most importantly has still managed to retain the genius of his thoughts by always appearing aware of situations even though he looks unresponsive. It is a real struggle to watch him do his interpretation because it looks so real, or even better, someone real actually went through this same problem and is still going through it. This is a truly visceral performance that towers over the film by instigating all its success as it plays such an integral part in the film\u00e2??s course of action. Felicity Jones stars as the female lead, Jane Wilde. Not taking anything away from Redmayne but she is the audience\u00e2??s connection to the ever-deteriorating Hawking and actually is most of the time the only one resuming normal acting duties and boy does she do a good job at it. Jones\u00e2?? character faces a delicately stringent dilemma that could tarnish her reputation as a patient, loving wife even though she has endured more than anybody has seen of her. After 25-years of tiring struggles, no one can blame her if she wants just a little bit of action! Jones is truly captivating as the lead woman whose aura of boldness and power grows as her husband physically declines. Jones\u00e2?? performance excels as a woman that has performed the miracle of patience. Both Redmayne and Jones are the engines to this movie and without their Golden Globe nominated performances; The Theory of Everything would truly suffer.\n \nThe Theory of Everything is essentially divided into two genres: romance and drama. The romantic aspect of the film is perhaps a little too overly-incorporated into the film that it directs which road of his life to head down. Yes it does teach us the personal life of Hawking and the woman that endured his transformation, but the film\u00e2??s digression into romantic territory has undoubtedly impacted the scientific side of his life. The film makes you feel the love between two people who have been through a hellish struggle together but their relationship lacks a bite to it as it never fluctuates and always remains on the same level. Their romance is disappointing, but you can\u00e2??t manoeuvre real life for cinematic benefit. However, there is an emotional ode to their relationship and this is perhaps the best scene in the film because it feels so real and heart-rendering making the experience seem worth it. The drama side of proceedings formulates itself as extremely tough viewing at some points of his physical change. You end up becoming bogged down in its tragic depictions of his physical downfall but because you know there is a positive outcome to this story you try not to fall into dreariness. Thus, The Theory of Everything is a moving film that lacks an ending because the story still lives on and that is testament to how remarkable Hawking is as a person as he has defeated obstacles continuously for the last 50 years. Romance and drama don\u00e2??t go hand in hand as both are powerful genres on their own and need a lot of time for exploration. As a result, the film touches over things and never really explores anything that isn\u00e2??t romantically involved. There should be more about the science Hawking is most known for, but his breakthroughs in science are merely mulled over and employed as a foil to his physical capitulation as the unknown hope the universe radiates is mirrored in his condition\u00e2??s unpredictability.\n \nIt is a polished looking film that despite its harsh subject matter appears bright and hopeful. It is brightly lit giving it an almost glowing appearance symbolising The Theory of Everything as a film of hope and belief that even through inconsolably despondent times, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. This metaphoric understanding demonstrates that the film has utilised everything as a means to comprehend his personal life rather than know what Stephen stands for scientifically. As a result, the film drags for long periods because it swallows you in its shiny-looking despondency. Both the lack of humorous output to dumb down the film\u00e2??s intensity and whining instrumentals to accompany despondent scenes truly brings you down a lot that when the film is 1 hour and a half in, you can\u00e2??t wait for the end because the uplifting moments become overshadowed by the barrage of negativity in Hawking\u00e2??s life. The only thing that keeps you feeling upbeat about Hawking\u00e2??s life is that he is still alive today and has made monumental strides in our scientific understandings of the universe. The Theory of Everything intently explores the personal downfall of Hawking\u00e2??s physical abilities, but what would have suited Hawking\u00e2??s story is a more fervent display of his scientific prowess; a contribution most people would recognise him for but struggle to explain exactly what he has done.\n \nThe Theory of Everything is an intriguing insight into the personal life of Stephen Hawking brilliantly acted by Eddie Redmayne, but this insight would have fascinated further if it payed more attention into the science that made him famous.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        6/10",

            "content": "The Theory of Everything is a truly remarkable film about one of the most remarkable men who has ever lived. Eddie Redmayne puts down one of the best performances of the year with his representation of physicist Stephen Hawking. \n\nThe film begins with Stephen Hawking about to complete his thesis topic. He meets Jane Wilde (played by Felicity Jones) and the two instantly start to fall in love.  From the start you see the progression of Lou Gehrig's disease in Redmayne's performance. Starting with small limps, awkward pen holding, clumsiness, and shakiness it culminates in a fall on the way to class. Doctors tell Hawking he only has two years to live and takes the news very hard.\n\nWilde stands by his side during all of this and tells him of her love. The two get married and have children. All of this occurs while Hawking's body muscles continues to degrade from him having to use crutches to the eventual use of an electric wheel chair. Redmayne plays the struggle to speak and move brilliantly. You can see the pain and sadness with each progression.\n\nFelicity Jones does an excellent job in her own right. Portraying someone in love who struggles to keep everything in order. The struggle is one of mutual love and respect without anger. Jones pulls off an indescribably good performance showing how loved ones adapt to difficult situations. You can't help but feel for her as the two start to grow apart.\n\nMy only real criticism would be in the story itself. It seems to almost downplay the importance of what Stephen Hawking discovered and it never gives you a scope of how it affected the science world. It's focus on the personal life story comes at the cost of not showing you how brilliant this man is to overcome so many physical obstacles to accomplish so much. The movie isn't short on telling you how brilliant Stephen Hawking is but they don't show it. \n\nIt is also unfortunate some scenes seem a bit dumbed down for the audience and the film spends too much time arguing the possibility of God, time that would have been well spent on showing Hawking's accomplishments in more detail. The acting in The Theory of Everything is world class and nothing short of brilliant, the cinematography and score are beautiful, but the story left me wanting more.",

Using the autobiographical book by Jane Hawking, Marsh explores the love life of one of our greatest scientists, Stephen Hawking. Around the time Hawking was a student studying relativity and black holes, he was stricken with the neuromuscular disorder which leaves him paralyzed and helpless today. But he had just met Jane who devotes her life to his care and builds a family with Stephen as his physical body succumbs, his intellect grows and his celebrity explodes.\n\n Actually very little of the science of Stephen Hawking is in this film which was a bit of a letdown. Marsh focuses on the personal relationship between Stephen and Jane and the strain his circumstances place on their marriage. But the two leads sell the love story like gangbusters and curiosity remains throughout as Jane struggles with her desires for normal companionship while never giving up on her increasing famous and dependent husband. \n\nEddie Redmayne (Les Miserables; My Week With Marilyn) gives a miracle performance as Stephen Hawking. Every mannerism and nuanced emotion is precise and never showy. It's a masterwork of mimicry. And Felicity Jones (Like Crazy; The Invisible Woman) matches him as the capable and devoted Jane, her powerful raw emotions drawing us into their unique world - tragic, beautiful, and uncompromising. They are both Oscar-bound, and the film should be an across the board contender in a number of major categories. The Theory of Everything may not be the most successful - or for some, compelling - biopic, but it's worth seeing for those amazing lead performances.",

The result is a film that seemingly loses nuance or objectivity with its subject, and instead gives us a central story, that of the romance, that never feels real. The performances, though good, fail to gain any real chemistry.\n\nAbove all, the biggest fault of Theory of Everything is in the direction. James Marsh, as talented and as mature as he is, fails to engage the viewer. The pace is slower than innovation at the DMV and what we see fails to translate well to cinema, it's a story that feels forcibly put on to screen, and a drain on our time. \n\nA disappointment.\n\n2.5/5 Stars",

            "content": "Some things may continue to go undiscovered throughout the history of time with people striving to figure out the most perplexing questions the universe has to offer. The search for a theory that explains everything may be a fool's errand but perhaps its been with us the whole time. Geniuses like Stephen Hawking based his whole life on it but maybe it's the love of another that is the reason for being and makes us continue to go on. Because without it he wouldn't be the man that he is today, surviving against insurmountable odds to tell his extraordinary life. With The Theory Of Everything, his life is told in such exquisite detail that it's hard to realize that we are watching an actor play him. The love of his wife Jane and the search to discover all that is around him made for a gorgeous love story that transcends all barriers while showing that without love, a person can never be whole within themselves.\nStephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is studying at Cambridge unsure of what to label his thesis. Hawking is a highly intelligent student who just happens to catch the eye of fellow student Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) which quickly blossoms into a romance. When everything seemed to be going well for the time being, Stephen is struck a major blow when he is found out to have Lou Gehrig's disease at the all too young age of 21. With a life expectancy of two years, he struggled to find a point for his grim time table. But Jane having falling in love with him vowed to stay by his side despite the short time he has. Now rejuvenated and given a new lease on life, he discovered theories that changes how we view the universe and life on earth itself to later become one of the most intelligent, highly respected and influential men on earth. \nSometimes singular performances in biopics often muddle the truth to make them more appealing like John Nash in A Beautiful Mind and sometimes they transcend what we expect from them and go into another level of brilliance. Such is the case with Redmayne's impeccable performance as Hawking who literally takes it to another plane. Never really hearing of him before, I was awestruck by how great he was and may look back on his previous roles that he is also famous for. He was pretty good in Hick that being the only other film I've seen him in. It was one of the best performances I have seen in quite a while and was like watching a carbon copy of Hawking himself. \nIt got to be hard to watch after a while seeing him struggle to perform even the most simplest of tasks. The dedication to the role that Redmayne showed is unlike anything that has been seen lately and something that needs to be seen to be believed. I compare it to Daniel Day-Lewis Oscar winning role as Christy Brown in My Left Foot as they share many comparisons. Two European geniuses stuck in a body that is just begging to come out that persevere with horrible odds. Whether Redmayne gets the Oscar for best actor is yet to be seen but he will without a shadow of a doubt be nominated come January when the nominations come out. Redmayne completely transforms his body and mind to become the man which is no easy thing to do given his worsening condition later in life. The way that he contorts his body and speaks in nearly unintelligible form is one of the most awestruck and believable pieces of acting that will be hard to match. The limited speech and movement that he portrayed was one of the most realistic performances that I will ever see. \nAnybody who knows his story can see where it was going but it didn't make it any easier to process and handle. Seeing him breakdown physically and mentally was heartbreaking as the film went on. I had no idea how open and inviting Hawking was, but Redmayne exuded great charm, wit and personality to really flesh him out and bring him to life. Those little instances of comedy and warmth that he provided made the film a little easier to watch. Seeing him persevere despite all that was happening to him was inspiring while showing that anything was possible. As he lost more of his senses and body movements, he still showed how expressive he can be. Redmayne may have been stuck physically, but he still was able to present a wide array of emotions through his facial recognition. Anybody who can do that is a superior actor in the highest order and not many can do that with such limited capabilities. \nJones was just as good and integral to the makeup of the film. She was just as charming and witty, challenging Stephen along the way from their first initial meeting all the way up to their long standing marriage. Jones brought a fine groundwork to the proceedings that brought out the harsh internal struggle that she was going through across the film. She played a subdued performance that showed the strenuous toll that Stephens's condition was having on her, her life as well as dealing with three kids. Her best scenes showed her trying to deal with it as Stephen is having fun with the kids, leaving her alone to deal with everything else. Jane's pained struggle brought out the best in Jones as she was put in a situation that no one ever wants to be put in. their dual performances brought out the best and the worst in themselves while providing a great anchor to the story making it all the more heartbreaking and satisfying in the end. It was one of the best one two performances this year with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl being the other.\nThe direction by James Marsh was impeccably well done and presented in such an artful way that the love story never felt like it bogged down the film. You really get deep into the mind of Hawking at his most vital moments of his professional and personal life where you feel like nothing was left out. Using an array of colors, music and imagery, a gorgeous spectacle of emotions was expertly conveyed. I loved the use of spirals used like the staircase, crackling fire and the milk in the coffee that would harken back to his black hole theory at certain moments of his life. The gorgeous cinematography by Beno\u00eet Delhomme showed how isolated and alone Jane and Stephen were during the film. Some of the shots looked downright spectacular like when Stephen was given his diagnosis by a doctor. Stephen was so detached from himself and the doctor that the hallway in the foreground looked to be going on forever, overtaking the shot and the doctor in it. You feel how entrapped both Stephen and Jane are, just begging to get out for some air. The pacing was very even allowing for certain moments to take center stage while pulling at the right heartstrings when needed, but not feeling too overly sentimental or cheesy. \nOne of my favorite scenes was the dance that Stephen and Jane went too with Stephen being confident but not over confident. They both charm each other with their respective intelligences throughout the night, winning her over as it progresses. Stephen finally gives in to Jane for a dance amid a beautifully lit bridge under the dark moon light. \nWithout knowing too much about his life, I was completely captivated by all that he has been through and far more brilliant than I ever anticipated. It's a story that was simply made to be told and may fall into the Oscar bait category but it rightfully deserves any accolades it gets.\nThe script by Anthony McCarten was great and full of charm, love, whimsy, wit and heartbreaking truths of what one would do for the ones we love when put in a terrible situation. It was light on science which is what I expected since that would have been far longer and complex to get into. It was never meant to be the main focus anyway and I'm glad it wasn't. It was surprisingly funny and charming with a brisk natural feel to it. Throughout the film, it never felt like it was glossing over things and went into subjects like the divorce between Stephen and Jane. But not making either one of them the bad guy since any relationship like that is bound to become strained. Both of them were looking for new things but waiting for someone to make the first move. It didn't have the controversy that John Nash had with A Beautiful Mind that white washed practically chunks of his life that many people don't know about. The script utilized Stephens sense of humor to great effect, allowing it to come out of nowhere when you least expect it. While he was an atheist and went into his beliefs, it never looked down on other religions or made it seem like other points of view are wrong; unless when it comes to black holes of course.\nMy knowledge of Stephen Hawking usually pertained to his appearances on The Simpsons and never really got into the brilliance of the man. Watching The Theory Of Everything makes me wish that I have read about him much earlier since it's so extraordinary. It's not every day that there is an iconic and revered figure who is not only alive and well today but is still hard at work at the questions that puzzle us all. Seeing him brought to life on the screen so honestly by Eddie Redmayne was nothing short of amazing and is truly one of the great recent performances out today. When it comes to a portrayal of such a brilliant man, nothing should be left on the table. With such a short shelf life to live from the start, Stephen Hawking spent his life studying what he had the least of, time. By doing that he changed the world how we view the universe and shows that one can do anything if they have love. Four and a half black holes out of five.",

            "content": "With a heartwarming score, an outstanding performance from Eddie Redmayne and a heartbreaking one from Felicity Jones, The Theory of Everything succeeds in telling a rather unconventional story  about love in its purest expression; the love between two people who are not meant to be together, the love between husband and wife, family love, the love an individual has for his/her profession, the love embedded in responsibilty, care and forgiveness. Overall, the love that inherently exists in everyone of us.",

            "content": "The Theory of Everything suffers from two major issues: It often becomes more melodramatic than it needs to be, and it is perhaps a little too much love story and too little biopic.\n\nThat being said, the movie is still a very honest portrayal of Stephen Hawking. It follows his life from when he first meets his now ex-wife jane, who is portrayed brilliantly by Felicity Jones, and ends when they part their ways. While the outline could easily makes this movie sound like it focuses entirely on love, which is true at times, there are still plenty of relevant points in Hawking's life that this film definitely does not gloss over.\n\nThe primary place where this movie truly shines is in the perfromances by and chemistry between the two lead actors. Both Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones deliver absolutely stellar performances as the couple who are struggling in their tough situation. The film never romanticises or ignores that hardship that the two lead people go through. \n\nAs mentioned before, the movie is partially a love story and partially a biopic. While the movie certainly tells us the stories and events of hawking's life that are relevant, some of the scientific stuff is only touched lightly. But there is only that much science that you can shove into a biopic about a certain person. had it been a documentary, it would have been a different story. The other part that the movie does right is the more emotional moments between the two lead actors. Especially Jones often delivers moments that feel genuinely emotional, and her feeling of responsibility, hardship and test of patience are easily conveyed to the audience thanks in much part to her excellent portrayal. But the love-related themes are more present in the first half of the film, and gets a little more loose towards the second half. But the romance is also felt through the cinematography and direction at certain scenes, which is excellently exectued, while not falling entirely into the trap of becoming a tiresome, clich\u00e9 scenario.\n\nThe Theory of Everything is a biopic of a person whose life story is definitely worthy of such. As his situation was undeniably hard and demanding, it is only relevant to show a lot of the emotional moments between the two lead characters, but as a biopic, the love-related themes may feel a bit too heavy-handed, as the movie misses a bit of its potential to really explore the ideas behind Hawking's theory. The story is still a very satisfying one, however, and shows largely what was the biggest moments that needed to be told through a cinematic release. It is good, but not great.",

            "content": "I know it is based on a true story so it cannot be accused of copying, but this film is trying really hard to be 'A Beautiful Mind', with the consensus pointing out that it is part biopic and part love story, it even has the part where the lead cannot pick a topic for his project but it quickly skims over that. And that is the main problem with the film; it zips through Hawking's life so fast that it feels like a highlight reel of Hawking's life and glosses over many things as opposed to a true story. Obviously they can't go through every single detail in a film and it isn't uncommon for a biopic to change a few things because of film limitations but there still needs to be a solid story. If Eddie Redmayne wasn't here to give his performance, there would not be much reason to watch it, which hurts to say given the absolutely fascinating person at its story's centre. \n\nThe film just feels like harmless fluff, it does what no biopic should ever do and presents Hawking as this perfect person who did little wrong and, in turn, seems to demonise Jane for some reason. We see Hawking smile to the camera, even though there clearly wouldn't have been video cameras back then, so the whole idea seems rather odd, and the look of the wedding seemed rather manipulative. There was one part where the nurse says how great of a person Hawking is and that seemed even more like a, hey-look-how-great-I-am, moment. They took some stuff out that would have made Hawking look like a 'narcissistic jerk' but at least that would have presented some actual conflict and something to engage, it would have been believable that he didn't want any help because that's how some people act sometimes, they want to do things by themselves, no matter the odds. There is some intrigue introduced about who the third child belonged to but that really doesn't go anywhere at all, it's subtlety implied in the camping scene when Jane goes over to Jonathan's tent in the middle of the night and calls for him that something is going on but it never goes anywhere other than that. Hawking was doing something similar with one of the nurses he was involved with but besides being subtlety put in, it doesn't go anywhere, either. It just seems cruel to do that to Jane anyway, she did all that for him and then just decided to be with someone else, sure, love is a weird thing, whatever, but still.\n\nThe biggest negative of this film is that it makes Hawking's ALS disease, which is an absolutely horrible thing, seem like a mild inconvenience. Besides some truly hard to watch scenes like when he is trying to eat his food, or when he falls over or when he starts to cry on the stairs, the film never showcased how hard it truly would be to live with this disease on a day to day basis, which showing us would have made it have more of an impact. You take one look at the real Steven Hawking and you feel so much for him, as soon as this film finished I went on about my day and it was like I hadn't even watched it. We see one scene where the children are playing on him with him saying 'exterminate' where he gives the defeated smile of someone who just wants to give up with Jane clearly struggling to work but these scenes are about 30 seconds. I also found it a bit unbelievable that when he is first diagnosed with it, he is allowed to be in a bath by himself, what if something happened? It didn't seem like someone was outside being on the ready just in case anything happened. As well as earlier on before this scene when the doctor just tells him what it is and then walks off and leaves him alone, these might seem insignificant but it adds up after time. The film never strikes a balance between the love and the science and you don't really fully understand what it was that made Hawking famous in the first place. The film didn't have enough to relate to its own title, and from the film itself, I didn't really get a good understanding of how his chair worked, either. I already knew about both prior to the film but that isn't the point; for a film about someone's life leaving out key details like this, the film has failed in educating and explaining to its audience.\n\nThe film also has its clich\u00e9s, of course he flips his chair when he goes back into his room after the croquet game, and I knew there would be a part in here when he flips something. You would expect Hawking to move as much as he could while he still could; I know he was obviously depressed, but still. In the final part of the film when his tutor goes up to say something, of course he says colleague and then friend, but, hey, it was great to see David Thewlis in this. There was a part where Hawking says he didn't dance but then offers to dance a little later in the scene and I did expect her to say, 'I thought the great Steven Hawking didn't dance?' I also expected a part where she makes a light joke for all the 'geek' talk and they didn't fall in the water when they are spinning around. I also thought there was a point where his friend was stealing his idea but he was just explaining it. \n\nThere was one part that didn't make sense just from a nitpicky standpoint. Jane calls Steven at one point, his friend is in the room, he leaves and goes to answer the phone and he hangs up.  Jane then goes to look for Steven and the friend asks her to sit down and have a talk about the news about Steven. Why would he propose to say that to her? It isn't like he knows that Steven put down the phone on her, because presumably he expected Steven to tell her over the phone what the matter was and the scenes were right next to each other, so it isn't like there was much progression of time. \n\nFor a film that speeds through his life, I'm surprised by the lack of a cohesive timeline; let's just pretend for a moment that someone watching this film doesn't know who Hawking is. One moment one of his children is just a baby and in the next scene they are at least 3-4 years old; besides that being a bad timeline anyway, someone who isn't in the know won't understand what just happened. They say in a scene later on that he surpassed the 2 year life expectancy but that is quite near the end. \n\nOn the plus side though, the acting was certainly good, there is a fine line Redmayne had to tread with this role but he is so natural with the gradual progression of the decaying of his body, with his movements and especially his speech that you can't help but pay attention. He looks the part more and more as the film goes on to the point at the end where you sometimes need to do a double take; it is quite scary how similar they look. Hawking even said himself that he saw himself up there on the screen at some point. I did wonder if they were going to put him in there at some point right at the end or something. Some thought 'The Norbit curse' would affect his chances of winning with 'Jupiter Ascending' (same with Julianne Moore for 'Seventh Son') but clearly not. Whether or not you think he deserved the Oscar, given that he didn't have to do all that much nearing the end, his final speech was certainly heart-warming. I find it tragically fitting that Felicity Jones' only award for her performance and that was the, 'Invisible Woman' award, despite the fact that she, herself, was mostly ignored in the hype for this film, it's fitting of the unsung heroes, which is usually the wife, which is probably why she won that. She also reminded me of the girl from the 'Orphan' poster at one point when Steven went for his speech in the lecture room, just because of what she was wearing. The film had its funny moments, especially with the bus schedule bit and the film looks lovely, the UV part especially and generally has that clear look that an English film would, although the scene in the opening credits was weird. \n\nIt was hardly a horrible film; it just wasn't all that memorable, like it should have been and is perfectly happy being a by the numbers kind of film. It means well, but sometimes that isn't enough. The award that this film won should have been the award Crowe won for 'A Beautiful Mind' but I have already explained that in livid, and vivid, detail in my review of that film, and I digress. The film had a good ending with the inspirational speech and the nice added part of everything rewinding, even though that odd fantasy sequence of him getting up and getting that pen was weird and the fact that Jane wasn't at the speech as weird, she has her reasons, but even so, with something that big, you'd expect her to go. The credits reminded me of 'Interstellar' a film that was horribly ignored in the Oscars as well in general in the award in general. I feel bad saying negative things about this subject but all of this is just about the film around them. The film was good for its first half and sped by unbelievably quickly but the second half really, really, drags this down. He is famous for his, 'A Brief History of Time', and that is exactly what this film feels like.",

You get more detail into his life and background. I think they were unfortunately doomed for divorce despite loving one another very much. I think Steven was a bit stubborn and naive in not getting more help sooner. So instead she wound up picking the handsome help and it also contributed to his pneumonia and thus coma. She has an affair and Then of course Stephen falls in love with his help. It's so hard to have a marriage with a disabled person and this film explains that. I liked how it touched on his theories and showed him overcoming als with humor and intelligence. In any case I kind of wanted to hear more about his theories but oh well this film had a lot to cover. Great acting btw. I hope sometime in my life a cure will be found or better treatment for als.",

            "content": "A friend of mine shared her views about biopics and the acting challenge that it requires.    In the last 10 years, there have been 6 biopic Best Actors award winners and 4 non-biopic.  The last six years it has been alternating between biopics and not.   Last year was NOT with Matthew Matthew McConaughey.  The year before was Yes for Lincoln.   Then The Artist (No), Kings's Speech (Yes), Crazy Heart (No), Milk (yes) and Last King of Scotland (Yes).   If the pattern continues, and it will, this year we have a biopic winner.   But history aside, what about the movie?\nI had heard mixed reviews about the film.   All the nominations quite frankly surprised me.    The two key performances with Redmayne and the Wife (Felicity Jones) are solid.   This is a story of remarkable resilience for a man who was given a death sentence (\"two years to live\") early on in his life.    We see his struggles and the brilliance of his mind.   Much like Daniel Day Lewis with Christie Brown in My Left Foot, you have a physical transformation of the man as he succumbs to the disease.    His body folds away underneath him and settles uneasily into a wheelchair ultimately.   There is a scene of tremendous struggle where he tries to get up a flight of stairs to his bedroom with his young toddler son watching.   Another after he loses the power of speech.   Still, he has the love and support from his Wife.  She is good as well.  Although for the older scenes as she ages, she is just a little too young looking still.   I was awaiting her Jennifer Connolly A Beautiful Mind moment where she explodes from frustration in dealing with her everyday life, but she doesn't.   Maybe that is a strength in the performance, but somehow I think that more range can be shown.  Or perhaps it comes from the fact that this movie is based upon Jane's own book of living with Stephen.   It reminds me of The Affair (Season 1 finished by me earlier in the year  - where perspective plays a huge roll and the same scene is shown to different eyes and lens).   Maybe that is HER interpretation of events with him.   Redmayne has to show range through his face, and body language as his character loses speech fairly early on.    I did find it predictable as a story, and I cannot think of this as the Best Picture.    I like Imitation Game and Birdman more than this -unfairly comparing completely different films.    But back to my friend's point, Professor Hawking is still alive.  There is much footage about his life and his history.   In many ways Redmayne is replaying old home movies.    To that end, I am still backing Cumberbatch as a better performance and gets my vote for Best Actor.  And although Alan Turning was a biopic as well, there you don'y have the celebrity attached to his name nor all the home movies and interviews.  But to me, there is more to fill in (and act) for a character who was not as well known.",

That's why he's a genius and deserves to be protected and cared for by the world, while the rest of us just muddle along without genius or paralyzing diseases.

I didn't think so before the movie, now that I've seen it, every vote from every person should be Eddie Redmayne.  He is an outstanding actor and this performance is so damn good it actually made the real life Stephen Hawking cry and say that at times it looked as if he was actually watching himself on camera.  Eddie Redmayne, if he continues down this path, is the next Daniel Day Lewis.  With that out of the way, not my favorite movie.  It's a good movie, if you like romance flicks and there are some really good parts to the film, it's just not my cup of tea. My wife liked it and Redmayne's performance was outstanding.  See it for his performance alone and if you enjoy romance movies it's probably even better.",

            "content": "Review:\nI quite enjoyed this emotional drama about Stephen Hawking and his rise to fame whilst suffering with a rare slow-progressing form of\u00c2\u00a0amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\u00c2\u00a0(ALS), also known as\u00c2\u00a0motor neurone disease\u00c2\u00a0or Lou Gehrig's disease, that has gradually paralysed him over the decades. The movie also concentrates on his relationship between him and his wife, Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) and it shows how she struggled to care for Hawking whilst bringing up there three children and studying for a PHD in medieval Spanish Poetry, whatever that is. Hawking also produced a best selling book called A Brief History Of Time which has sold more than 10 million copies and at 72 years of age, after getting told that he only had 2 years to live, he still continues to seek the theory of everything. This is truly a remarkable story about a man who, against all odds, is a scientific genius. It really does prove that you can achieve your dreams, no matter what obstacles come in your way. The performance from Eddie Redmayne is unbelievable and it must have been hard to perform because Hawking was on set while he was making the film. Felicity Jones also put in a great performance and the director told his story extremely well. Before I had seen this film, I never knew anything about his life so it was good to see him as an ordinary intelligent student before he came down with the terrible disease. The gradual decline in his abilities to do things, was sad to watch, but he still had his sense of humour and the ability to achieve his dreams. The love story was quite sad but they are still close friends and they have 3 grandchildren so it wasn't a sad ending. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and Eddie Redmayne really did deserve the many awards that he received for this role. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nLike many others that have seen this movie, I really didn't know that Stephen Hawking was English. Maybe that's because his computer voice is American! I didn't understand why he turned down his knighthood from the Queen but I'm sure he had his personal reasons to do so. I couldn't help feeling that his wife was being a little bit of a bitch throughout the movie and she didn't show that much sympathy for Hawkings situation after a while. I'm glad that Hawking finally let her go so they both could find true happyness in there life's, because it made them closer as friends. Anyway, I have seen Hawking in a few TV series and he has made a couple of special appearance in a few programs and he still hasn't lost his sense of humour. That's what makes this a truly remarkable story and I couldn't help feeling emotional through it. This has boosted Eddie Redmayne straight into the limelight after starring in movies like Les Miserables and My Week With Marilyn. His next film starring Channing Tatum called Jupiter Ascending, has blockbuster written all over it so there no turning back for this 33 year old actor.\n\nBudget: $15million\nWorldwide Gross: $121.2million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their biopics about the remarkable life of Stephen Hawking and his rocky relationship with his wife. 7/10",

It's the uninspired script that makes The Theory of Everything feel like a totally empty affair. Anthony McCarten's screenplay simply tries to cover too much ground and thus loses sight entirely of what three-dimensional characters look like. Again, the actors are definitely up for it and both Redmayne and Felicity Jones are terrific, they just don't have a lot to work with. Though the film plays Stephen and Jane Hawking's romance as something as epic as the universe, it never feels that way. I never felt the gravity of their love because the film is too busy racking up Cinema Sins. Fortunately there are some beautiful moments where the cast and crew overcome the writing, but it's just not enough. The story just needs to be smaller and needs focus (a la, say, the Diving Bell and the Butterfly) but it's clear that whoever was throwing money at this film would rather have Oscar bait than what could have been an intense portrait of a romance despite some pretty terrible circumstances.",

            "content": "For me, this movie was tough to get through emotionally. It made me feel kind of evil and worthless. A lot of the themes in this flick, I have in my writing, but this is hopeful while mine tends to be a lot more nihilistic and negative. I also have some things in common with Hawking (thankfully not any physical problems) but my collegiate years were not marked by such buoying emotional or intellectual development. Therefore I always have to view this narrative with a touch of cynicism. I suppose the lesson is that while Hawking was atrociously unfortunate to have his disease, he was also blessed to find true love and academic inspiration and support.\n\nThere are a lot of small holes you can poke in it - the depiction of university is not very realistic, why would Jane be attracted to Stephen, not much development in the beginning of their relationship, common biopic foibles, unending will-she-cheat sexual tension in the second act, etc. But really, none of those very minor things matter much - this movie is all about theme. There's a kind of similar movie from 2001 - A Beautiful Mind. Every once in a while, the dialogue is a metaphor. In this movie, pretty much every line is a metaphor for the emotions of the characters. \n\nRedmayne's performance was very affecting, like Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game, before he entered the ASL phases of the script. Once it started coming on, he was very effective still, though his mannerisms reminded me very much of a friend I have with cerebral palsy. Don't know how similar the symptoms are between the two afflictions. After the disease hits him fully, I didn't really buy it as much, particularly because of the voice. Jones was solid as Jane, and the supporting cast did well too. I think in general, both the film and the acting was regarded in the proper light. Maybe I wouldn't have selected Redmayne to actually win the Oscar, but his performance is certainly deserving of a nomination. Meanwhile, the film as a whole is rightly an also-ran for Best Picture.",

            "content": "An inspirational, if conventionally realized, biopic that is elevated by great performances from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones.\n\nAs mentioned in the review of The Imitation Game, The Theory of Everything also suffers from many of the pitfalls of the modern biopic. Efforts to keep pacing flowing while hitting the important points in the subject's life, for instance, are handled in as contrived a manner as I've come to expect from these types of films. Without even being too familiar with Stephen Hawking, it's easy to spot when notable events in his life are banged together for convenience's sake. Perhaps this is a necessary evil, but unfortunately it takes me out of the film. \n\nA more significant failing (in my opinion) on the part of the script would be in the oft-repeated biopic contrivance of having one's subject almost inexplicably fall in love with their lover at first glance and within the first ten minutes. I understand that time is valuable and that there's a lot of Hawking history to get to, but this takes me out of the film and leaves me doubting the veracity of the relationship. Thankfully, the two lead actors' chemistry helps the relationship along, but Come on! Is every notable figure in human history a victim of love at first sight? I'm serious. Watch these movies. \n\nThe film is competently directed. The cinematography is actually quite stunning at times. Uses of color and imaginative angles keep the eyes quite busy. Sometimes, however, this imagery is so picturesque that one wonders if the DP is trying to inject a visual style simply to stave off audience boredom. This is a simple story. The photography doesn't need to draw attention to itself, which it most certainly does on occasion.\n\nAs noted above, the real meat of the movie is in the portrayals of its main couple. Once their relationship has been established, and Hawking has finally proven himself to be the genius that he is, the film becomes far more enjoyable and the actors really start to shine. Honestly, everything is fairly contrived and cliched until Hawking loses his ability to walk. It's here that the \"special-ness\" of this acting duo comes into play. Redmayne as Hawking deftly engages in a very physical performance that seemingly limits his emotive ability; and Jones as his wife juggles her undying devotion to him with feelings of resentment about her husband's handicap, and her inadequacy as a caregiver. Neither actor resorts to melodrama. Both performances utilize the appropriate level of restraint while showing unquestionably deep and relatable emotion.\n\nRedmayne isn't the first actor to take on this type of role (Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot comes to mind). I wouldn't go as far as to say his performance is a revelation of some sort. The academy, however, really likes it when actors physically transform as the actor does here. His Oscar win, therefore, shouldn't be too surprising, and I wouldn't even say it's undeserved. But if I were voting in the 2014 Oscars, there are many other examples of good work that are \"fresh\" and \"brave\" (see Keaton or Gyllenhaal) that I would be more apt to heap props upon. Just a little, unnecessary rant for good measure.",

This should really be about an hour 40 minutes or so, and it's nearly a half hour more than that.  This causes the film to seriously drag at some points, especially when nothing of substance is really happening there.  And also, for a film about Stephen Hawking, it really doesn't focus that much on his theories of the universe.  Yes, there's like one or two of them here of some import, but for the most part, the film focuses on Hawking and his girlfriend/wife, which is honestly incredibly boring compared to what I signed up to see.  I thought I was going to see some mind-bending theories put into practice, all while being told the story of Hawking's life.  And while this is true to some extent, I really don't care about his relationship with his ex-wife at all.  So while it's a good film, it's also pretty damn deceptive on what it's advertising..",

ABC Radio's review is right in that as much as this appears to be a story about Stephen Hawking, it's actually a story about Jane more than anything and it takes on the view of the 'carer' in this relationship really well.\n\nEddie Redmayne's portrayal of Hawking is wonderful as his battle with motor neuron disease takes hold and pushes his relationship with Jane to the brink.\n\nIt's a bit of an emotional story as told from Jane's perspective but I also thought it was a nice look at the life of a great man who defied the outlook provided him by his doctors when diagnosed and brought three children into the world with the help of his loving wife.\n\nI think it's worth a look :)",

Also, he has many students who help him with the mathematics in his theory, these students were non existent in this film.  ALSO, sorry, gotta say that there was ZERO chemistry between Hawking and Jane when they first met.  What did she see in him?  All he did was smile...he cracked more jokes in a wheel chair without a voice than when he could walk!  What caught her eye when she first saw him?   He behaved and was dressed just like all the rest.  Dude didn't even dance after he TOLD HER that she was going to the dance with him.  WTH!  They need to explain their \"love story\" more compellingly considering that is this movie's foundation...Obviously this isn't my type of movie?  UGH :(",

As in real life, Eddie Redmayne portrays Hawking with a radiant smile, brilliant wit, and an unrelenting penchant to be independent even whilst gravely ill. Meanwhile Felicity Jones (Jane Wilde) is flawless as she portrays a woman caring for Hawking as long as she could but eventually was unable to sacrifice any more of herself after roughly 30 years of marriage. This would surely resonate with anyone caring for a loved one over a long period of time. In fact, Hawking was expected to die within 2 years of his diagnosis but has been able to survive into the present day. \n. \nWhile supreme genius seemed to come easily to Hawking, it was his sheer existence which is portrayed as most trying. Throughout the film's course, it seems that little poetic license is taken, giving a rather realistic view of the joy the Hawkings experienced early on, followed by a wandering heart in his wife, subsequent divorce between the two, and each remarrying another. Hawking, as well, was no stranger to wants outside of marriage. \n.\nHawking is defined cinematically as having no boundaries, not believing in God, and engaged in a life long search for something whose common denominator is time; the one thing that Hawking most likely has the least of even as he defies the odds time and again. \n.\nSome of my favorite lines from this work include Jane saying \"I have loved you. I did my best\" and Hawking with \"Where there is life there is hope ... \" It is from this belief that I think he has been fueled for so many years. \n.\nThis film is engaging, beautifully filmed, heart wrenching and yet uplifting as its touch upon us seems universal. A man, seemingly limited more than most, manages to continue to accomplish more than most who are considered able-bodied.

What an amazing story of perseverance and unabated intellectualism. \n\nGreat casting and wonderful direction. The true story of Dr. Stephen Hawking and the monumental trials he and his wife Jane Wilde Hawking who wrote the book \"To Infinity and Beyond\" (not buzz lightyears version) had to triumph over. Sometimes it was painful to watch Jane's spirit get crushed.\n\nThe theorum's described in this movie are pretty awesome to be thought of and mathematically defined by one person who attended the world renowned Cambridge University in England. \n\nThe Love story wraps around the genius who is Stephen Hawking. A modern day Einstein. The fact that he was given 2 yrs to live in 1965 and is still here today is a miracle. He has all the life you could imagine for someone as severely handicapped as he is. His computer voice is solely identified with him. \n\nI wonder sometimes why the truly great Physicists of our time like Hawking and John Forbes Nash (A Beautiful Mind) have such monumental challenges in their lives, yet share so much with the scientific community towards mathematical relativity. And attempts to answer space and time conundrums.\n\nThere were certainly predictable parts in the movie. I guess a lot of life is predictable. The cinematography and editing esp the backwards recap of the movie  at end of movie was done with great brilliance. It takes us back in time before Professor Hawking's disease sets in and shows two young lovers trying to solve their own mysteries of time. Truly a great metaphor for a great movie. I look forward to more of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in the future.  (I liked Jupiter Ascending with Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, and Redmayne)\n\nA side note, I still think that The Imitation Game was a better movie. Both British, both had their leading actors nominated, and their movies for Oscars. Bottom line both were outstanding movies about truly gifted individuals with major challenges to overcome and help lives of those who may never know how.",

Probably the fact that Eddie Redmayne was nominated for an Oscar, prompted me to see if he was a worthy contender for the coveted golden statuette. And the only thing I can say is that he totally deserved to win with his magnificent performance. I love to watch a biographical movie now and then. The only drawback is that I'm always a little bit disappointed about the subject covered in such a biopic and that the emphasis lies on something I wasn't looking for. In \"jOBS\" I missed the philosophy this visionary had about the Apple phenomenon and the development of the applied interface (which is currently perfectly normal for everybody). The clash between Jobs and Gates was cited as a fait divers, whereas that interested me. Also in \"The Theory of Everything\" the focus was on other facets of Hawking's life. What applies to both these films is the fact that the protagonists physically look an awful lot like the corresponding character. It's creepy to see how they both manage not only to capture the emotional part, but also to match the characteristics and physical traits of these famous people. \"The Imitation Game\" is obviously also a biopic which, however, had a more adventurous twist rather than being a purely biographical sketch.\n\nYou must admit that the performance of Eddie Redmayne is simply magnificent. Both excerpts from the college years, where he's still healthy,lively and the way he finishes his studies in a nonchalant manner, as the portrayal of a genius who's struck by a muscle disease, are brilliant and striking. A series of events wonderfully visualized using a variety of intense colors at certain times. The university professor who looks surprised at the solutions scribbled on the back of a timetable (10 math assignments which are almost impossible to solve I suppose, of which Stephen could ONLY solve 9). A family dinner Jane was invited to and where you already can get a sense of the intellectual atmosphere. The contradictions between Jane and Stephen when it's about religion. Hawking who excludes everyone after hearing the terrible verdict and the determination of Jane. These fragments stayed with me and made it a fascinating film. \n \nWhich theories the brilliant mind of Hawking produced in that cripple body, isn't explained in detail. Here and there black holes, big bangs and the concept of time is mentioned, but eventually I was wondering what exactly Stephen Hawking's ultimate contribution was to mankind. What Jobs achieved you can discover in any computer shop. And from Turing we know that he has broken the Enigma code. But what abstract evidence Hawking delivered, wasn't clear to me. From one moment to the other he's a celebrity and a much sought-after guest speaker. That a woman who lives together with a paralyzed person can't really enjoy a thrilling,romantic life and that she's actually the person who's responsible for all practical matters in a marriage, is of course obvious. And that's the central theme of this biopic: a loving relationship slowly falling apart because of a fatal disease, the awareness of limitations and the danger to seek solace in someone else's arms. So it's mainly a biopic about the wife of Hawking, instead of about Hawking himself. An insight into the life of mathematical genius, who could explain the mystery of the origin of the universe by using his phenomenal intellectual brain, is thus transformed into an ordinary dime novel about an unhappy woman who feels abandoned by her ever loving husband. And that's something I wasn't waiting for.\n\nDespite the romantic approach, I think it's an admirable film. The situation Hawking is facing during his life, ensured that other qualities came up : humor and willpower. These two qualities are subtly incorporated into this film. Even the choice Hawking made at an older age about his marriage, took me by surprise (actually it wasn't much I knew about the life of Hawking). Once again this proves that he sees himself as a normal functioning man. \"The Theory of Everything\" is a beautiful film that actually moved me and should serve as an example to show what one can achieve with the right attitude and a big portion of perseverance.\n\nMore reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",

It makes you want to put all the filming locations (especially Horsted Keynes station) on your travel wishlist. Then there's Redmayne's performance... well I don't really have the words for that, apart from 'utterly impressive'. Interesting fact is that, whilst it's presented as a biopic about him, it's actually about her, based on her book. Which brings me to the few things I don't like about this movie. I understand why the existence of a god would come up in this film, but I don't like the fact that when Stephen stops adamantly saying there isn't one is presented as a triumph, as if that is the accepted and only right way of thinking. Also, even though I like its polished look, I think the content is a bit too polished, as the struggles will have been huge but are presented as in an almost \"oh well...\" fashion that could have been presented more poignantly.

Stephen Hawking is a man that has defied the odds and surpassed not only scientific and medical boundaries but personal as well. Diagnosed at the age of 21 with a type of motor neuron disease called ALS, Hawking with the vital help of Jane, decides to finish his PHD thesis on time at Cambridge University. The film is based on Jane Hawking's memoir Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen. BRAVO to the cast and crew of this exceptional and epic motion picture that will have you crying and cheering for this remarkable couple. Nominated for five academy awards and it won for best actor. I was surprised to see that Professor Hawking turned down the offer of a knighthood over 10 years ago on principle citing the UK government's mismanagement of science funding. He has three children with Jane and they divorced some time ago. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED in Blu-ray, its a winner!!!",

The movie takes a deeper look into the life and family of Stephen Hawking, a theoretical physicist which was diagnosed with ALS while still in college.  What impressed me the most about the story is that there were so many times in his life where it would have been so much easier to give in, to quit.   Even when he contemplated his own suicide, he somehow found the perseverance to keep going.    The movie also does a wonderful job exploring the challenges of being in a relationship with someone that may be physically challenged.  How the caring for someone who needs more attention can change the dynamics of the relationships.  A very touching story that doesn't sugar coat the challenges they went through as a couple.\n\nI had a block on seeing this movie, but I am glad that I pulled the trigger.

You just put your feet in Stephen's shoes and you live with him his first love, receiving his Ph. D., and getting the bright idea of black holes. I think that it is engrossing to learn the way in which a scientist makes a discovery, better than be taught only his theories.\n\nHowever, as soon as Jonathan appears in the story, the movie get unfortunately very flat. The scenario only focus on the emotional on the emotional life of Stephen, and the brilliant picture becomes a dull love-story.

Therefore 'The Theory of Everything' looks more into the personal lives of both Jane and Stephen which has not been explored before and what makes this movie a must-see.\n\nAs far as Eddie Redmayne winning the Oscar for Best Actor, I couldn't have agreed more and yes, I have heard the critics talk about that he portrayed a disabled person which gave him the emotional vote but let me point out that you could not throw any actor out there and the performance would have been as good. The look itself as well as Redmayne's facial expressions were truly extraordinary in telling the entire story, not simply just about what he was going through but in also being so devoted to Jane that we see that Stephen eventually understands that Jane has done so much for him that he understands the budding relationship between Jane and Jonathan.",

The depiction of Hawking's physical deterioration thanks to Redmayne was well-worth the Oscar he won for it. By the end of the film, he's almost unrecognizable. Felicity Jones plays his loving wife, who also turns in a great performance. My problem with the film is understanding exactly what director James Marsh was aiming for: it focuses on their relationship while at the same time focusing on Hawking's revolutionary work. It was sad to see what actually happened to the love that began as an unbreakable force turn into something that lost it's spark. Hawking initially sets out to find an equation that allows him to reverse time so he could find the beginning. The final scene of the film mirrors that with his relationship with Jane. At first, I wasn't crazy about that scene, but I understand what they were going for: going in reverse to show us what Hawking's personal \"beginning of time\" was. The scene felt a bit sentimental, and perhaps a tad cliche, but it was cute. Maybe the ending of their relationship related to his final thesis: that time is boundless, and so are human beings. The performances and Hawking's final speech are more than enough to warrant a viewing here. I was definitely impressed.",

Each new act has Redmayne take on an entirely new performance, as Hawking's disease worsens.  Its truly a performance that has deserved the praise and awards, including his Oscar.  Felicity Jones should not be forgotten as well, with her performance being an emotional powerhouse that really hits the viewer.  We sympathize with her as she is put in a tough situation along with her husband, and it really helps us see how this disease effects not only the victim but the ones closest to him or her.  Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds of all time, and seeing his journey was an honor.  While the film did feel like Oscar bait at times and it having dozens of similarities with Ron Howards A Beautiful Mind, it never strayed from the story it wanted to tell and gave us two brilliant performances in the process.

Eddie Redmayne deserved that Oscar for all the charm he brought to this turd of a movie. He is the only reason I sat through the whole thing. He has a spark that makes it hard to tear your eyes away from him. I wish I could say the same for his costar, who played a character advertised as Stephen Hawking's \"tireless first wife.\" She had exactly one scene where she told another character how strong she was, and the rest were spent crying and self pitying. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point: was this movie shot to simulate the uncontrollable empathetic sobs of the audience? Because I wasn't crying and I was wearing my glasses, but nearly the entire movie was poorly lit, colored in similar pastels, and slightly... blurred. Clearly I am not of the artistic caliber required to understand the art direction. It looked to me like they dropped their lens in Vaseline and forgot to wipe it off all the way.\n\nFinally, I'll just skip ahead to the worst thing about this chore of a movie: the plot. It can be summarized in one small sentence, which would have made a much more truthful tagline for the posters. \"Watch this marriage fail.\" We don't really get the nice parts of their relationship, the loving (or even liking) moments they theoretically shared as a couple who loved each other. All we got was her crying as she failed to take care of her husband and multiplying gaggle of children. \n\nOh, and the children. I understand that I will likely be alone in hating this, but the message of the movie was the CHILDREN? How special. You hated each other for years but you made three people so it's all fine! \n\nAnd one more thing while I'm at it. This movie could not make up it's mind about whether it wanted to tout a religious message or not. It was like a shy missionary, knocking at your door ready to tell you all about Jesus and then scampering away as soon as you answer! It came across as weirdly preachy but without actually espousing any system of belief. \n\nIn summary, this is a weird Frankenstein's monster of a movie and I don't recommend it. But it was nominated for an Oscar so what do I know?",

And the passion of revolutionizing the scientific world is still present as well, it just isn't shown as much of a conflict as Stephen getting more and more consumed by his disease while his wife and other loved ones try to support him all the way through. Once I found that the biography this was based on was written by Jane Hawkings, I realized that this was more of the story of Stephen Hawing's life shown from his wife's perspective, their shared conflicts are at the main focus and they both get equal amount of screen time. However, it is still Stephen freaking Hawking, so I can still understand desire for more of his scientific aspect shown. As for the cast, Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne both hit it out of the water with this one. You really feel for these characters and understand all of the layer Eddie in particular had to perform since as the scenes go by he has to find a new way to communicate to the other actors in a respectful but realistic manner. Fortunately the religion vs. science aspect is kept to minimal banter, and the personal conflicts in the last act are for the most part handled quite well. Overall while this may not be the scientific Stephen Hawking biopic that you were hoping for, it still provides enough personal conflict and human connections with two spectacular leads to make it worth a watch.",

So we end up with a few odd scenes (amongst all the love-stuff) where Stephen speaks to a room full of people about his theories and then everyone stands up and starts applauding him and how brilliant he is. But, for the unintelligent people in the cinema like me who don't have a clue what he's on about because the movie doesn't provide a single iota of the background work or thoughts then went into these theories, you're left feeling like he may as well have said 'Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah'. And everyone still would have stood up and cheered, because the Movie Director needed a few uplifting moments.\rAnd, boy, does it need those uplifting scenes in amongst the grey, depressing story of a man diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease. Yes, Stephen Hawking has accomplished a great deal in his lifetime so far but so much of this movie focuses on the struggles of his wife, Jane, to cope with looking after him as his condition worsens that the film ends up feeling more informative than entertaining (and what do we go to the cinema/movie theatre for if not to be entertained?)\rMy other issue with the movie is that, especially when you find out that it's based on a book by Jane, it feels distinctly like it glosses over the foibles of his then-wife and yet highlights the flaws of others. Her being unfaithful garners five seconds of screen time but when Elaine (Maxine Peake) shows up later in the movie to help Stephen, she's portrayed as something like a naughty nurse from a 'Carry On' movie who tries (in several scenes) to undermine Jane. It's these things that - especially when considering whose book this movie is based upon - make it feel like it may be a slightly biased version of events.\rHowever, there are positives about the movie that need to be highlighted. There are some greatly funny moments and these are often provided by Stephen's university room-mate Brian (played wonderfully by Harry Lloyd). He brings some much-needed laughter to a sometimes otherwise dreary movie.\rOf course, the main highlight of the film is the performance of Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking. As I write this review, he is Oscar-nominated for it and I would be shocked if he does not win the award. Without such an outstanding job by the leading actor, I feel that 'The Theory of Everything' would have fallen completely flat but his outstanding performance is absolutely spot on.\rOverall, if you're interested in Stephen Hawking then - by all means - you may find 'The Theory of Everything' worth watching. Otherwise, there's not much to be gained here other than seeing a tired, generic love story in a different setting.",

Eddie Redmayne is also very good, especially with the physicality the role demands, but surprisingly his role seems somewhat underwritten. The screenplay pays scant attention to his professional achievements concentrating instead on his disability and the challenges this posed to the couple\u2019s marriage. Anyone not knowing anything about Stephen Hawking going in to this film would be hard pressed to understand the reverence in which he is held, the tragedy of his physical battles notwithstanding. Ironically, criticism levelled at 'The Imitation Game' and the lack of personal details about Alan Turing's personal life would be more pertinently aimed here at Hawking's professional one.  Montages are adopted to delineate time lines to mixed success, but probably the biggest indication of the film\u2019s failure is due to the fact that one is more interested in the love story between Jane and Jonathan than in the one between Jane and Stephen.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe Theory of Everything is an intelligent biographical dramady about the life of Stephen and Jane Hawking depicting the struggles and accomplishments they faced together. Everything from the production design and costumes to the cinematography and editing helped accent the emotional struggle of the characters. With Oscar-worthy performances by Redmayne and Jones and brilliant direction by James Marsh the audience is taken on a charmingly humorous and emotional ride through the life of the Hawkings.\r I was a bit disappointed with the story in two aspects. Firstly, I believe that the film was subjected to some restricted narrative construction to appease the still living subjects of the film. In biographies of deceased people the filmmakers tend to push the boundaries and add a bit of controversy or increased tension. If Marsh was going for a more biographical, documentary film than a biographical drama, then he certainly succeeded. However, I feel even with the restrictions that this film delivered. Secondly, I was not pleased with the lack of science in the film. This film is about Stephen Hawking, one of the greatest minds to ever walk this Earth, and yet we are more interested in his personal life? Yes the film is a recount of Stephen's life through the eyes of his ex-wife Jane, but being the only film about Stephen Hawking they could have at least explained some of the interesting theories and research he worked on throughout his life.\r Regardless this film delivers a brilliantly charming biopic about a man whose dynamism was hidden by his overachieving mind. Although Stephen is the star of the film, the true star of the story is Jane whose strength and dedication to Stephen helped bring us The Theory of Everything. His mind changed our world, her love changed his.",

Some reviewers seem to feel cheated that they didn't get a good enough physics lesson from the film.

I'd read that the emphasis would be on Hawking's school life and his romance with his first wife. Unfortunately, that only comprises the first half of the film. The second half is entirely too slow. The sequences of Hawking struggling to pull himself up his staircase - looking at his son at the top of the stairs - mirrored many of the people in our theater struggling to get to the end of this film. Sure, Redmayne is awesome, but when he gets into his \"My Left Foot\" mode, that's no longer acting, in my opinion. I'd much rather award an actor for subtle, true moments - not pretending like he or she is physically disabled. Seems far too easy. Pandering. The movie simply needs editing.

It is also the story of self-sacrifice and dedication as told through the eyes of his wife of 25 years, Jane, who, together with Anthony McClaren, co authored the screenplay based on her book \"My Life With Stephen\". The film was directed by James Marsh and stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. One must approach this film as both a factual summary of the trials and efforts of a genius confined to the prison of his voiceless and motionless body and, also, as an entertainment vehicle. For the former the film serves its purpose well and is made even more believable by Mr. Redmayne\u2019s remarkable likeness to Mr. Hawkng  and the performances given by both he and Ms. Jones.  As to the latter, the film is certainly not \"entertaining\" in the true sense of the word but represents one of those \"should see\" see films because of its biographical data and the efforts of its two stars. This is indeed a difficult film to rate for much depends on the needs and desires of the viewer and whether he or she considers watching Mr. Redmayne\u2019s character struggle with a catastrophic disability for over 2 hours worth the effort. My experience of the film may well have been affected by the fact that I saw a PBS documentary with the real life Hawkings a few days earlier. That being said, I give the film  a 7 rating because it basically is locked to the actual story of the subjects with little or no poetic license or interest creating insertions.. Remember, though, as with  \"My Left Foot\",also a fairly difficult film to watch, it did earn Danel Day Lewis an Oscar and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the same fate awaited Mr. Redmayne.",

What makes the movie more interesting is the way of approaching his life, not focused in one aspect, it shows the scientific part, the family part and the illness part. The first one is very impressive, starting by the epiphanies that he experiences, how he developed his theories and how he breaks with current knowledge. The family part gives us a more human image of this genius and his relationship with his wife Jane. And finally, the illness and how the couple deals with it is very well achieved. These last two are unknown for the viewer and James Marsh is not afraid to show the most dramatic episodes making it a heartbreaking story but always realistic. This whole thing goes hand by hand with a breathtaking performances of Eddie Redmayne, it is unbelievable what he has created and Felicity Jones is perfect in her role.

The film starts when he was a promising Cambridge student, where he meets the woman who became his wife (Felicity Jones, who's also wonderful). Even though he was diagnosed with ALS at age 21, they continued their relationship, as he went on to become the famous physicist. Throughout the dramatic challenges of their life, the screenplay manages to inject humor and hope. Redmayne transforms himself into an Oscar-worthy performance and the film tells Hawking's story with warmth and honor.",

These parts were Steven and Jane had their moments with their future partners felt so clich\u00e9 it was like watching a Disney movie because it was like they just gave up on trying to make a great final hour as opposed to the first hour which was great.\r Finally,  Felicity Jones who had such a great start and gave such a great performance, at first her character was shy and coming out and wanting to help Steven even though his condition was worsening, but then she meets a man who can play the piano  (Who comes off as very dis-likable, as does Steven's nurse) and 3 minutes of montage time and all that connection that we built up with that character was just ended, making the audience feel for her but dislike the character at the same time.\r This film was great seriously, it's just the final hour that becomes unbearable, there is not enough character development, and I don't see why these characters were given more screen time than Harry lloyd's character because I think if they used him instead of the two most annoying characters in this movie then the final hour would've been saved. I don't see why they didn't change the story a little.\r The last part I have a problem with is the ending, it's trying to do something phenomenal and great, and that would've worked and became truly emotional if they had not ruined the story after the first hour.\r I do recommend people to watch this though, it is a good movie for the first half",

It is, simply put, a fantastic, life-affirming film that is propelled forward by its story and its leading roles. In that order. And the rest of the film is pretty good too. But \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d isn\u2019t all about Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) and how incredible his story is. Instead the film is \u201cpart biopic, part love story\u201d with the latter telling us about the imperfect marriage between Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde (played by Felicity Jones).\rEddie Redmayne is fantastic as Stephen Hawking and what is best at how he portrays Hawking getting worse in regards to his Motor Neurone Disease (/ALS). Redmayne starts the film as a young Hawking and we can tell this guy is clever. But it is as the film goes on that Redmayne\u2019s performance gets better. Halfway through the film we are looking at a slouched Redmayne, slurring his words and occasionally smiling and by the end of the film we are looking at Redmayne playing Hawking as he is now. In testament to this the real-life Stephen Hawking commented, on seeing the film, that he felt he was sometimes looking back in time at himself. I\u2019m with him. His performance is again, incredible, as incredible as the story he has the privilege to tell. If I don\u2019t see him in the running for the Best Actor Oscar come February then I will be surprised.\rFelicity Jones performance as Jane Wilde is magnificent too. Although on the surface she doesn\u2019t seemingly require the various skills that Redmayne has to delve into, she again does the story and her real-life counterpart justice. Although she starts the film as a student, we come to see her having to raise 3 children as well as look after her husband and you feel that she really is going through all this. Again, the real-life Jane Wilde was impressed with Jones\u2019 performance. When I think about Best Actress potential this year, she should also be in the running for the appropriate Oscar.\rHarry Lloyd is brilliant as Stephen\u2019s university friend Brian too. Although Brian is a mere composite character, he is a brilliant one at that. His attitude is drawn from Jane\u2019s descriptions of \u201cStephen\u2019s fellow lodgers and research students\u201d at Cambridge: \u201cThey talked to him in his own intellectual terms, sometimes caustically sarcastic, sometimes crushingly critical, always humorous. In personal terms, however, they treated him with a gentle consideration which was almost loving.\u201d He could also be in for an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\rBut it is the story that really propels \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d forward and it provides for half the reason as to why the films leads are fantastic. The film itself is based on Jane Wilde\u2019s 2008 autobiography \u201cTravelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\u201d, a flattering account of their initial marriage and a significantly different, revised edition of the 1999 autobiography \u201cMusic to Move the Stars: My Life with Stephen\u201d, a less flattering account of their marriage, sparked when Hawking left Wilde for his nurse Elaine Mason in 1990. (It\u2019s worth noting they quietly divorced in 2006 following a 5 year period of rumours over whether Mason abused Hawking, apparently hitting him, throwing him around and even leaving him in the sun to burn for several hours.) The revised edition was sparked by her and Hawking managing to develop a good working relationship with Wilde.\rThe story of \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d, as I said earlier, is \u201cpart biopic, part love story\u201d. We learn in the film of how clever Hawking was and how he refused to let his disability stop him from being great, initially managing to overcome the 2 years he was given to live and ultimately managing to become a household name. But this isn\u2019t what \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d is really about. Although the film does give Hawking his due, it\u2019s not as if Eddie Redmayne has a bigger role than Felicity Jones. Their roles are coequal and the film thus focuses on Stephen and Jane\u2019s relationship, in particular how Wilde had to cope with raising 3 children whilst looking after her husband.\r\u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d is a fantastic film with a fantastic story and two fantastic leads. The only problem I had with the film, and it\u2019s always there for me when I watch this kind of film, is although it is never boring, you do find yourself occasionally wondering how long is left. But this is not the final thought I want to leave you with. Instead, let me remind you that \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d is again, a fantastic film and worth seeing if you get the chance. It tells you something that apparently a nurse wiped a tear from Hawking\u2019s eye when he first saw the film.",

Although, it's tastefully done, the story is does not shy away from the difficulty they faced.\r The Theory of Everything seamlessly shows their life, the personal side of thing, and it's no romantic comedy. The film tells a great deal of what this brilliant man and his wife had to endure. Jane married this genius man, on borrowed time, planning to cherish the little time they had but in time found herself with a husband, whose slowly crumbling body, demands a lot of her. Stephen, this brilliant young man, who had a bright future in front of him, found himself faced with a hurdle he can't possibly overcome and only live with. Their story is beautifully told, fascinating but also cruel.\r The Theory of Everything is subtle and clever. Like I said, it's not an overly sugar-coated and romanticized story of Stephen and Jane Hawking. They are portrayed as strong and determined people but they're also flawed, which makes them human and very likable. I was touched all the way through, immersed into the story and into their lives, but I did not pity them I admired them. The immersion into the story is wonderfully accompanied by the score. It gives an extra layer to such a beautiful story.\r The cast is just superb, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones really deserve the nominations and awards they got because they carried the movie. Redmayne was incredible and once you fathom the amount of work and details that went into this performance, you realize how impressive Eddie Redmayne's performance is. Felicity Jones, though, is the cherry on top the movie wouldn't have been as good without her in it. She's sweet and incredibly good as Jane Hawking her eyes speak for themselves in the movie. She's brilliant.\r As Biopics go, The Theory of Everything is a great one among the many we had this year with Unbroken, and The Imitation Game, or Selma. When the story's great and you have a very talented cast, the director is often overlooked James March did a stellar job.\r I now understand what all the fuss is about. The Theory of everything as a great script, talented cast, is believable and touching.\r @wornoutspines",

This is the fact that there are two major theories in physics\u2014the theory of general relativity, which is used to make very accurate predictions about the behavior of massive objects in space, such as planets, stars and galaxies, and the theory of quantum mechanics, which predicts, also with great accuracy, the behavior of invisible particles such as protons, neurons, and quarks. The problem is that the two theories contradict each other, but since they are employed in completely different realms, there is usually no conflict; however, there are a few situations where the two theories are both applicable and stand in opposition to each other. Therefore, another more integrating and all-encompassing mathematical equation is needed to unify the two theories and reconcile all the forces of the universe, and this is called the Theory of Everything, sought in vain by Albert Einstein himself for the last thirty years of his life.\r As critic Mike Scott pointed out about the film, Hawking\u2019s preoccupation with the Theory of Everything appears as a background process, superficially discussed in conversations and occasionally depicted on blackboards filled with mathematical formulas. A layman\u2019s version of the theoretical quest is given by Hawking\u2019s wife, Jane (Felicity Jones) when she tells a dinner guest that there are two major theories of physics to be reconciled, one dealing with the large objects (\u201cpotatoes\u201d) and one dealing with the small objects (\u201cpeas\u201d).\r Since the film is based on Jane Hawking\u2019s autobiography (Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen), the emphasis is on the romance between Jane and Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne), their subsequent marriage and raising of children, their heartbreaking but in many ways triumphant struggle with his ALS, and their ultimate break-up. It is actually a fascinating aspect of his life, perhaps almost as fascinating as the Theory of Everything. Through sheer determination, a young man who was given two years to live not only survived for fifty years (and counting), but he resolutely sought to have all the experiences he would have had as an able-bodied adult\u2014career, romance, marriage, children, and even divorce and remarriage, and then another divorce. As a friend who picks up the young Hawking to carry him up a flight of stairs asks rather pointedly, \u201cStephen, is everything affected?\u201d And Hawking replies, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a different system\u2014it\u2019s automatic.\u201d Eddie Redmayne comes as close to becoming his subject as is possible for any actor to get.\r Despite the intrigue and complications in his personal life, Hawking was always obsessively at work on brilliant ideas that included the discovery of Hawking radiation, his theories about the origin and boundaries of the universe, and his best-selling popular science books, among other projects and theories, making him one of the most famous physicists in the world. The details of this ongoing intellectual process would have made for an interesting portrayal in the film, since his work is the most fascinating and most important part of the miracle of Stephen Hawking\u2019s life.",

Yet it's dealt  with so glibly to be laughably unbelievable. Seriously, I think my wife taking care of two kids at home by herself without a disabled husband demonstrates and communicates more stress than the Jane character does.\r Seriously a woman gives up her hopes and dreams to care for a disabled person and his kids Instead, her resentment is rather sugar coated. She rarely speaks up for herself. And she doesn't experience any other kind of mental breakdown. The one time she tries to bring it up to her husband he laughs about it. She doesn't pull over the car and give him a piece of her mind? Or let in bottle up until she snaps?\r The most hilarious part of this is when something is \"too much\" cause it involves 3 kids potentially going camping with their mom in France while dad is at an opera. Seriously? That's what crosses the line? Not, you know EVERYDAY fact of taking care of an extremely disabled man and three kids. WTF.\r A more realistic version of this film makes Jane's life appear far more horrifying and isolating. It should have made Stephen's celebrity a source of deep, deep resentment. His inability to agree to simple ways to help her deeply insulting. It should show the despair of the female caregiver, stuck. The unquenchable anger at a man that has all the fun. It should be far more critical of Stephen Hawking and somewhat critical of Jane if she seriously can't seem to communicate her feelings.\r On the plus side this film has a tremendous performance by Redmayne. He thoroughly inhabits the image of Stephen Hawking we all are familiar with. I enjoyed the early romance and the chemistry between the leads was great. Having visited Cambridge, the setting was filmed beautifully.",

With a couple of excellent performances, a superb screenplay and cinematography, and a soundtrack that works very effective with the topic and mood of the film, I can definitely say that this movie really in a brief moment in time pulls your heartstrings quite enough to win you over. Generally recommended, although be warned that there is not much science explanation nor expect too much detail in the story if you are a big fan of the professor. Final Verdict: 8.2",
