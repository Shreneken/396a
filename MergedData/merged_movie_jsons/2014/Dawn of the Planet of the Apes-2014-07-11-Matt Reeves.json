            "content": "I liked Rise of the Planet of the Apes, like... REALLY liked it; this is no secret to those who know me or have read my review of the film here on iMDb, but Dawn is a film that holds a special place in my heart, not only because the film is spectacularly made (although that certainly does help) but also because of the circumstances in which I first experienced it which I will get to in a bit. First off, I'll start with what you will first notice about this film, the effects; the CGI in this movie is absolutely incredible, in the first scene alone we see these beautifully rendered apes, lining the trees in preparation for a hunt and the lighting is spectacular as well as the texture work on their skin, fur and depth and wetness of the eyes. They feel real, even now, and for a 7 year old movie? That's pretty impressive. I forgot to mention how this scene also happens to take place in the rain which adds another element of challenge but they pull it off superbly. I mean, you can see each individual raindrop effect each individual ape's fur! Next up on the block is the narrative, now, although admittedly nothing too special, I think considering the approach this film took with it's story, it's done as well as it can be done; I think the lack of truly original story is what drags this down from a 10 for me but I can't hold it back too much as there is only so much you can do with a post ape uprising earth, and what they do do (ha) is done to a tee. The acting is pretty top notch, I think almost every actor does a pretty solid job but the real standouts here are Andy Serkis as Caesar and Toby Kebell as Koba... wow. Possibly the best motion capture performances I've ever seen. Koba is a deeply damaged character who when we start the film, see has calmed down quite a bit now that he is living free with his own kind, away from the humans, but as the film goes on and he is reintroduced to the human threat, he breaks under the pressure and his scars reopen, it's really great stuff. Caesar continues on his natural trajectory from Rise and is now the leader of the California based ape civilisation we saw birthed in that prior movie. We see him struggle with leadership, parenthood and all things in between, it allows us to sympathise with him on another level and feel the weight of his actions as well as the consequences that surround him and having seen him grow from a baby in Rise, our emotional connection with him is already a strong one. Next, we have music. Absolutely brilliant. The soundtrack perfectly encapsulates the feeling of Planet of the Apes as a whole while also bringing it's own flair, making it feel perfect for THIS movie and the scenes that it is used in.\nIn summary, this is a really, really good film and you should watch it, but I promised I'd tell you my first experience with it and why it means so much to me; when I was 15 me, my dad and my stepmother were all supposed to go and see the film in the IMAX together, unfortunately my dad got ill and it was cancelled. A few days later, my step-mum was supposed to be taking me to the train station, to stay with my birth mother, but unbeknownst to me, she took me to see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, it wasn't in IMAX but I didn't care, I got to spend some extra quality time with my step-mum and watch a bada** film before I left and it's a memory that perseveres through the many that have faded.\nI'm going to give Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a 9/10. Thank you for reading this LONG review and have a lovely day or night, wherever you may be.",

            "content": "Among Hollywood's recent output of mediocre (and in some cases: downright abysmal) remakes of Sci-Fi classics, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' was the rare movie which stood out, for it had as much of a brain as it had a heart \u2013 plus an original approach to the well-known material and great visuals. Having said that, 'Rise' practically pales in comparison to Matt Reeves' sequel: the upcoming 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is as close to a Science-Fiction masterpiece as a 170 million PG-13 Hollywood summer blockbuster can possibly get.The storyline picks up ten years after we saw Ceasar and his fellow simian escapees seek refuge in the woods near San Francisco, and although the film's trailers already gave away pretty much everything that happened during that time (and alas, way too much of what will happen), I'm not going to spoil anything for those who carefully avoided watching said trailers. As with all my reviews, instead of giving away any details about the story, I'll elaborate on all other aspects of the movie.What needs to be mentioned first is what an astonishing achievement 'Dawn' is when it comes to the use of CGI. I'm normally very critical towards the (over-)use of CGI \u2013 but the level of craftsmanship displayed here simply has to be admired. It only took me seconds to forget I was watching digital characters (brought to life through the outstanding motion-capture performances by Andy Serkis, Toby Kebbell and Judy Grier \u2013 to name but a few), and I can't begin to imagine what a task it must have been for the artists and wizards in the animation department to work on every background and every tiny little detail of every character until this level of seamlessness and reality could be achieved.But nearly every other aspect of the movie has been realized equally well: Michael Giacchino's haunting musical score fits and reflects the drama on screen perfectly, while the \u2013 often terrifying \u2013 beauty of the images on screen had me immediately wondering who the DoP was (now I know: Michael Seresin, the genius veteran DoP of such classics as 'Midnight Express' and 'Angel Heart'). When it comes to the action; well, 'Dawn' is not your usual summer blockbuster. This is no light-hearted, comic-book-style fantasy film with fun, over-the-top action scenes. What we have here is a gritty, realistic portrayal of a slowly escalating conflict, and when we do get to the battle scenes in the third act, those scenes are a spectacular, mesmerizing visual feast (and ultimately heart breaking).But the core of this film \u2013 and also the reason why the action scenes in the third act really do have an impact and all the mayhem really gets to you \u2013 is the intelligent, skilfully told story with its well-drawn, believable characters (portrayed by equally believable actors). The tragic simian/human conflict mirrors our real \u2013 and very human \u2013 past and present day wars and social frictions in a very credible way and thus makes this film resonate far beyond what any mere Sci-Fi premise would let you expect. So my verdict: With its beautiful imagery, highly relevant story and breath-taking effects, 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is as close to a Science-Fiction masterpiece as its mass-audience orientated constrictions allowed it to be (which \u2013 in this case \u2013 is very close); an astonishing achievement and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/",

            "content": "The Planet of the Apes franchise has always fascinated me but I hadn't been interested until seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes a few years back. The emotional depth that that film brought to the table was unparalleled in terms of big blockbusters. I was attached to Caesar and several of the other apes. That movie surprised everyone so it isn't much of a surprise that the sequel 'Dawn' looked even better as they hired Matt Reeves as the replacement director. The special effects are some of the best I have ever seen and the acting was surprisingly outstanding. The trailers looked incredible so my excitement was about as high as it could possibly be for an apes movie. And the film doesn't disappoint.The film takes place at least 8 years after 'Rise' and the time jump is much to their benefit. It allowed Caesar to step into his role as leader of all the apes and link between the apes and humans. Speaking of the effects, some of the facial expression the apes gave were just devastating. And for me to say that I was on the verge of tears in a movie where apes can talk should sound absurd but its the truth. Caesar's family is present throughout and his eldest son is the one that hit home. When you see him being put into war unwillingly after life changing events you just cant but help feeling terrible for him. Koba, the corrupt ape who has always believed humans are more dangerous than Caesar thinks is also a conflicting character. There is a scene between him and Caesar near the first act that made me feel sympathy for him and whatever other apes were also tortured. Dreyfuss, played by Gary Oldman also stood out for the short periods that he appears. Much like Koba, he is a man who lost so much that he has lost faith in the world and wants nothing to do with the other species. It's these two characters who keep the conflict rising as peace is on the downfall and war is on the brink. The only real weak part of the film is that the trailers show a lot of the important scenes and I'm a guy who watches trailers everyday. I knew a little bit too much.To say that Caesar is one of the greatest leaders in film history is not an overstatement. When he is on screen you cant help but be mesmerized by the immense strength and gravitas that comes along with the character. Now it is time for the academy to honor the greatness that this film brings to all aspects of filmmaking. I wouldn't go as far as saying Serkis deserves a best actor nod, but I wouldn't disagree if they gave it to him. The performance is one for the ages.The third act is brilliant in every way a film should be. It was unexpected, visually dazzling, and emotionally fulfilling. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the get go. It's one of the best movies of the summer and definitely made it's mark in motion capture history.+Caesar's unparalleled leadership +Special effects and motion capture are just insanely good +Apes facial expressions can be emotionally devastating +Koba & Dreyfuss similarly troubled-I knew a bit too much from trailers 9.2/10SECOND VIEWING 9.6/10",

            "content": "As someone who really enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes, expectations were high for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. And apart from a rushed ending and the underdeveloped human characters Dawn of the Planet of the Apes didn't disappoint and is just as good. It looks amazing for starters, the cinematography and lighting are of great beauty and atmosphere and the scenery is equally striking. But the visual highlight, and most likely the best thing about the film, are the special effects for the apes, that they look so real and that it's hard to believe they were done by computer is testament to how good they look. The soundtrack is haunting and rousing with no dirge-like tempos and it doesn't feel overbearing either, even with sound with as much authenticity as here. The script also impresses, it's very intelligently done and has a lot of tension and heart. What impressed even more was how simple and nuanced some of it was, like when the apes speak they only need to say a few words and it still feels like it's saying a lot, a couple of times even a sideways glance brings more impact than you'd think. The story takes a bigger and somewhat bolder approach than Rise of the Planet of the Apes and this is an instance of it working very well, especially with the visceral action sequences which are very tense and look terrific and in the incredibly intense and emotional final act. It's compelling stuff where you feel compassion for and identify with every step of the way with Caesar and his family. Matt Reeves' direction doesn't make the mistake of being overblown or lethargic, there is at least a sense that he knows what he's doing. The acting is solid, Jason Clarke and Keri Russell are charming leads and Gary Oldman while criminally underused still gives a spirited performances. But other than the special effects the other highlight is the characterisation of the apes, which is just superb especially for Caesar(who is by far and way the most relatable and most compelling character in the entire film), Andy Serkis never fails to amaze me. All in all a really well done blockbuster, although the human characters do not register anywhere near as well as the special effects and the apes characterisations. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Well meaning, but a bit too full of its own importance, becoming a bit heavy and ponderous in the process",
            "content": "I had enjoyed the first film in what I guess is the modern version of the PotA franchise, so I was quite looking forward to this second film. The plot jumps quite some time ahead, to find mankind surviving in small bands following the outbreak of a virus around a decade ago. Meanwhile Caesar has established a community deep in the woods, founded off the survivors of the battle on the Golden Gate bridge. When a group of men ventures into the woods looking for an old dam in the hope of getting power to their community, it tests trust and loyalty within both camps.As the title suggests, this is the point where the Apes start to develop rather than just survive, and as such it holds a key point in the series; unfortunately this is something that the film very much feels and as a result it carries itself much more seriously than it can bear. The base elements of the plot are all well and good, with a narrative that expands on war, peace, trust, fear and aggression in a way that balances the apes and humans pretty well. The problem is not that it does this, but that it carries it all too heavily, producing a rather ponderous tone that sees the delivery imbued with too much weight, with all the characters and every line seeming to be aware of the import which it has. This robs it of flow and naturalism, both of which it could have done with.When the action comes, it carries this same weight. It provides plenty of good moments but again there is the constant sense of importance and darkness about it \u2013 so there is nothing that really rivals the Golden Gate Bridge sequence for spectacle and tension. In terms of the technical side of things, it is hard to fault the film, and the motion-capture performances really feed back into the effects to produce more than just impressive computer generated effects. Performances from Serkis and Kebbell are both very good, and it is shame therefore that Clarke is as stiff as a board and Oldman mostly wasted with little to actually do. The rest of the cast are the same \u2013 the humans seems overly labored while the apes are generally better.It is not a bad film by any means, and there is a lot to like about it, even if a lot of this is what it could have been rather than what it is. The weight it carries is evident, so it doesn't just deliver an epic plot, it feels that it is doing that, in every word and scene. This stifles it, making it feel ponderous and too self- aware, which is a shame because there are a couple of very good performances in here, and a lot of impressive effects work.",

The big issue across these two films is that the human characters are very one-note and bland. Gary Oldman is the only complex human character in it - the rest just have one personality trait that is well explored, if that, and a lot of them make very stupid decisions. But on the flip side, Caesar is a fantastic character, and I really like how the apes' opinions on humans are affected directly by their experiences of them - it makes their characters a lot better. Andy Serkis is still fantastic, and the effects have aged very, very well. The action is really well shot, and has a really nice gritty feel, particularly in the second half. I will say that the first half was a tad slow for me, but I did appreciate how the film spent time building up the characters in order to go all out for the finale. The cinematography is strong and the story is well developed - those opening few minutes really pack a punch now. Overall, I wouldn't call this one of the best sequels of all time, but it is a genuinely great and recommendable film.",

            "review_title": "High class monkey business",
            "content": "There are some films you go to see with low expectations and back in 2011 Rupert Wyatt's \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" was one of those. After the Charlton Heston classic, a long series of increasingly poor sequels and a failed Tim Burton reboot, apprehension was high. But how wrong could I be. This was 100% a 10/10 film (if I'd been doing these reviews in those days): an epic and gripping story; great performances from James Franco, John Lithgow, Freida Pinto and Harry Potter star Tom Felton; and stunningly executed special effects, with Andy Serkis's performance delivering amazing depth of feeling and emotion. (The scene where Serkis's character Caesar first speaks is one of my top 10 \"most goose-bumpy\" moments in cinema history).Now, 4 years later, we have the sequel - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - which, given how much I loved the original film, I approached with a similar feeling of apprehension. But, I am delighted to say, I was pleasantly surprised.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes neatly takes over in its opening titles where the closing titles of the first film left off. The so-called Simean flu has wiped out 499 of every 500 people on earth, deftly explaining why James Franco and Freida Pinto fail to reprise their roles in the sequel: in fact it would have been an unrealistic cop-out if either had done. Instead - monkey business aside - we have a brand new human cast led by Jason Clarke (\"Zero Dark Thirty\", \"The Great Gatsby\"), Keri Russell (\"MI-3's\" 'bomb in the head' girl) and heavy hitter Gary Oldman. These characters are trying to rebuild a new society for the survivors in San Francisco, but their desire for power (of the volts and amps variety) puts them in direct conflict with the emerging simian society deep in the redwoods. Much conflict ensues, not only between the two tribes but between the factions of the two societies.Once again, there is a good story by original writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, joined by Mark Bomback: underneath the set-piece action sequences, the majority of the drama comes from the relationships between the characters, and especially that between Caesar (Serkis) and his estranged son played extremely well by Nick Thurston, culminating in a remarkable stand-out scene between the two in Caesar's old home that is genuinely moving. And another specific callout was Yorkshire-born Toby Kebbell playing the emotionally and mentally wounded Koba: his scenes in the human armoury - think Heath Ledger's Joker crossed with PG Tips advert - are both funny and distubing in equal measure.Is it as good as \"Rise\"? No, not in my view. The first film was novel and deep, and \"Dawn\" is more superficial in comparison. It is also far more of an action film (or \"a bit fighty\" as my dear wife described it), with some standout battle scenes that are a masterpiece of special effects. If \"Rise\" could be compared to the original \"Alien\", \"Dawn\" is much more like \"Aliens\" - wham, bang, thank-you Simian.The director this time is wunderkind Matt Reeves (\"Cloverfield\", \"Let Me In\"), directing with panache and a narrative drive that only occasionally lets up for emotional punch. The acting is good and (as flagged above) the special effects are outstanding: the production team clearly saw \"I am Legend\" and wanted to go one better with the San Francisco streets. And all topped off with a fine and un-obtrusive score by Michael Giacchino.Highly recommended, and I am now looking forward to the next sequel, planned for a 2016 release.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my library of other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to \"Follow the Fad\".

A group of civilians not killed by the Simian Flu pandemic are gathered in San Francisco and have been degraded by civil unrest, economic collapse and a shortage of power. A small group of humans led by Malcolm(Jason Clarke)have found an abandon hydroelectric dam in the woods and being able to repair it and get it running again could provide much needed power to summon other survivors for help. But something has gone very wrong; an ape has discovered the group. An iffy peace agreement is reached between the humans and apes, but goes awry when a human gun is found that breaks the treaty. An all-out war is unable to avoid, with the conflict determining which species will dominate the planet.This installment of the franchise seems to be written better and there is noticeable character development with the humans as well as the apes. Filmed in and around San Francisco, New Orleans and Canada...cinematography is outstanding. The CGI is awesome.

Civilization has exemplified the mass exploitation and selfishness humans are capable of in the past, and present, on numerous occasions. The Planet of the Apes series delves on this complex. It displays the vulnerabilities of the human race and how nothing is to be underestimated.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will surely entertain. As the sequel to the last instalment, we follow Caesar in his new habitat following the human pandemic instigated by the Simian influenza. In a world where the human population is depleted and infrastructure collapsed, society is broken apart and in a fragile state. With stubborn and selfish humans, the fate of humanity does not rest in good hands. Watching this film, I cannot say there ever was a moment of dullness nor boredom. Though, for me, there was nothing exceptional about it. The plot is one that we have come to expect and the CGI was certainly state of the art. Putting this aside, it is the story of Caesar and the strive for freedom of all that captures this movie's true essence. Empathizing with these intelligent beings no longer being the tools of humans is one to both support and fear. It is this unique mixture of elements that make Dawn of the Planet of the Apes so touching yet stimulating.This is a movie I'd recommend all to see since it offers a perspective many contemporary films fail to produce.",

Okay an origin story always offers more meat but it had me a lot more involved than Dawn which was ultimately a leadership struggle film.I felt this film was weaker because it descended into the rather clich\u00e9d dad trying to connect with his son, 2nd in command wants to take over, they have a big bust up at the end. If the main protagonists were humans and not superbly rendered apes, I think some more might think the story a little predictable, almost like the Lion King.It's like how I thought the first was clever for showing the monkey strengths and ingenuity in outsmarting the humans. However in this film the monkeys wouldn't actually have been any good at aiming the guns or reloading. So although cool seeing them fire guns, the humans would still have had a tactical advantage.I'm not saying this to be a spoil sport for the action scenes but it was lazy film making that the makers didn't then think of a clever way to use the monkey strengths to get round this tactical weakness.Fox bundled the original director out of the way for daring to want to make something of equal calibre and switched in Reeves to create an inferior sequel that hit all of the generic blockbuster marks but had no real heart. Maybe this is proof that recreating the 'lightening in a bottle' of Rise does require a little more time and effort than simply throwing money at special effects.For me it was one step forward in the technology and CGI but two steps back in the story telling. In Rise, the effects aided the story. In Dawn, they were the story.",

Meanwhile Ceasar is challenged by Koba.The realism achieved with the ape characters is terrific. They are almost human and distinguishable from each other. The story is compelling.

            "content": "After seeing RISE on Channel 4 last night I promised myself I wasn't going to waste two hours of my life and money on a bus and cinema ticket to watch a Hollywood blockbuster sequel . Maybe the Summer heat has been frying my brain because I found myself taking a long walk to Edinburgh city centre and spending \u00a38.20 on a ticket to watch DAWN . Perhaps I was trying to teach myself a lesson in that I should always stick to gut instinct ? When someone makes a decision they should stick to it otherwise bad things might happen DAWN starts in exactly the same manner as RISE finished . Simian flu sweeps across the world killing billions of humans and this economy of storytelling is very effective indeed . Unfortunately when we're introduced to the surviving humans there's been a massive spanner thrown in to the works because they're all living in a small district of San Francisco . What's wrong with that you ask ? Common sense should tell you that's the worst place you can stay in after a catastrophe . As John Wyndham and John Christopher point out in their novels a city is nothing more than a concrete desert . Surely they'd be hundreds of thousands of dead bodies in the city ? Won't this lead to all types of secondary diseases ? How you going to farm crops in a city ? I suppose there might be some supplies left but after ten years of industrial collapse people still have access to cigars and cigarettes . I'm guessing simian flu only affects non smokers ? I'm also guessing you're not supposed to think too deeply about this scenario because it doesn't really hold up to much examination . Characters are shown to having access to military hardware but the military are conspicuous by their absence . This is probably down to plot function . The human survivors need access to a hydro dam just outside the city in order to gain electricity and kick off the plot . The human enclave need electricity in order to power communications to contact other human communities but it's impossible to believe that in ten years after the flu outbreak not one single warship has berthed in the docks , or a military plane has landed at the airport or a self sufficient military unit has entered the cityAnother slight problem is that the characters are like in the previous film rather one dimensional and underwritten . We've got the nice male human character , the nice female human character , the bad ethnic minority human , the good ethnic minority human etc and this is mirrored by the ape community . If you've any knowledge of Soviet history you might just second guess how things pan out in the ape community and it's the actors playing the apes in a motion capture suits who make the biggest impression . If you're going to cast Gary Oldman at least give him a part deserving of his talents and have him do something interesting with his character It's a pity the film is let down by a succession of small flaws because I did like it but wanted to love it and the movie doesn't quite pull it off . It is a solid relatively dark blockbuster better than the film that preceded it and better than most Summer fare that's been released over the last few years but don't think it's anywhere near deserving of its position of 150 on the IMDb top movies list and feel like the HOBBIT movies will quickly drop out of the list . As it stands the original franchise was probably more enjoyable as a whole due to its imagination",

            "content": "\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is the latest chapter in the POTA franchise. I must admit that I had not seen any of the recent releases--those that rely heavily on CGI--until this one.If you are wondering whether or not this film stands on its own, it does. After a quick updating of the last film (Rise of...), the story advances without any confusion for the viewer.Since this film does use CGI extensively, let me say that the effects are extremely well done. In my opinion, the most difficult thing to pull of is to make apes on horseback look realistic and natural. They came as close to it as I think can be done.Another reasonable question might be: When so many of the characters are apes, are you really able to tell them apart easily? Again, yes. Visual cues are utilized, making it very easy to distinguish the ape characters. This might seem like a given, but it is essential to enjoyable viewing.The story itself is interesting and engaging. The relationship of ape to man is a touchy thing in this film, due to years of abuse and violence. There are those who wish a peaceful coexistence and those, naturally, who wish for war. Even as conflict ensues, opposing forces are at work. It is critical that the inter-ape communication and the inter-species communication be somewhat believable, and the script handles that issue well. There are subtitles when needed. Somehow, they never seem to interfere with the flow of the story.I recommend this film to almost anyone, subject to the PG-13 rating. Though violence is depicted, it is not gory. Nor is it championed. Instead, the film promotes peaceful communication and cooperation.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes jumps right into the time when the apes are beginning to build a new civilization while mankind is starting to fall apart. What makes this different from the last feature is it once again sticks more to its symbolism. Now this is the real deal of the context, it's obviously a truce between two sides, it is the part that is mostly known as the last chance before the unwanted fate of their world happens. Since everybody knows how things are going to turn out (regarding this as a prequel), it still provides the heartfelt tension of their trust to each other. Unlike Rise, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes doesn't only throw off a visual effects gimmick on screen, it also deeply focuses on the compelling themes beneath the tale.Whatever legacy that was left from the last movie is the character development of the ape. Caesar has grown understanding more how the world works, his sympathy with the humans remains and he can still believe in peace in them and his own kind. However, anyone else in both sides stayed naive, paranoid on what they're planning to do. It doesn't lack any information, the rubble already shows the crisis going on in those streets and the characters are given their own backstory to effectively define their motivations, thus this is a situation which is far from good vs. evil. The real enemy of this conflict are simply fear, cynicism, and sometimes revenge. It is a dilemma that is a few steps closer to the edge of their trust. And that is how the whole story works, it makes the audience real nervous about the decisions each of the characters make.Even when it's already packed with a great director and a great cast, the film still manages to keep on telling the story straightly, like exactly pinpointing the allegories without distracting any demanded pleasures that you would typically ask from a blockbuster. But as said, it still offers those elements when necessary. Director Matt Reeves gives this franchise a whole new tone. Blockbusters today tend to be ultra serious and darker, but Reeves is one of the rare directors who could live up to that ambition. He doesn't only bring the atmosphere, there are also some nicely shot action scenes that deliberately displays the horror and violence of the battles.But the merits doesn't end there of course. The acting is stellar, mostly pointing at the man behind the leading ape, Andy Serkis. He's always been terrific in this job, but here there is more gravity and grittiness to the performance than before, whether it's physical or vocal. The motion-capture performances just add a lot of exceptional value to the CGI work which could totally outshine everything else in the filmmaking. The actors who played human characters also did good, with Jason Clarke handling his role well.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is more than a stunningly made film, it thoughtfully considers real depth within its storyline which results an overwhelming experience even without an excess of action. There is already suspense existing at the complexities of the species' treaty. The battle scenes just becomes the gravy of it, but really, the analogies is what makes it really compelling. After years of attempting to bring back the original spirit of the series, the filmmakers has finally realized that this is what this mythology is all about. Except it has become grittier. The film just triumphs in its choices, which it's almost difficult to call it a blockbuster, because blockbuster asks you turn off your brain. This movie makes you open your heart.",

            "review_title": "Great Effects, but Lacks Substance",
            "content": "As an avowed fan of the original Planet of the Apes films and the 2011 reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes, it was with some anticipation that I awaited this latest instalment in the prequel series. Maybe I had my expectations too high, or maybe the film is just missing that something special, but I left the cinema feeling a little underwhelmed. Of course, the motion capture effects are amazing, the post-apocalyptic atmosphere is suitably bleak (power supplies have almost been exhausted and the human populace is in panic mode) and there is action aplenty, which might very well be the problem. You see, as strange as it may seem given that the majority of characters are apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is very typical in both its characterisations and narrative structure.Directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In), Dawn of the Planet of the Apes picks up the story 10 years after the events of the previous film with the vast majority of the earth's population having been wiped out; either by the ALZ-113 virus or the violence that broke out as panic set in. A group of survivors have etched out an existence amongst the remnants of what was once San Francisco, but fuel supplies have been exhausted and an alternate power source must be found. Meanwhile, in the forests north of the city, the burgeoning ape population is living peacefully under the rule of Caesar (Andy Serkis), a benevolent dictator of sorts. When a group of humans led by Malcolm (Australia's Jason Clarke) head into the forest in an effort to repair a dam that could potentially generate power for the city, conflict ensues. Despite the best efforts of Caesar and Malcolm to hash out a peaceful co-existence between the two groups, ignorance and distrust abounds and the tensions escalate. There are the requisite bad guys on each side \u2013 Gary Oldman's Dreyfus for the humans and the scarred Koba (Toby Kebbell) for the apes \u2013 whose actions ultimately result in war between the two groups.The attitudes and actions of key characters are a reflection of what has been happening around the world for as long as we can remember. Koba's experiences in captivity have left him with a bitter hatred of all humans, an attitude that reflects ways in which certain groups today (such as the Islamic community) are marginalised because of the actions of a few. Dreyfus, on the other hand is of the arrogant belief that they are \"just apes\" and thereby don't pose a serious threat. Again, how many times in history have we seen such situations where one group has such an overwhelming sense of superiority over another that they feel utterly justified in their desire to use force in an effort to secure what they want. Of course Caesar and Malcolm, who have developed a mutual respect and know that such conflict is completely unnecessary, are caught in the middle as war breaks out. The parallels to conflicts such as those in the Middle East are obvious and it is this distinct lack of subtlety that prevents the film from soaring as an engaging narrative. Reeves was obviously conscious of the need to appease an action-obsessed audience desperate for a fix of mayhem and chaos and such a focus prevents the film from offering any genuine insight into what is an utterly intriguing premise.There is still much to appreciate in what has been achieved on a technical and aesthetic level. The motion capture work is brilliant and, even if there are a few moments where some of the apes don't look quite real, the creation of the forest world and the apes who inhabit it is remarkable; certainly a far cry from Roddy McDowall in costume in the first Planet of the Apes in 1968. As Caesar, Andy Serkis is fabulous and it is great to see that he is duly credited as the star of the film. The casting of Clarke as Norman is a good choice because he doesn't bring any pre-conceived audience expectations or the baggage of previous roles that might burden a higher profile actor. Whilst Clarke is quietly effective as Norman, fellow Aussie Kodi Smit-McPhee has little to do as his son Alexander, while Keri Russell's Ellie is the convenient love interest with requisite medical training. Perhaps the biggest disappointment amongst the cast is seeing a talented actor like Oldman confined yet again to a one-dimensional role as a bombastic, narrow-minded douchebag. Whilst there are elements that impress, Dawn of the Planet of Apes possesses neither the intelligence nor the heart of its predecessor.",

            "content": "Dramatic as well as spectacular film in which simians undergo a rebellion against humans and winding up at a climatic final . Based on Pierre Boulle novel initiated by \u00a8Planet of Apes\u00a8 that at time of its release regarded as the most extraordinary Scifi in years . 8th movie in the series , it deals with Caesar (Andy Serkis) a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (the fate of Will -James Franco- after the events \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" is unknown, but there is a clue , when Caesar returns to his house you can see a sign with an X on the stoop by the door , usually this means someone living there is infected) and a Primatologist Caroline Aranha . The chimpanzee gains human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug that gives rise to a super-intelligent chimp who leads an ape uprising . Later on , Caesar seeking justice for his fellow primates , as he carries out a riot in which simians turn the tables . Meantime , lots of simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas murder violently every human in sight . Then , a growing nation of genetically evolved apes led by Caesar is threatened by a band of human survivors of the devastating virus unleashed a decade earlier . They reach a fragile peace helped by a group of good humans (Jason Clarke and Keri Russell ; Matt Reeves cast her as the female lead, fifteen years after giving her her most famous role when he cast her as the lead of his TV show Felicity) , but it proves short-lived , as both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species . At the ending happens a spectacular , fierce confrontation between a human army and the simians commanded by Koba (Tony Kebbell) . Then Caesar leads an animal revolt against his enemy in which humans battle the apes led by an intelligent ape .This is an entertaining , big budget sci-fi flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about origin of human being , racism , apartheid , though also packs action, intrigue and amusement . Although several elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit the story turns out to be pretty interesting and amusing . This film is considered to be the second live action film to have its main hero as a thoughtful, feeling, self aware animal . Andy Serkis's distinctive features prove to be recognisable even under \u00a8Motion Capture\u00a8 FX images . One of the first feature films to use motion-capture in a so-called 'on location' setting , formerly , motion-capture was limited to special studio set up with special \u00a8motion-capture\u00a8 cameras in very clearly defined surroundings . Unlike the previous films, this is the second Apes movie to have CGI apes and with arm extensions . The performers are very fine , particularly Andy Serkis who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs , Jason Clarke , Keri Russell , Gary Oldman are pretty good , the characters are well drawn . Andy Serkis, Terry Notary, and Karin Konoval are the only actors that returned from \"Rise\" to play the characters Caesar, Rocket, and Maurice . Judy Greer replaced stunt-woman/dancer Devyn Dalton as Caesar's mate, Cornelia, and Toby Kebbell replaced stuntman/motion capture performer Christopher Gordon as the scarred lab chimp Koba . Remaining cast formed by Gorillas , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice , in spite of Motion Capture they are still oddly convincing . In addition to the apes, visual effects company Weta Digital created other digital animals, such as a herd of deer, a grizzly bear, and CG doubles of the live horses . The deer were created using key-frame animation and the digital crowd enhancement software Massive , the bear through key-frame animation, and the horses with a mixture of key-frame animation and motion capture . The picture delivers enough energy and results to be an impressive flick full of action , battles and suspense . In contrast to former movies , this film shot motion capture mostly in exterior sets. Andy Serkis remarked that shooting outside in motion capture suits made all the actors playing apes so sweaty and smelly that they hardly dared to come close to other people after a few days . Writing credits by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver and Bomback , their screenplay is just clever and including interesting issues about human beings and animals . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and luminous cinematography by Michael Seresin . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Michael Giacchino , it's full of fury and sound . This motion picture was well directed by Matt Reeves , being the first \"Planet of the Apes\" to filmed and released in 3D and first Planet of the Apes film to be shot in the 1.85:1 ratio.Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are the followings : The previous \u00a8Rise of the Planet of the Apes\u00a8 by Rupert Wyatt with James Franco , Freida Pinto , John Lihtgow , Brian Cox , Tom Felton and Andy Serkis ; the original and the best turns out to be \u00a8Planet of Apes\u00a8 by Franklyn J Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , followed by \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" (1970) with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels that get worse and a TV series as 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes' (73, J.Lee Thompson) and finally Tim Burton version (2000) with Mark Whalberg , Tim Roth , Helena Bonham Carter and special appearance by Charlton Heston .",

            "review_title": "Amazing ape performances, some stupid humans though",
            "content": "Dawn follows on 10 years after Rise. A large part of humanity has been killed by a deadly virus which swept the globe and Caesar and his ape community live somewhere in San Francisco. The apes teach each-other to read and write and most are fluent in sign language. They hunt other animals en masse with well-timed plans. Meanwhile, the humans are in a dystopian society, hanging around in an enclosure with limited electricity and no communications with humans in other areas. In fact, their power supply will run out in a few weeks unless they can reactivate a dam near where the apes are located.A mishap occurs where an ape ends up dead (due to a guy called Carver) and Caesar confronts the humans with his army warning that they should never again go into ape territory. It's a powerful and convincing moment.I've never hated a character more than I hated Carver (Kirk Acevedo) in this movie. He is loud, stupid, arrogant, rude, aggressive, dismissive of anything he doesn't agree with and almost single- handedly causes a war between apes and humans. He's antogonistic with the other humans and adds nothing of value to the movie. He cuts off Ellie (Keri Russell), emphatically proclaiming that obviously the apes are responsible for the simian virus (he is incorrect). I can't stand when movies turn to devices like this. It's unnecessary and cheapens the existing tension in the film. The other humans are stupid by extension by putting up with him and seemingly forgiving his countless mistakes, constant risk-taking and unpleasant negativity.The apes themselves represent a major achievement in film-making. The cgi is incredible although the chimpanzee faces are more obviously fake. The orangutans are especially unbelievable. I was really blown away. It's important to give credit to the sound design as well. The sounds give the apes weight and presence. You don't think about the breathing or the steps or the subtle shifting of weight but they all make noise which is critical to making it seem real.And the ape performances are great. The eyes of the apes are intense and knowing. Their movement is very natural, both with the body and the face. They put so much expression into what they say with sign language and also when they actually speak. Andy Serkis is the go-to man when it comes to ping-pong-balls-on-a-green-suit acting and he must have delivered here because Caesar is a powerful character with a demanding presence. Koba is also excellent but then so are all the apes. They're incredible to watch and ironically bring a lot of humanity to the movie, moreso than the humans.The way Koba eventually leads a battle against the humans is very logical and devious. I felt like it echoed WWI in some ways. But there are many gaps in logic in the movie. The humans are far too lazy in protecting a weapons depot. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) does a reasonable job of trying to connect with Caesar and the apes but he fails to warn that the humans are arming and preparing for a likely battle. He doesn't do enough to initiate diplomacy and communication between the apes and humans. Why aren't the humans more excited in finding intelligent, speaking apes? This is a major revelation! A chance to connect with a separate species.Gary Oldman is one of my favourite actors but he can only do so much with so little screen time and such weak lines. His character ends up being disappointingly short-sighted.The music was disappointing. Parts of it sounded like Agent Cody Banks or something - like a goofy kid's spy movie. Michael Giacchino seems inconsistent, perhaps it depends on the director or kind of movie he's working on. Some of the more sentimental parts were okay but most of the music sounded tired, contrived and forgettable.In summary, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a mixed bag. It has the makings of a great film with the potential to give profound insights into how conflicts grow and wars begin. Caesar's growing moral compass is powerful to watch. The apes make the movie worth seeing alone. But the humans are dull and stupid by comparison. The acting, lines and characterisation is weak for the humans. The action scenes are really well done. The relationship between Caesar and Koba is perhaps the core of the movie and it's very well done. Take out 40 minutes of weaker material and substitute 20 minutes of smart ideas and motivations and Dawn would be a masterpiece.",

            "content": "\"I always think... ape better than human. I see now... how much like them we are.\" After the magnificent \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" from 2011, Caesar the legendary ape who started the revolution for his species, can show up again in this sequel. It's 10 years later and the world has been decimated thanks to the Simian virus. This flu originated from a genetically engineered virus and ensured that the apes became systematically wiser. The magisterial beginning shows Caesar in close-up and from there it's a run-up to an amazing first 20 minutes in which no human is seen and we witness the ins and outs of the apes commune, who communicate by use of a kind of sign language. They have retreated into a mountainous forest near San Francisco, where they have formed a primitive society with Caesar as the absolute leader. They lead a peaceful existence, not aware of the fact that humanity has survived the pandemic. Until such underdeveloped biped turns up one day and immediately shoots an ape at first sight. And that's the beginning of a very interesting struggle for power between two different cultures with survival instinct, self-preservation and demarcating the territory as a central issue. Eventually you start to wonder who really are the primates.Is it necessary to see this movie in less than no time because of the original story with surprising twists? Nope, not at all. It's not really that exciting and even a normal chimpanzee can predict the outcome. But, it's the amazing design of the apes and the sometimes real human actions and emotional traits that they show. Probably the fact that the actors are \"motion captured\" has something to do with it, but it's still breathtaking to watch. At certain moments the CGI wasn't quite correct. Especially the fragments of the horse riding apes. You can notice sometimes that these were computer animations. But that's really nitpicking. The Most part looked lifelike and one can only conclude that the authentic episodes of \"Planet of the Apes\" from the 60's were irrefutable populated by costumed actors.The final confrontation between humans and apes, with Caesar, again played by Andy Serkis (who formerly also performed as Gollum in TLotR), and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) as the two righteous leaders of the two parties, is of course inevitable. Clearly a socio-political theme was ingeniously woven throughout the cheap, ordinary Hollywood entertainment. The mutual distrust with revenge as the cause for the sneaky tricks and treachery. One group is angry because the apes are supposedly the origin of the extermination of mankind. The other group is unnerved by the years of abuse in laboratories and a doomed life in captivity. The result, of course is a clash with also some internal feuds and conflicts.Unfortunately after several memorable and downright masterful film clips, we're treated with some ordinary, cheap action movie scenes. A kind of \"Expendables meets The A-Team\" with heroically swinging of automatic rifles, rockets whizzing around the ears as if the third world war just began and even a tank broke loose. Next to that a big can of sentimentality is pulled open quickly leading to an engaging conversation between Caesar and his son. And then the curtain falls across this magnificent epos with a picture of a real Messiah who parades among his followers. An open end that yearns for an overwhelming third part. But beyond this kitschy final offensive you can admire a few cinematic gems like the appearing of the apes colony in the big city, where they speak to the crowd in an admonishing tone. You could feel the consternation of the crowd after hearing the first words of Caesar. And also the magnificent mimicry Koba used at one time to deceive two armed men. A moment where CGI and facial expressions blend effortlessly. Yes, that's the reason why you should watch this movie.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",

            "content": "Count me as one of the people who was completely bored with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The story makes absolutely no sense and therefore I couldn't get into it. I just thought it was meh.1. The apes have been living out in the forest for ten years now, can still barely speak about twelve words, but they ride horses? Really? Where are the stables? How do they train the horses? What do they feed the horses when there aren't any hay fields or even fields of grass around? How did they make those fancy reins for the horses?2. Caesar has known Malcolm for three days and trusts him and thinks of him as a friend for some reason? Why? Malcolm hasn't done anything to gain said trust. He's there for selfish reasons, to get that dam working. They don't have any meaningful conversations. Caesar can barely speak twelve words. True, they save Caesar's wife from some type of illness, but Malcolm doesn't do that, the female doctor does that. And about that. The wife is on her death bed and the doctor gives her some antibiotics and shazam she's up in less than a day? Huh?3. The climax of this movie is basically just the ending of the Lion King with monkeys instead of lions.4. There's just way too much CGI in this film. It's impressive at first but after a while it's just like watching a cartoon even though it is realistic. 5. I didn't really care about anyone in this film, was given no reason to. Not enough time was spent with the apes, or with the humans, when they were doing anything but shouting and shooting guns, for me to get to know any of them. I was bored.6. The 3D did nothing but distract me. Instead of getting absorbed into the little story that there is, I was like, wow look at how that stump looks so much closer to me than the apes are, while missing whatever was actually happening.7. All the subtitles were just idiotic. I don't know if they were using real sign language because I don't know sign language, but it seemed to me the subtitles said a lot more than what a few hand gestures could represent. Was there some reason the apes couldn't just, you know, talk, and talk in a conversational manner instead of barking and grunting out words? Caesar has had ten years since he spoke his first words. He should be talking as well as a thirteen year old does by now.8. There was a lot I just didn't understand. If the vast majority of the human population has been wiped out by the flu, why aren't there corpses all over the place? Why did they even let the bad guy who shot the ape at the beginning come back with them, when they knew he couldn't be trusted? Where did the camcorder with the scene from the previous film come from all of a sudden? How did they fix a gigantic dam with nothing but wrenches? How did Caesar suddenly recover from his gunshot wound at the end to go on and fight Kobo? Why did he tell Malcolm that he was \"a good man\" when Malcolm hadn't done anything particularly good to deserve it? And there is so much more that just didn't make sense to me.9. Basically this is a very loud, in your face, not subtle at all film that doesn't take any time to develop characters or get you emotionally involved in anything. It's just a lot of CGI action and yelling. I thought it was boring.",

            "content": "DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES continues to prove this franchise as one of the most entertaining reboots to come out of Hollywood in an age where refurbishing classic favorites is the new fad. I was such a fan of the first in this new series (RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES) that I actually went to the theaters this time around for the new installment. And it continues to blow my mind in how good these new films are. If you were a fan of the first film, you will most likely find plenty to love in this one. It continues the tale of our species' downfall and the inevitable rise of apes to a position of dominance. It begins around ten years after the end of RISE. The \"simian flu\" epidemic that closed the previous film has eliminated all but a small percentage of the human race, and we're introduced to one survivor camp in San Francisco where their continued existence relies on jump-starting a local dam to restore power. Unfortunately, their journey to the dam leads them into the territory of the apes. The apes, led by Caesar (Andy Serkis, returning), have created their own little utopia, evolving into a functional society, and they are rightfully unwilling to trust the seemingly violent humans at first. Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the man in charge of the human expedition, stands in awe of the apes and what they've become, and he believes a truce can be reached that will allow peaceful coexistence and access to the dam. But there are forces working from both sides that won't allow that to happen.I really love this movie. I'm ecstatic that, despite the potential for the usual big budget explosions and battle sequences, DAWN continues to play on a smaller, more personal scale. Yes, we get some awesome action sequences in the second half of the movie but the first half of the movie, where Malcolm and his team are brought into ape society and we see their early interactions, is the best part. Director Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD) and the screenwriters weren't interested in making another generic summer film but telling an engaging story that makes sense in the progression of the franchise. The apes are not yet the reigning species on the planet, but they're getting there. The humans are still around in scattered packets and neither side trusts the other. The apes, particularly Koba (an ape from the first film that experienced the worst of human nature in laboratory experimentation), have lingering mistrust for the proved violent nature of humans; meanwhile, the humans are generally petrified at the concept of an ape that can speak and reason. They're animals\u0085we don't negotiate with \"lesser\" species. The movie plays as a morality tale about xenophobia and our nature to fear things that are different from us, but it tackles it from two angles, showing that the humans aren't the only ones capable of irrational fear and snap judgments of others.Andy Serkis is an experienced motion capture actor but I really think DAWN is the ultimate example as to how talented the man is. Caesar is his best character yet. The technology has advanced to a point where Caesar is so convincing that I was never once pulled out of the movie at the sight of him. Immersed in the film, I never doubted that I was watching a \"living, breathing, thinking\" ape. And his actual performance was fantastic, imbuing the character with emotion and earning the audience's sympathy. Really, all of the apes were done to perfection. Maurice the orangutan (Karin Konoval) never utters a word and yet is still a well-built, three-dimensional character. It was a bold move for Reeves to utilize characters in a major action film that rely for large parts of the film on non-verbal communication in a world where the thought of subtitles will scare off segments of the target audience. But Reeves created a summer movie that aims to be more than the average, striving to tell an interesting story populated with strong characters that just so happens to include talking apes who can ride horses and (poorly) use firearms. I really enjoy this movie and I'm excited to see how well the series has done so far, and I hope they manage to keep the same momentum in the inevitable continuation. The film ends at a key moment in human/ape relations and telegraphs what the next installment will entail. As long as the franchise is handled with the same care and consideration (and especially if Reeves continues on as director), I imagine these movies will be some of the most anticipated (for myself, anyway) movies in the years to come.",

            "content": "Continuing from 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes, now after ten years of the simian flu virus spread and killed off nine in ten humans, the apes group led by Caesar has nested in the woods near the ruins of San Fransisco while some remaining humans are surviving in the city. Seeking to reach a broken dam for electricity in the apes' grounds, the humans send a group led by Malcolm. They meet the apes with a wrong start. Caesar give the humans a chance at repairing the dam. Koba, one of Caesar's lieutenant, goes to the city and discovers the humans' weapons pile up. He then finds Caesar deciding to let the humans stay to help his sick wife and contested it, resulting in Caesar attacking him. Koba goes back to the city and gets a rifle. The humans finished repairing the dam and power goes back in the city. With the rifle, Koba shoots Caesar at night and framed it on the humans. Thus that night the male apes attack the city and overrun it. In the morning, Malcolm and his family found Caesar dying and took care of him. While getting supplies to handle Caesar in the city Malcom comes across Blue Eyes, Caesar's oldest son, and brings him to Caesar. Blue Eyes then frees the apes loyal to Caesar and they all regroup on Caesar. Caesar faces Koba on a tower, but the humans blow up the tower's base, killing many apes and leaving Koba hanging for his life. Koba asks Caesar for help, reminding him the principle that no ape may kill other ape. But Caesar lets him fall after stating that Koba is no ape. Malcolm then tell Caesar to flee as the humans have contacted the military which will come to war on the apes. Caesar says that the apes had already started a war, and he and Malcolm parted ways.The story is very nice, weaving the focus back and forth between Caesar's and Malcolm's group. I like how the movie starts without any human dialog, focusing only on the apes and stayed like that for some duration and then jumps quickly to the humans without losing any story relevance. At the end, it shows that the humans and the apes are not so very different in the end, they both have differences of arguments and betrayals within their own. The story twists are nice, even though they are very predictable. But the direction and execution on how the movie portrays intelligent apes is nice to watch.The acting is a great work. Andy Serkis and the other cast who play as the apes did a great job in doing the sign languages and the body movements. On the other hand, the relatively newer faces of the human cast can also present us a great set of emotion play. Jason Clarke particularly has gone a long way since acting stiffly as a guard in Death Race (2008).The other thing that is great is the sets, costumes, makeup and visual effects done for this movie. Of course the costumes look very realistic, as well as the makeup, that looks like it took a long time to apply. The visual effects are worthy of praise also because they can handle the resizing of the limb body parts of the cast to suit the real simian anatomy. It's very nice to see the high effort put into it. The sets are also magnificent. The ruined city and the Golden Gate bridge are depicted very nicely with all their remnants that still indicate its former glory.My final say for this movie is a solid 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation to go and see it is another sure thing I give you, although I know that most of you may have already seen it. But this movie is worth seeing again for me. It's a nice entertaining piece of work.",

            "content": "If Rise successfully quoted the original 1968 film and introduced a new take on the Planet of the Apes series, Dawn manages to set things in motion the right way, and is far superior its predecessor. The story is set 10 years after a pandemic apocalypse. A familiar premise to post-apoc films, to be sure, but it isn't zombies that the survivors have to face. It is Caesar's highly organised tribe. The story reminds me once again on almost an \"Animal Farm\" take, with apes behaving quite similarly to humans, because, as Caesar says, apes are similar to humans even though he hoped not. Therefore Caesar, Koba and several others behave very humanly, each having their own motivations for their acts. I like how Rocket's role was further developed after what he was in \"Rise\". Similarly human characters are portrayed without a distinction between good or bad, but more likely between protagonists and antagonists. Dreyfuss' motivations are made quite clear.What is even more surpirising, is that half of the characters appear as Computer Generated Imagery. The photorealism is outstandingly convincing, and the mo-cap actors (with Serkis on the lead) could convey through this technology all their talent as well as the other actors.Generally, I really appreciated photography in this film. Some of the shots where outstanding, and there where a few single-take scenes (which, however, didn't last more than a minute of uncut footage or so). Even if much of what you can see on screen in CG, this is a remarkable achievement.The only weak point was the score. I can recognise clearly when I hear a Giacchino score because his \"emotional scene\" theme is almost the same in every movie or TV Show he scored since Lost, partially probably due to the enormous quantity of work he has to do.This is one of the best post-apoc films of the decade. I strongly hope the conclusion of this first trilogy will be as good as this film was, if not better.",

This sequel is fantastic.Easily my favorite movie of the year,and let me tell you pretty people why.This is more than just a summer blockbuster with probably the best special effects I've ever seen and intensity to the max in it's action.It's a movie that has a LOT to say about stuff going on in our real world.There's heart wrenching drama,beautiful cinematography,and the best motion capture acting ever put on film. Andy Serkis plays Caeser who is probably a new favorite movie character of mine.He plays Caeser to perfection whether it be a touching scene or a scene where he's beating the snot out of someone. He oozes screen presence.Toby Kebbel plays Koba the scarred up scary ape from Rise and his performance was JUST as good as Serkis.The humans in the movie don't bring down the greatness of this movie.I thought Jason Clarke did really good as the lead human but it's the great Gary Oldman who plays my favorite human character.His performance when he's looking through tablet choked me up.The storytelling also makes this movie shine.This movie had me second guessing where it was gonna take things so for people saying this is gonna be like Avatar or Dances with Wolves WRONG! Matt Reeves' direction is superb, my favorite scene in the movie involves Koba and a tank.There's some incredible shots throughout.It almost reminded me of a big budget Walking Dead episode.The musical score is also very good.This is just a perfect all around Summer movie.I give this movie my highest recommendation. 10/10",

            "content": "\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is an improvement upon the first entry in the rebooted franchise, \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" (2011), although the distinctions are about as slight as the difference between their titles, of \"rise\" and \"dawn.\" The CGI is better, the lighting and tone darker, and there's a more compelling balance of the shared humanism of ape and man. Although, granted, members of both species are simply either good or bad, and females get the short shrift--one a mother sick with baby, the other a doctor who lost her child and so helps mother become well with baby. Meanwhile, the males play politics and war, within and between species. There's a focus on the parallel between Cesar and his first born and a counterpart human father and son, which further recalls Cesar's upbringing by James Franco, scientist.The cinematography, although another improvement here, still seems rather rudimentary for a picture featuring largely CGI creatures that can climb and swing through environments. It's too bad the camera doesn't do the same, although there's a so-so tracking shot of the human male hero for one wartime scene. The climactic fight sequence is a let down. As for the opening, retracing the spread of the virus that wipes out most of humanity, it's an admittedly hackneyed sequence that cuts together clips from CNN of real-world disasters, images of well-known politicians like President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg, with fictional reports, but such is the reason I watched this movie now. With the current coronavirus pandemic, such a media montage (science-gone-wrong, super simians aside) doesn't seem so far fetched.",

            "content": "\"Apes together strong!\"A decade has passed since the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes (Rupert Wyatt's 2011 film that successfully rebooted this once beloved franchise from the late 60's) and now we find ourselves in a completely different world. The genetically evolved apes have built a new home in the San Francisco woods and continue to be led by Caesar (Andy Serkis). They communicate through sign language and several can speak. The simian virus that broke out at the end of the first film has practically wiped out the human race and it's been two years since Caesar or any of the apes have seen any human activity. But there are survivors living in the ruins led by a man named Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) and in order to restore power they need to gain access to a nearby hydroelectric dam in ape territory. Caesar's lieutenant, Koba (Toby Kebbell) hates humans and recommends killing them, but Caesar is wise and wants to avoid war. He gives a few men, led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), permission to work on the dam only for a few days, but this short lived time of peace hangs on a very thin thread.Matt Reeves was given the director's chair for this sequel and he doesn't disappoint. It's just as entertaining and smart as Wyatt's Rise. There have been several strong blockbusters that have come out this year and Dawn deserves to be considered among the best. What this film does right is focus on the apes allowing us to sympathize with their cause. Andy Serkis delivers a powerful performance once again and he owns this movie, although I would have to say that Kebbell's Koba is so memorable that he may just be the best villain in a film this year. The humans don't get much attention in this film so of course there is very little character development going on with them. Jason Clarke plays the most sympathetic character and perhaps the only human worth carrying about in this film. I was a bit disappointed that Gary Oldman wasn't given more screen time or a heavier role. Reeves also cast Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee with whom he worked with in Felicity and Let Me In respectively, but they don't have much to work with here either. The true stars of the film are the apes and there is a significant upgrade in the CGI compared to Rise. The apes look and move in an authentic manner. Dawn has everything going for it, great visuals, a fantastic score, a smart script, and some fantastic action scenes. We spend so much time with these advanced apes that by the time we see them riding on horses and carrying machine guns the entire premise seems plausible. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of those rare smart blockbusters where the action and visual aren't the only aspect of a film that has been given some thought. The apes are given personalities and the tension between the two sides is palpable. It isn't just a lame excuse to give us great visuals and cool looking action scenes; it is much more complex than that, and by doing so it creates much more tension. We are entertained just as much as we are forced to think. They have managed to turn a franchise I really didn't care for at first into an engaging and gripping one without ceasing to entertain the audience. When you spend some time creating believable and complex characters and combine them with cool looking action scenes you have the recipe for a successful movie that will leave audiences entertained and engaged at the same time. Their eyes won't be the only thing that are blown away, but their minds as well. And that is what Reeves and his team have managed to do with this franchise. It is sort of a Shakespearean drama combined with fantastic action scenes that are shot really well (there is a rotating shot from the point of view of a tank that was spectacular). I had a great time and I'm sure most audiences will as well.",

Three, years after Rupert Wyatt brought the 'Ape' franchise back to life, Matt Reeves continues the saga with a stunningly inventive and thrilling sequel.'Dawn' follows a middle-aged Caesar (Andy Serkis) as he leads over his group of genetically-evolved apes and while also assuming responsibilities as a father to his son, ten years after human civilization is crushed by an annihilating virus.Probably the best budgeted movie I've seen this summer, 'Dawn' is simply epic in every sense. It has a brilliant script to match its equally epic visuals, topped by its magnificent use of the motion capture technology. Through it, Andy Serkis' Caesar, singularly shines as the most significant element of this movie. It'stunning to witness the apes' emotions being captured like they are actually humans, and it's even amazing to realize than even without the presence of actual humans, the story can still work and be intriguing and compelling enough on its own. Along Cesar, he is accompanied by equally effective ape characters including Koba (Toby Kebbell), an revengeful warrior whose hunger to retaliate against humans is heightened by Caesar's seemingly revitalized bond with them, and Cornelia (Judy Greer), Caesar's wife. They are joined by human characters led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), who works to create a strong bond with the ape and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), the resistant human leader.It's really refreshing to see a film such big budgeted as this one be sensibly and intelligently written and executed while still making its spectacular visual matter.

Greedy cash-ins are all too familiar, where rather than stepping further into the world established by the predecessor and exploring unlimited opportunities in character and themes, they just add more antagonists, more action and more noise. It can also be worrying when the original director who helped see a great film through till the end is replaced in the next film. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a refreshing and involving take on an old franchise and director Rupert Wyatt set up such promise for its sequel. Matt Reeves takes over the reins here on Dawn...and thankfully has taking the film to a rare, brilliant new level.The film is set ten years after the first film. The ALZ-113 virus has continued to evolve Apes. Led by Caesar, they have made their home in the woods and bred. On the other side of the island (and the world), humans are scarce. The virus has had the opposite effect and spread, killing billions. Those thousands we do see remaining are struggling to survive. When an unfortunate situation occurs between the two sides, war is imminent. But not all humans and Apes agree with the potentially devastating results.Whereas Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a stripped back study of the science at the core of the story, whilst investing us in the human drama, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes throws us head first into a very different world. The scope is immense and multi-layered. At one view, it's a dead, frightening post-apocalyptic world. At another, it's brisk, dynamic and visually arresting. Matt Reeves has such a masterful handle on every string and creates brooding scope, claustrophobic tension and powerful action sequences; all amongst a basic, but incredibly rich morality play which is raw and powerfully spoken. What is most fantastic about the character approach is nothing is clear cut. Good vs. Bad meet in the middle and spirals out to both sides. I could sit here and blabber about the complete awe I had of the major step up in visual effects of the Apes, but that's not what caught my attention. Right from the opening scene of an extreme close-up of Caesars eyes, I felt the characters. The performances from all stunt men and actors bringing life to these apes transcend the visual brilliance. It is collective. It is immersive. It is terrifying. Andy Serkis delivers one of his most satisfying performances to date. His dedication and his understanding of every thread and fiber of Caesars being are in every frame of this film. And I cannot forget to mention the all-out, aggressive performance from Toby Kebbell as Koba. He breaks the barrier of something quite terrifying and strong.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes transcends the Hollywood blockbuster. Not only does it deliver that rare sequel explores its world and characters further, but it's also richly told, beautifully and hauntingly portrayed and truly exciting and terrifying in equal measures. Quite possibly one of the best films of 2014.",

Last night I saw it on a rented library DVD and I was absolutely amazed!Let me explain where I'm coming from. I saw the original PLANET OF THE APES on television as a 10 year old in 1973. I waited months to see each sequel as it came on TV. The apes and their world were the center of my childhood. I am an old school Apes purist and I loved the culture, philosophy and political commentary of the original films so much that I truly dreaded the new series. But this time around, they got it right. From the first few minutes I was mesmerized by the intensity of the apes, the beauty of the scenery and set design, the power and simplicity of the dialogue, even when (especially when) it was mostly delivered in sign language. From a purist's point of view, DAWN is not so much a sequel to RISE as a brilliant re-imagining of the fifth and final film in the original series, BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES. The plot is basically identical. Having won equality and a new start, Caesar attempts to create a simple, rural civilization where humans and apes can peacefully coexist. But when an evil ape consumed by race hatred (species hatred) decides to take the law into his own hands, both Caesar's life and his family's future is at stake. The thing that impressed me so deeply is that the same plot was far more powerful and dramatic the second time around. The characters are more nuanced, and the performances more tragic. General Aldo, the gorilla bully in BATTLE, plays much the same role as Koba in DAWN. But the two characters are so different. Aldo was a big, dumb bruiser, and nothing more. He was a bully, and he saw himself as superior to humans. Basically he came across like the mean, redneck sheriff in a Burt Reynolds movie. Koba, with his scars, his blinded eye, and his horrible memories of life as a lab specimen, is a far more tragic figure. His sly, Machiavellian cunning and his utter lack of remorse remind me of Shakespeare's classic villains. Watch the scene where he infiltrates the human settlement and gets two redneck survivors to lower their weapons with fatal results. The ease with which the embittered, scarred ape becomes a clowning, playful monkey (just for as long as it takes to get his hands on a gun) literally sent shivers down my spine. This level of subtlety and the darkness it evokes is reminiscent of Herman Melville's work in stories like BENITO CERENO. Everyone remembers Andy Serkis as Caesar, but I think Toby Kebbell's performance as Koba was just as remarkable. And though many other reviewers have surely mentioned it, I was struck by the fact that the name Koba was used quite intentionally by the film makers. Koba was Joseph Stalin's first alias when he was a young revolutionary in Czarist Russia!The first hour of the movie is absolutely riveting. Only the final half of the movie drags, a little bit, because the film makers couldn't resist the big battle scene with the machine guns and the explosions. Frankly, my impression was that Koba would have overcome the human colony without even needing a battle. He was that clever, and that chilling. But I want to say that as brilliant as the ape performances were, the humans, particularly Gary Oldman as the corrupt colony leader and Keri Russell as the caring human doctor, were solid and convincing as well. This movie was a wonderful surprise. It has restored my faith in the Planet of the Apes as both a sub culture and a way of life.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. There is a ape in every human and there is a human in every ape. This line describes the whole idea behind consistently engaging and imaginative sequel to the well respected Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Taking a jump of 10 years from the last movie, dawn is about the survival of the fittest among apes and humans. Caesar, the amazing creation of combination of acting skills of Andy Serkis and new age motion capture technology is the heart of the story. He leads, and bleeds for the apes. Apes have become almost human. They have families, the conflicts, the trust issues with humans and the rules to govern their wild colony. These tiny details make Dawn a unique piece of cinema. All jungle scenes are done so well that they make real footage of National Geographic seem ordinary. All apes and humans characters make you root for them even the evil ones. Caesar's elder son's emotional journey is soothing and his younger's son's first encounter with humans is heart warming. At the same time, ape Koba's encounter with two humans guarding the weapons and his ever rising conflict with Caesar is chilling.For nitpicking, apes riding horses seems somewhat hard to believe and 3D does not add any value in the story telling apart from the massive destruction scene in the climax. Running for more than 2 hours, dawn is a high voltage action and fiction drama that leaves you amazed. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. It is the most sure footed blockbuster of Hollywood this year so far. Don't miss it!",

            "content": "I would not call myself a huge Planet of the Apes fan. The first film is a classic, the rest of the original movies are average at best, and Tim Burton's film was a passable popcorn flick. However, it wasn't until 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes that my interest in the series really ignited. The film had an excellent story to tell about how an experimental Alzheimer's drug could lead to world takeover by super-intelligent apes. It was suspenseful, exciting, and a real thrill to watch. Plus, it had some great performances from James Franco, John Lithgow, and Andy Serkis as Caesar, the leader of the Apes. Rise was one of my favorite films of the year, and when I found out a sequel would be coming out, I was understandably excited. I awaited a bigger, more action-packed movie than Rise that would hopefully give me more of what I loved about its predecessor. Much to my chagrin, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes carries over none of the freshness or charm of Rise. Dawn is a fatally pompous, self-important, and generic slog through an uninspired planet of the apes.The movie is a post-apocalyptic story told both from the human and ape point-of-view. The apes do have a somewhat interesting story; particularly a dramatic betrayal between two ape leaders, Caesar, motion captured by Andy Serkis and the scarred bonobo Koba (Toby Kebbell). The human actors manage to convincingly pretend to be talking animals, but I fail to find anything really special in these motion capture performances. On the other side of the story are the human characters, and let's just get to the point, they have nothing remotely interesting to do, and not one of them is at all interesting as a character. Gary Oldman acts the Hell out of every scene he's in, but even his scenery-gnawing presence can't save the humans in this movie from feeling utterly dull and pointless. The post-apocalyptic story is as generic as it gets, pitting a band of survivors against the odds in a struggle to get power to the city. It is the type of broad \"post-apocalyptic\" story that seems like it was lifted straight from an episode of The Walking Dead. You would think there would be more imagination and ideas for a future where apes rule the world, but there is no such thing here. It is the same dilapidated cityscape and band of survivors schtick we see in every cheap zombie apocalypse movie/show nowadays. Thankfully, the apes take center stage, and while their story is more interesting than the humans', the seriousness of the whole thing is often laughable. It is basically Hamlet in digital monkey costumes. A lot has been said about the \"performances\" of Serkis and Kebbell, and yes, the digital makeup looks convincing. They move like apes, they talk like apes might talk, but what else can you say of what the actors bring? Grunting out dramatic dialogue with a stern look on your face is not what makes a good performance. Unfortunately, it seems it's enough to fool audiences into thinking it is. Watching Serkis and Kebbell, I couldn't help but feel like I was being presented an effect; like the actors were trying to show me how much they could act under the digital makeup. Even with cutting edge special effects and big action set pieces, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was a crushing disappointment for me. The film had potential to takes us further into the ape-dominated world set up in Rise. Instead, the film coasts on the well-worn post-apocalyptic formula. Anything remotely interesting in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is killed by the frustratingly pretentious tone. The tone of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is relentlessly dark. Darkness is not a sin in itself, but director Matt Reeves lathers the drama and grittiness on so much that he forgets to entertain. Instead of simply taking the story seriously, the film takes itself seriously. Here is a group of people (Reeves, Serkis, etc.) who \"know\" that the movie they are making is an important Hollywood milestone. That is never good.That is the problem with the movie. It thinks it is a significant, world-changing drama about the nature of man, when in fact it is not. It's a glorified Last of Us ripoff, masquerading as a Shakespearian tragedy. The tone never wavers from the absolute dead serious. It's a shame because I loved the balance in tone that the Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes had. It was dark and scary, but it had real heart and the action was actually fun. I might not be the biggest apes fan, but what appeals to me about the series is its imagination, satire, and thrills, not wannabe high-brow crap like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.22/100",

So this Is a sequel and an eighth movie. I expected that it would feel a bit stretching, but it isn't. In fact, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes' main purpose Is to show another side of these super apes and to set up the story for the next film in the franchise. This isn't just about fighting; in fact, fighting scenes, even though they are epic, take very little part of the film. There is romance within humans and apes families, sometimes, the apes can act funny. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time! Also it has a story line no one expects! The original Planet of the Apes book is about humans that went to a planet ruled by apes. When they come back to Earth, the same thing happened to our planet. The reboots, (Dawn of The Planet of The Apes and Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are pretty much prequels. So, Caesar leaves civilization with his ape friends while the human race almost goes extinct due to a deadly virus. The remaining humans struggle for power. Will they be able to find a new source of power or will it be up to the apes and their leader to decide the humans' fate? For me, this is a fantastic addition to the series. They don't try too hard to make it too action-packed and cool looking. The apes look extremely realistic and I really like that. They include some scenes from Rise of the Planet of the Apes which helps to pull it all together nicely. The action and fighting even has some stuff from the original 1963 Planet of the Apes book! The director made it a perfect length and, in fact, this is the first time I've seen what I would call a \"trailer\" movie (a movie that looks like an hour-long trailer for the next one in the series) that is entertaining and includes a surprise ending. My favorite scene is when we see a small group of humans working on the power station. When they wake up, the youngest is sitting with an ape that acts as a teacher to young apes and is very loyal to Caesar. The kid gives him a book and reads along with him. It shows how well they actually understand each other and how alike humans and apes are. It shows friendship and how two creatures of different species can be friends. This film has some violence and intensity so I recommend it for ages 11 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars for fantastic graphics, a well planned story, excellent cinematography and stupendous acting. Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Overall the movie was just spectacular. My advice: don't expect anything when you go into this film. It is without a doubt the best entry in the planet of the apes franchise. Another thing about the special effects in the film, in Rise of the Planet of The Apes although that film had great special effects, there were some parts that you could tell were CGI while in Dawn, you couldn't tell if it was motion capture or CGI puppets. You literally feel like you are looking at apes. Anyways, the story is great, it had some awesome action, this film didn't disappoint me at all. So I will say that Dawn of The Planet of the Apes gets: 10/10 stars",

So a story of 4 hours is cut to reach the usual standard time. Storyline defects: 1) events happen too fast, it's not natural; 2) events happen but they are not contextualized compared to the plot (example: 2 humans are in a military repository to test arms forwarded by human chief they are killed by an ape there is no consequence... these 2 men disappear from the story; another example: main human characters escape from apes citadel in the night leaded by some apes after Caesar fall, they are searching for Caesar in the morning (what happened between these 2 facts?). Another question concerns with logic: apes can infiltrate easily into human fortress as dark knight, but then they attack human enemies in front of from the ground(illogical: apes can infiltrate and attack on trees or palaces directly as shown). Movie lacks also of explanation about human fortress and apes citadel origin and description of them. Some scenes are ridiculous as human assemblage to celebrate energy since afternoon to night (the same scene in the same place all the time) till apes arrival. The movie appears to be fragmented and or cut from an event to another event sometime very dumb as if it has been made by a child. director inability? Hollywood poor standards!? Or both. I don't know exactly... what I know is that potentiality has been completely ruined. Man of steel falls almost in the same defect: too many events summarized in 2 hours.

I consider it one of the best sequels I've ever seen. Not since X-Men: Days of Future Past have I seen a sequel this great. The franchise has had a new lease of life breathed into it ever since the 2011 reboot and this film certainly follows on with that.Picking up 10 years after the events of the first film, human civilisation has collapsed due to the ALZ-113 virus that had been released on the world previously. The intelligent ape Caesar (Andy Serkis), now middle-aged, rules a new generation of apes along with his son River and his vicious lieutenant Koba in a relatively peaceful society. However, a small group of human survivors of the virus soon threaten the ape society with their violent ways and their use of guns. As a result, a battle for the dominant species of Earth eventually erupts.Andy Serkis' performance as Caesar was once again fantastic. I feel he deserves some kind of honorary award for his work in this film. The other apes were all very convincing as well. The film also serves as a commentary on misuse of guns and other firearms, as the humans are constantly using them against the apes to assert their dominance over them. When the apes start to learn how to use them, the tables seem to be turned.I rate \"Dawn\" a 9/10 and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed \"Rise\" and the \"Apes\" franchise in general (except for the 2001 remake).",

Caesar is such a great character and if Andy Serkis wasn't the actor behind him it wouldn't be even close to being as good.What really improved from the first film was the use of human characters. They were far more interesting this time around than in the first film. We get to see this conflict between them as they debate how they want to handle the apes. It is very clearly a message to racism and other forms of bigotry, which lifts this film to a whole other level. I have one gripe and that is a character named Carver played by Kirk Acevedo. He is very unnaturally woven into the story as a character that has zero redeeming qualities. He is there to make the audience mad and that is his only purpose. But outside of him the rest of the human characters are excellent.This film is incredible and that is because of the fantastic direction from Matt Reeves and the phenomenal performance from Andy Serkis.9.5/10\nA+",

I read the books of the films when I could get them (you couldn't just pick up a movie back then. There was no video available). I avidly watched the TV show and I bought merchandise. I was besotted and have remained so. Maybe this has something to do with why nothing since has quite come close.Let's get the good stuff out of the way. The animation /CGI of the apes is phenomenal. They look real. The idea that humans had almost been annihilated by a deadly flu is a great plot device and better than the reason given in the original films (a plague killed cats and dogs so we brought apes in to replace them as pets and then to be servants). That's it. After that it's all down hill.The story is riddled with holes and left me asking why, why, why throughout the film and long after it had ended. Forgive me but I have to get them off my chest.This is 10 years since Rise and no humans have been seen for 2 years but there is a huge city just over the bridge. It's so close you can see it when the generator turns on the power and the lights come on. Hang on, they already had power anyway so the lights would already have been visible.The humans come to find the dam because they only have 2 weeks power left. Hey, great forward planning people.The man they bring who is the only person who knows about water power is a dick, such a badly drawn character but they need him. Then they dump him and get the power station working. Err how? Why do apes hunt stag? Why do they kill a bear after the way they have been treated? Don't they appreciate letting wild animals live in the wild? Why do the apes ride horses? Are these the naturally wild horses normally found in forests? Why does Caesar's son, Blue Eyes, side with Kobo the bonobo? When Kobo and his mates get the guns they have no problem in loading them and shooting them. Kobo is such a good shot he hits Caesar easily.When Blue Eye's goes to Caesar's house they all speak to him in English. When did he learn this? Caesar plops out the odd word now and again but surely he normally talks ape talk and sign language.After 10 years the camcorder still has battery life and works. It wasn't looted or smashed.Gary Oldman's character has no motivation for wanting a war.The humans have a \"Tower\" that strangely seems to be all scaffolding. Ideal if you're a bunch of monkeys and want a fight.Oldman set C4 around the tower - just above his own head. Erm that might just kill you when you detonate it. It did but it didn't kill our boring human hero who was standing there at the time.Caesar's other half, Cornelia, is very ill and needs antibiotics. She gets them and feels as right as rain by the end of the same day.Caesar after being shot is really weak from blood loss. Never mind. Give him 2 days and he will fight like he's on meth against Kobo Bonobo.There was more. So much more.On top of that it's too dark and too long.",

Apes against the humans and humans against the apes etc. it starts off with how the apes have been surviving up in the woods all these years. How they eat, hunt, how they are slowly starting to learn English and how they have developed their own way of speaking. It impressive, to say the least. You feel like these apes are real apes, and you feel for them every step of the way.It has been years since the humans have made any sort of contact with the apes and coming and touring their home. Caesar (played again by Andy Serkis) has started in his own family. His son and his new baby (which is just breathtaking to see the new baby being born) and all the apes have their own families and been working dang hard at surviving. One day, however, humans come along (lead by Aussie actor Jason Clarke) and they need to get into the mines to generate power into the city, for in the city they are losing power and need to get some power ASAP. Unfortunately it does not make it easy considering the fact that the mines are right where the apes have been living all this time. There is conflict between the apes and humans, but they start to begin to trust each other. Except one particular ape named Koba (played by Toby Kebbell) has hated humans from day one. He does not trust them. Koba had been tortured and almost skinned alive by the humans until Caesar freed him. Koba makes travels nonstop to the city and notices all the humans are keeping heavy armed guns and the main person in charge named Dreyfus (played by Gary Oldman) is not at all worried for killing all the apes if he has to. Trust begins to crumble and relationships are getting worse. The slowness of the battle begins to take its course.All in all, it was a fantastic flick and I would watch it again and again, and I hope it goes down in the history of Cinema as been the best film of 2014. Great effects, beautiful shots, fantastic acting (espeicially played by Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell. My only complaint is the human characters ever get a chance to show their side of the story. They had so much emotional stuff to tell, but in the end, it never went deep enough. The main focus was on the apes (maybe not a bad thing) and I think this film should have developed more on the humans. But, excluding that, this film is just breathtaking. An excellent example of what can happen to you when you love, hate and trust somebody. I highly recommend it. 9/10.",

The lead actor was dull, and why was Oldman cast as a military commander with his squeaky voice - it actually broke like a teenager's when he was giving commands.So much of it was predictable, and you just knew it was going to end with a punch up. Almost gave up half way through.I really don't want to say much more. Totally inferior to Rise and a great disappointment.ps. Just watched this for a second time, but it seems to be a different edit, much longer, with less of Oldman. Much better movie - 8/10.",

To make me understand that a chimp has a choice between being mean or choosing not to be aggressive? Like the US army in Guantanamo decided not to apply torture to terrorists? Or was the movie about to entertain people about monkeys shooting guns? I must be out of trend, what's up with the monkeys nowadays ? This film felt just like a double big Mac. Seems to hide some interesting development, yet it lets you totally on your hunger, less a $10 bucks. The difference is that a big Mac hurts your stomach, while this chimpo movie did hurt my mind for over 2 hours.To resume, this flick is useless.

Not so fast.Having been a fan since the original, I really want to see these new releases succeed. Even when they fall short, I would rarely take the time to write a negative review. Unfortunately this is so bad AND the hype surrounding the film has been so outrageous and misleading.... I really feel compelled to add my two cents.Most importantly to me, this film is just plain boring. Other reviewers have been gushing over the special effects and I'll admit the CGI is moderately interesting. I did think about the technical details... for about a minute. The film cannot stand up purely on the special effects. There is no amount of computer processing power can save this storyline. CGI cannot add depth to cardboard characters or make them appealing.So why are people buying tickets and giving this film such good reviews? I really wish I knew. I'll just add it to the list of movies whose success doesn't make any sense to me. Some films just get lucky I guess. Like Zero Dark Thirty.",

The humans need to take control of the dam near the ape's village to secure power for their city, which leads to both friendly and hostile relations. Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell lead the human cast.This film's on par with the previous one, so if you liked that one you'll like this one too. The CGI is both good and yet cartoony. Strangely, the CGI in \"Jurassic Park\" was better, and that was 21 years ago! But, hey, they're better that the FX on Syfy and you get used to 'em after the first act.The forest cinematography is awesome, but the story is only mildly compelling. The characters are okay, but bland and the plot fairly predictable. For instance, when Keri' Russell's character goes to the ape village you know exactly what she's going to do; and when Caesar spares a fellow ape you know exactly what that ape's going to do. Overall, I was expecting better, but it's a decent addition to the apes saga and ranks about the 4th or 5th best in the entire series.The film runs 130 minutes and was shot at Golden Ears Provincial Park, Campbell River & Vancouver, British Columbia with beauty shots of San Francisco.GRADE: B-",

Not only was this movie too long, but it bored me, and I was more confused than before.*** spoilers *** I was hoping for a resolution or at least some hint at whatever happened to the astronauts launched into space in PotA I, but nothing here on that track. The original PotA(1968) starts off with astronauts landing on some unknown (to them at the time) planet; however, thus far we've gotten no suspense as to what they'll encounter when (and if) they land somewhere in this re-boot. We get a back-story from part I as to how humans became dumb and apes smart; in part II we get... exactly what I have no idea.Apes living in what appears to be a village, having no contact with humans. Humans live in some run-down city (San Fran), are running out of fuel, they need to re-start the dam to get electric power going. Ifcourse, the dam just happens to be within ape territory. Shenanigans and all sorts of shoot 'em ups ensue.Now, yes, the CGI and ape movements are much more realistc than in PotA '68, and perhaps even in 2001 '68. But, we again get ape vs. humans fight scenes, an evil doer who challenges his leader, etc.I am beginning to think that the PotA reboot of 2001 made more sense, for those who cared to think about the cause-effect time-lines loop. At least it did have a time traveling astronaut who was confused as to where he was and what was going on.Since other humans were contacted, is a bigger army of humans supposed to come to the rescue? I sure hope PotA III will address these questions.",

            "content": "This film has me thinking about it three whole hours after leaving the theater and that's after the 2nd viewing! First and foremost, the visuals. As expected, the film is stunning, but unlike most CGI heavy films of late, this one uses CGI the way it should be used, and that is mixed in with real, detailed sets and real locales. The creative team behind the Lord of the Rings films had a hand in this film and it shows. The apes are light years beyond what they looked like in Rise and I can't believe how much technology improved in three years. Never have so many mo-capped actors appeared on the screen at the same time, and not against blue-screen, but real, detailed sets, riding real horses and holding real weapons. It was mind-blowing.Ground breaking visuals aside, I thought the script was solid. Like the first film, it was a character drama that focuses on themes such as Loyalty, (or a lack thereof) Jealousy, Pride, Greed, and most of all, our savage nature. In the film Caesar says-- \"We apes are no less violent than humans\" and what that translates to is that we are no less violent than apes\" Matt Reeves did an great job with the direction of this film in that it has its own unique flair to it. He really gave it a Kubrick stamp. The pacing was okay, and he excels at using depth of field photography.. Some of the scenes were hauntingly beautiful to look at. However, I am left hoping for a directors cut in the future because the beginning felt rushed. I like my drama to build up slowly and this film cut right to the chase--which isn't what I wanted. I also thought some of the philosophy of this film differed from what the original Apes films spoke about--which was--humans are destructive, and so is their technology. All humans should be treated like the animals that they are. In Dawn, Caesar isn't as cynical as he was in the first film and it makes me wonder if his legacy will hold in the future apes films, when the ape eventually take Earth and view the humans as devilish animals. Overall, Dawn is bigger and better, and the soundtrack by the great Michael Giaccino was absolutely brilliant. It was perfect for this film. If a CG character is ever going to win an Oscar for best actor, it has to be Andy Serkis for his role as Caesar, the primate king!I'd go as far as considering this a masterpiece, but it felt more like a 2nd act rather than a film with a beginning, middle and an end. There was a bit of a cliffhanger in there, but it didn't totally leave me hanging in the end because the character driven elements were satisfying, but the entire plot as a whole will continue into the next film.

            "content": "\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is a great and successful sequel to it's 2011 predecessor and reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise, \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" and it is one of the best movies of the 2014 summer season! The film is just phenomenal. There is more to this movie than just a summer movie that was critically acclaimed by critics and audiences.This is the eighth theatrical film in the franchise, overall. The critics and audiences praised this film for it's visual effects, story, direction, music, acting and it's focus on emotional depth. I will get into the story of the film first before I get into the other stuff that I like about this movie.The film is set ten years after \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\", this film establishes that a virus called the \"Simian Flu\" that increased the intelligence of the apes has killed most of the human race. Our main protagonist, Caesar struggles to maintain peace as his ape community is drawn into an all-out war with nearby human survivors. The plot is easy to follow, it may take a couple of re-watches to know what is going on, but to me, the plot was simply well-written and I give credit to Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver, who wrote a very great script and story that is just one of the greatest film stories ever created.Now, I get to the other stuff. The first thing I start off with is the concept of the film. A lot of people has said that this film is like The Empire Strikes Back of the Planet of the Apes films and that is exactly what it feels like. A lot critics have liked the combination of an engaging script with impressive special effects and this movie does not fail at all. Story: 8.9 / 10.I move on to the special effects. I love the CGI and motion-capture for the apes in this film as much as I thought I would like and from my point of view, the visual effects company who did this film's work also did the effects for the Lord of the Rings, as well as Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of the 1933 film, King Kong. The visual effects are just impressive.The music by Michael Giacchino, is very amazing and with the choir and orchestra, it feels like an actual Planet of the Apes musical score. A lot of critics really liked the musical score. Me, I definitely like it when I hear a choir in a film's musical score, such as The Polar Express, the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars prequel trilogies as well as The Dark Knight Trilogy. The music is just amazing.The direction by Matt Reeves is just amazing. I have seen his other movie, Cloverfield, which is produced by J.J. Abrams and it is simply amazing, but this film, he really had a lot to prove and it shows because it does not feel like it's a very long movie. The film is as long as it needs to be -- 2 hours and 10 minutes -- is just all I need for this kind of movie. His way of directing the action scenes are great and when stuff goes down in this movie, stuff is going down. I'm talking a big battle with the humans going against the apes and everything, but the best fight scene was at the end when Caesar and the main antagonist, Koba has this one heck of a fight, in which Koba begs for his life, saying \"Apes does not kill apes\" and Caesar tells him, \"You are not ape\" and lets him fall to his death. That part was disturbing for me, but it was also action-packed. The emotional scenes are what really got me to like this movie, along with the action, but the emotional depth that this movie focuses on is really amazing to see.Now, I move on to the final thing that I will mention and that is the acting. Caesar is played once again by Andy Serkis and his performance was so great that I was actually happy to see him in this part again. He blew me away as Gollum and he blew me away even more as the title character, King Kong. I felt that he should have won an Academy Award for his performance capture acting.Toby Kebbell plays the villainous Koba and he is just great, there are moments where he scares you but he works nicely. Judy Greer plays Cornelia and she is great. Nick Thurston plays Blue Eyes and he is great also and Karin Konoval plays Maurice and he is good as well.Now, I move on to the human characters: Jason Clarke, plays Malcolm and he does a really great job in his performance. Gary Oldman plays the role of Dreyfus and he makes a good character work, especially when Oldman played Jim Gordon and Sirius Black, those performances were great. Keri Russell plays Ellie, Malcolm's wife and she does a really amazing job and Kodi-Smit McPhee plays their son, which I am surprised to see him in this film.Overall, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is just a well-made that I think needs to be seen by everyone, not just kids, but family members and film students as well. Also, for kids, who would like to make movies one day, like I do, this is a movie that you should see. If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, let them watch it and see what effect it has on them. This is movie worth buying on DVD and also watching on TV, because this movie is spectacular, remarkable, majestic, amazing, emotional and breathtaking. My rating is a 10 out of 10.",

Tim Burton had already tried - and largely failed - to recreate Planet Of The Apes in 2001, with a film high on visuals but low on most other things. So when it was all tried again - this time from the beginning - in 2011's Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, expectations were not high. How wrong we all were. It was an intelligent, chilling, engaging triumph - most of all in Andy Serkis' brilliant motion-capture performance of lead-ape Ceasar; but there was more. The human interest story worked; the performances worked throughout the story had a brilliant momentum. It was, at times, genuinely disturbing; and it never forgot to entertain or amuse.Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes picks up right where the previous film left-off; a credits sequence portrayal of the spread of the simian flu virus setting us up for an advanced colony of apes outside of San Francisco and a decimated, bruised and battered humanity struggling in vain to make some kind of life for itself. From there human and apes come into contact, and conflict builds: between ape and human, ape and ape, human and human. Andy Serkis is back again, with a wider supporting cast of motion-capture performances. His colleagues are good - he remains utterly outstanding, and long overdue major award recognition. It's a performance provoking awe, fear and joy in equal measure and is a masterclass of its type.In a blockbuster season which again sees Michael Bay return to milk the Transformers cash machine with all attendant hype, cynicism and disregard for the viewer, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes represents everything the big blockbuster could and should be. Thrilling, intelligent, artful, entertaining - and not overlong. It's a worthy sequel; not a perfect one. Like the predecessor, the script has weaknesses. Occasionally the inter-human interplay is somewhat forced. Other than that, it's as it should be, and all the better for it. Entertainment with heart, guts and a soul.",

The CGI while very detailed, fluid and spectacular, is also glaringly unnatural, and distracting.The human mission is also very technically flawed. With enormous systems which would require constant supervision and maintenance are simply treated like a light switch to be flipped on and never need to revisited. Lame dialog \"this relay is bad go get another one.\" to some kid who grew up in an apocalyptic wasteland, who would have no idea what a relay was not to mention the specific type of relay, as well as they are in a dilapidated facility with what appears to be no maintenance parts or anything else to conduct repairs with.While I get that the apes are advanced and not to be confused with real wild apes, I can give some leniency for sci-fi. But they are apes, not aliens, I am reasonably familiar with apes and their limitations especially from what has been demonstrated in the previous movies. They overreach their technical as well as physical ability, very quickly. The basic parallels between the mentality of the humans and apes is reasonably clever and thoughtful but a bit slow and near the end down right heavy handed.Here's the spoiler. Once the apes capture many guns from the humans the movie goes down hill fast. The apes who have no familiarity with guns other than being shot by them, are now able to fire 2 assault rifles simultaneously in each hand while on horseback in a full gallop and actually hit targets other than than themselves or the horses the're riding on?!?! The complexity of loading a magazine with the correct ammunition, then chambering, switching the safety, aiming, trigger control, loud sound tolerance, etc, is completely dismissed. This is why soldiers basic training with a rifle is 8 weeks long (granted not all 8 weeks are rifle training) and the rifle is anatomically designed to be fired by a human not an ape. But you get the point, an ape no matter how smart wouldn't be able to simply pick up a rifle and do much more with it than use it as a club.I've seen worse for sure, but this movie is highly overrated, if you are sensitive to technical flaws like I am this movie will frustrate more than entertain.",

The original from 1968 remains a classic to this day and has spawned four sequels, a television series and a failed re-boot in 2001. It was a surprise then that 20th Century Fox announced in 2010 that they would re-booting the series and Rise of the Planet of the Apes \u2013 an origin story - was released the following year with spectacular results and a sequel was green-lit almost instantly. It has taken three years for the sequel to hit the screens and whilst it doesn't hit the heights of Rise, it is a worthy sequel. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (DOTPOTA) is set ten years after Rise as the clever introduction shows how quickly the ALZ112 virus (or Simian flu - briefly featured at the end of Rise) has spread around the world, wiping out of most of humanity. Caesar (the super intelligent ape from Rise) and his fellow apes live peacefully in the forests surrounding San Francisco, happy in the knowledge they are alone without mankind's interference. But their peace is soon interrupted by a small group of immune and desperate humans led by Malcolm (played by Aussie actor Jason Clarke) who are looking to re-establish civilisation by re-starting a dam which will give humans power for the first time in years. Startled by the apes' ability to speak, Malcolm and Caesar form a grudging truce and agree to work with each other for the good of both parties. Caesar is well aware that humans will bring force if he does not agree to assist. But tension, not just between the two species but also amongst the two groups threatens the peace and it isn't long before all hell breaks loose. The key to this whole movie working is believing that the apes are real and fleshed out characters. Not only are the visual effects incredible \u2013 within ten minutes you have forgotten you aren't looking at real apes \u2013 the actors behind the apes perform wonders too. Andy Serkis (responsible for the game-changing Gollum in Lord of the Rings) is behind Caesar and he has given him a complex and believable personality \u2013 fierce leader, family ape and a warrior protective of his territory \u2013 clearly the hours of studying apes has paid off immensely. Caesar's fellow ape Koba is also a stand out and the token bad ape who threatens to run riot. Such is their quality you can almost sympathise with them. The two human leads \u2013 Clarke along with Keri Russell are both on good form and are well supported by Gary Oldman amongst others. On the downside DOTPOTA is quite slow \u2013 building tension is admirable but it overstays its welcome slightly. Plot-wise it is fairly predictable and offers no real surprises or twists but that is a minor gripe of Summer Hollywood Blockbuster whose purpose is to entertain \u2013 and entertain it does \u2013 Hail Caesar!",

Clever casting and descriptive storytelling has helped turn the franchise into a smashing success. Just as James Franco delivered in 'Rise,' Gary Oldman and Jason Clarke did here in 'Dawn.' Also, and I was floored by this, Andy Serkis, playing a cgi ape, was brilliant. Ceasar is the defining character of the series, and Serkis has portrayed him beautifully. Everything that is Ceasar from the dominant body posture, to the startlingly authoritative voice is all perfectly on display thanks to the flawless work of Serkis. The fact that an ape, Ceasar, is by far the most complicated and intriguing character in the movie is no accident. Clearly the movie makers are sending a message, but more on that later. Ceasar is the ultimate leader prototype. He is wise, powerful, caring, and most importantly he is open to new ideas. Ceasar learns apes are not necessarily better than humans, nor are humans better than apes. There is good and bad in both. In the climactic scene *SPOILER ALERT* Ceasar says to Koba, \"you are not (an) ape.\" If given a little thought, on realizes that this is an astoundingly profound statement coming from an ape. *END SPOILER* Ceasar is alluding to the idea of what it means to be humane, which can apply to both humans and apes. Some humans commit horrible atrocities that we consider inhumane, suggesting that these individuals are different and perhaps not human. The same could be said about certain apes\u2014perhaps they are not worthy of being regarded as apes. While Ceasar towers above the rest, plenty of other characters were worth analyzing: Dryefus (Oldman), Malcolm (Clarke), and Koba (Kebbell). They, along with Ceasar, were all faced with the same dilemma\u2014how to deal with the coexistence of apes and humans\u2014but they each approached the situation very differently because of their individual backgrounds. Dreyfus wanted to fight and eliminate the apes. His military background caused him to think of the apes as a threat that should be dealt with. Similarly, he had a very narrow, simplistic view on every situation in the story. Plus, he almost ruined the entire movie with the most pompous statement anyone has uttered since the heyday of Muhammad Ali. Malcolm, a more peaceful, community-based thinker, saw the possibility of apes and humans cooperating. Koba had built up a massive distrust and even a hatred for humans because he was tortured in labs most of his life. So he immediately wanted to kill all the humans since he viewed them all as evil. Ceasar had the most complicated perspective because he was willing to accept new information and allow his viewpoint to evolve. He initially had ambivalent thoughts about humans due to varying experiences. Ceasar was loved by his human caretaker as a young ape, but mistreated and attacked by humans later in life. Based on his experience, he formed the opinion that apes were better and more evolved than humans. After seeing the events that unfolded during the movie, he realized neither species is inherently better. Clearly there are parallels between the pairs of humans and apes. The writers are sending the message that the two sides are very similar (although, Ceasar is made to be the most impressive character just to push the point that apes are not to be held beneath humans), each capable of both great compassion and destruction. The bells of racial overtones ring loud and clear, just as they did in the original 'Apes' film. Some want to fight, some want to segregate, some want to cooperate. It should sound familiar. In addition, the writers deserve credit for setting the table for a war between the species without bluntly presenting who is responsible for its commencement. Both sides played their part. The lines of good and bad are blurred. Fear (which led to hate) seems to be the only true enemy. One thing that was made obvious is that an epic battle is looming in the sequel. And if the quality of 'Dawn' is an indication, it is going to be epic.",

My two star rating is for Andy Serkis alone, who I think is a true artist with everything he does!This review is a Spoiler from start to finish!Massive budget - check A reasonably good first movie of the franchise - check Andy Serkis - check Storyline - let's talk about that pointWriters sitting in a room to put together a \"great storyline\" for this sequel:We are set only 10 years after \"The Rise\" so...\"What are the basics we need\"?\"Apes\"\"Good. What else\"?\"Humans.\"\"Sure, but maybe a few less. Let's face it, the Apes have to have a chance at fighting the humans. Say we kill off most humans on earth, leaving just hundreds left in smaller groups...but how?\"\"A virus! A virus that was a result of complicated genetic....\"\"Perfect! A virus! And we can say it had something to do with the Apes and so on! We need to keep it simple. Moving on. What else do we need?\"\"A new nice guy...Oh, and maybe a couple of \"actors\" playing his family\"\"What happened to James Franco? Never mind...a new nice guy then. What about more important things now like...we need a war. So, how do we give the Apes a chance against the technologically advanced humans? Should they be 'building' sophisticated weapons to challenge the humans?\"\"One option would definitely be to have the humans create a massive arms depot and just have two idiots look after it. Oh, and maybe these two idiots could also just spend their time drinking and shooting for no reason. It would be easier to kill them off that way. This way the Apes would have access to lots of guns, which they know how to use, since...they are intelligent.\"\"Awesome...but how do we explain the arms depot. Did I miss something about zombies or others human enemies in the outline?\"Nope, just the virus. The humans aren't really aware of the Apes initially.\"Ok...arms depot it is.\"\"How do we get things kicking off?\"\"I'd say we need a human volatile and a monkey volatile.\"\"Say no more...done\"\"Anything else?\"Explosions\"\"I agree. That's it for today. We meet again next week to discuss the next sequel. Thank you for taking time of your well deserved luxury life style!\"This is my first review of a movie. The enjoyment of writing this review made up for the 2-hour agony of watching an appallingly bad story line together with poor acting and terrible scripting. And most of all - a negligence to explain anything to the audience.",

            "content": "In 2011, the dead & dusted franchise of Planet of the Apes was successfully resurrected by Rise of the Planet of the Apes; the origin story of the rebooted series, which turned out to be the surprise blockbuster of its year considering that there was no significant buzz at the box-office prior to its release & even the prediction from marketing pundits was never in its favour.Three years later, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes finally surfaces amidst enormous hype & expectations as the second chapter of the rebooted franchise and continues the story of Caesar & his legion of genetically evolved apes. The plot is set in a dystopian future & takes place 10 years after the events of the first film and brings us closer to an inevitable war that would determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species.Directed by Matt Reeves, this sequel features a much darker premise in comparison to the adventurous tone of the original & presents Reeves in terrific form. The screenplay is a gem in itself for it adds an incredible amount of detail, depth & characterization to the whole story. And even though it is a sequel, it is crafted like a standalone feature that can work without being entirely dependent on its predecessor.Weta Digital has done a tremendous job once again as it adds even more accuracy, authenticity & realism in the depiction of apes & their evolving nature. Cinematography envelops the story with a darker ambiance while editing exhibits an admirable level of patience in its story. The background score by Michael Giacchino is also reimagined from the ground up & beautifully reflects the tense mood of the film.Coming to the acting department, the digital apes simply outperform their human counterparts in almost every single scene and were far more expressive & interesting than them. Andy Serkis reprises his role of Caesar & gets to explore many more dimensions than before and impresses with a remarkable screen presence. The next best work comes from Toby Kebbell as Koba; Caesar's second-in-command who has a strong grudge against the humans.Rest are good in their supporting roles although I wished Gary Oldman had more screen time. On an overall scale, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an ingeniously directed, deftly scripted, tightly structured, darkly photographed, firmly edited & magnificently scored cinema that implements a fine balance between its storytelling elements & action spectacle to come out as a genuine summer blockbuster material.Covering the themes of family, leadership, fear, loss & vengeance in an elegant manner while also making a powerful statement against the use of arms, the second chapter of the rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise is a major step-up that's darker, stronger & bigger than its already impressive predecessor and succeeds in delivering everything it promised & even more. Delightfully recommended.",

This is not far from what America will look like in about 30 years. It will be overrun with wild apes and there will be complete lawlessness and chaos. It will be a jungle out there. The lull moments of the movie are a big downer, who really cares about the emotional stuff, we just want to see apes smashing skulls.",

            "content": "Robert Frost once said, 'Good fences make good neighbors'. I really don't know if you can understand the implications of this adage from his poem 'The Mending Wall'. So, where do we draw that line or the fence? And how well do we respect that territorial pact? How will our preconceived notions give rise to conflicts and lead us to tearing apart our neighbors? Humans have gone way beyond the Darwin's survival of the fittest theory. Our existential crisis seems to have consumed us so much that we are always war torn; at conflict. Dawn of planet of apes is a glimpse of the beast within ourselves; a mirror to our deeds in the past and the present. It is a brilliant tale of obvious conflict between humans and apes. \"But, why? And for what?\" catapult this movie to the next level of storytelling.Riding on the wave of success of the sleeper hit and the acclaimed 'Rise of planet of apes', 'Dawn of planet of apes' is not just your average CGI or a sci-fi popcorn flick. Coupled with an excellent story lineup and brilliant CGI and motion capture work, and some excellent acting (from Andy Serkiks, Toby Kebbell and Doc Shaw for their mind-blowing ape-like performances \u2013 the motion capture work), this is by far the best movie of the 'planet of apes' installment; all in all, one of the very good movies I have watched in the recent times. Just imagine a set of apes capable of emoting happiness, sadness, anger, rage and so on; unseen and unheard of.Now, the titles make lots of sense to me, at least. 'Rise of planet of apes' shows how a group of apes evolve into intelligent beings, speak and think like humans do, and how the simian virus spreads across the globe infecting the entire mankind. 'Dawn of the planet of apes' starts from where the infection kills millions (ever played Plague inc. on Android/IOS?). A small set of humans, who must have either fought the virus or evaded the virus, are living off the coast of San Francisco and that's when the movie is set.As the title suggests, it is the 'dawn' of something at brink. What is 'it'? Which of 'em is going to emerge as the dominant species on this planet? What are the choices they (both apes and humans) make and what are the consequences of these choices? More than often, we do not see movies that have a soul. The soul of the movie lies in the characterization of apes and humans. One minute you feel one of 'em is right and in the very next, you see that the other is right too.The movie will shock you with its unexpected twists. I was spellbound and baffled with occasional bouts of goose bumps during certain sequences, for I never expected that coming. Watch the movie for its breath-taking imagery, for the apes that emote and for the primeval question, 'How did 'it' start?' A highly recommended film. My rating 5/5.",

The movie didn't make me care about their need for electrical power or their emotional connections to one another.

I did not like the story, I did not like the plot, I did not like it at all. Except 1 or 2 nice scenes, the movie was quite bad. Not interesting at all. It was longer than it should ( because the plot was quite plain and basic). The first movie was original. This one was not. If you could switch the Apes with humans, then you would have a typical story of a peaceful leader who wants peace and prosperity for his people and doesn't want them to get into war with an enemy tribe, but some of his people do not want peace and after treason, they misguide the peaceful tribe into war. Until the leader steps back in and stops the hostilities.. I have no idea, how many movies I have watched dealing with a similar subject. For me it was a huge disappointment because the first film was quite a novelty, whilst this one was very common. As I aforementioned the movie was too long for its plot. It was as if they were doing it on purpose just to say ,hey this movie is long because it is complex and has a lot of action. But it did not. I am disappointed",

The \"Switched at Birth\" type sign language and subtitles are cute. Keri Russell provides sympathetic support. Jason Clarke is okay for the lead role though he looks a bit Neanderthal himself. Gary Oldman looks bedraggled enough.Liked the San Francisco setting and City Hall scene though the Golden Gate was under utilized. More familiar landmarks and scenes of SF could have been used. The battle scenes are exciting and the story makes enough sense for this kind of scenario. There is a gun control message.A must see - it's better than you can imagine.",

            "review_title": "Ape-solutely Fabulous!!!",
            "content": "Watching \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" reminded me of Hollywood cavalry westerns from the 1950s, like \"Broken Arrow,\" where noble Native Americans confronted white settlers over land rights with a cavalry scout serving as a go-between to negotiate the issue. Invariably, no matter how amicable relations between the two factions got, war erupted with deplorable results. Fanning the flames of dissent, unscrupulous whites often took advantage of defiant Indians with contraband liquor and firearms. The Native Americans chieftains as well as their white counterparts respectively contended not only with treachery within their own ranks, but also the collateral damage such senseless violence yielded. Mind you, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is not a western. Occasionally, this futuristic, Twentieth Century Fox release resembles one. When they scrimmage for war against mankind, the marauding apes arm themselves with fully automatic weapons, saddle their horses, and stampede through the remnants of the human race like pugnacious Apaches. This imaginative, visually resplendent, PG-13 rated, sci-fi saga depicts no-holds-barred warfare. You won't see anything that might sicken you. Casualties by gunfire occur on both sides, but \"Cloverfield\" director Matt Reeves keeps the violence comparatively immaculate. You won't witness anything as savage as the beach-front \"Saving Private Ryan\" battle scenes. Meanwhile, unlike its provocative predecessor \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\" \"Dawn\" dwells more on the dynamics between the apes rather than the humans. Incidentally, all the primate characters alive at fade-out in the original make encore appearances. Caesar (Andy Serkis of \"The Lord of the Rings\" films) dominates his horde as the alpha ape, while his creepy lieutenant, Koba (Toby Kebbell of \"RocknRolla\"), abuses his trust. Naturally, villains are always more gaudy than heroes, and Koba makes an incomparable adversary not only for Caesar but also the human leader, Malcolm (Jason Clarke of \"Lawless\"), who wants to live in peace with the primates. Koba emerges as one wicked ape. He does everything but twirl a mustache like a vaudeville fiend. \"Total Recall\" scenarist Mark Bomback along with original \"Rise\" scribes Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver give Koba two memorable moments. Koba is the kind of villain who displays no qualms about killing and requires little provocation to resort to violence. Koba's disarming antics that lull two clueless, heavily-armed humans into a false sense of security are impressive.\"Dawn\" resumes the narrative thread about a decade after the events in \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\" If you missed \"Rise,\" you may find yourself at a disadvantage with \"Dawn.\" Although we never saw him die in \"Rise,\" the human protagonist, Gen-Sys geneticist Will Rodman (James Franco), who emerged as Caesar's surrogate father, has not been accounted for, so he could still be alive. However, he never shows up in \"Dawn.\" Meantime, the ALZ-113 aerosol that Rodman developed after the failure of ALZ 112 has wiped out most of mankind. Designated as the Simian Flu, only the strongest humans survive, while the apes thrive. You may remember Rodman's lab assistant, Franklin (Tyler Labine), died from exposure to ALZ-113 during an experiment on Koba in the first film. Before he died, Franklin infected Rodman's next door neighbor, international airline pilot Husiker (David Hewlett), who is ultimately responsible for spreading the virus. As far as we're informed, a small community of humans residing in the ruins of San Francisco have been struggling tenaciously for ten years after the events of the first movie to survive. Nominally, this lone group of humans are led by a former soldier, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman of \"Lawless\"), who is preparing to arm his people. They have exhausted their make-shift power supply and are about to be plunged into darkness. An engineer named Malcolm has convinced Dreyfus that if they can reactivate a nearby a hydroelectric plant then they will be in good shape. The obstacle to bringing the plant back on line is that it lies up in the forest where Caesar and his apes have settled and lived in peace for ten winters. Malcolm takes his wife and son along with a hydroelectric employee, Carver (Kirk Acevedo of \"The Thin Red Line\"), who knows how to start it up. Unfortunately, for everybody involved, Carver has struck out ahead of Malcolm and company and he stumbles onto two young chimps. Terrified by their presence, Carver whips out a revolver and wounds one. No sooner has he shot the poor chimp than Caesar and an army of apes, gorillas, and orangutans have surrounded the humans. This sounds like the Apaches surrounding Randolph Scott in the desert after he has encroached on their land. Predictably, Caesar is not happy with this turn of events. Similarly, no sooner has Caesar agreed to a truce to allow Malcolm and his people crank up the hydroelectric plant that Koba undermines Caesar's authority.The CGI in \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is twice as impressive as its predecessor. The entire ape cast wore motion-capture suits. Meaning, they didn't have to undergo elaborate make-up and costuming like their forerunners in the first franchise. Back in those days, the actors who played the apes wore simian gloves, simian feet, and a simian's head, while the rest of their bodies were concealed in outfits that dictated their job. Andy Serkis is amazing as Caesar, and his performance as a simian is about as close as anyone will come to impersonating a primate. Toby Kebbell is likewise awesome as the villainous Koba. The apes are as convincing as they can possibly be, and you will be astonished at how life-like the actors and actresses are, particularly when they move. Lack of depth undermines the human characters, principally Gary Oldman's Dreyfus, while Carver is not only hopelessly paranoid but also hopelessly impetuous. At two hours and ten minutes in length, \"Dawn\" advances the storyline beyond the original, and Reeves stages several spectacular set-pieces. \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" amounts to far more than just monkey business as usual.",

At the same time the apes evolve and become intelligent. Of course this has to happen over generations and not just by the passing of time in the same individuals, but let's say it happened. And so the plot holes begin:All the human survivors are gathered in one building in the middle of San Fransisco. What are they eating? Do they grow the earth? -NoDo they raise livestock? -No.Are they near a spring or well to have fresh running water? -No.Are they dressed in animal skins or primitive hand made clothes? -No, they use 10 or 15 year old clothes and look great.So all these people together produce a lot of waste, what happens to it? -Nothing, probably use the sewers which are capable of functioning forever without any maintenance of any kind. Probably the writers imagined the survivors using the toilet and flushing and the water appearing magically from taps, showers and toilets...What do they really need? -Power to charge the i-Pad to see the old photos. Of course they cannot go to the nearest refinery or gas depot and fill a tanker truck, but they risk their lives going to the mountains against angry intelligent apes, because the radio uses a lot of power and the nuclear plant doesn't work any more. Makes perfect sense.And of course when they repair the dam the power magically transfers to the city, tenths of miles far, because of course poles do not fall down and cables don't cut after 10 or 15 years without maintenance just like the sewers.The apes can all talk, and the villain ape has English accent. They prefer to use sign language though because a language which is useless in the dark or even just when the other person is not looking at you is superior to a spoken language.And which is the best way to test guns? By shooting them, because 10-15 years old or older guns with out any kind of maintenance never blow up in your face when you try to shoot them.And then the apes learn to use the guns and they shoot literally thousands of rounds without ever reloading. No need to reload in wonderland... I, personally had one year of training for my military service, and I am still not sure how to use a weapon I was not trained with but hey I m not an ape!A lot more stupidity from the writers and finally, the human warns the apes that the army is coming to wipe them out, but the ape leader which through the entire movie is depicted as intelligent, moderate and cautious does not order to hide in the woods. Instead he stays in the city waiting for the army.The characters are a joke, especially the bad guys, and generally don't spend any money on this if you are over 16 years old. Don't watch it altogether if you are under 16 years old because it is full of stupid and meaningless violence...",

            "content": "It was many years ago that I saw Charlton Heston in the original 'Planet of the Apes' (1967). I finished the film stunned by the ideas in it. Now there is a new film; 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes', to add to the now lengthy canon of PotA-ape films.Looking forward to seeing this new 'Dawn of the PotA', this reviewer was pleased that two days ago there was a TV screening of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' (2011). This fitted in well with my cinema choice because 'Dawn of the PotA' follows on from 'Rise of the PotA' chronologically.'Rise of the PotA' (2011) was set in the year 2016. It told the story of how drug-tests created super-smart apes, who became self-aware, and then escaped captivity, to take shelter in the woods outside San Francisco. The film ended with them free and an outbreak of Simian Flu being spread around the world. The film did it's best to stay with the original story, though it did refine and update it, whilst still being true to the original spirit and paying homage to it too.The new film 'Dawn of the PotA' follows in those footsteps too. 'Rise' ended with the spread of the flu. 'Dawn', like it's predecessor, starts with the iconic '20th Century Fox' and the opening credits, showing at the same time the spread of the flu. This is done well and convincingly. Film then moves forward. It is set in the year 2026, thus 10 years after the other one.The apes have been living in freedom, without any human contact, and their own society has developed. However a human is encountered, one of a group. Human society has survived. Now apes and humans must deal with the reality of their shared existence.'Dawn' spends time with both the ape and human societies. We see family bonds and politics in both societies. We see mutual distrust, and the decisions, and mistakes, as the two groups try to develop a position on future relations. Ultimately, this boils down to having to decide to fight or live in peace. Can the participants in the struggle put the past behind them, and develop a new way of thinking, or will they be burdened and enslaved by that past? Charlton Heston, who appeared in the original 'Planet of the Apes' (1967), also campaigned for civil-rights, and this of course was a major theme of that original film. This theme is also there in the modern 'PotA' films. Self-awareness is also an SF staple, be it in books or films. Earlier this year, there were two films that developed that theme in computers; 'Her' and 'Transcendence'. SF writer Isaac Asimov also tackled it in his robot books. These and other major issues are tackled in 'Rise' and 'Dawn'. Both are thought-provoking films, especially 'Dawn'. Like the older films, it tackles questions, or at least asks the questions, that we also ask and decide on, in our own present-day existence. Decisions on war and peace, honour and dishonour, loyalty and rebellion and revolution, lies and propaganda and truth. All are faced in this film by the apes and humans. As they are faced too by us in real-life.Whilst this is a serious and thought-provoking film it is also an exciting one too. The story moves along at a pace. The human survivors living in their post-apocalypse world are familiar to us who have seen similar 'Survivors'-type films or TV series. These scenes are filmed well, as are the scenes of the apes. There are many fight scenes, some small-scale, some large. The fighting is bloody, exciting, realistic and violent.This film, which I saw in 3D, is classed in the UK as 12A, thus it could be described as a film for family viewing. However the above description of the violence means that the 12 category should be adhered to. There are many scenes of apes using sign-language, and in those, subtitles are provided for us the audience. If a child is so young that it cannot read the subtitles, then leave it at home, so it does not disturb adults with it's frequent questions.'Dawn' is a well written, produced and directed film. The cast too should be commended. Despite it's 12A rating, this SF film is grim and gritty. This, and the thought-provoking ideas, make this a surprisingly adult film. As such then, this is a very worthy film to add to the very best of the 'PotA' canon.Exciting and thought-provoking. 10/10.",

            "content": "When this franchise was re-booted a couple of years ago, I had high hopes for it. Though \"Rise\" was a middling movie by almost any description, it provided just enough \"canon\" moments for \"Ape-heads\" like myself to have hope for the future. A future in which an ape invasion of humans could be rendered visually believable, which is what \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" portends to do. On a strictly technically basis, it comes through with flying colors. One can indeed see a believable interpretation of a human/ape war. The problem? It tells such a boring story along the way.For a basic plot summary, \"Dawn\" picks up a number of years after \"Rise\" ends. In the future, humans are decimated by a simian flu (thank you, Big Pharmacy!) and down to pockets of existence. When the San Francisco band of humans (led by Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman) ventures into the redwood forests to power up a hydroelectric dam, they stumble upon a community of apes led by Caesar (Andy Serkis), who has the advanced power of speech as previous developed. Tensions run high between human and ape, with one wrong move threatening to start an all-out war.In the \"old school\" ape films, there is most definitely a \"buy-in\" level, as the \"apes\" are clearly actors in monkey suits. While likely not a problem for sci-fi buffs (like myself), others may not have the imagination for such a \"reach\". With today's movie technology, however, an ape rebellion looks very, very real, with apes swinging through trees and learning new skills as they evolve. No long does one have to imagine the apes taking over planet Earth...you can watch it happen!Sadly, there is NOTHING else interesting going on in this film. You thought James Franco's character was a bit wooden in the first one? \"Dawn\" is oh so much worse. Not a single human character is even remotely interesting, and the plot is about as bland as one can get away with in such a high-profile release. Never once did I feel as if I truly cared about anything that was transpiring up on the screen (aside from a few of the \"ape action\" scenes, of course).Let me put it to you this way: In the film \"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\", Caesar the talking ape rallies his simian friends to begin a chaotic riot in the first steps towards breaking their human bondage. At the end of that tension-filled riot, Roddy McDowell (Caesar) gives an epic, hair-raising speech proclaiming \"tonight begins the planet of the apes!\". There is not one second of \"Dawn\" that even approaches that sort of high drama. Instead, it is a palate of great special effects tagged with a lousy script/characters. I was really excited about the potential of this new \"Apes\" franchise going in, but this clunker has significantly dulled that enthusiasm.",

Even the whole world has been trying to find them for years? - The factory is workable after so many years with just a little effort of 4 guys in several hours? Come on, I live in the country where we depend on such power source, to run such kind of factory, we need a big team of engineers, workers from many departments working together on specific conditions. - We just need a stupid man and stupid apes' leader ever to start the war so easily. - ipad, cameras and many electronic devices are working well after many years without power, wow. - Human are lazy,aggressive and selfish. I think when those people living in such kind of condition (no food, no electronics...), they should kill each other before apes come. ... I don't want to list more and more non-sense and illogical details but how the writer can ignore so many basic thing like that? Huge disappointed about the \"second ape\".

Anything other than a co-ordinated, presumably paid, campaign of solicited positive reviews seems improbable to me.I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I loved the opening movie of this new take on the franchise for it's original and thoughtful way of kick-starting an updated 21st century imagining for the birth of sentient apes. I read Pierre Boulle's \"Monkey Planet\" in the 70's, and loved the original series of movies (even the naffer, later ones after \"escape\"). This may be largely influenced by my youthful age at the time and general love of science fiction.I have no problem with the willing suspension of disbelief or escapism. A film doesn't have to make perfect sense in \"the real world\" for me to appreciate it. What i do have a huge problem with, however, is the lazy and cavalier way this movie utterly cuts loose from the premise so carefully set up in \"Rise\", and which i was intrigued to see explored further in this plot less, pointless travesty.There is so much wrong with this movie that i am simply unable to catalogue it, however, here are a few pointers.......1) it is set just 10 years after \"rise\". Yet, in this time, the West Coast of America has in the main turned into jungle. Old petrol stations are shown looking as overgrown and integrated into the greenery as various Inca ruins look today, surrounded by mature trees that tower above them.2) There is a massive population of smart apes who can use sign language, and some talking apes living in the jungle. Far more than the indigenous population of the west coast could ever explain (though only (count 'em) one Orangutang, called Maurice, in the film's only nice touch - a nod to Maurice Evans who played Dr Zaius in the original). He, at least, can also write, scribing \"Ape not kill ape\" etc on rocks, which the baby apes can presumably read??? Are you chuckling yet? In just ten short years since \"rise\", 100's of thousands of years of evolution have been spread liberally, though very unevenly, across this vast ape population, who presumably flew over to the states when they heard how cool the west coast was to hang out at these days. Though, even the apes who can't talk yet, sort of grab that extra bit of evolution needed to get a bit shouty when some \"dramatic\" piece of \"plot\" development spurs them individually on....Actually, i am losing the will to go on, since i would run up against the 1000 word limit long before i ran out of ire at the lazy, trite, inconsistent, banal, clich\u00e9d \"plot\" so i will limit myself to one more observation.3) once the apes grab automatic weapons, as they invariably must, they become instantly proficient in their use and have the supernatural ability to summon UNLIMITED AMMUNITION from the same mysterious realm that transported them all in, forged their tree dwellings and bypassed Darwin so succinctly. Plus, they get the ability to put tanks on autopilot.And i didn't even start on the humans tale.....what the hell was Gary Oldman thinking of, appearing in this pile of chimp manure. Or the overblown schmaltzy soundtrack, which \"helpfully' illustrates important emotional, or dramatic \"events\" in the film.Truly, this is an experience beyond parody. As Charlton Heston would undoubtedly have commented to the director and writers of this movie \"You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell\"1/10 for very fluid CGI, though in 2014 i begin to question whether this warrants any points, such is the accepted state of the art?",

Humans want to repair a dam nearby so that they can get electricity, Caesar allows them to work, and asks other monkeys to help.

DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES has set a whole new Standard for cgi and the superstars of those cgi have given us the most convincing cinematic simians since Peter Jackson's KING KONG. For my money, it's Koba (who \"learned Hate from Humans\") who steals the show (while I can't cite the performance of an actor, I CAN sing the praise of the aforementioned superstars of cgi, who rendered the character so 100% believably). If this is the future of Great Filmmaking, so be it. I'm now on board with it. DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES benefits greatly, too, from some solid storytelling (although it IS essentially a remake of BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES, the lesser of the original five films); and it's never predictable in terms of the shots we see: everything looks and feels absolutely Brand New, an almost impossible achievement, one would think, given that it IS a remake. The idea of the Apes signing was a stroke of genius because that's how Apes HAVE been taught to communicate (lending the proceedings an air of authenticity). When it comes to the ARTICULATION, Koba again rates top honors: his inflections have the hyper-delivery of the True Primitive in all his rage. (And Koba is ultimately the most tragic of all the Great Apes, having first been abused by and then \"lied to\" by Humans. If nothing else, DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is the revenge tale of Koba.) Like PACIFIC RIM, DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES absolutely MUST be seen on The Big Screen. Trust me: it's WORTH it.",

            "content": "The apes are back in town, and they are more than ready to throw down with Gary Oldman and company! \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" continues to prove that this rebooted franchise is able to compete with many of the 2014 films on multiple levels. This is helped by the fact that this film improved upon many of the elements of its 2011 predecessor, and that is not a compliment I can give to every film that continues a franchise. Andy Serkis reprises his role in this film as Caesar, the leader of the apes. At this point, I would assume it is rather safe to say that no one does motion capture performances the way he does. Throughout the film, one will be forgiven for mistaking his performance for what it is; acting. From the way he walks to the way he talks, Andy Serkis sells this role and gives life to an animated chimp that could not be more believable if it were really an ape playing the part. But honestly, every single one of the apes is excellently portrayed through this movie. The visuals on the apes are stunning, and I strongly recommend that the audience just take a few moments while watching the film to look really closely at them. It is incredible what animators can accomplish these days!I could go on and on, praising this movie's visuals and performances, but I doubt I will say anything that has not already been said. In a nutshell; this movie is a visual masterpiece. Rather, I am going to say that this film really focuses on telling a story that delves into human nature, and how we deal with people, ideas, or beliefs that are different from our own. Through the apes versus human conflict, I could not help envisioning or thinking about how humans fight or disagree with each other over very obvious misunderstandings. This movie brings these issues to the cinema floor, but disguises them in guns, apes, and warfare. In all honesty, the few complaints I have are not to be blamed on the apes. Instead, the minor complaints actually revolve around the surviving humans. I will not include any specific examples, but there are moments when the humans and apes encounter each other that have very predictable outcomes. The humans also feel a little two dimensional at times, and I say this because there are a few characters that could certainly have benefited from stronger dialog or a stronger back story. In fact, the real problem with the humans is that the film does not focus on developing their characters as much as those of the apes. If one were to compare almost any ape to the majority of the human characters, the apes will almost always a have much clearer motive, more depth, and just a better screen presence. And although the apes do not speak much, their communication is still better written than some of the human dialog. Expositional lines are used a few times in the first act of the film, and I believe this is due to the fact that this is an entirely new human cast. While the apes are mostly a returning cast, the humans need to be introduced to the audience. This is something that I hope the third film will not have to worry about; I really hope that next time the director keeps the same cast so that we do not have to be introduced to another new group of humans, thus slowing down the storytelling.Ultimately, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is a very, very good film. I did have some complaints with a few characters and lines, but for the most part this film is extremely effective in continuing the return the apes to the silver screen. It takes a franchise that looked to be beyond saving and has turned it into what will likely become a box office contender whenever it hits theaters for the foreseeable future.",

I am so glad that the entire cast and crew of this movie did an awesome job. Once again, Andy Serkis did a superb job voice acting as Caesar (and so did the other voice actors for the other apes) and I don't think anyone could have done it better. Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman did a good job too. Keri Russell didn't have much screen time but she did well for the time she was on screen. And I guess I don't have to mention the awesome graphics, though watching it in 3D didn't make much of a difference.This movie revolves around the lives of two species - the humans and the apes. The apes on one hand have progressed much in few years, they have started to read and write, establish laws, live together as a family, hunt together using weapons and tools and even domesticate animals under the leadership of Caesar. On the other hand, the virus which was being tested on the apes in the previous movie has actually caused an adverse effect on humans causing a world wide pandemic in which most of humanity has perished. Tensions build up between the apes and the humans which is the central plot of the story. What follows is a showcase of betrayal, trust, power, humanity and the basic need to survive.I would also like to compare this movie with the recent transformers movie (rather the entire transformers movie franchise). The transformers movies call themselves 'transformers' and they concentrate more on humans than the transformers themselves. This movie on the other hand focuses more on apes and at the same time also incorporates the humans and the tensions between the two races in a fantastic way. The transformers movies always have a half naked helpless chick running around the screen for god-knows-what reason and unnecessary emotional and romantic scenes. This movie kept every such aspect at the level it was supposed to be - no unnecessary emotions, romance or intimate scenes. What's more? I found the animation of this movie as good as (if not better than) the transformers movies. I could go on and on but I would end by putting this here: Michael Bay could really learn something from this movie.I would like to end by saying this is one of the very good movies so far this year.

I have to say that I was not having the highest of expectations on it though and I also have to say that my expectations was more or less met. To me this is a mildly entertaining movie but it is certainly not a great movie.The special effects with the apes are very good indeed. The apes look very much real and I was surprised at how much emotions that the special effects people managed to get into their facial expressions. The human actors also did a quite good job\u0085within the limitations of the script of course.However, the previous movie felt reasonably new, fresh and original (although it was fairly predictable) while this movie just feels like a rehash of some fairly standard, thirteen on a dozen, post-apocalyptic story with some apes thrown in to make it stand out. I really do not understand why so many people seems to think so highly of this movie. It is the all too common catalogue of stupid behaviors and sadly enough the apes seems to have inherited plenty of stupid behaviors from the humans.It starts of with the usual scared-trigger-happy-idiot-shoots someone. In this case an ape of course. How many times have that boring excuse for kick starting the story been used? Then it pretty much goes on. The only mildly intelligent people in the town seems to be the Malcolm and Dreyfus. The two morons wasting ammunition on firing at a old car and drinking Whisky as well as the original idiot who tried to hide a gun deserved to be shot.The only somewhat intelligent part was when the captured apes turned over a bus and took a bunch of their adversaries with them. The movie was indeed very predictable. The only thing that elevated the movie above the level of downright boring was the fact that half of the characters were apes and, luckily as I wrote, those special effects were very well done.The blurb from Twentieth Century Fox states that \"\u0085both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species.\". Well yes I guess that you cannot say that this is a downright lie but it is definitely a bunch of hyperbole to sell the movie. Come on, we are talking about a very limited group of apes, badly decimated as well, against the rest of the surviving humanity, which obviously have some modern facilities left and a war that is more or less just assumed will happen.A mildly entertaining movie but certainly not a great movie.",

The movie started well by setting up audience sympathy for Caesar's world but went steadily downhill once the interactions started. The ape sign language quickly became tedious and it was unconvincing - there was simply not enough content in the gestures to communicate the complex messages going to and forth. The narrative arc was, sadly, as banal and predictable as any Hollywood spectacular I have seen. As usual, there was a yawning gap between the sophistication of the cgi and the vacuously thin story line. I know, this is blockbuster territory, but that doesn't preclude the occasional diverting twist and turn. The attack and battle sequences were lamentable. There seemed to be more and more apes and humans around - where did they all come from - and it was obvious that given the weaponry involved the outcome would be a human victory, not an ape one. However, having secured their implausible victory, what do the apes do next ... they put the humans in cages. What would they do with them? Feed them bananas? From then on I more or less gave up on the movie as it had obviously hit the buffers. It looked like even the actors realised the show was over and were just going through the motions. The only slightly redeeming feature of the last act was the reference to King Kong - a climactic struggle at the top of a tall building etc. I rather liked that. Other reviewers have picked away at plot goofs, coincidences, tropes, etc. and they are indeed numerous. Sadly disappointing. Five for the likable music score plus Andy Serkis as Caesar.",

This one is a reworking of the story from Battle of the Planet of the Apes, which was the weakest entry in the original series. 'Dawn' is superior to 'Battle' in every way, although a notch below 'Rise' in my book. The story picks up ten years after the events of 'Rise.' Caesar is now the leader of the apes living in the woods north of San Francisco. The only humans remaining are the ones immune to the virus introduced in the prior film. The humans and apes have a tenuous relationship that is further strained by humans attempting to enter the ape habitat to reactivate a hydroelectric dam. Caesar wants peace between the humans and the apes, so he allows them in to fix the dam. This doesn't sit well with some of the apes, particularly one named Koba, who wants to wipe out the remaining humans. Extraordinary action scenes and CGI highlight the second half. I actually wasn't very impressed with the CGI in the first few scenes. I felt the faces on some of the apes looked kind of cartoonish. But it seemed to improve after that and I had no further complaints. The first half is full of incredible character moments (not that those are missing from the second half entirely). It's a really well-written movie. One of the best things about this series (and the original) is the great writing and characterizations.

It would not be a tragedy. It would be a blessing.)This would mean that the surviving human population would have approximately 1 entire square mile PER PERSON to live in in the contiguous 48 U.S. states. That's over 600 acres per person. That's utopia.They'd have enough fuel (diesel and gasoline) just sitting in all the reserves of the nation (and the various fuel stations) to run generator and vehicles for 100 years. Anyone with half a brain would move to the south eastern U.S. states with the temps are mild, growing seasons long and water plentiful.They would have NOTHING to fight over. I honestly can't think of anything sweeter that having the world's population reduced by 90%.The Apes could NOT have had the distribution of intelligence they exhibited within just 10 years of Ceasar and a few zoo apes getting their \"brain boost' back in the first film.Ceasar, the Ape leader, says at one point that they haven't seen a human in 10 years, and he wonders if their are even any left. That's ridiculous. There is not way that it would have taken 10 years for either Ape or Human to cross the bridge out of curiosity.There is certainly no way the Apes lived in perfect peace for 10 years.

This sequel does a perfect job at telling its own story, connecting to the past and leading to a future film, that I cannot wait to see. As far as the effects go the apes are so realistic and the plot truly shows what I truly believe would be a post apocalyptic San Francisco. This is a story of the human race that shows what we all hold most dear, security and family are the cores of humanity and this movie depicts that better than I have seen before. Do yourself a favor and go see this ASAP.",

Not really all that good either, but somewhere in between.It had very much the same idiotic decisions that you see in the film.But were better in some areas and more explanatory in others The movie is big on CGI, and rather short on everything else from acting to line delivery An the plot holes are simply endless So for me the whole movie was a big hyped disappointment************************WARNING SPOILERS*************************** 1; Why bring a human that hate apes with a passion that would make Hitler jealous, to work in a place surrounded by apes? Not really what I would call a smart tactical decision 2:As for Caesar why have koba walking around second guessing every thing you do.Even a chimp would know that could lead to disaster. These two, Koba and guy that hates apes ,are the spark of the whole conflict between humans and apes. Which again makes the whole movie very predictable, from the first 15 minutes you know how the whole thing will go, you only left guessing who will set off the powder keg.3:Another plot hole is why do they need the electricity back? They talk about a radio, but a short wave radio don't really use that much power, and you don't ever get to see what they need the electricity for. The chance of them getting anything else to work is pretty slim. It's not like you can just start up the power plant, and voila you have microwave dinner. Someone need to direct the power to where its going and how much. And somehow the dimwits human in this movie, don't convince me as someone who possesses that knowledge 4 where did all these apes come from ?? I mean even if they released all the test subjects in U.S how did they get to San Francisco? And do they multiply like rabbits? Cause there must have been over 1000 apes Another thing is: Why do Hollywood producers just seem to love big battle scenes were people get slaughtered in mass as they charge on through the bullets.. Have they sat through so many glorifying tales of the civil war, listening to historians telling how the brave brave soldiers continue to march on towards the on going bullet storm? And how come they always miss the leader in these big battles they are so found of , even though he never hides, they still can't hit him until the end. I dislike English movies for the most part, but somehow you rarely see them glorifying these old battles. Where they march forward an mass and get killed, even though they were doing it longer than the U.S civil war",

Caesar (Andy Serkis) leads a society of apes that hunt and live in the redwood forests. During a hunt, a bear attacks Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and Caesar nearly dies fighting it but Koba (Toby Kebbell) saves him. When humans stumble upon the apes' home, Caesar speaks, telling them to go. He sends Koba after them to follow. The group of humans is led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) who returns to the human settlement in San Francisco to tell the leader of the human society Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) about the apes. Carver (Kirk Acevedo) shot one of the apes and fears what the apes can do. Ellie (Keri Russell) used to research the disease that wiped out most of humanity at the CDC but sees no signs of any further contagion. Malcolm's son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) left behind a sketch book allowing the apes to see the extent of the society. Koba, recalling the ill treatment in the labs, believes they should attack the humans but Caesar cautions against war.Caesar leads a show of force to the gates of the human society and tells them that he does not want a war. Dreyfus is ready to go to war but Malcolm pleads with him to let him go up there and reason with Caesar. He has to take Carver along since he knows the how the power works at the dam. At the apes' fortress, Malcolm is brought to Caesar. Despite Koba's doubts, Caesar lets Malcolm show the dam to the apes. Dreyfus sends men to the armory and Koba sneaks into it though he is caught by a soldier. The men are caught off guard when Koba plays stupid. Caesar has a family to worry about as well and does not want to sacrifice apes in a needless war. He allows Malcolm and the other humans to work on the dam. The apes save the humans lives when an accident leaves some of them trapped in a tunnel but a tense altercation with a baby chimp, Blue Eyes, and Carver shows that trust is still difficult between the species.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",

            "content": "You're kidding right? This must be one gigantic colossal joke. So many holes in this film to list. For one, the city of San Francisco would not deteriorate like that within 10 years. This was absolutely ridiculous. It looked like a gigantic apocalypse had taken place. The humans also stated they had power for a while with generators etc. they never bothered to venture out of the city to see if there were other survivors? Caesar and the other apes could barely get out the word NO in the beginning of the film and towards the end, Caesar was making full sentences. He also healed over night after Keri Russell operated on him. It was such a joke. The acting was horrible. No character development whatsoever. I felt like I was watching one of the weakest episodes of The Walking Dead or some other made for TV movie. Everyone keeps saying the CGI was great...that's the problem...you never really get the full facial expressions and everything doesn't quite look realistic. Why all the ammunition where the human survivors were? Why after 10 years is the environment where the humans still look like complete trash and destruction with garbage and other things all over. Can these people not clean up after themselves? I also love the fact that after 10 years they decide to go to the dam to try and get power. First, that was one small dam that apparently brought power to the whole city. Second, it only took like 5 people one day to fix the dam...such a joke. My thoughts are random right now as there was nothing realistic about this movie or made sense whatsoever. When they went back to Caesar's old house...the house looked like 1000 years had passes...dirt all over the walls etc....but the camcorder went right back on with no worries...yet everything was so eroded everywhere else...but things like that, the laptop, the ipad...instantly came on with no problems...the power does, the batteries...nothing had eroded...yet the outside buildings,inside the buildings looked like it had been through a nuclear war. I also had to laugh when they went to Caesar's house and there were house plants that still looked very healthy in their pits on the porch...after all those years and also on a covered porch. Wonder what kind of miracle grow they used? These people don't bother to go to the dam for over 10 years...then decide to go...Caesar and his army come back to their city and say leave us alone...yet they immediately go back. I could go on and on. At least with the original movie, time travel was easier to swallow than a virus that kills people and within 10 years , all the cities him the world have eroded to nothing. Honestly, there was no actor standout. I have seen better acting on Lifetime made for TV movies. Here is another thing I remembered...San Francisco makes contact with a military base that was going to come down at the end of the movie. This military base never bothered to go to a major city like San Francisco to see if there were survivors? People can live without power...and there looked to be like many vacant houses all over San Francisco where people could live...yet they all gathered in this underground like city world that looked all destroyed. I think this movie made a mockery of the original 1968 movie.",

Within 10 minutes you are completely immersed in the story.One of the most fantastic aspects of this movie is that we watched it in 3-D and it didn't feel like that over-exaggerated 3-D effect that most 3-D movies give off these days. The 3-D effect was subtle enough that you didn't think about it but it added a great depth to the scenes, no pun intended.One of the greatest aspects of this movie is that it didn't rely simply on great CGI. The depth and allure is truly the acting and storyline. Andy Serkis (Caesar) is fantastic and Jason Clarke (Malcolm) really puts up a great performance.Clarke's portrayal of Malcolm is grand and he brings to life Malcolm in such a way that you feel like you've known him your entire life. Much of Malcolm's life prior to the virus outbreak isn't known or even brought up but the way in which Clarke portrays him allows your imagination to figure it out and that is a clincher. You really feel Malcolm's words and story in your soul.Andy Serkis' fantastic performance is yet another feather in the cap of this movie. As Clarke does with Malcolm, Serkis does in spades with Caesar's character. His movements are deliberate yet believable, he tells you more with his eyes and facial expressions during the movie than with his words. The manner in which Caesar and the other apes speak makes you believe that the next time you go to the zoo, you are going to be greeted by a speaking ape. At the same time it makes want to go on a spree across the country freeing all animals in scientific studies and in zoos.Toby Kebbell plays \"Koda\" to the limits of emotion. The proverbial \"emotion roller-coaster\" jumps the tracks on this one because you first empathize and sympathize with Koda, then you understand how and why he comes to hate humans. Once you start down that rabbit hole, you believe in his opinion that attacking the humans and killing them is the only way to defend the apes from them. The reality check is the way he gets the apes to follow him and that brings you back to a place in your soul where you now hate that fact that you ever felt sorrow for him, yet you hope he can redeem himself at some point.The rest of the supporting cast from Kodi Smit-McPhee as Alexander, the human boy to Nick Thurston as Blue Eyes to Keri Russell as Ellie are convincing in their roles. Karin Konoval plays Maurice the Orangutan with classical style. Maurice is immediately an ape that you can identify with and one that becomes a part of your heart from the first moment you see him.There is nothing bad in this movie. The directing, acting, CGI, etc are dead on and this movie owns a part of your soul when it ends.",

            "content": "Why do we get so many bad mega budget movies, but so very few great ones? Among the many things that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes makes you think, this thought comes back again and again. It is a terrific film, that is not only a thinking person's blockbuster, in the context of the movie, which makes one actually feel the consequences of our choices, and the dying gasps of humanity, but also action packed enough to entertain solely on that front.We last saw Caesar, the hyper intelligent ape lead his rag tag army of chimps, gorillas and orangutans in Rise of the Planet of Apes, across the Golden Gate Bridge into Muir woods. Dawn of The Planet of the Apes is set 10 years later. In that duration, the virus that gave Caesar his intelligence has proved apocalyptic for the human race, as they are all but destroyed. Only one in five hundred survive the simian virus, and those who do, engage in war and riots and cause a complete societal meltdown. As the human civilization slide towards an inevitable doom, the apes thrive. They learn to tame horses, hunt and fish, build homes, provide rudimentary education, and are making baby steps towards articulated speech to supplement their beautiful gesture based communication system. It is interesting to note that nature always pays the price for the progress of any species- and the giant redwoods do so for the apes, as they are felled all over to support the growth of the apes. \"Ape not kill Ape\"Caesar, who has seen both the good and bad side of humanity, knows that only this \"no kill\" ideal will ensure that the apes do not go the human way. However, much to Caesar's dismay, the apes prove to be akin in nature to humans. There is subterfuge, war mongering and the appetite for power and retribution in both species. He is unable to contain rabble rouser Koba, who becomes the leader of a bloodthirsty splinter group within the ape society. Rest is a standard war movie, as the increasingly assertive apes plunge headlong into a species defining conflict with the remaining humans. The ending is symbolic as the lead human character quietly steps back into the shadows as Caesar takes his place in the sun. The ending is also one that is soaked in quiet foreboding, and creates even more longing for the upcoming sequel. This is a breakthrough movie by director Matt Reeves, as e is able to create an action movie where you are emotionally invested in digital characters. With that he carefully constructs a series of climaxes, each one bigger, and better than the previous. A chimp on a horse firing off two AK-47s may be as ludicrous as fighting robots or super powered mutants, but Reeves makes it all very believable. The CGI characters are better than the humans, who largely are inconsequential and caricatured. The motion performance capture is so good that you may end up rooting for the opposing species. Andy Serkis pioneered motion capture as Gollum, and does a turn here that is Oscar worthy. The apes are worth the price of the ticket. The boffins at Weta Digital have outdone themselves in creating utterly seamless effects, so much so that the apes seem straight out of a real life National Geographic video.To sum up, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a complex, entertaining, riveting, intelligent and empathy inducing war movie. It kind of brings back the epic back in epic movies, and is easily the best movie of the year .Highly recommended- 10/10",

            "content": "The themes of human extinction and doomsday have been done to death in Hollywood. We have had alien attacks in Independence Day, asteroid collisions in Armageddon, machines taking over the world in The Terminator, The Matrix and The Transformers, global climatic catastrophes in The Day after Tomorrow and 2012, and pandemics leading to the wipe-out of the human race in I am Legend and Resident Evil. But these panic inducing themes have always managed to garner an audience thanks to the overwhelming special effects showing destruction, edge-of- the-seat action, and the sheer daredevilry of the characters involved. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes lends a new perspective to this theme. While it shows the perennial undying human spirit for survival and their utter disregard for any other living species in the pursuit of it, it tries to zoom in closer on the conscientious aspect of the human mind. The intellectually advanced apes have also been portrayed in the same light as their human counterparts. Although the transition from the last installation is not entirely seamless, the script is far more rational compared to 2001's Planet of the Apes which had a sophisticated and highly evolved ape colony enslaving humans. This one has a start similar to I am Legend wherein the human race has been eliminated due to a simian flu triggered by a scientifically developed virus. As expected, a handful of American survivors immune to the virus colonize a small area of San Fransico trying to make the most out of the limited resources available to them. Concurrently, they attempt to establish contact with any potential survivors elsewhere. Gary Oldman plays Dreyfus, a former military man who leads the settlement. Soon they are close to running out of their power backups and the solution to this problem lies in the forest across the Golden Gate Bridge where Caesar and his extended family of apes have built a protectorate of their own. The latter part of the story then revolves around the negotiation and conflict between the ape colony and the group of humans who are trying to bring back the old power source to life. This group of humans is lead by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and Ellie (Keri Russell) though Keri Russell's role comes forth only as a filler for a female lead. Instead of sensationalizing the plot, director Matt Reeves manages to keep it grounded by delving deeper into the humane aspect of the face-off. At the risk of making it look preachy, he tries to show how a future struggle of survival might be more about introspection rather than brawn. Caesar played by Andy Serkis continues to address the whole situation with a rationality which is completely unexpected of an ape no matter how evolved it is. While he has to put up with the rebellious Kobo, Malcolm has a rotten apple of his own to deal with. The movie is successful in driving home its message of the co-existence of good and bad elements in civilization where the good needs to continue to pursue its cause irrespective of the action of the bad (I can only wonder what George R. R. Martin would have thought about that). And it does this without compromising on the entertainment quotient. Andy Serkis does justice to Caesar's character yet again just as he did to Gollum and King Kong. The movie ends with an implicit hint at a sequel but that can only be confirmed by the franchise.",

A fine cast, but there was so little that was distinctive or memorable about characters from either species' cast - again, so stock. Gary Oldman felt wasted in here and looked and acted exactly like he did in Batman.Special Effects - they were impressive. But the modern blockbuster (starting perhaps with 'The Dark Knight'), seems to overstay its welcome with spectacle overkill and if you're like me, you'll do just about anything to avoid sitting through another prolonged action sequence, unless you're fifteen years old.91%...really? I'm not suggesting it's terrible, but to put things into perspective, this film has the same rating as the seminal science fiction film 'Blade Runner'. It seems that reviewers have a very fickle memory indeed...",

To enjoy this story you will have to accept the premise that apes get intelligent, and to also see the developments of struggle for power behind the back of the protagonist. Just like humans, isn't it. However, the story does not go anywhere. I mean, we know how it starts, it is explained in \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" and we know how it ends as explained in \"Planet of the Apes\", so this should be an intermediate part of the saga. But the only thing we learn is what we already learned from the previous film, which is that humans and apes don't get along. In the final film of the saga it is shown that humans get to be submissive, tamed and exploited by the apes, but this transition is not yet made in this movie. That's a missed opportunity, I think. It could have added some spice to the plot.",

This is actually the first sequel to Rise of The Planet of The Apes, which was not related to the other \"apes\" movies, and has not much to do with either the first series 1968-1973, the 1974 TV series, and the re-make film in 2001. confused ?, so was I, but I am trying to fathom it.On its own it is actually a very good film, and better than \"Rise\", it is very thoughtful and has a great story line, A virus has killed most of the human population (timely review this with Covid-19 on the spread at the time of writing) with the few remaining living in the ruined city and the advanced apes living in the forest, of course they come into conflict, but some try to keep the peace whilst others are trying to kill. Its a usual story in mankind except this time one of the sides are apes.It is acted well and directed well, the scenes are well done, photography is excellent, the sets, particularly of the ruined city are great. The CGI is not too brilliant though, a bit better than in \"Rise\" but still not flawless, the apes and other creatures look great, its just when they move, it does not look natural, I know it isn't natural, but they are supposed to make it look natural, but it is getting better. The music was average.I have watched all the original films and these modern ones and there's one thing that bothers me though, and it is quite obvious if you think about it. We humans evolved from apes, and we look like we do now after millions of years evolvement, So why are the apes (apart from those medically enhanced) so advanced after only a few years, and in the old series, after being evolved for 2 thousand years, why don't they look more like us, more upright and less hair?\nThey should have consulted an Anthropologist before creating the costumes/CGI.But its a film, not a documentary, and it is sci-fi/fantasy, so I can't grumble too much, besides it is good, and if it had better music and CGI I would have rated it higher, possibly a 9.",

Ten years later, Caesar leads a new generation of apes and an out of the blue encounter with the humans causes hostility between his ranks and the human survivors.All the ape action one could hope for and more. It's very rare a sequel can equal it's predecessor but Dawn is an exception, it not only pays homage to the classic original series it successfully incorporates emotional throw backs to Rupert Wyatt's Rise notably when Caesar returns home.The effects trump the first instalment and director Matt Reeves's film has a better pace than Rise. Using elements from the limited budgeted classic's follow ups from Beneath, Escape through to Conquest and Battle it also sets new ground in-terms of execution thanks to Reeves skills.There's plenty of action set ups from Reeves and there some truly tense scenes notably from a menacing Koba playing a dumb chimp routine or the first human contact with the apes compound. The emotion oozes from Caesar thanks to Andy Serkis and some ingenious effects. With great sets and a real location feel coupled with the music score, immense sound design and some great acting from Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman (slightly under utilised here) it meets entertainment expectations. There's not just spectacle for spectacles sake, like Rise it feels very much grounded.Dawn gives apes fans both new and old a fantastic cinematic experience. Granted the story by a handful of writers may not have a lot of twists and turns but Jaff, Silver and Bomback offer an intriguing enough script with both subtle subtext and blatant warnings of both past and present to the viewer. Dawn has plenty to say. With no time travel loop story element required (as in the original) lets hope the Icarus astronaut's (from Rise) return thread doesn't raise it's head too early and is handled with as much care further down the line as Dawn of the Planet of the Apes has. Yes it's good. So good in fact you kind of feel guilty for not missing the fantastic Roddy McDowell, bless him. Recommend.",

The apes are photoreal and expressive, and they show sheer genius of the movie makers.But I have to fly in the face of all the folks trumpeting how this is a classic, it's breathtaking filmmaking that transcends typical blockbusters and on and on. The story is concocted by filmmakers eager to set up a big violent battle because it'll be SO COOL and audiences want it. But it makes so little sense and is so implausible I was literally laughing in the theater (the only humor in this film is unintentional; you're supposed to only be awed, angered and upset.)I mean honestly, five people are given three days to resurrect a dam that's been sitting there for ten years, without equipment, support, or as far as I can make out, even a voltmeter. It's taken a whole crew of street maintenance guys two months just to put in a traffic light in my neighborhood (and they've got power tools and can order spare parts from Grainger), but we expect these five (apparently only one who has ever seen a dam before) can pull something like this off in three days. And of course that dam's right in monkey harm way, prompting the battles. They couldn't find some other way to make power in San Francisco? Distill methanol from all the biomass, or use a wind turbine -- the Bay Area's brimming with wind turbines, they're on every hill -- or solar panels? No, it HAS to be the monkey dam, because otherwise there'd be no basis for monkey battles. And why do they supposedly need electricity? Because they have to power their radio to see if anyone else is around on the planet. Couldn't they plug it in to one of the cars they're driving around all over the place? How much power does a radio take? Obviously, at least a dam's worth. I'm sorry, I'm sitting there asked to believe such ridiculous things because everyone says it in such somber, menacing tones, but it's obviously all concocted just to force a big epic ape battle. And frankly, after Transformers and X Men and all the rest of the summer bash, we REALLY need another pointless epic battle.It'll make a ton of money because people really like going to see things get destroyed, and they'll have fun watching apes set up as sympathetic heroes so they can get gunned down. And pseudo-intellectuals will treat it like great art because the monkeys were all so GOOD and humans are so BAD. Bah. It's like playing with toy soldiers, and as uplifting.Enjoy!",

With a name like \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" you already know that the apes win against humanity in the end. It's just a matter of how. Instead, it's a smaller story about a tribe of newly-intelligent apes near San Francisco whose first contact with humanity is an accidental encounter followed by a failed quest for peace between the two sides. As it turns out, the future ape leaders of the world are mostly peace-loving and, despite a few bad eggs, want nothing to do with fighting humanity. But through an unlucky turn of events, one of those bad-apes assassinates the ape leader and blames it on humans. Thus, the apes go to war and quickly roll over the human settlement despite the humans' overwhelming military advantage.The ape war and end of humanity is catalyzed by accidents followed by betrayal, lies, and gross military incompetence. No one can do anything right. It is an unsatisfying story whose main characteristic is its multitude of blunders. I consider the mistake riddled plot to be lazy story-telling. It would have been more challenging to tell a believable story of apes unifying and beating a better human foe, but that story would have been more entertaining.",

Sitting next to one of my friends, I could guess what was going to happen before it happened, literally, throughout the movie.There were multiple to name, however, but there were two that struck me as the most clich\u00e9, and forced me out of the cinema to take a toilet break (which I never do when watching a movie at the cinema). The first was when the power was turned back on and the horrible acting protagonists moved to a store which is know overrun by trees and vegetation. A guy puts on a song and I said to my friend, \"If they start dancing, I'm leaving.\" I subsequently left. Another clich\u00e9 (and extremely annoying) moment was when the main human (somehow not Gary Oldman who had about 4 minutes screen time!) had to run back to get Caeser some supplies (he'd been shot) and I guessed, \"hey, Caeser's son who is the only ape against the new leader not tied up for loyalty, will meet him and ignore him\". It just sucked. Sometimes people say \"that was 2 hours of my life I'll never get back\",well for me,that was 2 hours of my life I'll never get back!Not joking! Highly unrecommended!",

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Matt Reeves. This film is the sequel of the surprisingly good Rise of the Planet of the Apes. When it came out, a few years back now, people were not really into that film but it was pretty good. Matt Reeves actually proves that he CAN direct and deliver a movie which is looking FANTASTIC! This time the film is dealing with a concept of power struggle between Apes and Human but also among the Apes themselves. Plus it shows how people can hate and behave facing difficult times and in front of something that isn't familiar or an other group or race. Along the film we are discovering that Apes are not as different as we could have thought. In fact they are far more evolved than when we met them in the first movie: they have personality, they have interesting inter activities between each others like learning in school, code of conduct, consequences and most importantly a Leader. Caesar definitely steals the movie. We actually get really attach to the Apes. In fact there is no need of words in Apes' dialogues and proper conversations as they use body language, everything can be understood as they have emotional expressions in their eyes. Plus, scenes are all so incredibly powerful and there is a great emotion flawing through the film. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes improves in every ways possible the first film. The Apes are so well realised thanks to the motion capture work, they actually look like real Apes - which is incredible. Plus Andy Serkis never failed at motion capture he is one of the most talented actor of his generation. ACADEMY LISTEN: This guy has to win an Oscar someday! In fact there are few remarkable technological achievement in this movie, such as special effects, music, direction, motion capture looks, and a great emotional core. I was surprised at every turning point in the story throughout the film like \"wait... we're not predictable, let us tell you the story!\" Finally this film seems truly human to me even if the majority of the protagonist are Apes and it's full of content in relation to its length.Overall this film is smartly optimised, it looks great, have very good cgi, it's exciting, it has good action sequences, great relationships and character development.",

            "content": "Had it been the first of the 'Planet of the apes' franchise of movies that i would have been seeing, I'd attach a whole another level of merit to the movie. There ARE of course a few areas where the movie shines up above the previous slices of time presented in this legacy of ape-drama. The apes have been lent a deeper sense of human emotion drawing lines of gray wickedness and a dark demeanor that imparts an almost human like hatred with which the anti-human arboreal Koba leads a vendetta against Caesar and his followers, while the prominent, principle-led flow makes Caesar, the Ape-tribe leader represent almost a human visionary. But then, that's just it. At the outset of a new episode in this saga rolling out, I had anticipated a multiplied level of evolution of the apes with a boost in intelligence beyond what has been showcased so far; after all, it's this evolutionary drama and the constantly evolving and developing ape community that made the planet of the apes series create a solid stir in the seventies. Though the alpha males of the ape colony were the trend-setters, the others remained the followers of the pack and at some point, the need for a few more characters was felt. The mighty and ever-thinking orangutan was such a pleasant character and demanded more to be seen in screen. While darkness prevailed as one of the most fascinating shades of the human-ape encounter, the literal dark treatment and absence of any clarity-rendering light induced a feel of dullness during several moments in the movie. The climax duel of Caesar vs Koba atop the debris of the construction site towers was a potential adrenaline booster. So was the familial sense attached to the Caesar family and the growing enmity which makes Koba fire through Caesar's chest and igniting a mob of revolutionaries from among the hitherto pacified apes. It IS a good movie. It however missed a few niche areas of scoring only a movie like this could have bagged. Let's hope the coming movie in this series does give you a whole shocker value delivering more than what the audience has witnessed so far.",

Obviously, the humans would be hot heads and some of the apes would be hot heads too. There would be an ape who didn't agree with Caesar and kill him because he wouldn't go to retaliate against the humans. Then the apes would go all out against the humans killing them.This is what pretty much happens during the film. Obviously, there are some differences, but as the movie goes along, you can predict the more specific details that happen next.Since the movie got so many great reviews, I was expecting a better film. However, even if it was predictable, it still makes lots of mistakes when it comes to being believable. An example is this ape riding on a horse in the middle of a gun fight with machine guns and never getting shot like all the other apes do riding on horses. Another example is apes falling down or taking big hits and not getting knocked out, injured, or concussed. The last one is that the amount of apes shown in the film is around 100-200. Yet, during this big battle, it goes up to about maybe 500- 700.This makes the film feel really sloppy, which drags it down from maybe an 8-8.5 to a 7/10, which is the same score I gave Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Even though that film was even sloppier, it did have a great emotional bond between James Franco's character and Caesar--something Dawn of the Planet of the Apes also lacks.",

The apes look great and the expressions (eyes, emotions, etc.) are wonderful. The landscape looks great and the film presents a believable post-apocalyptic world. Caesar is well represented and is a great central character to the film. The bad: clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9. It is tiring that movies use the same plot lines and the same types of situations time and time again. This screen writing by numbers has gotten so old and is a sign that there is a lack of intelligent writers in the entertainment industry. It is stupid that a society (apes) would allow one racial bigot to manipulate the entire community to violence when the community is taught not to act that way. It takes away from the storyline in which the director wants you to care about the apes, but they are the ONLY ones who exhibit the violent, aggressive attitude and kill indiscriminately. The apes are the aggressors in this movie and it would suggest that intelligent beings are manipulated by one individual to go on killing sprees. The ugly: the movie tries, at the end, to make a bad guy out of Gary Oldman. The problem is that he does nothing sinister, or evil, the entire film and just because he wants to demolish the tower (that the apes took over) because the apes attacked them without provocation and killed many, many humans does not make him bad. If his character were in any other movie, he would have been a hero. The fact that Malcolm feels for the apes, and yes you may say that Caesar was the reason for that, after they destroyed his entire home and killed a large majority of human beings is a bit over the top. The film started out as an interesting character study and could have pursued more with the apes/human interaction. Instead of going along an intelligent pathway, it instantly turns into a mindless slaughter spree to have the action component at the expense of storyline and believability.",

            "content": "This movie deserves the praise that it's been getting. It was so awesome very well acted, the visual/special effects are outstanding, and the action was breath-taking. Solid characters and story. Directed by Matt Reeves, the movie serves a sequel to 2011's film, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', which is a reboot of the original 1960/70s Planet of the Apes series. The movie takes place, a decade after the Simian Flu wiped out most of humanity; the survivors of San Francisco are trying to rebuild society with power from a local dam. The only problem is that the dam is located, where Caesar (Andy Serkis) build a community of thousands of hunter apes. Seeing no way, around it, Dreyfus, (Gary Oldman), the leader of the human community wants to wipe out the apes community. Second in commander, Malcolm (Jason Clarke) thinks otherwise, and tries to seek out peace with Caesar. However, with mounting pressure from Dreyfus, as well as Caesar's own inner circle from Koba (Toby Kebbell), the two sides might end up in all-out war. A bloody war that Caesar and Malcolm is trying to prevent. Andy Serkis reprises his role as Caesar, as do the other actors who portrayed apes in the previous film, but no others. One thing, really missing in the film is James Franco's character of Will Rodman from the previous film. The last film spent some much thing investing in getting to know his character, only to have the sequel to reduce him as minor call back, with stock footage. You really never got to see, what happen to his character, and that of his girlfriend, Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto). The new human characters are just as bland and wooden as the previous movie was, with the extremely awkward dialogue. Gary Oldman as Dreyfus had too little scenes, in the film. At less, they try to make us emotional invested in his character, when you see him turn on the old IPAD. His final action was quite baffling too - not sure it made much sense given it didn't have much of an impact on the outcome either way. Jason Clarke was alright as Malcolm, but you could put James Franco's Will Rodman in the same role, and it would make the film, six times way better. It would be nice to see Will's conflict of trying to save humanity, while trying to save Caesar. Too bad, James Franco and the producers couldn't make a deal to return. Andy Serkis deserve praise for his role as Caesar. This movie is his movie! Too bad, the Oscars will probably not give him, a chance due to his motion-capture roles. You really see him, as a strong-leader here, challenging his inner King Kong. The CGI apes are so-much better than the previous film. It didn't look CGI, it look like they were really there. Mad props to them, able to create the illusion of wet fur. They look closer to what they look like they did in the 1968 film. Still, a bit too \"primitive\" for a society raise on a smart drug from a high-tech lab. Still, it kinda make sense, since Warpaint and feathers are easily obtained from the natural environment, are light and restrictive, and could serve as identity markers in a wooded/jungle environment where silence might be tactically advantage. The action scenes were way brutal than the previous film. It was nice to see them, put more action in this film, as the last one was indeed, lacking. Still, the whole assassination attempt was a bit rush. Koba was indeed pretty evil, but pretty damn clever. He plays on, Caesar and the human trust. There is a funny scene that remind me so much of a Youtube video of a monkey shooting AK-47 in Africa. Still, it was a bit unrealistic for human still have a hard time, believing that apes are indeed smart, when the last movie show them, hoping weapons and wrecking San Francisco, pretty aggression. I'm surprise that human never went looking for them for this long, when clearly they play a part in the Simian flu. The music score by Michael Giacchino is haunting to listen. Too bad, it's sounds too Dark Knight. I really tell the different. The movie had a lot of symbolism for social commentary. If you pay attention, you might see the graphic novel Black Hole by Charles Burn plays a role of the apes learning to trust the human. The story deals with the aftermath of a sexually transmitted disease which causes grotesque mutations in teenagers. The book was written in a time, where AIDS was killing millions of people around the world. Many believe HIV/AIDS came from apes, originated in non-human primates in Sub-Saharan Africa and transferred to humans. Yes, many believe that AIDS indeed, made in a lab like the Simian Flu. It makes you wonder. Some people might hate the movie, thinking it's offended to certain races. Many might view it as anthropomorphism movie about the plight of the black man from slaves, to dealing with racism, to gaining their freedom. The original 1968, Planet of Apes was an obvious allegory about race. Indeed, people might see that as well. Surprising, the movie does have a surprise end credits audio. Its hints that somebody might not be dead. Still, it was letdown, compare to the ending of the previous film. As of this writing, there are hints to that another movie will be made, and will indeed, be call 'Planet of the Apes'. This will be interesting, how they fit the whole Icarus plot in it. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, it's not for all children. Lots of frighten imagery. The 3D was rarely used. So check it out, in 2D. Overall: Monkey see monkey do. See the movie, indeed. You'll find it, very entertaining.",

With no generated power the humans in the ruined city are running low on supplies, human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) agrees with fellow leader Malcolm (Zero Dark Thirty's Jason Clarke) they should try to reconcile with the apes to activate a hydroelectric dam in their territory, to provide long-term city power, Malcolm is given three days to do so, while Dreyfus remains and arms the survivors with weapons from the armoury. Malcolm is joined by his wife Ellie (Dark Skies' Keri Russell), his son Alexander (Let Me In's Kodi Smit-McPhee) and group members Carver and Foster (Jon Eyez), but he enters the ape community alone, speaking to Caesar he explains about igniting the power of the dam generator, the ape leader allows this, as long as the humans surrender their weapons. The humans slowly bond with Caesar and other apes, mutual distrust starts to subside, there is a moment when Carver is caught with a concealed shotgun, but Caesar's wife Cornelia (Judy Greer) is gravely ill, reconciliation restores as Ellie is permitted to treat her with antibiotics. Meanwhile Koba investigates the human city, he finds the armoury and confronts Caesar, the leader does not want to take any action, the scarred bonobo taunts that he has \"love\" for humans, they get into an aggressive fight, but sticking to the law, \"Ape Not Kill Ape\", he stops himself and forgives Koba, in anger Koba returns to the city, steals an assault rifle and kills two human guards, and he kills Carver and steals his lighter. The dam is repaired and power is restored to the human city, during a celebration for this Koba starts a fire in the ape settlement, and unseen by others Koba shoots Caesar in the chest, he falls from the settlement tree, Koba claims that humans have killed Caesar and orders that the apes wage war against the humans, Malcolm's group hide as the vengeful apes head for San Francisco. The apes steal various weapons from the human city armoury and charge towards the tower, breaching its gates they overrun the building, cause heavy casualties and imprison captured humans, Dreyfuss flees underground, Koba orders to kill all unarmed humans, but apes including Ash refuse, citing Caesar's teachings, Koba therefore kills Ash and imprisons all apes staying loyal to Caesar and his laws. Malcolm and his group find Caesar barely alive on the ground, they take him to his former home in San Francisco, where Dr. Will Rodman (James Franco) raised him, Caesar tells that Koba shot him, knows his notion that apes are better than humans was naive, and he grows nostalgic watching a home video from his childhood, Ellie finds Blue Eyes and brings him to the house to find his father alive. While Blue Eyes returns to the city and frees the caged apes, Malcolm goes to through the city's underground and finds Dreyfuss, him and some men have made radio contact with other survivors in a military base who will send an army to fight the apes, but also Dreyfuss wants to detonate the C-4 underneath the tower. Caesar and the freed apes confront Koba at the summit of the tower, while the leader and the scarred ape fight the C-4 is detonated by Dreyfuss, he dies and the explosion causes part of the tower to collapse, but the fight concludes with Caesar overpowering his enemy, Koba begs for mercy, reminding the leader that apes don't kill apes, Caesar says he is not an ape and lets Koba fall to his death. In the end Malcolm informs Caesar that human military reinforcements were called, both sides realise that the opportunity for peace has diminished, Caesar explains that humans will never forgive apes for starting a war and tells Malcolm to leave safely with his family, Malcolm disappears into the shadows and Caesar gathers with the apes awaiting for battle to come. Also starring Karin Konoval as Maurice, Enrique Murciano as Kemp and Lee Ross as Grey. Oldman is good but perhaps underdeveloped, Clarke and Russell are good at being nice, Kebbell is great as the vicious chimpanzee with a grudge, and of course Serkis propels as the leading ape who despite bad feelings cannot help but empathise with humans. It does indeed feel like a Shakespearean tale, with betrayal, deception and brutality in the mix, it is fantastically scripted, combined with explosive scenes and amazing CGI special effects, it is a most satisfying blockbuster experience that that pulls at both the strings of the heart and mind, a brilliant science-fiction action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",

            "content": "The script for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes starts 10 years after the climax of Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The apes have built their own establishment and civilisation and they are leading peaceful lives. But one day 2 apes suddenly come across a few humans(who they didn't think still existed) and a spell of continued tension begins.I was surprised by the depth of the screenplay. The film is about race relations, slavery, war, politics and also love and family. We are allowed to witness proceedings from the point of view of both sides. Both sides have loving and caring families,both sides have individuals who genuinely want peaceful coexistence and not war, but there are also individuals on both sides who are unwilling to consider anything other than fighting a war for asserting a supremacy over the other side. This could easily have been a movie about a real conflict between two nations and it would have still felt convincing. The screenplay and direction by Matt Reeves is absolutely brilliant. On the surface,this is a summer blockbuster, but to be honest it is so much more than just that. The undertones about diplomacy and how easily the line dividing peace and war can get erased through extremist influences are fascinating to observe.However after mentioning all that about the direction and script, the film still won't be the film it is without the characters and the actors playing them respectively. Caesar is without a semblance of a doubt one of the most charismatic leaders ever put on film. Andy Serkis as Caesar is absolutely flawless. Serkis can be now easily called the master of motion capture, he really doesn't put a step wrong. Toby Kebbell is equally good as the intimidating and extremely intriguing Koba. Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell also deserve a special mention. The great thing about the film is that although there are characters whose opinions you might not find agreeable, but still you will understand the motivation and the mindset of these characters and reasons why they think the way they do.Lastly, I will have to admire the cgi work. The movie looks astonishingly good. The apes look completely real. The opening 10 minutes of the film only focuses on the apes which to some extent reminded me of the opening sequence of 2001:A Space Odyssey and even the score in some scenes resembles that of 2001. The ragged and deserted streets of the cities reminded me of The Walking Dead and there is one long sequence with a single take that reminded me of the long take from Children of Men.In a nutshell, this is an absolutely glorious film. Not once did I find myself disengaged during the film. There are uses of unnecessary minor clich\u00e9s in some parts for additional emotional effect, but they are not enough to make me give the film anything less than 10.This is a 1000 times better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes and I loved Rise of the Planet of the Apes.",

            "content": "If the first movie (Rise) was really much more about and the characters (that is slightly stronger emotion in establishing Caesar and the humans, all of whom are gone now), this is about ideas, and looking at what happens when war is, as is so often in the world of the past and today, an inevitability.What happens when the Apes have to contend with the straggling humans that are left? What happens when a ruler has to contend just as fiercely with dissent in his own government so to speak while also having to find a balance with the 'others' that both post a threat AND want to find a path to peace? like the 1968 Apes movie, more so really, this looks at the world we live in and transmogrifies it into the popcorn world. Captain America did that earlier this year, and so did X Men to an extent. This has so much to chew on in terms of politics (America, dems vs republicans; Israel vs Palestine; \"you're with us or you're with the terrorists\" jingoism) and yet it's a fun movie to watch amid the high drama. maybe the humans are just slightly more developed in the first movie than here (but they are just fine and Clarke and Russel and Oldman do well). Maybe the final battle between Caesar and the rival Magneto/Khan Ape, Koba, becomes too much like any given fight between two rivals in an action movie, and some of the circumstances leading up to it take some suspension of disbelief. But the movie is filled with so much gray areas, so much about how both sides, at least in several circles, want peace or at least stability along with such a towering presence in Caesar (Andy Serkis does his best ape since... King Kong) that it flies in the face of a lot of dumb blockbusters that don't have any thought behind it.",

            "content": "Rise of the Planet of the Apes had intelligent storytelling which paid respect to the old Planet of the Apes franchise taken out of mothball. Just look at the way they set up the Charlton Heston film.Here with a new director it has all gone out of the window as they brush up a bad draft of a X Men film and sprinkle a little of the Lion King and Animal Farm. So you have a setting just 10 years after the Rise movie where Apes have become hyper intelligent and can even speak English even though they have been living in the woods just off San Francisco. They have started to build living quarters, they have domesticated horses and can even ride them.Humans have gone backwards thanks to a simian virus and joined the ranks of the homeless that currently populate San Francisco. They seem to be living in some closed off quarters struggling with power and heat, despite tribes in Africa, Asia and Australia have been living in the open land for thousands of years without issues and so have the apes in this movie, out in the cold forest just off San Francisco and they are advancing in brain power.Caesar is the alpha ape, The Professor Xavier of the movie. His right hand ape called Koba (which happened to be Stalin's nickname, hence the Animal Farm link) distrusts human, he is very much Magneto. When some humans turn up to the woods hoping to repair some old dam their presence causes distrust and tension within the ape community.However even the humans who spend their time whining are not solid. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) wants to reach out to the apes and work together. Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) does not see the Apes as a threat and think they can easily be dispensed with. Although no one notices that as a leader he seems not to have done a good job advancing the human race.Of course these prequels will lead to set up where the apes take over the world but it's rather clumsily done with Koba leading the pack. Ape may not kill ape but Koba rather does it openly. So some apes are worth more the other apes then and the apes do not seem to mind this. In fact Koba can ride a horse and fire guns from both hands at the same time. I am sure San Francisco has a law against hands free horse riding!Outside of the battle scenes at the latter part of the film this was more Yawn of the Apes as I struggled to get into this film mainly because I found the whole story absurd and the script laughable.So you have a party of humans having sensitive negotiations with the apes in the woods. You take with you a guy who hates apes, blames them for the Simian virus (even though the virus was man-made) and wants to wipe out the whole stinking lot off them. Nice move as you have a two dimensional character whose whole plot purpose is to upset some apes and therefore go to war with them.Technically the film is very good with the CGI apes that are more lifelike than some of the human cast who come across stiff or just plain dull, like they cannot believe some of the lines they have been asked to speak.The film is ponderous as it tries to follow on from the first film that was a surprise critical and box office hit. Despite the technical wizardry it is clich\u00e9 ridden and formulaic.",

            "content": "I really liked it! It had a fun, cool depiction of ape culture, and a surprisingly awesome villain in the form of Koba. The great CGI and some terrific voice acting made both Koba and extremely likable Caesar seem real.The action and special effects delivered; this was a nice little darker action flick with a science fiction premise. Koba and the sometimes unsettling battle scenes made this something that would also please horror movie fans as well. The scene where Koba tricks the two men at target practice? Yeesh. Look at that sneer.We've got three cardboard good guys that make up a pretty boring de facto nuclear family. For a better example of how to script post- apocalyptic characters, the screenwriters ought to see \"28 Days Later\" and \"The Walking Dead.\" Jason Clarke's Malcom was sooo nice and intuitively understanding, I kept hoping that one of the apes would knock him upside the head to slap some character depth into him. The far more interesting characters were Koba, Caesar, and Gary Oldman's Dreyfus.Question \u2014 does Kirk Acevedo play a jerk in everything that he's in? I am reaching for an \"Oz vs. Apes\" joke right now, but cannot seem to find it.Question \u2014 I am no techie, but would human survivors really need hydroelectricity just to power a long-range radio? Couldn't something like that be powered by a generator or some other power source?Anyway, this was a fun, darker sci-fi movie \u2014 I'd happily recommend it.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Four years ago you never could've predicted that \"Planet of the Apes\" would be rebooted to critical and financial acclaim, let alone become perhaps the most promising franchises born after 2010. If \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" was a consummate origin story, then \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is a consummate next step in a larger story, and proof that a movie franchise can evolve more gradually and still be grippingly entertaining.The sequel picks up well after the end of \"Rise,\" which implied that a simian virus wiped out a large portion of the earth's population. At this point, the apes have established a village outside San Francisco and their intelligence has grown (as has main ape Caesar's vocabulary). When a band of human survivors stumbles across some of the apes, Caesar (played fabulously once more by leading mo-cap actor Andy Serkis) confronts the colony of human survivors (led by Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman) and issues a stern warning to the humans to let the apes live in peace. However, the apes' home is situated next to a dam \u2014 the humans' only hope for a power source and theoretically their only way to survive.\"Rise\" writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver return and they've remarkably crafted a story as straightforward, suspenseful and emotional as the original (with some help from 20th Century Fox A-list screenwriter Mark Bomback). The entire movie we wait for the other shoe to drop as humans and apes must get along but don't entirely trust each other, and a few dark characters on both sides undermine the good guys: Caesar and Clarke's Malcolm.Caesar is the linchpin of this series. James Franco's character not being part of it says everything you need to know. The fact that the movie spends more time acquainting us with the ape characters than the human ones demonstrates that the creatives behind the film know it too. They should pass that information along to Paramount for the \"Transformers\" franchise.The story is packed with character-building, suspense, painful misunderstandings, betrayal, hope, violence and justice. You really feel the roller coaster ride of the story in your guts, a vicarious feeling that too few blockbusters create, even the really entertaining ones. Caesar is the kind of character that all blockbusters should have and he's entirely done in CGI. That tells you just how crucial good storytelling is to creating characters. They don't have to be human. Not to take anything away from Serkis' brilliance, but Jaffa and Silver should teach a class on screen writing that should be mandatory for the rest of Hollywood's big studio writers. They way they create empathy and stick to basic storytelling tenants in a crude yet effective way is so laudable. And undoubtedly Bomback (\"Unstoppable,\" \"The Wolverine\") helped ratchet up the entertainment factor.Director Matt Reeves picks up on all these terrific moments in the script and nurtures them. He lets the plot breathe and gives it time to snowball, and by the time it does, the audience is so invested in the outcome that the ending doesn't have to be great, it just has to give us what we want, which it does. \"Dawn\" is also thematically stronger than \"Rise,\" taking the idea of both apes and humans having both good and evil tendencies to the next level. It's elementary stuff about human (and ape) nature but in this premise it clicks especially well. Through the eyes of a growing civilization of apes and humanity rebuilding we see the chance for a fresh start for human and ape-kind in, which makes the conflict between them so maddening throughout the film yet also riveting.\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" propels the slow-build of this franchise to the point that it almost feels more like a first entry than a second. That's a good thing. So often franchises work in trilogies, but Fox could turn this into a four-film arc easily with the right story. So far, however, the scope has been kept small, allowing for character moments and that emotional connection. They will have an opportunity to blow the lid off everything, but hopefully Fox has learned a thing or two and will continue to make this about Caesar rather than just a war of apes and humans.~Steven CThanks for reading!

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not your typical summer blockbuster. Not at all. Instead you get a heavy intense drama. A unfolding family saga where Caesar serves as Don Corleone. The visual effects are jaw-dropping, you won't think for a second that what you see on the screen might be CGI effects. That's the level of the technology nowadays.Caesar has grown older and wiser, built a community in the woods and is under the assumption that all the humankind is now extinct. Trouble ensues when the not-so-dead humans appear in the woods.Andy Serkis is just as excellent with the minimalist performance he has to give just as he was in the Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Only problem of the movie is Jason Clarke as Malcolm. Not his character but the actor is highly uninteresting and uncharismatic. Gary Oldman is in my opinion one of the most under-appreciated actors of our time. With so much little that he is given he still creates a mesmerizing character. The true standout character of this film is Koba. I don't what input is from the actor Toby Kebbell or what is the work of the animators but Caesar's second-in-command is an truly terrifying ape. Koba still holds a grudge against the humans and their deeds on him. Through him the director Matt Reeves shows all the horror of the war and what \"animals\" are capable of. Some things shown in the film would get a higher rating but only because it is apes doing these things to each other the creators get away with a PG-13 rating.I've heard that the script has underwent through many changes but I guess this is the best possible one. The first act serves as a reestablishment of the characters and the situation, they are in, the second act just simply put kicks ass and the third act kicks ass as well.I'm glad that these young talents get a chance to show what they have got in themselves so now we have more promising directors to look forward to along with Gareth Edwards. Matt Reeves sure knows how to strike fear into the hearts of the audience because he seems to be one of the few directors who can scare, just as he did with the magnificent Cloverfield. You have no idea how excited for the next Planet of the Apes and I'm sure you will be as well.",

            "content": "Chimpanzees' and other primates' image as mischievous, comical, banana-loving cut-ups has been shattered. As recent studies have established, primates share at least 98% of our genetic code and also share humankind's penchant for killing and eating meat and violently squabbling with others for food, mates, and even territory. Add to that the fact that the average chimp is at least five times stronger than the average man, and you realize that the post-apocalyptic simian society portrayed by \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" (hereafter \"Dawn\") may not be an acid-trip fantasy at all. It just may be an imminent terrifying reality. Maybe those who advocate granting (or have even already granted) chimps and orangutans full-fledged protected human status should reconsider.\"Dawn\" begins 10 years after the end of \"Rise of The Planet of the Apes\" (hereafter \"Rise\") after the mentally-enhanced apes led by Caesar (motion captured again by Andy Serkis) fled San Francisco to the safety of the Muir Woods (replayed in a montage at the beginning of the film). They have established a basic treetop village society, subsist largely on deer, and, though capable of speech, mostly communicate by sign language. An epidemic simian flu has eradicated the human race \u2013 or so the apes believe since they haven't seen a single human in 10 years. However, when a human hunting party stumbles upon a small group of apes and one shoots and wounds an ape named Ash (Doc Shaw), the apes investigate San Francisco's semi-decayed ruins and realize a sizable group of human still survive, led by rational, conciliatory, peace-seeking leader Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and more impulsive, belligerent, and ape-loathing leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman).The reason apes and men have mutually avoided each other is because San Francisco has had enough fuel supplies to support a quasi-civilized existence. But the fuel supply will be depleted within 3 weeks and the only source of alternative power is an electric dam situated in ape territory. Malcolm and his wife Ellie (Keri Russell) a former CDC nurse and her son by another father, the artistic Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) manage to gain an audience with the deeply distrustful Caesar to get permission to re-start the dam, which Caesar grudgingly grants, provided they finish within 3 days and bring no weapons. Malcolm complies.Just as the sensible, \"live and let live\" Malcolm and Caesar complement each other, vengeful, reckless Dreyfus finds a match in Koba, a confidant to Caesar, and a fiery, bitter, aggressive human-hater because of the painful experiments to which human scientists subjected him. So, paralleling Malcolm's and Caesar's efforts at a truce and d\u00e9tente, and even Alex's literary relationship with the orangutan instructor Maurice (Karin Konoval), is Koba's efforts to prove to Caesar that the humans cannot be trusted. And in one of his forays into the city, Koba finds just that proof \u2013 an armory stockpiled with guns, ammunition, and war machines. Nevertheless, Caesar continues to trust Malcolm, so Koba dangerously takes control of things by first shooting and apparently killing Caesar.He then learns to strong-arm and intimidate some followers to grab some of the guns and launch an assault at the human refuge (the former stock exchange, I think) to kill and enslave both humans and apes sympathetic to humans. Koba then ensconces himself within a tower. Fortunately, Koba only wounded Caesar; Malcolm and Ellie locate him and dress his injuries and help Caesar's wife Cornelia (Judy Greer) recover from giving birth to Milo. They even manage to free Koba's prisoners (both ape and human) and regroup at Caesar's childhood home in \"Rise\". Malcolm agrees to buy Caesar time to confront Koba at the tower, but Dreyfus has installed plastic explosives within the tower. Also, since the dam has successfully powered up, Dreyfus's gang has even managed to establish contact with the outside world \u2013 namely a military base up north ready to fly down and help. Can Caesar reconcile with Koba and keep the fragile peace? Or have Dreyfus's and Koba's shameful actions doomed everybody?\"Dawn\", in its blatant but still sober and powerfully effective way, demonstrates the chaos that ensues when anyone (human or ape) abandons reason, harmony, brotherhood and diplomacy and gets caught up in fearful, deadly intolerance. \"Dawn\" magnifies this intolerance through its use by Dreyfus and Koba, whose fear and vengeance have caused indiscriminate death and brought them below the lowest human or ape. In Koba's case it is even worse because, as both \"Rise\" and \"Dawn\" argue, the primates were poised to supersede and be better than the humans because, as one of Malcolm's supporters comments, they combine human intelligence with their natural agility and strength that don't need energy sources and other human comforts. Caesar thought so, too. But with Koba's fall, Caesar grimly admits how alike humans and apes, for better and worse, really are. So when we witness the fires, explosions, attacks, shootings, and assaults both humans and apes in \"Dawn\" commit, we might be exhilarated, but we shouldn't. Instead, we should be sad at a mutually lost opportunity.",

            "content": "As a compulsive purist, it is aching to write this review since I missed the opening scenes for 10 minutes at least, watched it in a shoddy 3D screen and the surging audience after Ramadan blindsided both me and (obviously) the cinema, thanks to a long queue and the lack of countermeasure from the tickets office, what a mood-killing damper!So the first scene I saw is the confrontation between the human squad led by Malcolm (Clarke) and the apes, with Caesar (Serkis) now crowning as their leader. As most of the mankind has been obliterated by deadly virus from the preceding RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2011, 7/10), a desolate dystopia scenario cannot be more familiar to present audience, which effectively tips the scale to the uprising of apes versus man's dominant lethality and sets up as a logical prequel to PLANET OF THE APES (1968, 8/10). The animation capture technology of personifying thinking-talking apes has again proved to be a chief accomplishment in this franchise reboot, Serkis, Kebbell (plays Koba, the ape presents strong animosity toward human race due to the suffering of inhuman treatment in the human lab) and Thurston (plays Blue Eyes, Caesar's eldest son) impressively morph into their primate personages by aping human movements, body gestures and facial expressions with minute verisimilitude. The plot draws lessons from Shakespearean complex, conspires to a ferocious ape usurper and bluntly puts him in the villain default (unlike its prequel, where rapacious human beings are the arch enemy). When the internecine friction takes the stage, mankind is subjugated to sideline, Malcolm and his family are amicable friends, but Dreyfus (Oldman), the leader of the remaining humans and his gangs are frivolous saboteurs doomed in their narrow-mindedness. Jason Clarke believably justifies that he can lead a blockbuster too given a proper chance, him, Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee form a close knit, as the last hope for men; Gary Oldman, bears the ambiguity in his actions, is a pitiful sacrifice for the wrong cause. Apes are the stars, maybe in the next installment, no men is required, the film will still be overwhelmingly compelling, suffice to say, the CGI effect and action set pieces are among the best of the year, particularly the ones involve the mobilities of great mass, gun-wielding apes' charging on the horses, one scene when Koba attack a tank with a 360 degree shot of its surroundings, superbly orchestrated! The final showdown is also fluidly white-knuckle with vivid tumbling down veracity, although the casualty is conspicuously underestimated to create a spectacle that the number of apes is not drastically declined after the monolith wreckage. The director chair is handed from Rupert Wyatt (for RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES) to Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD 2008, 7/10 and LET ME IN 2010, 7/10), a wise decision since the scale and gravitas clearly go up a notch, but the 3D surplus does hurt the viewing, too dim and overstretched in this case, otherwise I might rate it higher, perhaps I should give it another try and catch up with the missing parts. Anyway, it is a pretty marvelous studio juggernaut, devoid of the manipulative eagerness to introduce its sequel, but indeed establishes a solid ground for the next move when the last humanity will be snuffed in the bona fide planet of the apes.",

All the apes acted like people, even down to their fights-punching and wrestling while their huge fangs just hung in their mouths. When the humans were behind bars, surrounded by hundreds of apes pointing guns at them, what did they shout? \"Get us out of here!\" Just where were they going to go? I was ready to leave after 30 minutes. Even the kids I ran into at the exit did not like it. How could so many respected critics have given this the Thumbs Up?",

A human survivor settlement wants to restore a power dam which happens to be also the home and settlement of the apes. The story really is a rather classic one, something we surely all seen before. The biggest draw for this film is the execution. And more specifically the performance of the apes: they squeeze more emotion out of these computer generated monkeys than Keanu Reeves ever showed in his whole career. They also look quite real and convincing. The animation is superb and the rendering almost photo-real. Despite all this praise I think it is a bit overrated. 8,0/10 by 140.000 people on IMDb should warrant an instant classic but for me it's not. I liked it, it's better than the first one, much better than 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes' but it lacked something to make it to my personal favorites list.

            "content": "I knew this movie was going to be something special after the first 10 minutes came and went without the appearance of a single human and all I could think about was how so emotionally taken I was with watching Caesar's ape community interact with one another (mostly through sign language) that I could've sat through an entire feature length film with no human interference at all.Synopsis: Somewhere around 10 years after the results of the previous film (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) caused the supposed mass extinction of all humans, a group of surviving apes and their offspring (lead by Caesar) have built a community on some of the nicer real estate in post-apocalyptic San Francisco. And then humans come and mess everything up.\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is full of \"WOW\" moments. By this I mean, I was so blown away with how the script (full of fabulously crafted Shakespearian themes) came together so wonderfully with a healthy portion of visuals punctuated by CGI textures and visceral direction from Matt Reeves (Let Me In) that I literally uttered the word \"WOW\", out loud at least a dozen times throughout my viewing experience.The Direction: When I think back on the history of primates in film, the difficulty directors tend to have (on a technical level) with portraying such an undeniably intimidating animal such as a gorilla or a chimpanzee in a manner that is even the slightest bit intimidating, has always been baffling to me. For this reason above all, I must heap praise onto Matt Reeves. There were moments when watching \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" when I got the same uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach, as I had the last time I stood in front of the gorilla sanctuary at the zoo and realized that if I were any closer I could be ripped to shreds on a whim. I can guarantee I've never had this same experience watching any other cinematic primate.The Acting: From the trailers alone \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" would seem as though it stars the likes of Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and Andy Serkis. But in reality, it stars Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell who play the two prominent lead ape characters, Caesar and Koba respectively; both giving nomination worthy performances. Every other actor portraying a non-ape character is aggressively secondary to the plot and should be considered as part of the supporting cast in a movie that didn't necessarily need a supporting human cast.If you've read my reviews before, you know that I'm a glass half empty kinda guy; a constant \"hater\". Or so they say. So, allow me to get off of this film's jock for a second and address a few things. If there are flaws in this sequel, they are minute; buuuuuuut\u0085there are a few. The first being the miraculous resurrection sequence of a major character (that's about all I can say about that, without spoiling anything) which garnered audible groans from a few in the audience I sat with. The second flaw comes near the end by way of a 3 minute, woefully sappy, end of \"Rocky 4\", \"if I can change, and you can change, everybody can change\"-esque back and forth between two characters. That said, there is way too much here to admire (the storytelling, the performances, the action sequences, etc.) to make a big deal out of forgettable \"flaws\" such as those. So\u0085moving on.Final Thought: If I sat most teenagers down in front of the 1968 classic, \"Planet of the Apes\", it wouldn't take long for them to openly disregard the fantastic premise, underlying themes of racism and a delightfully dark ending that most big budget films nowadays couldn't possibly get away with, simply because the look is very dated and the camp factor is very 60's centric. With 2001's Tim Burton remake, we saw an instance of millions of dollars thrown into a production, with the end result being a film that is still panned across the board, to this day. But with \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" (directed by Rupert Wyatt) and \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\", what we are witnessing is this same (if not similar) premise, based on the ridiculous notion that apes can now speak, but this time it's done in such a way that not for one moment during either of these films (both of which apes speak, and one of which apes ride horses and shoot firearms) are things perceived as campy or unintentionally silly. That is the reason why these new Planet of the Apes remakes work. It's not so much the million dollar visual effects or the overall entertainment factor. It's the fact that a packed theater, filled with people from all walks of life, sat and watched a two hour movie where apes talk, and not one of them snickered.",

But instead what i get is a very \"National Geographic\" scenes in the first 10 minutes which makes me wonder is this a TV show or a movie? I came watching this movie with a quite low expectation and it surprises me with a well developed plot, a stunning emotional and intelligence portrayed by these apes and the conflicts that leads to war between apes and the human colony. These apes kinda reminds me of the Red Indian people, but this time the \"Red Indians\" will win and the American cowboys will fall from their horses and die.When i see the word \"dawn\" I was expecting the apes is already conquering the whole planet and humans is already enslaved/massacred in this movie. Perhaps what I really don't like to see would probably happens in the next movie, which probably titled \"The War of the Planet of the Apes\". But I'm still intrigued with what might happens in the next movie.And I would like to end this review with a quote from myself for the movie; \"It will be the end of mankind when humans start thinking like an ape and lost their sense of humanity.p/s: an exciting film to watch for anyone with a brain that they use for thinking ;)",

It was even turned into a stage musical featuring everyone's favourite actor Troy McClure.Then, over 40 years on (Let's ignore the Tim Burton atrocity, for his sake) they decided to start from the beginning again, with Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes (You can always count on these movies for having long titles). This was a very intelligent and moving precursor to future events, with a superb climax on top of the Golden Gate bridge. The ape costumes were amazing too.Now we have the sequel, which is just as thoughtful and heart rending as the 2010 entry, but ups the action ante to 11. There are several fight scenes, between hordes of men and simians, which could grace the final reel of any blockbuster movie ever made. Here though, they only act as a taste of what's to come...The fact that they maintain the perfect balance between pathos and violence throughout is fantastic, and ranks this as one of the most impressive big budget spectaculars I've seen in recent years. And looking at it's unqualified success at the box office, It just goes to show: you don't have to dumb down to win the audience's approval.Other film studios, take note. 8/10",

            "content": "In 2011 the long dead Planet of the Apes franchise got an unexpectedly successful reboot with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Nobody expected it to kill at the box office like it did, and as a result a whole new franchise was born. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes marks the second, and certainly not the last, film in this franchise and it's a noticeable improvement on the first in some places, and a step backwards in others. Of course, if you're like me and you have a soft spot for dystopian sci- fi, this blockbuster can deliver a solid two hours of entertainment.Dawn picks up a few years after the events of Rise where Caesar and his ape army fled to the Redwoods just before the aptly named Simian flu begins spreading and killing off the human population. Dawn kicks off by introducing us to the post apocalypse where the majority of the human population is dead, and the ape population has grown considerably. The apes now have their own civilization established in the woods; a civilization I was really excited about at the beginning of the film and would have liked to see more of. Instead, those pesky humans come in and interfere with everything, which sparks the central and, after a while, long winded conflict of the film which is humans vs apes. Caesar, because of his upbringing with humans, still wants to trust this race that many of his ape counterparts, specifically Koba, the film's main antagonist, vehemently despise. Unless you're absolutely oblivious you can pretty easily assume that when the humans need help from the apes it kicks off a whirlwind of driving conflict that carries forth an explosively action packed plot. If it's nothing else Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a lot of fun. Like, an absolute blast. Every year I feel like motion capture technology improves exponentially, and 2014 is no exception, with Dawn displaying awe inspiring motion capture performances that blend so seamlessly with the rest of the film. The illusion of movie magic is never broken. The raging human v ape battles are as exciting and as spell binding as they should be. Then, at the same time, the more sentimental and intimate ape moments feel just as real as everything else with an impeccable amount of detail going into each and every ape we see on screen. They certainly feel more authentic than the tiredly straight forward human story. Thanks to astounding technology and fantastic performers, the motion capture performances are honestly better than any of the human performances in the film. Where Dawn suffers is obviously not in its grandeur or its effects, it's the fact that it has traded in layered storytelling for a whole lot of simplicity. Dawn doesn't have a deep seated conflict or textured characters for us to sink our empathetic teeth into. One of the things I really thought Rise did well was the pacing at which it told Caesar's story and detailed his struggle. It felt very authentic and believable as we watched Caesar grow up trying to discover why he was different from all the other apes he was surrounded by. Watching his coping with abandonment and betrayal by his human friends feels so real and my sympathy with Caesar knew no boundaries during Rise. With Dawn we are repeatedly hit over the head with \"Caesar trust humans. Koba no trust humans. Caesar love humans more than apes. Koba love apes more than Caesar. etc, etc, etc.\" This dichotomy is laid out within the first 20 to 30 minutes of the film, but we get to be constantly reminded of how it works for the next hour and a half. Dawn doesn't have the storytelling chops of its predecessor, and its script, chock full of unnatural and poorly disguised plot forwarding devices, also leaves something to be desired. But what Dawn does have is the setting, the dystopian post apocalypse world that has been created here is awesome, and the great action set pieces that persist for two hours left testosterone fueled adolescent me very happy. The side of me that appreciates great storytelling was underwhelmed, but not enough to say that I didn't really enjoy Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.",

It was playing simultaneously in the same Philippine mall in the non 3D version which had cheaper tickets. I was never into the planet of the apes movies since I saw an early one with Charlton Heston in it I think. This 2014 was a heck of a lot better for a number of reasons. I have no complaints since it was a thorough hardworking film and it was certainly not a rip off. It does give value for money, especially if you buy into the premise. It is quite convincing and has a good sense of drama and depth. What The Weight by the Band was doing on the soundtrack beats me. I love the song and always have. It just seemed incongruous in the context of the movie. Yes the special effects were good and many scenes were interesting if invariably dark hued. But here is the thing for me: I just wasn't that interested in what happened to the characters of either species. That may not be the film's fault but it is how I felt. There were no holes in it that I could see and as I said it managed to be convincing. However I just could not get into it. It started a bit slowly and that's fine, but it never actually grabbed me or compelled me to be enthralled. I am not blaming the movie though, so maybe I just wasn't in the mood. Still do go and see it if you are into post apocalypse set pieces or science fiction. Perhaps through not fault of its own it just wasn't to my taste.

            "content": "10 years after the events of 'Rise of Planet of Apes' got over, the events of 'Dawn of Planet of Apes' follow. We saw that some virus originates causing an epidemic called simian flu spread across the globe during the closing credits of the previous installment. The same events are show in the opening credits of this one. Most of the humans on the earth's surface are wiped out and few who are alive seem to be somehow immune to the virus. While the apes lead by Caesar have established a new home in the forest and growing in population day by day. The group of human survivors need a dam to be back in operation so that they get electricity but the problem is it lies close to the ape territory. And there the differences on both sides start to begin.Caesar played by Andy Serkis(motion-capture) is definitely my favorite character from both Rise and Dawn. His character is well written and Andy Serkis has done a marvelous job. Despite knowing nature of Humans he still is sure not every human is bad. While in the other camp of humans, people are panicking as the apes are smarter than ever and feel threatened. Gary Oldman isn't at his best but does his job. But its Jason Clarke as Malcolm who is more likable. The bond between Malcolm and Caesar that slowly and strongly develops is one of the strongest points in the film. Also other positive includes, the tension that builds up on each side on the slightest doubt against each other.The CGI and motion capture is also top notch. The post-apocalyptic environment is quite haunting and effects on apes are damn good. Its doesn't not look perfectly realistic but still one of the best works in recent times. The weak point of the film is it gets quite predictable and towards the end turns into routine action flick filled explosions and more CGI. Also some plot advancements might not make much sense,but its bearable. The ultimate point of film in my opinion is that no one perfect on either side, which is the main cause of misunderstanding. Humans are always feel threatened when they see something far advanced while apes are afraid of humans destroying their species like they destroyed earth. One point where Caesar says \"I always think ape better than human. I see now, how much like them we are.\", kept me thinking about our nature for quite some time.Dawn is way different movie compared to Rise. So if you liked the first one because it featured a playful pet-ape Caesar than don't expect same thing here. But still despite its flaws Dawn of the Planet of Apes is strong movie with good intellectual and emotional depth. Only if they did not make it feel like a blockbuster action flick in the second half it would have been pretty much betterRATING: [3.5/5]",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the sequel to the Planet of the Apes reboot, which turned out to be a surprise both in terms of reception and financial gains. Thankfully, this film expanded on the goodwill that film left behind and created one of the more moving, action-packed sequels in recent history. For every minute of action, there is a minute of emotion which I love in blockbusters. I love how the film focuses on the aspect of the chimps' lives and how they perceive the humans as a threat. The third act, however predictable, doesn't let up on the action. The one standout here, other than Caesar of course, is Koba. Koba is an angry monkey who lost his family at the hands of humans, and he will do everything he can to kill them all. Matt Reeve's film takes place years after the events of the first film. The chimps have created their own society, lead by Caesar. They believe the humans to have gone extinct. But after a chance encounter with some humans near their home, whom are lead by Malcolm, humans and monkeys start to battle each other to see who are the dominant species. The acting is really good. I wish James Franco returned, but luckily the people who took his place are just as good, if not better. Jason Clarke does a very fine job as Malcolm, one of the few humans who actually believe the humans can co-exist with the chimps. Keri Russell is decent as Malcolm's wife. Gary Oldman is back in top form as the sleazy leader of the human compound. On the monkeys side, Andy Serkis returns as Caesar and does a great job in one of his famous motion-capture roles. Toby Kebbell does a great job as the surprising menacing villains, Koba. Overall, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes proves that the first film was no fluke. When done right, this franchise can be very entertaining. The questions imposed on us is what would happen if any species other than humans would rule the world. This is a fine look at that answer. A very fun, action-packed movie that also has several key emotional scenes that flashbacks the first film in a memorable way. I am positively giddy in thinking about the third film, because the ending means good stuff will happen. My Grade: A+",

Despite the fact that this movie is heavily marketed to kids, it's also extremely bloody and violent, with the apes throwing another ape off a balcony, and you are treated to a loud splat!. Then, there are the apes machine-gunning humans to death. But, still, we are told that the apes are the good guys who are just responding after the humans invaded and killed an innocent ape boy. I felt like I was watching CNN coverage of the \"innocent\" HAMAS Palestinians weeping over their dead boys while nobody gave a crap or remembered the three Israeli Jewish teens who were kidnapped and murdered for no reason.The movie takes place ten years or so after the first \"reboot\" of the \"Planet of the Apes\" movies, \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" (read my review), which I didn't think was all that great, but is a masterpiece compared to this. A virus has wiped out most of the human race, and there is no electric power. Humans live in one area (and most of civilization is overgrown and abandoned), and apes live in the woods. The apes are a super race of apes because of the experimentation that's been done on them by the evil humans ten years earlier.Soon, humans decide to invade ape territory because they want to fix a dam in order to restore electricity. But an evil human murders an ape son, and it breeds hatred of humans within the ape population. Only the peaceful head of the apes, Caesar, holds the apes back. But his rival, Koba, hates humans after the killing, and he tries to murder Caesar and frame the humans for it. This starts a war, with the apes invading the human area and killing and imprisoning them.Sounds like an anti-ape movie, right? Nope. Even with all this, it is \"all the humans' fault.\" Like I said: CNN HAMAS coverage or Trayvon Martin coverage. And I've had enough of that in real life news. I don't need to pay to see it in a dark movie theater in a long, boring silver screen diatribe.And neither do you (but if you must, do not pay extra to see it in 3D \u2013 the 3D stinks).

Which puts the two movies together quite nicely, especially if you watch these back to back.The storyline in \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is good, and it picks up a good pace right from the very beginning, and it continues on in this pace all throughout the entire movie, which leaves for a very entertaining movie experience.Furthermore, the characters in the movie, both man and ape, were well-rounded and detailed, having distinctive personalities, traits and characteristics.And they had a great ensemble of acting performers on the cast list. I did really enjoy Gary Oldman in his role in this movie, as it felt like the role was custom-written specifically for him. Andy Serkis did a great job with his performance as Caesar. But it was generally a nice thing to see a relatively unfamiliar ensemble of cast for a movie such as this.The special and practical effects in the movie was quite good, and it really worked out quite well because it was so realistic to look at. And having good special effects is a definite must for a movie of this kind.There is a good amount of action in \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" as well, combined with an interesting story.My rating of this movie is a very solid 7 out of 10 stars.",

            "content": "First, a 3 is what I give the movie only for the special effects. Compared to the CGI in older flix like the Matrix, in many cases you could almost believe they were real apes running around with guns.As for the story?? O...M...G...!! When the people started applauding at the end, I wanted to stand up and shout what the H-E double hockey sticks. The plot is simply unbelievable. For 10 years, humans are hold up in San Fran proper....with fuel..but no electricity. Uh?? No one thought to take a drive to the Ace hardware to get a generator? Yes a drive cuz they got trucks and jeeps and even an assault vehicle that FEMA left behind..oh and mountains of guns, but not one generator? What about private homes...?? NO ONE had a back up gen, or the office buildings they were living around in?But I digress..first they want to show that the monkeys all live this idyllic life on the other side of the bridge, complete with JUNGLE SOUNDS YOU WOULD NORMALLY ASSOCIATE WITH A MOVIE SET IN Africa!! UuuuuHHH??!? A group of dumb humans are wandering through monkeyville when they run across the monkeys and a trigger happy loser shoots and WOUNDS a monkey. So in order to show they are not monkey killing savages, the humans lower their guns and say sorry, we won't do it again. Wait if you are so humane and caring and none threatening, wouldn't you want to offer to help the wounded monkey, pull the bullet, patch him up? Nope, just leave and NEVR INQUIRE AGAIN about the wounded monkey boy.This is just the beginning of the absurd and ridiculous plot and it's twists and turns. Another incident...We're told the monkeys did rampage and kill many humans along with the \"simian\" Flu. This has been the environment for 10 years. And no electricity either so the two losers who are supposed to be guarding the munition dump, probably never saw \"Bedtime for Bonzo\", would not be entertained so easily by the circus like antics of bad monkey. Who of course dupes them into a false sense of security, to the point of the humans offering the monkey whiskey, which monkey spits in their faces, so he can get their gun and mow them down.This only 2 of many holes, loops, twists, turns, that make no sense, add nothing to the plot, which is as predictable as the sun coming up in the morning.And of course, Hollywood recycles an old story, because they have no imagination, no originality. Proof, that as a society we are truly circling the drain. I say we give up now, turn it over to the monkeys so we won't be subjected to this sort of dreck again.Sigh.",

            "content": "I struggled with Planet of the Apes reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes, finding the plot dreary, human lead James Franco rather bland, and the CGI ape effects less than convincing. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is far better in terms of storyline, progressing the narrative nicely into post-apocalyptic territory, and the digital trickery to bring the apes to life has improved. That said, I'm still not 100% sold on computer generated animals: it's clever stuff, to be sure, but even the best CGI isn't good enough to convince me that they're anything but pixels.Take the opening scene, for example: an army of apes hunts a herd of stags through the woods, only to be confronted by a bear. All of the animals are CGI, with the fancy camerawork swooping in and out of what is a presumably CGI enhanced environment. It's an overload of not quite completely credible visual wizardry that immediately reinforces the fact that most of what we are seeing has been realised with a fancy 3D software package. Since so much of the rest of the film relies on this technology, the whole experience, no matter how skilfully told, doesn't quite sit right. It's a shame because the acting and direction are very good, and the writing enjoyable (not always plausible, but still fun) with plenty of pathos and loads of action, as the human survivors of a 'simian flu' epidemic come to blows with a civilisation of intelligent apes lead by chimpanzee Caesar (performed via motion capture technology by Andy Serkis).If you're a fan of all things ape, then the positives outweigh the negatives, ensuring that the film is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. If anything, it does provide the awesome sight of a snarling chimpanzee riding a horse while firing two machine guns.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",

I was waiting for something to hold my interest but there just didn't seem to be even that. There were four groups of individuals, good humans (who like monkey people) bad humans (who hate monkey people) good monkeys (who tolerate humans) and bad monkeys (who hate humans)and that was about it. Good cgi I guess and lots of mock anger and angst from all parties involved oh, and shooty shooty bang bangs but what was the story - what was the point of it. I think it was at best, a movie that was of straight to TV and DVD quality at best. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to seeing it.

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Admitting a weakness is the first step. Yes, I am a proud, long-time fan of this series. My soft spot for these films began when I was a kid - mesmerized by the 1968 original, while watching from the back seat of the car, as the clunky metal speaker hung on the window and my parents sat in the front. Oh, and yes, I was wearing my pajamas! It's pretty much impossible to describe the technological advances in movies since Charleston Heston stumbled into one of the biggest shocker endings the movies have ever provided (and that was 46 years ago!). Heck, the advances since the 2011 movie with James Franco is staggering to see. The combination of real actors, CGI and fantastic motion capture technology make for a realistic look that is unsettling at times.Many know the work of Andy Serkis (Gollam, King Kong) who is considered the master of motion capture acting, and here he returns as Caeser, the leader of the apes. Only this time, he has real competition, especially from Toby Kebbell as Koba, his friend who was previously mistreated in the lab by humans ... thereby explaining their opposite view of the few remaining humans.This entry from director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) picks up 10 years after the 2011 movie. The apes have established a very cool community in the forest, while only a few immune humans survived the lab-born simian virus that was leaked. The apes have continued to get smarter and even have their own culture and code (apes don't kill apes). The surviving humans have fought amongst themselves and only recently organized a faction with Gary Oldman's Dreyfus as their leader. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) takes a small group over the Golden Gate to see if they can reignite a dam which could produce the energy so desperately needed in human town.Almost immediately, humans and apes meet. The big philosophical chess match begins with Malcolm and Caeser negotiating for cooperation and peace, while Koda and Drefus see war as the only solution. Alliances are drawn, fragile accords made, loyalties are questioned, and hierarchies crumble. See, it turns out the apes are like us, and we are like the apes.There is a terrific battle scene, but the real joy here is the personalities and look of the apes. It is fascinating to watch the interactions ... and that final shot is startling! The only downside is the caricature of Carver played by Avecedo. He is the token human d-bag but his character is so over the top it ruins most of his scenes. Luckily, there are very few ... and they are offset by the really cool horse dismount displayed by Caesar. If you buy into this, it's a tension-filled jolly good time.",

I didn't watch the first one on the big screen and only got it on DVD so in a way I had very little idea what the movie was about. However, after watching the film, it was quite good not one of my top 5 but definitely in the top 10At first I was wondering if this was a reboot or a remake since I really expected the character Will (James Franco) to return if it were a sequel. Sadly, I was proved wrong and it was a sequel without Franco returning. I really liked his character and really wished he would end up meeting Caeser again sine the chemistry that they had were very touchingThe movie was quite long but the story was well told, pretty unique and questions ones trust and faith that he puts in others. Jason Clarke plays his role verywell as Malcolm and he but I wasn't much into his character in the movie. Keri Russell in my opinion puts on a more convincing performance than Clarke and she really helped build up a lot of tension to the film. Gary Oldman was also good for his part as a politician type kind of guy trying to keep everyone together from panickingThe twist during the film was really the surprising moment from me but in a way, half way through the film, I could already see it coming. Another thing is that there was not much 3D effects to see in the film so I would recommend sticking to the regular 2D tickets. Overall, the movie was rather enjoyable and I hope they'll make more improvement on the sequel",

Well, from my personal point of view, I didn't see any 3D. Maybe a little bit when the apes look down at the humans from a higher point, but in general 3D doesn't do it for me. It's not worth the extra money. At the beginning the apes come to the city and say something like : \"Apes do not want war, but we will fight!\". At that exact point the movie was over for me, apes and humans can live peacefully together, no need to seek out confrontations. How the movie progressed after that was very illogical for me.And why would you use sign language if you can talk!!The CGI is not bad, but the posture of the apes didn't seem to real to me. Apes riding horses with a straight back i.e. Evolution doesn't happen over night. If I was one of those motion capture actors, I'd go study chimp behavior and body language.Why does a chimp rule over all other apes? Including gorilla's? Isn't it \"survival of the strongest\"? Isn't a gorilla heavier and stronger than a chimp?The longer I think about it, the worse my opinion gets of this movie.",

The apes have evolved awfully fast to my thinking, having a functioning society where they communicate and build. Of course, the two forces eventually meet. All the clich\u00e9s emerge, with the humans being fundamentally evil (well, the apes have their moments as well). There is all kinds of give and take, but prejudices take over and violence emerges, eventually leading to an upcoming war. One previous reviewer hit the nail on the head, however. If one asks any questions about what has emerged in the human camp, there are way too many crimes against reality. Everyone seems well fed and prosperous (although we are told supplies are running out). How are they getting enough food? What is their day to day purpose in life. They all seem to spend too much time grousing about things. Anyway, the animation and computer graphics are amazing. The apes are much more interesting than any of the humans.

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an intelligent, beautifully crafted sci-fi film featuring some of the best CGI work since Avatar. With 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the bar was set high for Dawn and it definitely meets the criteria for not only a sequel but a great summer film. Set years after the events of Rise, Earth is overrun by the apes and the humans are almost extinct. When a group of humans stumble into ape territory, it is a battle between humans and apes as they are led into war for all the wrong reasons. This film works well as we try and understand Caeser as well as the humans. While it is easier for the audience to relate to the human motives throughout the film, it does a great job of showing the ape's side of things, almost to a fault. Director Matt Reeves spends much time with Caeser and the apes, showing that there are two sides to every war. While this remains fascinating throughout the film and holds your attention, you do start to feel fatigued by the idea after the first half of the film. By then you're wishing for further character development with the humans that simply never arrives. The lead actors, Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke and Kerri Russell are all very good in this. But the standout here is Andy Serkis as Caeser. Serkis brings a human element to a clear cut animal and makes it impossible for you not to fall in love with his character and truly care about him. It is a very layered and auteur performance. Director Matt Reeves proves that he is a forced to be reckoned with here. The action sequences are well constructed, the cinematography is top notch, and the overall storytelling works. Overall, this is one hell of a summer movie that really gets your blood pumping. It is smart, funny, action packed and thrilling...all the ingredients for a fantastic film.",

Even the main ape antagonist, who's militant sensibilities stem from a deep-rooted mistrust in humanity established in the prior title, has reasonable and somewhat supportable motivations.

When the two opposing factions collide they are drawn into battle due to misunderstanding, ignorance, mistrust and the instinct to survive.Never having seen any of the previous Planet of the Apes films, not even the originals, I cannot attest to this film's story continuity in relation to its predecessors. As a standalone film the plot itself is self sufficient and intuitive in its progression. The narrative within Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not original, and its pedantic telling using apes as a metaphor is monotonous and long winded.The film itself is over two hours long, which is completely unnecessary and extremely detrimental to ability to captivate the audience. By the one hour mark you are already longing for the film to progress in the expectant manner, which it does, it just takes an entire hour more. Fans of the franchise won't find this at all off-putting but those with an affinity for science fiction or action films could easily find a superior substitute elsewhere.Watching Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a cumbersome experience and in the end feels more like work to get through rather than entertainment.

Sitting through it was very hard. There were a lot of 'flowery' (normally I would say gay, but I don't want the PC Police crucifying me) moments.And quite frankly, I ranted about the main problem before I went in: the main character is a CGI ape. Same problem as the previous remake. I don't care about monkeys. They are cute as all hell, and I like visiting them at the zoo, but they are still animals. I will cry and love a human a lot more than a monkey or any animal. I love my cat but will probably not need a therapist when he dies, but will need one when people I hold dear to me, pass away.Even if I could somehow get emotionally invested, the character is CGI, fake, created by humans who are good at art and software. It's hard for me to forget this and to convince my mind that it's real. Sure I can drink free wine and lose myself within the story when aided by choc-top, but subconsciously, no.

I love the idea that Caesar has seen both the good and bad side of the humans while Koba has only seen the bad side. Which is why all Koba knows is hate. This film is mostly all about the apes. There are human characters but the main characters are the apes, so there are some human characters who feel like they are just there because they have to be for plot, and don't really do anything. But the main human characters all do a great job with the realism in there acting.There really wasn't anything I disliked about the film. The only thing I didn't like is that I wish they told us more about what happened to James Franco (except for that one tear jerking scene), but I also like the fact that they leave it for you to think. He probably just died from the virus.My favorite thing about this trilogy is that it makes you root against your own kind. Like I'm actually rooting for the humans to lose? That's good filmmaking right there. But, it's also scary because when you think about it in the perspectives of the humans it is absolutely terrifying. Imagine an ape charging at you, screaming, and holding a machine gun. F-k that.Overall, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an amazing film. Even better than the first. The action scenes and the CGI are fantastic! The acting is Oscar worthy, the cinematography is beautiful, and the storytelling and characters you genuinely care about. There wasn't a moment in this film where I felt bored, as I was always invested in the story and what was going on. This film is an amazing example of an action drama that does everything right. A nearly perfect film.This film is also insanely quotable, and when I first saw this film when I was 13 you would catch me and my friends yelling \"APES. DO NOT. WANT. WAR.\" on the daily.",

            "content": "Ever since \"Rise of the Planet of the apes\" was advertised, I've loved the direction this \"old worn out\" franchise is taking, and it seems a lot of other people are now on-board too. I mean, with the exception of \"Batman,\" what other franchise that's been \"rebooted\" was actually in dire need of it, and has actually pulled it off in a totally new, creative and original way? To get straight to the point. \"Dawn of the Planet of the apes\" is what \"The Dark Knight\" was to \"Batman begins.\" In that its successful in living up to the impossible expectations set-up after the surprise praise put upon number 1. If not completely surpassing those expectations.What worked for the best in \"rise\" is built upon with this one. Yes, Ceaser, the leader of all of these super intelligent apes is still the star of the show, brought to life with amazing motion capture CGI, and the under-praised actions of Andy Serkis. But what's going on around him is equally amazing. With the entire films special effects being at their best.There's a lot more use for the other apes this time as well, with the people behind their actions making some of the other characters equally as compelling As Caeser. But its still the story that comes first, and the film is made all the stronger for it. In the old movies you had to sustain disbelief a lot when it was just guys in rubber suits playing the apes, but here, you believe these characters are real when they act like apes, and completely forget your watching an animated animal when these guys are talking.The First movie had a couple of daft bits, but this one (surprising as it sounds) feels completely believable and not stupid at all. Its stories great and unpredictable, its effects are amazing, there's heartfelt moments, exciting moments,creepy moments,and even a few funny ones. With the whole thing being brought to life with modern, unique computer altered performances, that have to be seen to be believed.Maybe i'm being to generous, but I really can't praise this movie enough. Too call it a great sequel is un-fair because its more than that, and is possibly the first film i've seen in years that I may even add to my \"All time favourites.\" But is that all that surprising when \"Dawn\" is so damn near flawless.",

            "content": "Gosh, I really enjoyed this movie. My high expectations were fully met. This is a technically amazing, gripping and well-written film.It is also an intelligent and thought-provoking film. A lot has happened to us since 1968. We root for the apes now. We have integrated the imminent destruction of our planet into our value system. Mother nature striking back seems right to us. Trust and conflict are the main themes in this movie. The villains are yahoos and hotheads.What surprised me most was the technical artistry in showing both the anthropomorphism and the simian nature of the ape characters and this new strange simian society. With only very few exceptions, it all seemed utterly life-like to me. This all raises issues for me about what a movie like this actually is. What did I watch exactly? You can't call it just computer-generated animation, but nor is it ordinary acting. Our cinematic technology seems to have taken a quantum leap. In the first movie we had human actors in plastic masks, but now we've elevated this concept, this franchise, into something wondrous.I don't know enough about movie making to know who else is responsible for this exactly, but the movie credits includes a huge list of designers, make-up artists, technical people and so on. I suppose Weta Digital played an essential role.I don't think it is absolutely necessary to have seen \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" first in order to enjoy this one, but I do recommend it. However, these two movies are unrelated to the earlier movies. You needn't see the earlier Planet of the Apes movies to understand and enjoy these two. However, I appreciate the way they are trying to stitch the two series together. And I like the neat scenario they've developed to explain how a planet dominated by apes could arise.One quibble with this movie is with the depiction of weaponry and firefights. Why was there such a huge stockpile of weaponry there? Why were the humans living in a fortress and still walking around with guns? Who would they be shooting at? It's like being barricaded and armed is the \"default setting\" for American film makers. \"The power has run out! Barricade the door and fetch the gun!\" Except extend this for ten years. I suppose I (as a movie goer) reacted the way the film makers wanted, and this reflects a certain reality in America, but I found it annoyingly clich\u00e9 and unduly American. This movie could have been made without the heavy firepower. I suppose we should be grateful there were no monstrous lizards or robots, no enormous flying spacecraft, and no superheroes.Another quibble was that not enough time was spent showing us the human survivor group and how it was able to function exactly.Also, I suppose it's unrealistic for apes and a simian society to evolve like this after only ten years. This wasn't adequately explained.But let me tell you: none of these quibbles ruined the film for me. I would go see this one.",

Now humans are a minority, a race facing extinction (what an irony!) that apes seem to be able to seriously threaten. The contact between them reminded me of the difficult and dangerous understanding between different communities when distrust prevails. We can imagine something similar in moments of our past, like the first contact between European navigators and indigenous peoples of the Americas, for example. Distrust, fear, displays of power to intimidation... the film shows these in a very interesting way, with the apes being very similar to us, in behavior and way of think. Unfortunately, the whole film is quite pretentious and full of self-importance: both sides have an exaggerated awareness of the relevance of events to their own community. This is the most boring point of the movie. The actors do a good job, but non-human characters get more interest and dominate the scene. Technically, the film doesn't deserve major criticism. CGI is more cautious than in the first movie and seems more real. Sequences of combat and action are breathtaking, certainly pleasing to those who seek action and adventure.",

            "content": "Those of us that go back as far as the original \"Planet of the Apes\" (1968) would likely have registered our deepest impression in the scene (SPOILER: for those who know nothing about THAT movie) where Charlton Heston crumbled in total despair at the foot of the remnants (but still recognizable) of the Statue of Liberty.Since then, sequels have been going steadily downhill for four decades, until the widely acclaimed rebooting three years ago: \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" which recounts the events of how drug experimenting using apes turned into disaster in apocalyptic proportions as a resultant epidemic almost wiped out the entire human race. \"Dawn\" is the sequel showing that ten years later, while a small group of people survive and struggle to get the human race on its feet in San Francisco, apes in larger numbers have taken over the neighborhood forests and evolve. At the start of this movie, neither is aware of the existence of the other although they both vaguely suspect it.The opening shot (after a brief recap of what-went-on-before) is a closed-up face that reminds me of a similar one in \"Quartet\" (2012) showing the wrinkles on the face of an old woman playing the piano. Here in \"Dawn\", the wrinkles and the face belong to the protagonist Caesar, an ape played by Andy Serkis. Yes, the main character is an ape. Furthermore, I strongly suspect that Serkis will get a Best Actor nomination for next year's Oscar and I won't be surprise if he wins it.The basic plot line is quite simple. Human and apes, after a chance encounter, come to a mutual understanding that both have their highest priority in keeping their existing home intact and neither want war which would threaten rather than support these priorities. The immediate need of the humans is to reactivate an old power generating plant they just discovered, their salvation from the imminent danger in running out of energy supply. As the plant is in ape territory, humans, after some hard persuasion, manage to obtain permission to work there for a period of time to get the job done. The first half of the movie recounts the story of how a small group of human sojourn in ape territory to reactivate the power plant and, in the process, build trust and even friendship with the apes. Predictably, not all humans are good, nor are apes. Betrayal and treachery, on both sides, fuel an all-out war which moves the action scene to the human base in San Francisco where the second half of the movie takes place.Achievement in the technology department in this movement is second to none. Still, success of this movie owes even more to the storytelling, delivered through a fine cast. On the human side, top-billed Gary Oldman is in fact only a big cameo, playing the militant leader. The hero is played by Jason Clarke, established as a fine actor thanks to \"Lawless\" (2012) in which he plays an ultra-macho character in the Wild West. Here, it's an entirely opposite role, a peace-loving, mild-mannered man leading the power plant restoration project. Playing his loving wife and medical specialist is lovely Keri Russell who may be remembered from sappy \"August Rush\" (2007) where she plays a young mother reunited with 11-year-old son initially believed to be stillborn, through the magic of music. On the side of the apes, in addition to Caesar, there is his loyal follower militant Koba who eventually betrays him and his son who agonizes over the choice between compromise and confrontation. There are quite a few more characters, on both sides but Serkis dwarfs them all and I reiterate: I root for Serkis for the next Oscar.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves sequel to Rupert Wyatt's 2001 reboot of the classic series, is a more than satisfactory second chapter but is not without its flaws.Almost a decade after the outbreak of ALZ-113, most of the human population has fallen victim to either virus or violence. In an Ewok village on steroids in Muir Woods, just beyond San Francisco, Caesar (Andy Sekis) and his right-hand ape, Koba (Toby Kebbell) preside over his vast tribe of intellectually enhanced simians. Under the assumption that humankind is now extinct, the simian community lives as the dominant force in their kingdom.Meanwhile, within the confines of San Francisco, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) have established a large community of survivors out of sight of the apes. When their energy supplies run out, however, Malcolm, Ellie (Keri Russell) and a small team venture into the woods to see if they can harness energy from the hydroelectric dam. The apes see them, there is a standoff, one of the humans shoots an ape and the threat of war looms.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes rolls along slowly and it takes an awfully long time to really 'kick in', prompting much fidgeting. But the groundwork is necessary to bring us up to date on the apes' evolution, the humans' worsening situation and to build the tension steadily enough for us to invest time and emotion in it. This isn't a simple movie of goodies versus baddies but of varying shades of right and wrong, of misunderstanding, arrogance, quick tempers and failed diplomacy.Writers Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver must take much of the credit for crafting a story that engages the audience and makes us want to know the whys and wherefores while refraining from spoon feeding us every morsel of information. Much is left for us to wonder about; other than fleeting references, there is no explanation for the fate of Will and Caroline from the previous installment. However, while they take their time establishing the first act and rattle the third act along with gusto and gunfire, there is period of protraction in the middle where they seem unclear on how to join the two ends of the film.I am loath to pick on the writers as so often they are blamed for a movie's failing and rarely credited for its successes, but I'm afraid on this occasion they are at least partly responsible. For a good fifteen minutes last night, the seat shuffling was inescapable. We all knew a battles was brewing, we all wanted to see it bubble over but there was nothing we could do but wait for writers and director to work out how to make it happen.Of the principal cast of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, only Andy Serkis returns, as Caesar, in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Both physically and vocally Serkis has become the go-to guy for motion capture performances and he proves yet again why. It is easy to forget there is an actor hidden behind the pixels in many of the apes but particularly in Caesar. Only when we see a baby chimp does the CGI look awkward but, though the dialogue is a little cheesy at this point, it allows for some emotional attachment between audience and apes that is necessary for the final act.The human characters fare less well. Clarke lacks the charisma here to mark himself out as a solid leading man and one can only hope that the reason for his blandness will be explained in episode three. Keri Russell is wasted here and her scenes could be excised with very little impact on the film. While Ellie does enable the apes to edge closer to trusting the humans, it is a great pity that Russell was give more to play with.Likewise, Kodi Smit-McPhee has a central part to play as Malcolm's son, Alexander, in two short but enjoyable scenes (a sequence where he looks up to see the apes watching and waiting patiently is lovely) but there is nothing here to make him memorable or hope that Alexander lives to see a sequel. Gary Oldman is given the most meat to sink his teeth into but even he is prevented from making the impact that Christopher Nolan allowed in the Dark Knight trilogy.Director Matt Reeves (Let Me In, Cloverfield) has built on the success of the first installment (of the reboot \u2013 we'll ignore Tim Burton's awful attempt to reignite the series) and, though I don't think we'll ever regard Dawn of the Planet of the Apes as a stand alone classic, it works well as a quietly exciting middle chapter of what is certain to be at least a trilogy. With a sequel slated for a July 2016 release, this has laid the groundwork for Reeves to let rip with a no holds barred battle epic that should up the ante on the thrills and the bloodshed.For now, though, we must be content with an imperfect but largely enjoyable stepping stone from dark beginnings to the bloody thrills of futuristic warfare.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",

When it's the terrific Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, a blockbusting allegory for a tired summer of few standout tent poles. The apes have evolved into semi-literate survivors (at least Caesar played by Andy Serkis and a few other leaders) living peacefully until the \"humans\" return to the Muir Woods outside San Francisco looking for an old hydroelectric dam to power their broken city. Ten years after scientist James Franco nurtured Caesar to wisdom in the first franchise film (2011), this story exudes feeling for the difficult negotiations between, in terms we know now from the mid-East, \"tribes,\" whose mantra is \"home.\" While Dreyfus in the quote above sounds like W or Cheney, some logic prevails, like reclaiming rightful territory, just basic domicile here on earth. The motion-capture technology is remarkably life-like as it allows Serkis to give an Oscar-worthy performance without distracting us with the wondrous graphics. The other apes are so nimble as to make their existence seem commonplace. The visual design is impressive from the comfortable woods home of the apes to the ruins of San Francisco, formerly the most desirable living in the US, now a ghetto. The film's strength is that it doesn't favor either side, no moral imperatives can be claimed only by humans or apes; each side has legitimate claims. Although apes were here first, so to speak, humans have nurtured evolution to its high form. Lead ape Caesar remarks the apes are getting more like humans, which means not every ape can be trusted, nor will keeping one's word be always possible. As in most delicate talks between warring factions, trust is paramount and not easily attainable. When an underling breaks the peace, peace takes a serious tumble and is most difficult to regain.Some of the usual tropes visit even this creative rendition, such as the human doctor (Keri Russell)compelled to treat Caesar's wife, thus creating a bond;and bad boy ape Koba (Toby Kebell) challenging Caesar while causing severe hostility among the humans. Even the opening montage is a collection of clich\u00e9d memories to put us in context, with the dire warnings of global apocalypse, blurred videos, and grave anchors intoning.Original images abound such as an ape shooting from a tank turret (Michael Dukakis could have taken a lesson) and an ape charging on a horse with machine guns in both hands.Koba again inadvertently reveals the humanity and the weakness in the war: \"Caesar loves humans more than apes!\" those accursed affections, creeping up behind us just when we thought we were tough. That's what's really dawning and re-birthing: humanity. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a satisfying summer treat with images to remember and insights to clarify about the terrible dictates of co-existence.",

Everything from 80's action to modern independent to foreign horror. As is expected when watching so many movies, one is bound to come about a stinker every now and then.Of those stinkers, this is by far one of the worst. Now to clarify, it is not even a \"so-bad-it's-good\" type of affair either. No, my friends, this film lacks almost anything resembling entertainment.From the get go we are treated to a 15 minute or so bout of the apes hunting, gathering food, and generally living in their ape city. It feels like an hour. Not a good sign. Furthermore, for the duration of this sequence, the apes communicate solely through sign language and bright yellow subtitles. Yikes.After being treated to this sub-par excuse of a National Geographic documentary, I contemplated doing something I had never done before, walking out of the theater and spending the time elsewhere.In hindsight I wish I had.The rest of the film follows suit with card-board stiff acting from the humans, living up to each and every clich\u00e9 imaginable as these characters that you don't care about in the slightest go about their business.Yawn. This goes on for what feels like is another five hours or so (the pacing is devastatingly slow throughout) and nothing much at all happens. It was if the filmmakers took the absolute worst parts of Jurassic Park and threw them into one elongated middle section.Later in the film, without spoiling anything that isn't shown in the trailers (which do show just about everything), there are several battle sequences. These scenes can hardly be called action sequences, as without any attachment to the characters paired with the absolute absurdity (a 120 pound ape carrying a 50 pound SAW machine gun in each hand, charging into battle balanced on a horse), they are less riveting than playing a casual game of Angry Birds while sitting on the john.Just don't see this film.Even if you were a fan of Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Instead watch one of the films that this movie tried to be- Rise of the Planet of the Apes, District 13, or Jurassic Park.Actually, just watch anything that isn't this train wreck.3 bananas out of 10.",

            "content": "The Planet of the Apes franchise is so clearly established that it can be inflected for current issues. Each new version mirrors its time.Matt Reeves's Dawn of the PA makes our first identification with the apes, not the humans. The first episode bares the savagery in nature, as apes hunt down deer and fight off a grizzly. This is nature, red in tooth and claw and redder in 3-D. Still, we also get our first sense of the apes' humanity, in their leader Caesar's sensitivity to his son and his gratitude to the ape who kills the bear. The human father/son story feels undeveloped beside this one.When the humans are introduced they're intruders in that ape world. A thoughtless rifle shot suggests they might be even more murderous than the apes. As the two forces are defined the gap between animal and human narrows. The wise old orangutan (properly named Maurice) can read and teaches the young to read. He also conveys a morality that makes these apes superior to most of these humans: \"Ape does not kill ape.\" When the villain ape Koba does, he forces Caesar to one of the two key lines of the film: \"I didn't realize how much like us the humans are.\" Caesar's assumption of his species' moral superiority is undermined by his rival's evil.The other key line is Caesar's warning to good human Malcolm: The humans won't forgive the apes for the war Koba started. Caesar forgave Koba his first insurrection, which only encouraged the second. Their world in ruins, Caesar disqualifies Koba \u2014 \"You are not ape.\" \u2014 so he can drop him to his death. But the humans' inability to forgive augurs a continuing cycle of violence, murder and destruction \u2014 i.e., on the brighter side, a few sequels; but in real life, the end of civilization as we knew it.Certainly Koba's cunning shows him superior to the drinking arrogant guards he tricks. As the humans note, the apes are not as dependent as the humans upon outside power sources. They're stronger and they have genetically evolved. On both sides there are are good and there are bad characters. But in the post-plague world, in which humanity has shrunk to small bands of isolated survivors, the apes seem to be starting evolution all over again. Win or lose these apes expose the failure of humanity.Those three key lines make the film a clear reflection upon the present human landscape. All over the world, humans are killing humans. That is, they lack these apes' principle. They also deny their kinship to their victims, how alike they are, how trivial their mortal differences. And worse: they don't forgive. Wherever humans are killing humans these days you find inhumanity in action and long-festering differences magnified to justify slaughter. The apes' dawn is our miserable midnight.

Also the fur movement and the lighting of apes faces make them look detailed and simply, real!Director Matt Reeves sets up the whole story based on the premises of trying to make sure that we as the audience can feel empathy with the human survivors but specially with the apes. Without giving too much away the key to the whole story is what happens when two parts, human and Apes, agree on peace and prosperity, but ambitious dark characters around them have other plans...\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" was made without big stars...not counting Gary Oldman that is...who is soulful but underused. Andy Serkis might get an Oscar nomination for his CGI motion capture performance as Cezar. He captures the essence of an ape that in some way admires the humans and wants to be like them, but is also trying to not loose his connection to the animal kingdom. This is why he speak with apes using sign language not using human speech as much. He as a character is the lead of the film which is very unusual and because successful in its believability hugely satisfying. Toby Kebbell as Koba almost steals the film as a sort of Brutus archetype who becomes too ambitious for what he thinks is the good of his species! The human counter part of Cezar, Jason Clarke as Malcolm exudes passion and somehow delivers subtle performance that might not get the praise it deserves. This is his first movie were he takes upon himself the pressure as human lead in the story in the past being more of a solid supporting actor.As good as this film is I think the next part in this franchise will be an awesome storytelling and extravagant visual endeavor! All I say is that the WAR is coming! Like I said \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is more then just well used CGI, here it is used as a storytelling tool to deepen the family aspect of the characters. Making us care for the CGI creations (Apes) and their fate. There is also a bow towards Stanley Kubrick and 2001:Space Odyssey at the beginning of the movie during the deer hunting sequence. The director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) is using the same music as Kubrick 'Monolith' sound and obviously is paying the tribute to 2001 showing Stanley, how the correct ape CGI is done. (2001:Space Odyssey from 1968 is a masterpiece, but the actors in monkey costumes in the opening scene of the movie in front of the Monolith can be quite comical and dated, if you know what I mean) and that comes from someone who worships Kubrick. If only Stanley would have the technology of today back then... \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is a great movie which not necessarily need to be seen in 3D. This film will bring you back to your childhood!For more of my film review check out: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",

            "review_title": "Deserves recommendation for taking bold risks, clawing at its audience's emotions, and displaying hauntingly winsome visuals",
            "content": "As published by the Morrisons Cove Herald on July 17, 2014. BY RYAN C. SHOWERS\"Planet of the Apes\" has undergone many incarnations since the groundbreaking original film, which revolutionized prosthetic make-up in the movie industry. The 1968 milestone also launched a booming success of four sequels in the 1970s, two television spin-offs (though neither picked up enough traction to stay active for more than one season), and a remake by Tim Burton in 2001.In 2011, \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" rebooted the franchise for modern audiences with first-rate special effects, dapper direction, and fresh take on the stale story. Following the financial and critical success of part one to the planned trilogy, the newly released \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" ferociously continues the story prefaced in the reboot.Even with a few justifiable reservations, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" deserves recommendation for taking bold risks, clawing at its audience's emotions, and displaying hauntingly winsome visuals.In the preceding chapter, the majority of the human race perished when exposed to the ALZ- 113 virus, an infection derived from experiments performed on apes in hopes to treat Alzheimer's disease. Caesar (portrayed by Andy Serkis through motion capture technology), the highly intelligent ape protagonist from the original film, now governs a primate community surrounding a hydroelectric dam that could supply the few remaining humans with an abundance of power. A survivor of the near human extinction, Malcolm (Jason Clarke), befriends Caesar in attempts to reach the dam, though the other apes believe humans are not to be trusted.The \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise has subsisted since what feels like the dawn of time, so \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" makes its existence relevant by producing the most textured and realistic special effects ever in the series. The film is a \"looker\", not just with its exquisite images of the apes, but also the primitive art direction and stoic cinematography.The elaborate visuals tell most of the story, which makes the script feel as if it's lacking heft since everything is exhibited rather than unambiguously told. Because of the lighter storytelling approach, I was not as engrossed as I might have been with a heavier scene-to-scene vitality.Even with that misstep, the screenplay builds around a tricky competition between the humans and the apes. The humans hold power by clenching formidable guns as their defense against the apes, while the apes contain physical power and strength over the humans. Neither group is omnipotent because both guns and strength are necessary for total domination by one race. In this regard, the screenplay is cleverly structured, as are the well-defined characters and their lucid motivations.This is a film dependent on the skills of its director to make up for absence of dialogue throughout most of the film. Director Matt Reeves brews his ape vs. human war film with environmental artistry. A shot in particular is quite impressive where the camera is set at an extremely low angle, almost lying flat on the ground, and captures hundreds of apes climbing from tree-to-tree in silence. Stellar shots like that and the introductory/concluding motif focusing on Caesar's eyes make the theatrical occasion worth the ticket price.\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is a film to be admired, not worshiped, for it excels in certain areas. \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" was lauded for richly commenting on political issues in its subtext, whereas the sequel accents the plot with existentially rooted themes. The actors in the ape roles muster up vast amounts of affecting emotion through the cumbersome barrier of motion capture technology. In particular, Andy Serkis, best known as Gollum from the \"Lord of the Rings\" films, blossoms Caesar with strong pathos. \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" reminds me of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" with its the temerity and ambitions, but unlike that film, it delivers on its precarious risks.* * * / * * * *",

Because in this dull and simple movie, it is possible to predict absolutely everything. In order to retrieve the invested 175mil. the authors didn't risk a thing. They just used patterns and templates (or should I say \"template\"). Special effects are quite fine, but I didn't spend my money to watch a cartoon. Therefore, another minus, since the authors somehow assumed I'm eleven. Big minus goes also for the technical electrical moments, but I will not say more in order to avoid spoilers.Finally, I made up my mind, so I leave the dispute from the summary to you.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Plant of the Apes is one of the best movies i have seen, let alone this year. It was a cinema 'Experience' full of palpable emotion etched across the faces of the cast, huge action scenes and emotionally gripping and harrowing moments that will stay with you for a while after the end credits roll.The use of CGI in this movie should now be viewed as the bench mark for other movies 'trying' to pull off convincing character models and emotionally charged set pieces. What a lot of cinema goers will not comprehend at first, is that Andy Serkis's body language and movements are not the only thing motion captured, its his facial expressions, sounds and his acting. Every subtle movement of Caesar, every powerful but very slight facial expression, every walk, every tear, every occasion of joy written in his smiles and every harrowing exhortation of horror is all the work of Andy Serkis, not the work of CGI, the CGI turns him into an ape, the rest is all the work of Mr Serkis. 'The Dawn of the Planet of the Apes', i hope, is the 'dawn of the future use of CGI'.To say he deserves an Oscar for recognition is an understatement, to truly understand what he is doing for the future of cinema, then look no further than 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'.The story follows on well from the first with a quick prologue/montage to get the viewers who have not experienced 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' up to speed. It starts off quick, setting the mood and encapsulating the world as it stands Post 'Rise of the Plant of the Apes'.By the end of this movie you will be aching for more and if you're like me, you won't be able to wait.I would recommend this film to any Sci-Fi fan, any action fan, any movie fan!You won't regret it, all hail Caesar!!!!",

Nope, not at all. It's not really that exciting and even a normal chimpanzee can predict the outcome. But, it's the amazing design of the apes and the sometimes real human actions and emotional traits that they show. Probably the fact that the actors are \"motion captured\" has something to do with it, but it's still breathtaking to watch. At certain moments the CGI wasn't quite correct. Especially the fragments of the horse riding apes. You can notice sometimes that these were computer animations. But that's really nitpicking. The Most part looked lifelike and one can only conclude that the authentic episodes of \"Planet of the Apes\" from the 60's were irrefutable populated by costumed actors.The final confrontation between humans and apes, with Caesar, again played by Andy Serkis (who formerly also performed as Gollum in TLotR), and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) as the two righteous leaders of the two parties, is of course inevitable. Clearly a socio-political theme was ingeniously woven throughout the cheap, ordinary Hollywood entertainment. The mutual distrust with revenge as the cause for the sneaky tricks and treachery. One group is angry because the apes are supposedly the origin of the extermination of mankind. The other group is unnerved by the years of abuse in laboratories and a doomed life in captivity. The result, of course is a clash with also some internal feuds and conflicts. .

            "content": "DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is the latest in the long-running franchise, following on from the reboot RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. This one was directed by CLOVERFIELD's Matt Reeves and features a mostly different cast to the first, albeit retaining Andy Serkis as the chief chimp Caesar. This time around the action is on a much larger scale, depicting a constant running state of warfare between surviving humanity and the organised primates.It's a very different beast to the first movie, set in a post-apocalyptic world enhanced by CGI effects. And the CGI is the main thing you'll take away from this film, which features some truly fantastic work; the motion capture in particular is quite brilliant and the main apes are the best I've ever seen. They've come a long way from Gollum all those years back. Even the eyes are beginning to look realistic, which is saying something.The rest of the story is a mixed bag. There are some good actors in the mix, including Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman, but the whole thing feels a bit too messy, a bit too grand and overwhelmed in CGI spectacle at the expense of depth. Me, I'm not too keen on CGI action scenes and these are typical for the format: explosive, fast-paced, and never involving. The script isn't as good as it should be, and the overlong running time gives the whole movie a sluggish feel at times. What you're left with is a comic book-style movie about humanised apes which is far too serious and would-be worthy for its own good.",

            "content": "While the original Planet Of The Apes film did show that humans had been dominated by evolved apes, it did not have the same ominous tone that this film Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes brings to the franchise. This film paints a very real picture of the plausibility and the possibility of humans no longer being the dominant species. There was no need to waste time rehashing what took place in the predecessor film, so the telling of what had transpired during the opening credits left the entire film to address the task at hand; the fall of man. But, this film was so much more than a tale of how man fell, it delved into the dynamics of the father-son relationship, and how some wrongs can be so life altering that there's no coming back. This was an intelligently written, though provoking story that picks up roughly a decade after the apes flee into the forest. Caesar (Andy Serkis) now has a family including a rebellious son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and is leader to an enormous clan, which includes characters previously established. Maurice (Karin Konoval) the circus orangutan, Rocket (Terry Notary) the chimp- pimp, and Koba (Toby Kebbell) all of whom are living in unison until humans happen upon their home. This is the point where everyone's agenda begins to unfold, none clearer than Koba's whose disparaging past has completely marred him. He was the only character who had focused intentions, everyone else was somehow manipulated or unaware of the big picture that led to the human-ape clash, which caused me to sign with frustration several times throughout the film, which is my only issue with the story; the overwhelming naivete. I have focused primarily on the apes, but the humans do deserve some acknowledgement for attempting to avoid any further annihilation of the human race. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) was a good man who stepped way outside his comfort zone to fight for peaceful resolutions. Unfortunately, the cards were already stacked against them. I liken it to watching Titanic, you can hope that this time they will miss the iceberg, but it's inevitable. The special effects in today's cinematic world never cease to amaze me, what was done here is no exception. The apes were a given that they would be extremely lifelike, but to see how nature had ravaged civilization in such a relatively short time was a bit frightening. This was a very good film, from beginning to end. I enjoyed it immensely mostly because it made me feel some kind of way.",

            "content": "Never has a sequel achieved such distinction in storytelling by seamlessly blending science fiction with reality. More than just an epic blockbuster packed with equal parts heart, soul and insight \u2013 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is as much a technical marvel as it is a quintessential milestone in filmmaking. For lack of better words, in its entirety, this film is the dawn of the evolution of cinema as we know it.One of the closing questions I asked in my review of Rise of the Planet of the Apes (one of 2011's curve ball hit films) was \u2013 Will we as humans eventually cause our own extinction and in the process allow another species to reign supreme? Not only is that question answered with such precision, returning script writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver spins such a yarn, this time around, that cinema's core ethos of 'make believe' is taken to unprecedented new heights of storytelling. In crafting this illusion of reality, Cloverfield director Matt Reeves gives us a glimpse of a bleak future that is in every way a stark contrast to James Cameron's fantasy world in Avatar. Set ten years after the events of the preceding film, a simian flu called the ALZ-113 virus has all but wiped out mankind. When a band of survivors led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and Ellie (Keri Russell) seek to restore power to a decimated San Francisco, they encounter a new generation of apes led by the super intelligent chimp Caesar (Andy Serkis at his brilliant best). As a proud and noble alpha male, Caesar is compassionate to humans as well as his tribe of apes thriving in the woods surrounding San Francisco. But in allowing humans access to a hydro-electric dam, both sides have at least one major obstacle to overcome. Koba (Toby Kebbell), Caesar's deputy bears the scars of human cruelty as a lab test subject. On the other side, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) a trigger happy military man blames the apes for the outbreak of the virus that killed his family. At this point, it's needless to say that peace between humans and apes bear a striking similarity to the current state of socio-political diplomacy in the real world. Similarly, for Malcolm and Caesar, the fragility of peace is tested on the strength of trust and forgiveness, each with depleted levels on both sides.After much inter-species finger pointing in the first hour, Reeves lets loose flaming arrows by way of a spectacular battle sequence, but not before tightening each passing minute with cork-screw tension. Each passing minute also leads to metaphors that serve to illustrate our bloody history of wars, mutinies, and conflicted leadership. Just like the preceding film, Dawn raises a few questions that strikes fear into the heart of the viewer because the film's most unnerving question is not about who we are but about what we have become. This is Kebbell's moment as a perfectly camouflaged Shakespearean Brutus. Kebbell's portrayal of a war craving despot is second only to the highly watchable Caesar in what has to be Serkis' most charismatic performance to date. Although the accolade of blurring the lines between virtual reality and live action cinema firmly rests with New Zealand based studio Weta Digital, thinking that an ape has been trained to act while also knowing that it is a product of CG animation is the greatest achievement in this film. That being said, human characterization seems to have taken a back seat in the process as more than 75 percent of the production favors the apes with every minute detail dedicated towards their emotions, aesthetics, communication and path to civilization. As such, Oldman and Russell have little to work with, relying on Clarke to shoulder human elements of the story.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes can be easily misread as an analogy on the current state of real world events and the mounting tension that is bringing nations to the brink of war. But under the guidance of Reeves, this film is primarily a stunning visual experience with all the sophistication yet none of the camp silliness found in other big budget productions. Apart from the photo-realistic aplomb of motion-performance technology, James Chinlund's production design is perfectly integrated with Michael Seresin's cinematography of a post-apocalyptic world in a way that doesn't require a 3D viewing. Together with Michael Giacchino's goose-bump raising original score, something tells me these technical achievements will not go unnoticed. For now, Caesar lives. And through this film, be prepared to be conquered all over again!",

At first impression, i was amazed by hoe good the CGI was ( okay, for graphic i will give two thumbs up ). However, for the story itself..i don't appreciate it too much ( all the bad reviews about this movie have sum it up ). Like, too many plot holes,things that was not logically fit in ( like the unlimited ammo without the need to reload the gun ) and a ridiculous ending. Yes, for the ending...i want to complain about it so much. I can tolerate the first hour i've watched ( well,the story wasn't that bad, just too common, illogical ). I give four for the score, mainly because of the ending. Why until the end, the human and the ape can't make up and war is unavoidable? The protagonist ( the human ) just leave the ape to face the war that will begin. Then what? The cycle of war is not stopped, thus will only bring sadness and grieve. I understand, maybe it will look Impossible to gain peace because even if the apes and the main protagonist ( i called the the minority ) want peace, the soldiers won't hear or understand it. I think in society, if the majority won't seek for understanding, the minority can't do much , just struggle in hope, that someday the peace can be brought back. It is logical, but i desperate to see a better ending.. i was desperate to see that even the minority can bring impact and somehow influence the majority and thus change the course of the story. Lead it to a happy ending. That, was the kind of ending i was hoped for.However, i think i got the point of this movie. I see the movie was trying to depict the reason why wars can happen in our life. Human, apes, or any other species in this world will someday be extinct if we can't have some senses and understanding between others! The war will happen and only bring us suffering, hatred, death, sadness, etc. In the end, i think this movie try to teach us the need of trust and understanding in order to maintain balance. I wish people in the world that has watched this movie can try to think for themselves and realize the importance of tolerance and understanding, thus will lead us to a better life and avoid the war.",

But with the large number of natural history shows in the intervening years, a higher level of realism had to be applied.This is written almost as a low budget young adult TV show plot, but applied to apes and men. The strength of the film is in the visuals and some of the survival aesthetic, not in the plot which displays most of Hollywood's shortcuts, tropes and sloppiness. But both humour and melodrama are sucked out to keep the action rolling, and this drives the entertainment.That aesthetic is pulled from the best of survivalist TV serials as well as video games. It also harks back a little to the original films. Watching the different apes work together is a joy, and the alien nature of their structures is well observed. Caesar is in the main brilliantly acted through Andy Sirkis, though Koba is a close second. As is usual with these things, you will get much more out of the film if you remember the previous one.This film is solid franchise building block for something special next time.",

From the first scene, you're scratching your head \"is that supposed to be a bear?\" \"why is there a bear?\" Then you spend the next hour thinking \"wait...why'd he do that? Why blow that up? Why are they hurt?\" No part of this movie makes any sense whatsoever. You could get better plot and dialog if you just asked a couple of 8-year old boys to make up a story about monkeys. Gary Oldman and Keri Russell need to fire their agents, they're both better than this stain on their careers. My advice--wait until it's on TV, and be sure to avoid it then.",

After seeing all the Planet of the Apes movies, this one, in my opinion, is the best one since the original 1968 movie. \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" was a pretty good movie, but I love this one more. The special effects in this movie are a big step up from \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\" which I thought they are very well detailed and not coming on and off (I explain about the effects from \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" for another time). Andy Serkis has given such an incredible performance for his role as Caesar for him speaking and not speaking. The rest of cast like Gary Oldman, and such all do their jobs well enough; but its really Apes that steals most of the movie because they are the stars. I thought Matt Reeves did a pretty darn good for directing the movie, since I knew him as a director for another movie he is well known for known as \"Cloverfield.\" The story was well told, and I thought the premise did kept me interest and does not come off being side track from having a subplot or anything that takes away from the entire movie. If you haven't seen it, check it out! I give it a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Average film, with decent efforts, but boring after about 15 min. (don't tell me you didn't look at your watch ?). The weakness is in the scenario. According to the previews, 95% of the humanity was dead. I had in mind that the apes were already dominating the whole earth, the few remaining humans were crawling to get medicine. The war was already won by apes (able to master technology) and a few strong humans (mostly in USA of course) were offering some challenge and fighting back. I would have prefer they start from there, then it would have been fascinating & entertaining to watch, but NO (maybe $ problems, or they keep that for the 3rd film which I will miss), we had to go through the whole process... Predictable in general, and boring. I thought they were going to exploit the ''hundredth monkey effect'', new communications skills... It's a bit like watching a Napoleonic battle, but before, having to endure the stars perform a fake love scene & tender kisses for 45 minutes... c'Mon, if you want an interlude here's a free suggestion: After the deer & bear hunt in the jungle, why not a BBQ at the MUMBA BAR, with the sexy Miley she-monkeys doing the rope dance ? OK Two more 'serious' points. Keir O'Donnell (the bad guy in Mail Cop) his underused in this film, with a small part. I would have give him the part of Carver (the ape-phobic), he's got the acting skills & a mad look perfect for that. Finally, concerning the frustration of Peter Wilder about the fight between a bear and a chimp (pretending that a bear would always win). Just think twice. A female 135 pounds chimp (Suzette, quite cute) checked in with a 1-hand pull of 1,260 pounds on a dynamo meter at the Bronx Zoo. We are talking here about an animal who has almost no idea of what's going on about this test, an animal who was living in a zoo since her birth. Do you know that the strongest men they found could do only about 200 pounds ? And he did it after repeated and focus effort. Can you imagine how much Suzette could lift with 2 arms ? Do you realize the strength ? When Suzette was not in a good mood, she could easily broke reinforced doors with her feet blows. An Orangutan was able to throw a big wood trunk in the air with one arm (about a ton according to the zoo keepers evaluation because 6 men were unable to move it even a small little bit). So a powerful male chimp, hunting in the wild with the intelligence of Einstein, armed with a spear could possibly kill a bear don't you think ? Big bears have problems with another small animal: a wolverine weights between 20-55 pounds (1/2 a dog) and can kill an adult grizzly, just look for ''wolverine vs bear'' ytube, you will see that this little devil can also destroy a pack of wolves...alone",

This mixture proved to be successful at the box office and at the same time made this movie indiscernible from any other contemporary action movie.There are some very nice moments within the apes' community, but they get squandered with the aforementioned mixture.So, if you're looking for a \"different\" action movie, you've found what you've been looking for.

            "review_title": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes",
            "content": "An intelligent blockbuster. This may sound like an oxymoron. But the idea that big budget blockbusters have to be purely visceral experiences with little to offer in terms of cerebral and emotionally intelligent content has been encouraged by the kind of films that have been successful at the box office of late. The financial success of films like the Transformers franchise seem to indicate that audiences have developed a palette for mindless action and crave for more films of such type. The studios have no qualms providing more of the same. So, it is pleasantly surprising to say the least when a studio decides to spend a decent amount of money to make a film that is as smart and engrossing as the latest installment of the Planet of the Apes franchise. What filmmaker Matt Reeves has accomplished with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is nothing short of spectacular. He has created a stellar motion picture, which is very elegant in its handling of difficult themes and complicated emotions that one might not expect from of this nature. The story has a dramatic arc that is positively Shakespearean in its handling of the primary characters and the screenplay is literate enough to provide even the smaller characters with moments that help us understand what they bring to this world. The script allows the audience to understand the motivations of all characters and makes it difficult to establish the dichotomy of good and bad/right and wrong. So assured is the filmmaker that he does not shy away from making several ambitious allegories about race relations, historical incidents and social psychology. Not once does any of this backfire. The resultant is a powerful and engaging motion picture experience With the messy and moody origin story out of the way 'Dawn' has more room to explore the conflicts that lie at the heart of this franchise. 'Rise', while a good film had several issues relating to the science fiction aspect of the overall story arc of the apes franchise. But, it laid the foundation for what happens in this film. Being liberated from the constraints of explaining how the world in which story transpires came into being the script is able to breathe and as a result the characters here seem more rounded here than they did in 'Rise'. It is not a great secret that this newly rebooted franchise intends to slowly lead up to the events of the original 'Planet of the Apes' film from 1968 so the eventual outcome is never really in question. But, the wonderful treatment of the material and Reeves' superb direction in particular make the journey to that point seem so evocative and poignant. On the acting front, motion capture expert Andy Serkis is definitely the one who walks away with top honours. The man responsible for bringing memorable characters like Gollum and King Kong to life breathes into Caesar a magnificent complexity and emotional heft that is breathtaking. Caesar is the heart of the film and Serkis makes it impossible look away every time he is on screen. Matching him beat for beat, is Toby Kebbel's terrifying and intense portrayal of the embittered Koba. It's hard not to understand the character's point of view primarily because of Kebbel's rendition of it. Among the human characters Jason Clarke's Malcolm is a definitely step up from James Franco's Will from 'Rise'. There is enough dramatic weight in the actor's portrayal to give the character an emotional weight that provides a fascinating human counterpart for Caesar. Gary Oldman's Dreyfus is an underdeveloped character who has very little screen time and it would appear that the versatile actor was only offered the role to make the character appear a little meatier than it is on the page. The Apes in this film are a stunning amalgam of art and technology. Not for a moment do they appear as if they are creations of a computer. Their movements, their facial expressions are rendered with such flawless execution that it is amazing to watch. The motion capture technology employed here has been developed by WETA digital and they have really pushed the envelope here with their fine work. This film represents a unique achievement in filmmaking in the sense that it is in this writer's opinion the perfect chimera of modern digital cinema and old fashioned drama heavy story telling. 'Dawn' is at times a dark and unrelenting motion picture; there is very little comedy here to provide padding to the serious content of the story. It makes the story tighter and lets the filmmaker make a film that's to true to his vision and not pander to any section of the audience to make the film more accessible.",

            "content": "'DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)This sequel to 2011's 'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' is the eighth installment in the 'PLANET OF THE APES' film franchise and the second chapter in the recent reboot series. It was directed by Matt Reeves, who also directed the 2010 teen vampire romance remake 'LET ME IN' and the 2008 found footage monster flick 'CLOVERFIELD'. It was written by Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (the last two also wrote 'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES'). It stars Andy Serkis once again (as Caesar) and costars Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Toby Kebbell and Codi Smit-McPhee (who also appeared in 'LET ME IN'). I found it to be a really entertaining and well made science fiction flick; an improvement over the last installment and the best of the series since the 1968 Charlton Heston classic.The story is set in 2028, ten years after the ALZ-113 virus killed off most of the humans on the planet. Caesar (Serkis) leads a growing ape civilization in the Muir Woods. A small group of human survivors, who are immune to the virus, live in San Franciso. They're lead by Dreyfus (Oldman) and are desperately in need of a new source for power. The humans think they can solve their problems by restarting a hydroelectric dam's generator, located in the community of apes. When the two societies discover each other, many (on both sides) want to go to war; out of distrust, bigotry and paranoia. Caesar tells the humans to leave them alone and they won't be harmed but a human named Malcolm (Clarke) begs Caesar to let a small group of human survivors work on the generator. A bond forms between Malcolm, his friends, and the apes but others don't want to give peace a chance; especially an ape named Koba (Kebbell), who wants revenge for past abuse he suffered.I was pleasantly surprised by how much more the movie revolves around the apes, rather than the humans. The story is really a lot more about the inner struggling of the ape civilization and how it falls apart, for a lot of the same reasons humanity has similar problems. The movie also, of course, deals with the bigotry and hatred that forms between two different societies but it focuses a lot more on the increasing flaws of a new civilization (which at first seemed ideal and perfect). We say human nature causes a lot of our biggest problems but this movie argues those same problems arise in any civilization. It's a really well made and thought provoking movie (and the visual effects are spectacular).

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 starsNothing, absolutely nothing, in \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" falls short of being spellbinding. An emotionally heavy and truly moving film, Dawn is an absolute marvel of modern science fiction, building upon the strong and unmovable foundations \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" had left earlier. This sequel to the 2011 \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" continues the origin story of a world devastated by a killing virus and partially occupied by super-intelligent chimps, gorillas, and orangutans who live in harmony in the California woods. Suddenly they are threatened by a band of human survivors and eventually reach a fragile peace treaty, but it proves short-lived, as both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species. As the film begins, they haven't seen a human for 10 years and believe us to be extinct. With a plethora of solid characters from both ends of the tale (humans as well as apes), an explosive sequence of events, and a rather poetic script, Dawn raises the bar for the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise reboot and other big-budget, philosophical sci-fi productions of its caliber.This lavish sci-fi epic really is something that deserves appreciation; few movies in our day can only dream of achieving what Dawn has. A film that truly touches its audience with heartfelt passion and remorse for humanity along with hitting all the right notes as far as providing blockbuster entertainment is concerned; \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is that rare summer blockbuster that boasts a perfect harmony where art meets excitement on a level playing field.Both Rise and Dawn are thought-provoking films that challenge our perceptions of our very own species through the eyes of the mammals we've evolved from. The film wrenches our guts and compels us to delve into our psyches through some highly pertinent questions it raises albeit in a subtle manner. Along the way, Director, Matt Reeves, successfully weaves an enthralling post-apocalyptic narrative against a riveting, grimy, desolate canvas brilliantly created by cinematographer, Michael Seresin, and production designer, James Chinlund. All three gentlemen as do the writers, Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, rightly deserve all the recognition and accolades that might come their way in the next awards season. The writers' greatest achievement that goes even beyond the fine script they've penned, is perhaps some of the most hard-hitting dialogues ever witnessed on screen, delivered with aplomb by the Czar of motion-capture acting, Andy Serkis. Lines such as, \"You are no ape\", \"If we go to war, we could lose all we've built. Home. Family. Future\", \"Caesar loves humans more than apes\", \"From humans\u0085 Koba learned hatred\", and \"Apes started war, humans won't forgive\", are nothing short of writing gold. Technically, the film is a marvel of modern cinematic achievements. The visual effects work superbly, and the director uses 3D unobtrusively. The most remarkable effect may be the animals' eyes, formerly a weak spot in motion-capture animation.Just as its predecessor had memorably done three years ago, Dawn triumphs spectacularly in a way few films before it have done so; through unsolicited and unforced emotion and depth that makes the film a true modern science fiction classic, something that the original creators of the Charlton Heston classic would be very proud of. Stunning visuals, stupendous camera-work, pulsating action, rich production values, notable performances, and an emotionally stirring plot rooted in human tumult all culminate into making \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" not just one of the best summer blockbusters ever, but an instant sci-fi classic that will surely wind up among the year's best movies.",

Thankfully, the film delivered and delivered in a big way.First off, the story builds tremendously on the last film. 10 years have passed and the world is a completely different place but, at the heart of it all, this new world feels legitimate and thriving ape society and remnants of the last surviving humans all come off as convincing. Also, the story does a fantastic job of making this film more than just a Sci-Fi tale about apes slowly becoming the dominate species on the planet and gives the film substance and heart. There's tons of tender moments, light-hearted sequences, exciting action scenes, some heavy drama and a lot, A LOT, of emotion to all it that helped in making the events and characters sympathetic. I'm not saying the film had me tearing up during bits but I'm definitely not NOT saying it.Next, you have the impeccable cast that was composed of both animated characters and flesh and blood actors. Without a doubt, this is the best performance I've seen from Jason Clarke and, even though we found out he's kind of a jerk, Gary Oldman still keeps his track record intact and does a great job as the film's human villain. However, the biggest highlight was Andy Serkis as Caesar. We already know Serkis as the God of Mo-Cap but he continues to show that he really can breathe both life and soul into computer animated characters.Serkis can really make the animated characters give off realistic performances but a part of that equation is having talented animators to make the character look real\u0085and they really did an awe-inspiring job. The level of detail they give the apes is flippin' insane and to such an extent that it was easy to lose yourself in the action taking place before your eyes and make you forget that what you are watching was rendered in a computer. When you combine these talented animators, realistic looking creations and absolutely incredible actors giving them life, you have yourself characters that are less of a computer generated spectacle and more of characters that are providing to and enhancing the film's drama, tension and emotion.I walked out of \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" with absolutely no complaints about the film. Everything about it\u2014from the cast to the visuals and camera work to the effects\u2014were all put together and blended perfectly to make a film that is unlike anything that was seen in the cult classic franchise. I am really looking forward to the next film in the franchise and to see the continuing story of Caesar\u0085I'm also looking forward to the day the Academy finally realizes Andy Serkis' greatness.Hello there, my friend!

What especially annoyed me was the over-cooked music straining to make you feel grand importance or aching to involve you. That detracted for me and was heavy-handed; Reeves failed to catch it. The CGI was good in some parts and terrible in others - the worst scene being the opener in the forest, where the misplaced shimmering looked amateurish and poor with apes and animals. After that, rendering improved more. Much of the background matte art/stills looked competent, as did the apes who looked much better in San Francisco/city scapes where light sources were easier to render. On the poor melodrama, I think subtitles for the sign language looked silly and ultimately probably should've been left off, although realize without them, much information is lost. Of the actors, Jason Clarke was great, while the others mediocre to poor. The story is fairly good though the plot is not really original. Worth a watch, yes; give it about 6.5/10",

            "content": "In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, ten years after the conquest of freedom, Ceasar (Andy Serkis) and the other monkeys live in peace in the forest near San Francisco. There they developed a community of their own, based on mutual support, while humans face one of the greatest epidemics of all time, the simian flu (which, however, was developed by humans in the laboratory) and which wiped out much of the world's population. Without electricity, a group of survivors plans to invade the forest and reactivate the plant installed there. Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the only one who knows the apes well, tries to act peacefully and prevent the confrontation from happening.A prologue to the script is portrayed in defense of family and property, showing a human society more devastated than ever, while the social organization of apes has also reached unprecedented complexity. They act in society, hunting, learning from their elders, taking care of each other. In charge of all this is Cesar, more mature, with some white hair and wrinkles from the experience he lived with his peers since we saw him disappear in the forests neighboring San Francisco. There is no (at least in principle) a dominant group. What is there are humans that also behave like animals and primates that sometimes act according to the most developed rules of coexistence of men. It is not even possible to be sure who started the confrontation that the title announces. Was it, then, the triumph of the individual, independent of the species? It is also not that simple.Although the plot revolves around the tension between the two races, the narrative does not leave out internal political issues for each group, in addition to the individual motivations of the characters. These elements deepen the plot, guarantee different layers throughout and reflect the complexity of our own society. The franchise known for working on political and social issues returns to touching on these issues without boring viewers, unlike The Inception, which oversimplified these aspects. With quotes ranging from the soundtrack of \"2001 - A Space Odissey\" to the battles of epics from the 60s, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is cinema committed to the viewer: to amuse him and make him think. It is darker than \"The Origin\". No less efficient. It has action and provocation in the measure. On both sides there are pacifists, who try to live harmoniously with the different. However, like real life, the thoughts of those who crave power prevail. Those who prefer to extinguish the opponent than try to live in peace. By bringing these themes to the fore, the film joins the list of blockbusters that go beyond pure spectacle.Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, wrote an excellent script that illustrates the behavioral similarities between apes and humans in a masterful way. Especially when there is so much hate and prejudice involved, something that in the film is common to both species. On the human side, Carver (responsible for the shooting, played by Kirk Acevedo) feels angry and blames the monkeys for spreading the disease that killed countless people. This feeling is common to most humans. On the other hand, Koba, overcome by a huge desire for revenge, believes that apes can and should get the better of humans while they still have the advantage. And right in the middle of them are Malcolm and Caesar, who believe that there is a way to live together peacefully.It is on a fine line that Caesar will need to balance his leadership, his family ties and his desires, desires and aspirations in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. His leadership is more than consolidated among the monkeys and his noble posture impresses Malcom, his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and his partner Ellie (Keri Russell). Caesar's pacifism needs to consider all possible angles of all actions and a confrontation between the races is not in his interest, but the hatred between humans and monkeys does not allow enough time for mutual explanations and arrangements - even more so when an ape himself does question of launching into the air a universe built on fragile and suspicious relationships.The complex, malicious and treacherous Koba is the film's great antagonist - and Tobby Kebbell's performance capture is superb. The scarred bonobo - on his face and body - suffered for years in laboratories and does not trust any human being. Ironically, he is in charge of building an intrigue of Shakesperian contours, emulating the most sordid human characteristics and not thinking twice before crossing a line of coexistence defined as a fundamental rule by the apes themselves: monkey does not kill monkey. Koba tries to assassinate Caesar, corrupts Blue Eyes, and sets his own village on fire to provoke an inevitable war between monkeys and humans.If James Franco - who starred in the previous one - did not return, the cast corresponds to the smart script to match. From Jason Clarke and Keri Russell, as the conscious couple who try to resolve situations in a peaceful way, Gary Oldman, always competent, in the shoes of the leader who wants to override what he believes to be the inferior species, and Andy Serkis. Once again the actor lends his features to a character created from the performance capture - it was like that in \"The Lord of the Rings\", with Gollum, and in \"King Kong\" by Peter Jackson. His talent is helped by an increasingly efficient technology: sometimes we are more moved and involved with the monkeys, their looks, their features. It is possible to capture in your eyes and in both actions all the emotions that we are used to seeing in a human being, from joy and sadness to hatred and hopelessness.Several issues are addressed, but the one that stands out most is the difficulty in accepting and understanding others with all their differences, especially when there are deeper problems. It is much easier to simply point out the defects, errors, than to put oneself in place and try to understand. Sometimes reason needs to speak louder than emotion, or impulsive acts end up happening and causing unnecessary friction. Do you realize that prejudice is there? That senseless hatred makes humans act without thinking and thus jeopardize their own existence and that of the entire planet? The writers and director Matt Reeves delve deeper into the subject, without ever forgetting that it is a blockbuster designed to earn a lot in the summer of the northern hemisphere, a great film made to be released in the middle of the year and please the maximum of people possible. And they manage to tell an original, captivating and tension-filled story, filled with exquisite computer graphics.In visual effects, we have the return of Weta Digital, going beyond the work that was already spectacular in the first film, creating other digital animals besides monkeys and taking performance capture to a new level. The work of the Planet of the Apes technical team - The Showdown is so impressive that for most of the film you will wonder if those monkeys are actually created by computers, size is the degree of realism achieved - in a larger number of external shots and in adverse climatic conditions. Apes walk towards the construction of a humanized lifestyle and this is noticeable in the most evolved vocalization, in the expressiveness of their faces, capable of expressing a myriad of emotions and feelings without the need for dialogue, and in the physicality of body movements, which express the animalistic stance of the creatures at the same time that they begin to indicate the first signs of a simian humanization - visible also in the grandeur with which the horses ride.Technically impeccable, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes establishes a gloomy and darker environment than its predecessor. Photography and art direction make up a San Francisco in ruins that impresses, with the world being completely taken over by nature, vegetation that flourishes on all sides. Matt Reeves demonstrates an excellent sense of composition in the action scenes, building a complex clash at night involving monkeys mounted on horses, multiple weapons and even a battle tank, which does not disengage in the confusion of the various coordinated fronts because of the correct positioning camera and the subtle beauty of fire and explosions that sparkle across the blackness of the scene. The director also allows himself to start from the sensitivity of the great initial sequence, which in silent plans reveals the apes' lifestyle and the contours of that nascent civilization, to the malignity of the scene in which Koba pretends to be an ordinary monkey to steal the weapon of two human beings and murder them with extreme cold moments later.From the memory of his creator and friend Will, James Franco's character in Rise of the Planet of the Apes - relived in the respect that is born in his relationship with Malcom and in the return to the rubble of his first home in a moment of sadness and pain -, Caesar realizes that goodness can germinate in humans in the same way as in apes - as well as evil. How much humanity did the evolved monkeys inherit? He had never noticed how human the apes were. To think that monkeys were better than humans was his mistake - and a mistake that took too high a price. In the end, Caesar realizes that there are no absolute and immutable truths about the two races. With a pessimistic ending, which leaves the way open for its conclusion in War for the Planet of the Apes, we also foresee in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes that the fate of the apes seems to be to erect a civilization as vicious as the human. In the ironic tragedy of evolution, the nature intrinsic to the two species - homo sapiens and simius sapiens - is, after all, the same.",

The situation of the humans was not very well explained and specially the reason how they were living with scarce electricity and no communication with other cities for so long.

The film is great pure and simply, well crafted with amazing effects and performances. Speaking performances before I finish I have to say the standout is Andy Serkis.

The story is more nuanced, the parallels between the ape and human world more pronounced and the CGI perhaps even more believable this time around.However what I really (really) like is the way in which \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" stimulated my cortex with echoes of other stories and other experiences. These ranged from the fairly obvious in that the post-infection world reminded me time and again of \"The Last of Us\" (which is an excellent videogame) to more discrete echoes of \"Animal Farm\" and the laws painted on the barn door.At the same time the script does an excellent job of contrasting and comparing the human and ape worlds. Both sides have individuals who are trying to do the right thing and both have loose cannons who are beyond reconciliation. However the latter aren't just bad for the sake of it. They have solid, believable reasons for fearing the other side and are (in their own minds) acting in the interests of the group.All of this makes for an engrossing action movie that keeps you guessing all of the way through. Given that I can barely wait for the conclusion of this trilogy I'd say that \"Dawn...\" really delivers.",

The trailer of DOTPOTA looked promising and moreover it looked it has the capability to strike a right emotional chord this time. But alas, it doesn't live up to the effect that the trailer provides.This time story is set in future after the 'Similian Virus' has scattered human beings around the world and they are becoming extinct. Only few healthy humans are surviving. They come exploring a dam that can help them generate electricity to make contact with outside world and they face off with the apes. Its about the ape-human war dilemma from then onwards. I don't care to explain that here. The story takes a bit too much time to build up and the first 40 minutes are wasted there. Too much forest, too much green, too much ape language. Moreover, I find the script not so ape-specific. Its almost like you could replace all the apes with human characters and still would have made this film.The only saving grace of this movie is CGI. It has some real quality and the role of Caesar is once again exceptional. Andy Serkis makes you feel Caesar exists in the real world. Jason Clarke has a meaty role and doesn't disappoint. This movie will help him to get more important roles in future. I am still wondering why Gary Oldman chose his role. It certainly didn't require an actor of his caliber. Other roles are not so important except for Toby Kebbel's masterful motion capture as Koba.I wouldn't say this movie is a waste of money if you watch in the cinemas. Some may like it some may not.

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014): Dir: Matt Reeves / Cast: Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Toby Kebbell: One of the very best editions of this franchise. It regards the emerging sense of hostility with the reality of a virus that has wiped out most of mankind while apes seem to be progressing. Andy Serkis is brilliant as the ape leader Caesar whose army of apes desire to live peacefully until humans trespass. Apparently these humans need to get through to the dam in hopes that they can spark electricity through to a ruin San Francisco and hopefully find other survivors. Tobey Kebbell plays another ape named Koba whose memories of abuse from humans have caused him to separate from Caesar's second in command to rage war against humans. Director Matt Reeves previously made Cloverfield and Let Me In. Here he creates an entertaining epic with convincing special effects. The apes are a fantastic creation with Serkis, Kebbell among others acting under makeup and CGI visual imagery. The one big flaw is that the human characters are total cardboard. Jason Clarke and Keri Russell provide little if any personality to the limited material they are given, and Gary Oldman is the human version of Koba with the exception that the role is bland. The apes ride in on horse back striking back at the humans while Caesar realizes some flaws in his thinking and reclaims his position from those corrupting peace into war. Great theme regarding co-existing and the reality of mankind drawing wildlife into a smaller living space as we constantly overtake and bring about the dawn of greed. Score: 9 / 10",

            "content": "I guess I am a fan of the Planet of the Apes franchise, because I have wathced all parts from the 1968 original till now, plus the TV series. I loved the original, and I am not such a big fan of movies made earlier than 1970.I can surely say this entry is the closest it can get to the greatness of the original in almost everything.The effects are astounding, maybe the best CGI I have ever seen in my life. The apes had soo much life in them, their eyes and gestures said more than a thousand words. Almost more than half of the movie is without speaking, only sign language, but that didn't hurt the movie at all, it only made it more realistic, much more than the non stop talking apes in the earlier movies.The absolute best thing about this movie, and maybe even all of the franchise was the story of Ceasar and Koba. What and amazing characters nad what and amazing motion-capture actors. I already knew about Andy Serkis and his greatness, but Toby Kebell as Koba almost stole the show here. We can see such raw emotions and pain in the apes' faces, it is just incredible. The betrayal of Koba and his mission to kill the human race, although spoiled in the trailer were amazing to watch. I never would have guessed that Koba will play such an integral part of the storyline and he looks like a complete badass! The scenes, where he dual-wielded the machine guns, riding on a horse, and later the one-shot of him riding and shooting a freaking tank were something else! And I loved it!I need to say, though, that the human characters were again, like Rise of the planet of the apes, very one-dimensional, boring and lacking life in them. Very underdeveloped and just plain unnecessary (the apes characters, though were all very well developed and thrilling) Apart from that - the story was soo much better and emotionally engaging, than Rise of the planet of the apes. Even the characters were somewhat better. The tone was much more darker and chilling, the music too. The atmosphere and cinematography were much, much better, that \"Rise\". And while \"Rise\" for me was kinda childish, like Disney movie and much more tame and light, \"Dawn was the exact opposite - just what I wanted and needed to see in this franchise. Bravo to all of the guys who decided to go in that direction, bravo Matt Reeves.Absolutely recommended, not only for fans of the franchise, but to all of you :)",

            "content": "We saw the gradual development of a baby ape into an intelligent leader in Rise. In Dawn, we see him reign.Reeves offers us an insight, a glimpse about the impending chaos in a Simian afflicted world. He spends hours into character building, the crucial element to any flick, where a director makes you feel 'value' and 'importance' of every soul at large. With apes spending more time on screen than humans, the title of the flick justifies. There is Koba, the bad-ass scarred ape, who defies the leader of the herd with his differences and engenders villainy and exasperates chaos. Maurice, the lovely and loyal orangutan, is charming as ever, whilst Blue Eyes wears an apt role exhuming strong emotional vibes, his best part being: where Reeves uses his perceptive to show the ugly side of war, the absorption of the aftermath on a young amateur heart, the effects of violence, the dread, the fallen victims and the cadavers of the innocents. The war presentation was drenched in beauty.Caesar emanates pizazz. We see him develop into a more thoughtful and intelligent being. The maturity that adorns his countenance makes him stand out from the rest. His personality would put you in awe.The CGI is marvelous. It was thrilling to watch each and every Serkis emotion captured into a series of dark and grim frames impeccably. On the humans counter, we have Jason, Gary, Kodi and Keri in the driving seat as crucial elements trying to help their own species for survival, by gathering resources for sustenance. The fear in the eyes of Jason Clarke is natural and relatable, when he ventures himself into the ape territory. A strange blend of geniality and fear persists whenever he is around Caesar and he dons it brilliantly. If we take the downsides of the movie into account, we find a clich\u00e9d tale that has probably been narrated many times before in epic tragedies. There is no element of surprise in the flick. Nothing memorable to cherish too. Matt needs to take these factors into account, whilst directing the next sequel.But overlooking the above fact, we do have a brilliant moulding of a tale that is on its way to become an epic saga of Caesar, his scion Blue eyed wonder, probably the next possible leader, an ape family who is willing to follow the footsteps of its leader, extinction of humans and their gasp for survival in a Simian-ridden Earth and a fight for coexistence \u2013 nature's felony of keeping predators and preys in one basket.",

Snif. OK, the director wanted to describe monkeys that are as human as us. Great. Forget the subtlety . And so on: the treachery of Koba, his close friend; the friendship of Malcom, and blah, blah.

            "content": "The first film \"Rise Of The Planet of The Apes\" literally floored me. It was probably one of the best films of 2011. It wasn't just the story, the performances, the special effects but just how everything worked together and as another IMDb reviewer pointed out it completely transcends what we know as the \"hollywood Blockbuster.\" Dawn of The Planet Of The Apes takes everything that was great about \"Rise\" and builds on it exponentially. Where in the first film we literally watched Caesar grow up and fell in love with him. We watched in horror and fascination as he rose to lead the Apes. In Dawn, we see their entire civilization and become immersed in their lives in the most believable way you could possibly imagine for a so-called \"science fiction\" film. I was once again nearly in tears more times than I care to admit because you become beyond attached to this beautiful creatures. Are there good guys? Yes...human and Ape, and bad guys...human and ape. This isn't really about who is right and who is wrong but rather two civilizations trying to find middle ground. The world is wiped out by a virus, not by the Apes. I can only hope and pray that they continue making this film as brilliant as it has been this far.I have to start with Andy Serkis. This guy has literally revolutionized Hollywood and entertainment as we know it. I'm not sure he's getting the credit he deserves for being a pioneer. Starting with Lord of The Rings and then King Kong and now playing Caesar...he is absolutely astonishing considering his entire persona is hidden behind CGI. He is essentially a voice actor but a step beyond thanks to motion-capture and he has this incredible way of making you become completely and utterly attached to his character. Caesar would not be Caesar if Serkis was not playing him. He is brilliant period. Jason Clarke isn't the strongest member of the cast but he does a solid job. Compared to perhaps James Franco's leading role in the first film, he pales in comparison but this instalment is all about the Apes so the human counterparts don't matter as much. Clarke still shows some intensity and some good emotion but I would have liked a little more chemistry between him and Caesar. The amazing Gary Oldman was harshly underused I thought. He had a great character and was excellent but I felt like there was more there and that they could have built on him even more than they did Clarke. Still he was amazing. Keri Russell was also underused as Clarke's love and a main character as well. She is still very good but much like Oldman there could have been more there. Kodi Smit-McPhee rounds out the main human cast and he was very good too and had some really great emotional scenes. Toby Kebbell is absolutely mesmerizing as Koba. Between him and Serkis they should both be award nominated for not only pioneering this technology but giving jaw dropping performances. Nick Thurston also deserves mention as Casesar's son who will bring tears to your eyes with his bravery, courage and moments of leadership. I also have to mention Karin Konoval who has a very small role as she did in the first film as Maurice but he is quickly becoming my favourite character.I honestly thought when director Rupert Wyatt wasn't returning to helm the second film that it would not be nearly as good. I felt like Wyatt's style and talent was one major thing that made Rise so good. Well, I'm proud to say that the film makers kept the ball rolling. Matt Reeves who is actually someone who doesn't have a TON of experience brings this world to life in an incredible way. This may shape up to be easily one of the best films of 2014 and I'm almost certain one of my personal favourites! I hate CGI which sounds ridiculous considering the backbone of this film is CGI. I will say that it shows in many, many scenes. I was almost distracted by the animation and blatantly obvious use of computer graphics BUT they are heads and tails above other so called \"Blockbusters\" because the story, script, characters and actors are SO good that you actually understand the use of CGI and don't mind it one bit. This film is an emotional roller coaster with plenty of action, drama, romance and an underlying message about social behaviour, family, war and history. It actually builds on and pays homage to what I think they tried to do with the original classic Planet of The Apes films. This is outstanding. See it now!! 9/10",

Matt Reeves did one heck of a job directing this movie, is stunning, the cinematography is just beautiful. Andy Serkis is once again great as Caesar and Toby Kebbell was also fantastic as Koba, once again the human characters played by Jason Clarke and Keri Russell, while giving good performances, the writing of their characters never made them as interesting as the apes, but that is also because the people playing the apes are that good.

It's amazing how I feel so connected to an ape, a very powerful, emotional ape that leaves me at the edge of my seat every time he's in action.\u00a0Andy Serkis deserves every Oscar there is for his unbelievable performance, he is, without a single doubt, the best motion capture actor ever! What a role!If there's another standout from this second installment, it is definitely Koba (Toby Kebbell). He steals every scene he's in! He's great when fighting and he's very passionate about his perspective on the human race, something that is very well explained and demonstrated throughout the film, giving this character the reason behind his \"evil\" personality.Also, this time around the human characters got a little more development than on the first movie, as it can be seen on\u00a0Jason Clarke's\u00a0great portrayal of\u00a0Malcolm, who brings the emotional human- ape relationship to some very compelling and captivating moments.The visual effects are flawless and incredibly realistic. I mean, there are close-up scenes to an ape's face ... That seems like a freaking real ape! It's that good! In addition to this, the action is awesome and there's a lot more of it than on the previous film. When it goes down, IT GOES DOWN! Just incredible direction from\u00a0Matt Reeves, congratulations for an extraordinary work!I only have a couple of minor issues: once again, the pacing is a little bit slow, but it did improve compared to the first movie. Some human characters are just assholes because the plot demands them to, instead of being the script (which is also a bit expositional) to justify their actions. However, these are very minor problems that I have with this amazing film!Dawn of the Planet of the Apes improves on everything\u00a0Rise has: marvelous visual effects, well-developed characters (apes and humans), awesome action and a captivating story, with an astounding amount of emotion and compelling moments during the whole runtime.\u00a0Matt Reeves' direction is near perfection and\u00a0Andy Serkis declares, once and for all, that he is, in fact, the best motion capture actor ever!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",

The group of humans surviving in San Francisco have nearly consumed the remaining resources and, on mounting an expedition to try to reactivate the electricity generated from a dam, they encounter Caesar's now well-established ape colony in the forest. Malcolm (representing the humans) and Caesar are able to reach a co-operative understanding, but the human group is prepared to get what it wants by force if necessary, and Koba (the scarred human-hating chimp from the first film) wants the remaining humans destroyed. The power games which result could end in tragedy.The story here is fairly familiar (albeit not necessarily having been done with apes before!), but it is unwrapped well - I never felt that it was overly predictable. It is always moving onwards, always engaging, often exciting, sometimes moving, and the marriage of CGI trickery and real world images is so good that you never know what is real and what isn't. You very quickly stop wondering at the trickery, and simply accept the reality of these intelligent apes.The ape performances are probably, on balance, better than their human counterparts - you care about Caesar in a way in which you never really care about any of the people.This was a very enjoyable sequel.",

            "content": "+ JMJ An impressive multi-faceted film. Beautifully executed are the filmography, CGI, and sound. Instead of hindering the performances of the \"apes,\" the CGI effects help Andy Serkis (Caesar), Nick Thurston (Blue Eyes) and Toby Kebell (Koba)- along with their animators- attract brilliant performances. The cast of human characters almost equal their ape counterparts, including the great Gary Oldman, but this is somewhat undermined by the often false performances of Jason Clarke and Kerri Russell. Nevertheless, \"Dawn\" is an impressive follow-up to \"Rise,\" and a setting for the original \"Apes\" film starring Charlton Heston begins to be established.The story is full of sudden twists and turns and is always suspensive. SPOILER ALERT: One complaint I had initially was the manner of Koba's death and how Caesar seems to give in to an elitist attitude that deems an ape (as anthropomorphized human) no longer deserving of being considered an \"ape\" (as anthropomorphized human being). Ultimately, here Caesar falls into the same pit as his human counterparts, as well as Koba, condensing the life-sensitive worth saving. For Koba, it's just apes that serve all his whims. This is solely for many of the people themselves.Deceptively, for Caesar, it is worth saving only that life which fits his morality criteria (which is indeed a comparatively compassionate one). However, I am informed that Koba's breathing toward the credits is being heard and that the character of Caesar after his attempted execution of Koba has not been morally resolved. I still have to see the sequel: there may still be a resolution to this moral conundrum.",

Serkis does his usual brilliant work, as do many of the other supporting ape roles.

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the godfather of science fiction movies. Simply insane. It is no longer a question of whether the apes look lifelike or not. The technology, which has been brought to astonishing perfection on canvas, recedes into the background and the actors shine in a rousing royal drama that even puts the Shakespearean classic \"Julius Caesar\" to shame. (Now you understand why Andy Serkis got that Name).Actually, there is no reason why Caesar's tribe in the forest and the colony in the city shouldn't coexist peacefully: The dam work lasts a few days, and after that it could be everyone for theirselves again. But fear and prejudice (humans are trigger-happy torturers, apes are wild animals) run so deep on both sides, and developing an understanding of each other is so difficult, that despite the good will of Caesar and Malcolm (Jason Clarke is an amazing successor to James Franco), things slide hopelessly toward disaster. This fatalistic narrative feels so unbelievably real - each time I see myself rewatching this mastercraft of story telling und suspense level unfold on canvas - I'm on the edge of my seat. As a viewer, you root for the characters (on both sides!) so much, and the nonsense of war becomes so painfully clear, that you would immediately forgo the equally ridiculously well directed action sequences (unforgettably, an explosive tank ride filmed from a POV-perspective and a spine-chilling primate brawl on a half-collapsed skyscraper) if only everyone could get along and stop the madness. It's hard to give higher praise to an anti-war film, especially when it comes in the deceptive guise of a CGI summer blockbuster.Rise has already raised motion capture technology and especially performance capture to an impressive level, but Dawn virtually pulverizes all previous standards. Andy Serki's transformation from beloved pet to near-divine leader, and especially Toby Kebbell as the battered Koba - the way the two are breathing life into the computer-animated apes truly is the greatest acting I have ever seen. But don't overlook Karin Konoval's Maurice. She's incredible. Not having Serkis win for any the three movies still remains the greatest Oscar snub to date.Thematically even more mature, narratively even bolder, and visually even more brilliant - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not only a technically groundbreaking blockbuster, but one of the most immersive, moving and effective anti-war films in history. Dawn deserves a place in the Hall of Fame of best sequels of all time.",

To me the first movie seemed like a deeper and richer story that was full of emotion and excitement. This one did have some emotional aspects and did have much more action then the first one but to me it didn't feel as full in story as the other one. On the other hand though the different aspects of the war : human vs. ape, ape vs. ape and human vs. human is what really made the movie. It's also a little disheartening knowing that no matter what species or race you are it only takes one to being about an end.

            "content": "Sometimes there are movies that are simply awesome, and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one such movie. A sequel to 2011's Planet of the Apes reboot, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes picks up ten years after a manmade virus, spread via lab experimented apes, has killed most of the human population on Earth. The small pocket of immune humans left find themselves coming into conflict with the genetically evolved apes, led by ape hero, Caeser, in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco. To say anymore would rob you of the experience that this film has to offer, because Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of those movies that reaffirms why I love movies in the first place.This is one of those rare films that actually transports you into another time and place for two hours and convinces you to invest in characters and struggles that are very different than your own. It is through the magic of movie-making that we are able to do this, but not every movie always succeeds in doing so, however Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does.I think one of the best words I can use to describe the construction of this film is confident. There is confidence in the way that director Matt Reeves chose to shoot many of the scenes in one shot, there is confidence in the way that the script foregoes traditional exposition for seeing rather than hearing, and there is tremendous confidence in the way that the filmmakers have used motion capture technology to realize the titular apes. Everything about this film is phenomenal, from top to bottom. All of the behind the scenes talent create this seamless science fiction world that is believable at every turn. I believed for the two hours of this film that there really were talking apes and not just CG-layered men and women in motion capture suits. A great deal of the believability is a testament to the folks at special effects house, WETA, for realizing the apes and creating texture in their hair and in their skin, selling the illusion. However, WETA and the filmmakers could not have sold the apes without the actors portraying them.While most people will talk about the noticeable human actors that play human characters at the fore (who are all awesome in their parts by the way), the real standout performances come from the human actors portraying the apes. By wearing dots on their faces and special gray suits, flesh-and-blood people became flesh-and-blood apes through the magic of computer technology and animation. Everything these actors did on set, their movement, line readings, and facial expressions, are all relayed in the ape characters, but it is the human soul behind the apes' eyes that really make these ape characters memorable heroes and villains.Just like he was in the first film, Caeser is a sympathetic hero, conflicted by his former love of humans and his desires to keep his fellow ape safe. Motion capture acting extraordinaire, Andy Serkis (Gollum from Lord of the Rings), continues to carve out what is quickly becoming his signature role here as Caeser. While Gollum may have more scenery to chew on, it's with Caeser that Serkis is able to show the wells of emotion deep inside of him in ways that he's never been able to show in previous movies. The fact that he got top billing in the credits made me extremely happy, and it's about high time the Academy recognized motion capture work and voice-over work as acting performances.Speaking of performances worthy of recognition, actor Toby Kebbell very nearly steals the whole show from Serkis portraying the villainous ape, Koba. Koba is the best kind of movie villain, one who is driven by more than a lust for power, but a deeply felt motivation of hatred for the humans who kept him in a cage and tortured him long ago. Whenever Koba is on screen, it's electric. You don't know what the character is going to do, and that is all thanks to Kebbell's performance. He turns Koba into a real live wire that easily rivals any recent movie villain like Loki, and if time favors this film like I believe it will, rivals the likes of Darth Vader. When Koba and Caeser fight in a climactic battle at the end of the film, it's as awesome as any lightsaber duel or superhero smackdown.So in case you haven't noticed, I am over the moon about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. It is the first movie this Summer that I actually felt like had transported me, and that's what I yearn for from a good sci-fi or fantasy film. Of course, not only is it entertaining and emotionally involving, it's also a film that actually has deeper themes beneath the surface, dealing with ideas such as race and species relations, war versus peace, and the importance of family and community. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a rare kind of film, one that maybe only gets made every year or two, if we're lucky. This is true blockbuster movie-making, relying on story, character, and experience, more so than action bombardment.I give Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a 10 out of 10!",

I think the scariest thing for me was that the apes began to take on bad human traits. Committing acts for survival is greatly different from seeking power and revenge. I'm used to it with humans but I expect better from animals.The one thing I can't get my head around is even after a decade of living in a post apocalyptic wasteland the humans still had a plentiful supply of automatic weapons and ammo. The only thing guns are good for is conflict and it's pretty weak for the creators to rely solely on them to instil fear.Overall the movie really could have been better.",

Although the human characters are a bit lacking even though I enjoy the actors most of the time, this is not their movie. From the beginning, this is the ape's movie. It is their characters that are riveting and you find yourself caring about. Their plot and intrinsic motivations that actually matter. The special effects here are amazing to the point that most of the time you are watching the film like you would any other movie with human characters, only that more than half of the characters are CGI apes. I was hoping for a bit more action I must say. Based on the previews, we know there is a battle coming. It is inevitable. Watching it unfold and the meddling humans and apes that try and mess things up to make this happen is alright. The battle then occurs and is good but done in about 10 minutes. Cue plot twists, and some decent character drama from the leaders of the respective groups who want to do the right thing and keep the peace. The rest of the film is spent watching the protagonists try and make this happen, and there are some pretty emotional and suspenseful parts.",

            "content": "It was okay for a movie. The special effects were pretty good, and for that reason alone it was worth seeing. But the story? The direction? Please...lots of plot holes that the the general public have to swallow. For example...the apes live in Muir Woods (from what I can gather--it's only 12 miles from SF and close enough for them to interact...if they lived in the main part of Redwoods, it would be a 300 mile journey back to town, and stretches the belief that the monkeys could follow humans back for such a distance or interact at all, but would be a better place for the monkeys to actually live). It's just not that big. It's only 564 acres. I used to be a farmhand in Kansas, and can tell you that one square mile is 640 acres. So, all these apes are living in this paradise? On less than one square mile of woods? There are enough resources to support their colony? I don't think so. And the story of the need of the dam. I can't find any dam inside Muir woods, but if I am mistaken, so be it. But, San Francisco has other dams...one of them 25 miles away. If the apes live with this dam, you don't have to go back to it. It's not like it's the only dam in the world. Even if the other dam is more easily repaired, it is in the middle of a war zone. Go to the dam that is 25 miles away and be monkey free. That would be the smart thing. The monkeys designate a meeting spot by drawing an obscure symbol on a window. You realize, suddenly, that the drawing matches a window someplace in the city. The fact that the it must be the only window like it in the whole darn city of San Francisco, and every monkey knows exactly where that window is, why, that is nothing short of a miracle. Or the fact that a monkey picks up a camcorder and it has enough power to play the tape left in it from 10 years earlier. Or, why do they follow Caesar anyways? The movie makes a great pitch that they follow strength. OK...I would have accepted they follow Caesar because he freed them. But, if they follow strength, then why didn't a gorilla take over already? As strong as Caesar and the rest of the chimps are, they are nothing in strength compared to one silverback gorilla. This is like comparing King Kong to Bobo the Chimp. If they don't follow strength, then they follow Caesar...but then there is not plot issues later...so for convenience...well, there you go....another plot hole that is glazed over. These plot contrivances of necessity take away from the story because every time these wonderful little miracles happen to advance the plot, you sit back and go...\"Wait one sec...\" or at least, I do. So...special effects? Yeah...pretty good. Story? Um...lots of holes. Character development? The humans are pitiful and underwritten. The main character is doing this for his son, because his son has seen so much tragedy, and he wants to build a better place for his children (exactly the same reason that Caesar is doing this for the apes). Well, Mr. Main Character, every human left alive, of which there are only a handful, has seen exactly what your precious child has seen, too. Also, out of city the size of San Francisco, two survivors who were immune to the simian flu are father/son? Another plot contrivance? I think so...wow...it just goes on and on. People are raving about this movie. I don't get it. The story is just not there. What little story that is there is propped up by more miracles than the Matthew, Mark, Luke or John could have found. If it weren't for these miracles, there would be no story. None. The fact that most of the public, and even the critics are going crazy over this is proof that there is such a dearth of original ideas and good movies out of Hollywood that even something this poorly done is head and shoulders above the rest of the stuff that they are churning out. That doesn't make this good. It just shows how abysmal the rest of the crap really is. Plot holes are just like pot holes...if you don't fill them in, you end up with a bumpy ride that no one enjoys. They didn't fill them in, but just pretended they don't exist. Everyone thinks that this movie is steak, and the rest of the movies are hot dogs. Bad news, folks. This isn't steak. It's just hamburger served on a plate with a baked potato. Not that great. Better than everything else, maybe...but not that great.",

            "content": "No one expected great things from RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, the 2011 reboot of a sci-fi franchise that nobody asked for. There just seems to be something faintly camp about its premise: a monkey acquires human intelligence - from James Franco, no less - and leads his simian brethren in a rebellion against mankind?!? And yet, surprising critics and audiences, RISE made its alternate universe terrifyingly, beautifully credible through its mix of sincere character work, lofty sci-fi and ground-breaking CGI. Miraculously, DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is even better - it blends even more stunning animation and heart- pounding action with huger ideas and bigger emotions, finding within its fiercely-fought battles the metaphor and menace of every conflict and war that has ever plagued mankind.A decade after Earth has been ravaged by the simian virus unleashed in RISE, Caesar (Serkis) has settled his well-evolved community of apes high atop a mountain. But, one day, their idyll is rudely interrupted by the arrival of a band of human survivors led by the kindly, open-minded Malcolm (Clarke). As it turns out, the apes have settled upon a non-functioning hydro-electric dam - the last chance a nearby human colony has of restoring its power supply for good. Caesar and Malcolm forge a tentative alliance - one that rests on a powder-keg of tension and mistrust. Dreyfus (Oldman) urges the human settlers to build up their stockpile of weapons in case they have to take the ape stronghold by force; while Koba (Kebbell) first tries to warn, before he tries to manipulate, his fellow apes against the human menace in their midst.DAWN carries over one element from its predecessor: the increasingly urgent identity crisis and soul-searching that come when man and ape try to figure out how to live with one another. What is humanity? And what is base, animalistic behaviour? Humans can make music, as we see in a heartrendingly sweet moment when the human survivors hear music again for the first time in years. But they also make weapons. The growth of understanding and respect between Caesar and Malcolm is balanced against the sheer hatred of humanity that runs through Koba in the film's second half, and the suspicions and doubt experienced by Caesar's own son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) about his father's 'human-loving tendencies'.All the more impressive is the fact that the film takes no sides: every character feels real, and even the antagonists have perfectly logical reasons for behaving in the way they do. As Koba regresses ever more into a spitting, irrational animal, we can never forget what he suffered at the hands of human scientists: the scars and anger he bears are the legacy of human neglect and cruelty. The same goes for Dreyfus: as he readies the humans for war, we're allowed a peek into the heart of the man when the return of electricity gives him glimpses of a past that he can never forget. In these moments of insight, the film goes from good to great.DAWN is also one of the finest movies made in recent memory that focuses so squarely on the outbreak and tragic inevitability of war. The film explores in intelligent, sensitive detail how conflicts can begin - and lays out in excruciating fashion how having right-minded individuals on both sides of a divide is no guarantee of peace. Director Matt Reeves handles the descent into battle beautifully: every step towards war is a small one, whether deliberate or unintentional, and builds to a crescendo of mutually-assured destruction. The parallels with real-world conflicts, from guerrilla warfare to nuclear destruction, are rife, and will strike you in ways you'd never expect from a sci-fi blockbuster about apes taking over the world.As for the outer trappings of the film, these are truly spectacular - the animation is astounding, especially considering that the motion- capture performed for many of the ape characters took place outside of a conventional studio setting. Soundtracked by Michael Giacchino's bitingly tense score, the action sequences are fantastic: they thrum with action and inventiveness, as the apes storm the human settlement, or tumble through the air in a storm of fire. The cast is uniformly excellent: Serkis, Kobbell and Thurston, in particular, are shrouded by CGI but nevertheless turn in performances bursting with spirit and soul. Clarke plays his one-note \"sensible, good man\" very well, and Keri Russell gets more to do as the medically-trained Ellie than most female leads in such blockbusters typically would.The question is whether audiences can buy completely into the universe created by the film. As was the case with RISE, Reeves and his entire cast and crew have committed wholly to this fiction: DAWN takes itself deadly seriously, never once winking at the audience in acknowledgement of its slightly campy premise. That is, arguably, necessary for the film to reach the heights that it does. If it weren't completely earnest, DAWN's emotional moments - of which there are many - would not be as successful, or as well-earned.However, viewers who remain detached from it all would find it easier to spot the film's draggier moments, or to take note of its odd collapsing of time when the apes attack the human colony. They might also sorely feel the lack of levity in the film; there's only a brief moment of comic clowning by Koba which, unfortunately, shades very quickly into horror and tragedy. Nevertheless, it's hard to deny that DAWN is a powerful, thought- provoking entry into the Apes canon. In making a war between man and ape so chillingly plausible, it easily becomes one of the boldest, darkest and smartest sci-fi films yet to be constructed on a possibly rather hokey premise. Best of all, whether you're here for its philosophy or its explosions, DAWN pays off in spades: giving you plenty to think about even as it teases, pleases and confounds your senses.",

            "review_title": "VIEWS ON FILM review of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes",
            "content": "There seemed to be a lot of audience participation going on during a screening I attended for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. One guy sat near the front and laughed at scenes that were not supposed to be funny. Another guy sitting near me, actually fell asleep for twenty minutes and preceded to snore loudly. Then there was someone who sat in the back and uttered things that made no sense throughout the film's most pivotal scenes. Myself, well I kept looking at my phone (I don't wear a watch so I kept checking the time) because a majority of \"Dawn's\" running time plodded along while recycling the same screenplay (which contains themes of authority, status, and governorship) over and over again.Listen, even after eight movies in the Planet of the Apes franchise have ventured into theaters, humans and hunched over, furry creatures still just can't seem to get along. Oh and I almost forgot, their own kind for some reason, can't see eye to eye either. In this 2014 release containing a large dose of bland, straightforward storytelling undercut with battle scenes borrowed from Saving Private Ryan, the apes grovel and fight with each other till no end (the violence is of the gore-free, PG-13 variety but it still stings).Containing at times, one of the most annoying musical scores in many a moon, featured as a sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes with almost none of that film's returning cast members, and harboring sequences that show gun-toting apes riding wild horses (giddyup!), Dawn of the Planet of the Apes reverts to scenes depicting the aftermath of ten years later. In San Francisco, a virus called ALZ-113 infected humans causing their way of life to almost come to an end. In present day, apes are on one side of said city and said (leftover) humans are on the other. The two sides, trying to refrain from starting an all out war, somehow meet to power up a hydroelectric dam set to better San Fran's power generation abilities. The humans, who live in a sort of dystopian future, form a group of leaders led by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who believes in saving the human race while forgetting the apes, and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) who wants only peace and overall equality from the two sides. Now \"Dawn\" with its lush, dark direction by Mark Reeves (he shot 2008's Cloverfield) and its strong cast, still left me feeling uninterested. It's obviously well made but at times, lacks any adage of genuine thrills, suspense, or perilousness. Also, I miss the old movies in this franchise where the apes almost looked human and spoke perfect English. \"Dawn'\" and the previously released Rise of the Planet of the Apes (from 2011), feature apes that well, look almost exactly like apes. They communicate mostly with sign language and speak minimal dialogue (an example would be one of them spouting the line, \"Apes! Together, strong!). And now as a result, the novelty attached to what's on screen in general, is wearing thin with me. The old ones were tongue and cheek with a smidgen of dark humor. The new ones come off as a little boring and almost too serious.The acting is decent enough even though some of the characters fade in and out of the proceedings. Gary Oldman's Dreyfus is a variation and it piggybacks on his RoboCop performance from February. Nobody wines and winces with his line readings quite like Gary Oldman. Then we have Keri Russell giving a deep, subtle performance as nurse Ellie, a strong woman who grieves the loss of her child from the previous epidemic. Her role is somewhat undeveloped but it's surely no fault of her own. Head ape Caesar is played by Andy Serkis and he's just fine donning the costume and nailing the operatic mannerisms. That leaves Mr. Jason Clarke outgunning everybody with an amazing screen presence and courtliness as a sympathetic figure in Malcolm. He was brooding and intense in 2012's Zero Dark Thirty and he sure does shine here as well.In conclusion, a mixed review is as much praise as I can give Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. I liked the creative opening title sequence, the opening zoom out shot, and the first set of minutes that felt like they came out of the silent film era. But as successful and long running as these films are, I find myself watching the same one over and over again. Evolution says that we came from apes (Darwin to be exact). You'd think that our species and their species could I don't know, at least try to cohabitate. Some much for that. As expected, \"Dawn\" leaves the door open yet again for an inevitable sequel (or prequel or whatever). I have a couple of suggestions for working titles: Growing Tired of the Planet of the Apes and Have Had Quite Enough of the Planet of the Apes. Slammer!",

When it was the 11 July 2014, I was more excited than ever when I went to the theaters. It's a great story. I loved Toby Kebell's character as Koba. I felt Koba's tragic feelings and I actually felt sorry for him when Caesar let him fall to his death (Or major injury). Caeser's character was good too. I know what it is like to rather make peace instead of war but it always happens. I thought this was the best apocalypse movie ever made in this year so far. I have always loved Planet of the Apes because apes are the second most intelligent beings on earth and one day if they could evolve further enough, the could dominate the planet.

            "content": "At least with this year's 'Godzilla', I went into it expecting a clich\u00e9d action movie, but with 'Dawn', the series has,(rightfully or not is a different question), gained a reputation as being able to balance thoughtful reflection with enjoyment, and so I was looking for it to transcend traditional tropes of the genre. But it didn't.However hard the film tries to convince you of its intelligence, its an average action flick. The storyline is bland, an unbelievably predictable, relying on caricatures, not characters, to provide the conflict both within the human and ape species and between them. A corny script, filled with forced sympathy and unconvincing moments of bonding, that results in characters we don't really care for, most notably, and worryingly, the main human character.So why have I given what is clearly a very flawed film a 6? If I dislike it that much why not give it lower? My rating is completely based on the brilliance of the CGI, which provides breathtaking realism to the encounters between simians and humans, and brings to life the main action scene, complete with horse-riding monkeys wielding machine guns. At points you forget that Andy Serkis' Caesar is, well, Andy Serkis, and the technical achievements of the films special effects make it more enjoyable than the story deserves.",

Oh boy was I wrong.This movie may be the biggest flop of this summer(so far). It was either a very slow/semi-romantic/teary scene or just apes/human gone wild. The actors were horrible- the CGI apes were better actors in fact. The actor who played the main protagonist just didn't fit the part and he had difficult time relaying his emotions through the film. The director's job is to absorb the audience into another reality, which the film never did. There was no emotional connection between the audience and the characters(maybe except for the apes). The best thing about this movie is understanding how and why the invasion of the apes on the human population occurred and seeing the similarities in the human's and intelligent apes' behaviors. I don't think this is a big screen movie, I personally left the theater in bitterness and disappointment. If you must watch it, wait until it comes Redbox or movie-streaming sites.",

            "review_title": "A movie worth going \"Ape\" over",
            "content": "It's strange in many ways yet satisfying in an industry sense that perhaps for the first or at least most noticeable time in movie history we have a film in which CGI creations well and truly overrule all human counterparts, for in Matt Reeves perfectly constructed follow up to Rupert Wyatt's well-loved predecessor Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes use of computer wizardry, motion capture technology and motion capture performances culminate in what could be the year's best Blockbuster.In a film filled to the brim with memorable scenes and primate characters, Dawn's cherry on it's very nice top sitting alongside its stunning CGI by the ever amazing Weta group is the outstanding performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar, leader of the apes and most advanced of all the hairy kind. Serkis as Caesar is the perfect molding of character, actor and technology, with Caesar now arguably the greatest ever mo-cap creation right up there with Serkis's other creations Gollum, King Kong and yes even those ever blue Navi's in Cameron's money making machine Avatar. From the close up opening through to the films satisfying conclusion, Caesar (along with his compatriots including the equally praiseworthy Toby Kebbel as Caesar's right hand man Koba) feels completely real, an ape that feels fear, longs for love and fights for family, Caesar is for all sakes and purposes real within this film and real to the audience. While Serkis as Caesar and the apes that follow are reason enough to venture out to the multiplex and catch Dawn it all would have all amounted to nothing if it were not for Reeve's steady hand behind the camera and the story of this newly envisioned Apes universe joining the quality party.Reeves has been working in the industry for some time now, making his debut in 1996 as a feature length director yet not reaching his potential until found footage Sci-Fi Cloverfield made a splash in 2008. On the back of that JJ Abrams led production and following on from the under-appreciated horror Let Me In, Reeves here shows a coming of age as director with an often inspired touch behind camera leading to some of the year's most impressively staged set pieces. Moments within the film such as the Ape's charge on the human stronghold or smaller tense moments such as Malcolm (played by Australian Jason Clarke) venturing into building overrun by some angry apes highlighting that fact that Reeves is indeed the man to take this franchise forward. While Reeves and his Ape chargers are all quite faultless there is no questioning that the film overall is brought back a peg or to by some pretty cookie cutter human participants.Led by the aforementioned Clarke as family man Malcolm the humans struggle to remain relevant in the picture that dedicates far for more effort into the growing of the Ape legion. While Clarke is in no way bad, his reluctant hero Malcolm is far from the human lead the picture needed to jump into near perfect Blockbuster fare. With supports from the underused Kodi Smit-McPhee (the Australian youngster now well and truly grown up) as Malcolm's son Alexander, the lame Kerri Russell as token love interest Ellie and the increasingly over the top and voice raising Gary Oldman as human leader Dreyfus, all human's fail to register on the interest scale or likability scale, again all culminating in the fact that our CGI beasts are the ones we are rooting for.Dawn is by far the most impressive big budget movie unleashed so far this year. A movie that is at many times thrilling, sometimes scary and hugely impressive on a technical level, Dawn is another positive step forward in a franchise that has all of a sudden on the back of these 2 newest additions become one of the most promising properties in the Hollywood canon and if the humans can match our beloved Apes in the next installment, the results will be quite mind-blowing.4 angst ridden teenage apes out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "'DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' was directed by Matt Reeves and stars Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke and Toby Kebbell. Over a decade after the simian flu wiped out most of the worlds humans, Caesar(Andy Serkis) and his band of apes have grown immensely and become much more intelligent. Meanwhile, Malcom(Jason Clarke) and a band of human survivors ask Caesar for help to help humans survive. This creates a rift between both the apes, the humans and the relationships between both. \u200b Very few sequels improve upon the stepping stones left behind by their predecessor. Only rare occasions like with 'The Dark Knight', 'Terminator 2' and 'Fast Five' do we get sequels that are infinitely better than their already brilliant originals. 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is one of these uncommon occasions. Sure it has its flaws(some of which do carry over from 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes') but it also fixes many and doubles the amount of drama and action that was there before. Pretty much everything is either improved or stays the same when compared to its predecessor. Nothing retraces its steps quality wise and that is very pleasing in today's movie climate.For example, the story in the original was very well written and I congratulated the writers for that. Building of the success of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', they could have just slapped a story together to string the events along but they don't and I genuinely admire that. They still put effort into the story and give it meaning and impact. The themes of betrayal and being a father carry over to here which was nice but I would have liked to see something new and different. The ending here, which I won't spoil, is also really good and perfectly sets up 'War For the Planet of the Apes'. Overall, they could have just made a weak story and ending just to hurry up the action but they don't and they genuinely try to deliver a pleasing narrative.Next, there is the acting. I've said it once, I'll say it again, Andy Serkis deserved some love from the Oscars for his mesmerising portrayal as Caesar and I honestly feel its disrespectful they haven't given him one yet. Toby Kebbell was also great as Koba and he has a clear arc from point A - B. All the non-human characters in the film were excellently acted and wrote and were the standouts of the film. That said, most of the human characters were very weak and their acting wasn't too special either. Jason Clarke, for starters, was very weak as Malcolm and showed no joy, sadness or anger at any point in the film. I feel like Gary Oldman at least tried as Dreyfus but that was no match for how poorly written the humans were. I will say that's the main flaw of most of the humans. Most of them were competently acted and whatnot but none of them had any interesting motives or personalities and were all forgettable. None of them were particularly likable and they were all replaceable, both as characters and actors. That said, both the villains were alright and, although one of them had a pretty weak arc for me, both of them were pretty threatening.Technically, this movie is flawless. The cinematography is gorgeous, the visual effects and mind blowing and even the costume/set design was brilliant. Matt Reeves is proving he's a world class director on a technical level and I am always amazed with the visually stunning work he pushes out.Now for the action... It's absolutely awesome! I thought it would be pretty hard to top the action in its predecessor but I was very wrong. I won't go into detail, because you really should see it for yourself, but I must describe ONE tiny segment of action that will have to make you see it. An ape... riding a horse... carrying an assault rifle... while jumping through flames. If that doesn't get you interested in this movie then I don't know what will. Aside from the action, this movie is also pretty damn spectacular on an emotional and dramatic level. This movie pulled at my heartstrings multiple times and must be commended for that. Colour me impressed. One thing I will say was pretty flawed about the movie was some of the dialogue which was unbelievably clich\u00e9 and could be predicted from a mile away. I must of said what a character was gonna say before they said it like 20 or 30 times in the movie because it was pretty damn clich\u00e9.In Conclusion, this movie is dramatic, emotion, action packed, a visual treat and is well worth your time and money. 8/10",

            "content": "\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is a great and successful sequel to it's 2011 predecessor and reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise, \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" and it is one of the best movies of the 2014 summer season! The film is just phenomenal. There is more to this movie than just a summer movie that was critically acclaimed by critics and audiences.This is the eighth theatrical film in the franchise, overall. The critics and audiences praised this film for it's visual effects, story, direction, music, acting and it's focus on emotional depth. I will get into the story of the film first before I get into the other stuff that I like about this movie.The film is set ten years after \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\", this film establishes that a virus called the \"Simian Flu\" that increased the intelligence of the apes has killed most of the human race. Our main protagonist, Caesar struggles to maintain peace as his ape community is drawn into an all-out war with nearby human survivors. The plot is easy to follow, it may take a couple of re-watches to know what is going on, but to me, the plot was simply well-written and I give credit to Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver, who wrote a very great script and story that is just one of the greatest film stories ever created.Now, I get to the other stuff. The first thing I start off with is the concept of the film. A lot of people has said that this film is like The Empire Strikes Back of the Planet of the Apes films and that is exactly what it feels like. A lot critics have liked the combination of an engaging script with impressive special effects and this movie does not fail at all. Story: 8.9 / 10.I move on to the special effects. I love the CGI and motion-capture for the apes in this film as much as I thought I would like and from my point of view, the visual effects company who did this film's work also did the effects for the Lord of the Rings, as well as Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of the 1933 film, King Kong. The visual effects are just impressive.The music by Michael Giacchino, is very amazing and with the choir and orchestra, it feels like an actual Planet of the Apes musical score. A lot of critics really liked the musical score. Me, I definitely like it when I hear a choir in a film's musical score, such as The Polar Express, the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars prequel trilogies as well as The Dark Knight Trilogy. The music is just amazing. The direction by Matt Reeves is just amazing. I have seen his other movie, Cloverfield, which is produced by J.J. Abrams and it is simply amazing, but this film, he really had a lot to prove and it shows because it does not feel like it's a very long movie. The film is as long as it needs to be -- 2 hours and 10 minutes -- is just all I need for this kind of movie. His way of directing the action scenes are great and when stuff goes down in this movie, stuff is going down. I'm talking a big battle with the humans going against the apes and everything, but the best fight scene was at the end when Caesar and the main antagonist, Koba has this one heck of a fight, in which Koba begs for his life, saying \"Apes does not kill apes\" and Caesar tells him, \"You are not ape\" and lets him fall to his death. That part was disturbing for me, but it was also action-packed. The emotional scenes are what really got me to like this movie, along with the action, but the emotional depth that this movie focuses on is really amazing to see. Now, I move on to the final thing that I will mention and that is the acting. Caesar is played once again by Andy Serkis and his performance was so great that I was actually happy to see him in this part again. He blew me away as Gollum and he blew me away even more as the title character, King Kong. I felt that he should have won an Academy Award for his performance capture acting.Toby Kebbell plays the villainous Koba and he is just great, there are moments where he scares you but he works nicely. Judy Greer plays Cornelia and she is great. Nick Thurston plays Blue Eyes and he is great also and Karin Konoval plays Maurice and he is good as well.Now, I move on to the human characters: Jason Clarke, plays Malcolm and he does a really great job in his performance. Gary Oldman plays the role of Dreyfus and he makes a good character work, especially when Oldman played Jim Gordon and Sirius Black, those performances were great. Keri Russell plays Ellie, Malcolm's wife and she does a really amazing job and Kodi-Smit McPhee plays their son, which I am surprised to see him in this film. Overall, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is just a well-made that I think needs to be seen by everyone, not just kids, but family members and film students as well. Also, for kids, who would like to make movies one day, like I do, this is a movie that you should see. If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, let them watch it and see what effect it has on them. This is movie worth buying on DVD and also watching on TV, because this movie is spectacular, remarkable, majestic, amazing, emotional and breathtaking. My rating is a 10 out of 10.",

Half of me went to watch it and the other half wasn't bothered watching it cause it was so bad!Like seriously, the story line is so bull. It is so overrated and the movie is equal or worse than the first movie. Like seriously. It is fake \"deep\" and emotional. Talk about being realistic, you have apes riding horses. Like WHAT?!!?!!.This movie ripped of the story line and character development of several other movies that are written way better such as Avatar. The animation and cinematography of this movie is horrendous. I have watched 'Gravity' and it HAS A BETTER NON-EXISTENT STORY-LINE THAN THIS MOVIE. THAT'S HOW BAD I FIND IT.GRAVITY won like 100 Oscars for animation, score and cinematography, which I found to be unbelievable, but then YOU HAVE THIS MOVIE. ITS LIKE HORRIBLE. The animation is atrocious. The score was harrowing. This is the first and only review that requires me to look up synonyms for \"terrible\". That's how bad it is.IT IS HIDEOUS AND APPALLING.

And I still can't get over the idea of having the chimps on horseback with their short legs - the imagery was just too weird for me and a step too far.Those are, however, my only dislikes. Everything else: perfect! Absolutely brilliant! The very first time you see a human in the movie your heart stops. I was torn between two worlds. Do I side with the chimps or the humans? As the film progresses you constantly switching sides till eventually you on no one's side. Everyone has got very valid reasons for their actions and feelings (and some even scars). For that reason, there's no real villain in the film. Works for me - except we're left with a sad ending...Nevertheless, I was gripped from start to finish and would definitely see it again.

Acting was good, characters had their own part to develop, each had their own depth, good and bad. For those only, the movie was pretty much a good movie for me to watch. However, the plot, for me was a bit of turn down from the 1st one. With the hatred of Koba and Caesar human's love conflict, i was pretty much can guess the ending of the movie after 15-20 mins of watching. Apes, from being a victims of human experiment, now developed hatreds, holding grudge toward human. For me, it was pretty much human-like, not apes. They hate human i agree, but from hate to Koba-like cunning, plotted a very cunning plan to blame human for what they didn't do, well, i don't think that would suit the role of Apes. Apes, they fight for their survivors, as well as human, but only human should have revenges, because of Simian Flu that cost most of human life on earth, and now it surprise me that we- human didn't want to wipe out of all those apes on earth. The movie fall into the trend of making human being a good soul, despite we suffer lots of lost and damages, in fact, we human sometime can be worst than animal. I was hoping for the plot where Koba didn't shoot Caesar, but some human did, and left that rifle at the scene, to make a plot twist when human will sacrifice some of their men, to create a cause and conflict then force apes to attack the human base, in order to protect apes home. And the from that reason, human make a come back to try wipe all apes out, therefore, war starts and once again, apes are the innocent victim of human's greed. The last scene where Caesar and Malcolm holding hands and talk about who start wars first, well, it should be human who make things worse, not apes.",

            "content": "Revenge is the main factor driving Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, where 10 winters have past since the outbreak of the vaccine that changed the world. Leaving only those immune, this lead to the predictable story line of man and ape coming together. In comparison to the previous movie, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', director Matt Reeves doesn't seem to have a grasping enough story line unlike Rupert Wyatt managed with the previous movie.The hooking character of Will Rodman played by James Franco is missed from Rise Of the Planet of the Apes; his and Caesar's emotional relationship touching the audience. I find this gap is not filled in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, as the lead actor Jason Clance, playing Malcolm, just doesn't present a strong enough feel of emotion when connecting and interacting with the apes. On the other hand, Keri Russell reflects her emotions towards viewers when playing Ellie; a survivor with a tough and caring attitude, even when disclosing her tragic past. All her efforts are greatly let down by boyfriend Malcolm's (Jason Clance) lack of emotion. The most recognizable face of course being Gary Oldman, playing Dreyfus; the cowardly leader of the remaining population and typical 'baddy'. Considering Oldman's film history, high expectations were made, but once again we were all let down by the lack of emotion shown... just over the top, bad acting!Looking at Andy Serkis' attempt at Caesar once again, I found that was where I was grasped as a viewer, as his pain and anger was reflected through the way he held himself, and the sudden words spoken, roaring throughout the cinema. All the apes created a visually magnificent experience, but found myself switching off during the drawn out scenes of either fighting or Jason Clance. A waste of graphics due to a poorly written film, lacking all the great qualities of the previous movie.",

            "review_title": "A total nonsense which is divorced from reality",
            "content": "Although I have seen all the movies in the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise, I always thought that the scenario that Earth will be taken over by apes is a nonsense and totally contrary to the known physiology of apes and humans. First, the scenario in this movie that a single simian flu epidemic would kill almost all the humans and lead to the blink of human extinction is not epidemiologically sound. Human gene pool is so diverse that there is a large percentage of humans who are highly resistant to any epidemic. That is why no epidemic in human history has killed humans like the simian flu as portrayed in this movie. This means that hundreds of millions, if not billions, of humans will be immune or recover from the simian flu epidemic. If apes try to take over the world, there will be hundreds of millions, if not billions, of human survivors who are ready to fight the apes with all the modern weapons. Second, the scenario in the movie that apes can wage effective wars against humans is biologically unrealistic. As all of us know, long distance traveling capability is crucial for offensive military campaigns. Bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans do not have the stamina to travel long distance. Their hairy bodies have a tendency to overheat and their knuckle walking posture make it very exhausting to walk long distance. A young adult chimpanzee typically moves only about one to two miles per day and the upper limit of chimpanzee's traveling capability is slightly less than 10 miles per day. Therefore, apes, which become exhausted after traveling only ten miles, make really lousy soldiers for offensive campaigns. In contrast, many humans\u2014even out of shape ones\u2014can run long distance. Some can run marathon or even longer than 100 kms. This makes us much better soldiers for offensive campaigns. (The movie's scene in which apes were traveling in the woods for miles and miles like flying ninjas is a total hogwash.)Third, although the very high intelligence of humans is the main factor behind the fact that there are seven billion humans spread throughout Earth while only half a million apes are confined to relatively small areas in Africa and Asia, there is another crucial biological factor which favored human proliferation. Humans are much more prolific than apes. A typical chimpanzee or orangutan female can become pregnant every four to five years (sometimes every three years) and the female is fertile for only twenty years of its life span. Just like humans, ape females usually give birth to only one baby per birth. Therefore, a typical ape female gives birth to five to six babies (sometimes seven) in its life span. Only about 3 to 4 of these babies survive to adulthood. However, a human female can become pregnant every ten to eleven months. She can stay fertile up to forty years of her life span. (A human female can stay fertile longer because most humans have much longer life spans than most apes.) Therefore, a human female can potentially give birth to fifty babies in her life time and a human female is potentially almost ten times as prolific as a typical female ape. Of course, giving birth to 50 or more babies is very, very rare but giving birth to 10 to 20 babies is not and has not been very rare in many present and past human societies. As we all know, there are and were numerous parents with more than 10 kids. If humans can secure ample amount of food supplies and proper habitats, there will be many, many more humans than apes within only several generations. Under such a circumstance, humans can overwhelm apes by sheer number within several generations. Fourth, I also found the portrait of most humans in this movie as weak, cowardly, docile, unprepared, and complacent to be totally unrealistic. I am sure that many humans are cowardly and unprepared. However, most humans, by nature, are more violent, paranoid, and vigilant than the pathetic portrayal in the movie. Under a crisis situation like a near human extinction and total collapse of order, most humans will try to guard against other humans from robbing and killing them. Therefore, almost all humans will become very, very vigilant, prepared, and suspicious. No human colony (unlike the feeble-minded San Francisco colony in the movie) will keep weapons in a remote armory which is guarded by several stupid drunks and totally rely on a weak leader like the one portrayed by Gary Oldman. Each person will have an underlying paranoia and keep their weapons handy 24 hours a day and even sleep with his or her weapons. This is obvious from recent historical precedents. For instance, even in a lesser crisis like New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, many citizens became paranoid and turned into armed vigilante groups, who jealously guarded their neighborhoods from looters. Moreover, since every adult males and females of a colony is a potential soldier, the governing body of a colony will most likely mandate each citizen to keep his or her weapon handy all the time so they can fight within a moment of notice. The portraits of post-Apocalyptic human colonies in the Matrix and Terminator or even Mad Max series were much more realistic. The humans in those series were vigilant, resilient, violent, courageous, and enterprising. Although not all of us are like that, didn't we become the masters of this planet due to our courage, vigilance, and initiative? I do not think we could have conquered Earth and maintained the control over the planet by just being a bunch of cowards like in this movie. In conclusion, this movie is a nonsensical fantasy, which is based on ignorance of human psychology and ape physiology. Not all works of fiction have to be 100% realistic. However, when its plot deviates so much from reality, a movie stinks to the heavens.",

            "content": "A kind of a pleasant surprise for me. I expected just another dumb CGI- boosted sequel, but the movie does posses some qualities which made me look at my watch only once during the whole screening. It's nothing new, I have seen many movies which show clashes of civilizations, violent consequences of actions made by nervous and ignorant individuals. That part of the movie was a standard plot of that kind and represented a solid backbone for everything else. On both sides there were enough different characters to drive the conflict/truce plot. The power plant subplot seems like a good choice, not too complicated to grasp and gives humans a strong motive for insisting to come back to the woods.The weak side of this kind of movie is its over-reliance on CGI. I never really believe in the ape side of the story. Apes become smart in this whole \"Planet of the Apes\" universe, but if screen is filled with hundreds of CGI animated characters which hunt CGI animated deer, which fight CGI animated bears it very easily loses touch with any reality. Deer and bears are real animals, it's kind of sad to see real animals animated for a motion picture involving cities and humans. With apes, it doesn't get any better because they are all animated. Not just 15% with the background characters being real filmed chimps (which I'm sure is possible to make). Such a cheap method, such laziness.I give it 6/10, solid movie nicely executed. But not more than that. Maybe because it is just one of the numerous sequels. In hands of a capable director, with production focused on one movie only and more courage for live filming, there was material here for a masterpiece.",

            "content": "It's about 10 years since the events of Rise of The Planet of the Apes. The virus that began to spread has crippled most of humanity and only a few isolated segments of people remain without power, heat or means of communication. One such segment is in San Francisco, near the lab where it all began and they are close to running out of food. When a small group of survivors head to the forest in hopes of finding and reviving an old damn that used to power the city, they run into a small group of Apes. What was once feared is now confirmed; not only have Cesar and the Apes survived, they have thrived near the dam and have created a home there. While initially there is an attempt to co-exist, inevitably this situation leads to a battle for power that will ultimately decide the fate of both species.I thought this story was really well done and I was surprised at how moved I was by it. This was a great theatre experience and definitely surpassed it's predecessor Rise of The Planet of the Apes in terms of story telling. Time was taken to show how much progress the Apes had made and how they had formed their own society with education, laws and responsibilities; friendships and families; a peaceful, functional society. The world of the Apes was actually quite engrossing and this was crucial, because it allowed the events that followed to really resonate. The first half of the movie was spent developing the world of the Apes, I found this quite engaging and it really enhanced the film.There were quite a few tense moments to keep you interested as there was always a sense of danger and suspense as things unfolded; this was a very enjoyable and entertaining experience for the over 2 hour running time. There are even a few light moments, such as when Koba (voiced by Toby Kebbal from Rock n Rolla, Wrath of the Titans) has an unexpected encounter with some humans. There's also a notably strong scene that is hinted at in the trailer is when Cesar returns to his old San Francisco home and finds an old video of Will (James Franco) teaching him. I thought this was a very subtle, but really powerful scene.The cast of the film is outstanding. Andy Serkis (Gollum of The Lord of the Rings trilogy), Toby Kebbal (a mostly unknown actor to me) and the rest of the motion capture team have delivered some incredible work here! They breathed life into the Apes and are the very essence of this film; the movie industry needs to find a way to recognize this kind of motion capture work (outside of special effects), because without it these kinds of films simply don't work. Serkis's Cesar owns the screen; whether it's as a powerful ruler, a caring father or a somber ape missing his mentor and friend, Cesar is unquestionably an incredible cinematic creation and one that will not soon be forgotten. Kebbal's Koba is also a fascinating character that you love to hate. He runs the gamut from funny and loyal to conniving and treacherous. Gary Oldman (The Dark Knight, Leon the Professional) as expected delivers a minor but spirited performance as Dreyfus, who's burdened with doing whatever it takes to ensure his people's survival, but is desperately trying to regain the humanity they've lost to the virus. Keri Russell (Felicity and The Americans) isn't given much of a role, but quietly shines as Ellie in a few tender scenes. Jason Clarke however, produces a fantastic performance as Malcolm and throughout the film (along with Cesar) provides its emotional centre. As the film culminates, he and Cesar share a stunningly power scene that left me unexpectedly fighting back tears as it was incredibly moving (that really surprised me).But what makes this movie great are the special effects, they are incredible! Make no mistake, the stars of this film are Cesar, Koba and the Apes. I was amazed how emotions were conveyed in a very genuine, almost human way; so much so that you can't help but be invested in their story. Love, rage, jealousy, sadness, humiliation, fear, dominance, forgiveness; they are all on full display here to amazing effect. You almost forget you're watching special effects driven characters and get lost in them. Again, the special effects guys did a fantastic job here, I can't say that enough. I didn't think the 3D really added that much depth to the movie movie personally, so the film I'm sure will be just as enjoyable if you watch a non 3D screening. There also plenty of meaningful and believable action in this film as well, so if that's your main draw you won't be disappointed either.I felt there was an interesting theme throughout the film of the fragility of peace and the great lengths that one must go to in order to preserve it. Cesar believed that \"ape not harm ape\", but as the film progressed, he eventually realizes that this is not always possible. Despite one having the best of intentions, sometimes violence and the exertion of authority is the only means to maintain peace. An ironic, yet very sobering in it's accurate portrayal of society. I appreciated that the film didn't bash me over the head with it and kept it fairly subtle. This is a fantastic film from start to finish and a wonderful technical achievement; I'm definitely looking forward to the conclusion of this trilogy! This easily unseats X-Men: Days of Future Past as the best film of the year to date. If you're going to see one movie at the theatres this summer: this is it.Was my review not horrible? Great!

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (DPA) is absolutely epic.Characters - The characters in this movie were great. Andy Serkis was incredible like usual and all the other actors in the movie were great too. Jason Clarke played well as the main human. I would prefer Franco more but Clarke was really good making out his characters. And every single ape I. This movie were awesome. I actually liked he character Blue Eyes who is Saesar's son. He was a great addition to the movie. And I really liked Koba the scary looking monkey he was a big part of the movie. Gary Oldman of course acted well like always and he actually played as more of a good guy. At first I thought his character was going to be kind of a bad guy from the trailer but he turned out to be the good guy.Story/Plot - This movies story and plot is so well created. The movie has a perfect length. The 2 hours and 10 minutes was literally e perfect amount of screen time for this movie it wasn't to short it wasn't to long. The plot totally surprises you. I thought this movie was going to go in a while another direction b actually went in a way that was unique and well played out. The movies story and plot works out great and the whole movies just makes you feel pumped and excited.Action Sequences - The action in this movie is great. I was a bit disappointed when Rise of the Planet of the Apes had little action just at the very end so I was happy to seen that this movie had a ton of awesome action. The ends action sequences are absolutely awesome. So the action in this movie is so well executed and I think the action is just pure epic. Just pure epic.Pros -Perfect Movie Time Length Epic Action Squences Well Created Plot and Story Superb Acting Incredibly Entertaining (No Boring Moments) Great Character DevelopmentOverall - So overall DPA is entertaining as heck and is my favorite Live-Action movie so far this year 2014. I am going to give DPA a 10/10. I also do have to throw in that is movie is better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes even though RPA is a really good movie, it's just that is one is a lot better. And I'm also giving DPA an (A)",

The setting is the same as in 60's westerns where they were really trying to use the viewpoint of indigenous people, but the plot and characters are more simplistic. For example, they say that the virus has left alive only those who are 'genetically' best part of humankind, and then we see the society with mainly white characters?How else should we interpret this movie than a racist nightmare story, when there are only black apes and white humans against each other? And why this worst human character has to be Dreyfus? To point out that the most unreliable soldier might have been noticed just because of his (jewish) name? And then - how should we see the meaning of the 'ape' ruler: is he really like Cesar or more like Malcolm X? The original Planet of the Apes had also it's racial subtext, but nothing has really changed in four decades, has it?",

Set 10 years after the events of Rise, this follow up sees humankind dwindled down to a small collection of survivors of the Simian Flu, whilst the scientifically enhanced apes are slowly but surely evolving into the superior species. Matt Reeves (Let Me Go) takes over from Rupert Wyatt behind the camera and brings a seamless continuation of astounding visual style and highly intelligent narrative drive. It's easy to highlight the awe-inspiring CGI simians \u2013 and the human motion-captured performances behind them \u2013 as a standout, because quite frankly, their creation is one of modern cinema's greatest visual achievements along with the Na'vi (Avatar) and all of Gravity. In particular, the ape leader Caeser is a tour de force; Andy Serkis' unparalleled mo-cap work and the flawless, meticulously detailed computer effects that bring him to life combine to craft a mesmerizing and memorable protagonist that sits in the highest echelon of filmic characters, period. Yet while the action sequences are outstanding and the CGI is immaculate, it's the Oscar worthy screenplay that makes Dawn a blockbusting masterpiece. Unafraid to venture into mature, emotional territory, the filmmakers give the plot room to breathe and \u2013 as a rarity in mainstream movies \u2013 the story propels the action and not the other way around. Additionally, the major players \u2013 humans and apes alike \u2013 are imbued with multi-layered character arcs and richly textured personalities, allowing the likes of Serkis, Toby Kebbell (Casear's vengeful right hand man Koba), Jason Clarke (the human \"hero\"), Keri Russell (Clarke's doctor love interest) and Gary Oldman (the battle weary human leader) to create affecting and captivating personas. Enthralling, clever, subversive and breathtaking, Dawn is everything you could ask for in a film.",

            "content": "\"Dawn\" explores new territory in the evolution of a new world society. Its prequel explained the origins of the new breed of apes and explored issues of genetics and experiments on animals, particularly apes. One of the most memorable scenes in movie history has him speaking at the end of that movie, and it's a chilling moment. Overall, the film is pretty good and sets up this amazing second chapter.This is a remarkable film because it gives a detailed look at Caesar's world, and its differences and similarities between them and our world. Because of a tragic turn of events, they're more similar than one expects: they both seek survival and fear each other. Caesar has put together a society where things seem to be working for the most part, except there is a bit of turmoil originating from a few disgruntled members, including Caesar's son and most importantly, Koba. Koba reminds us of some of the most radical members of our own society, and to balance things out, there is Dreyfuss (Oldman), an army man who is a leader of sorts in San Francisco protection agencies, a complex character that becomes key in the final third of the movie.We know from the beginning that fear makes people become irrational and reckless, and since both species are more similar than either would like, mistakes are made, revolutions start, and key figures are threatened or killed. Caesar himself becomes the target of a maneuver instigated by a member of his own tribe. Things deteriorate, leading us to see one of the most spectacular battles in movies. With the help of special effects, striking image after striking image remind us of the power of the movies.Still, nothing would work if the acting, writing, editing, and directing weren't in place. Andy Serkis shines again in a very difficult role. He commands the screen as the dignified leader who must rule a new type of world. He's a complex figure who is loyal to his kind but can't forget his attachment to people in his past. His eyes are certainly spectacular. He has probably topped his work in \"King Kong\" and \"LOTR\".The film takes its place as the best of the year so far. Hopefully people will honor it accordingly when awards are given.",

There are fisticuffs back and forth with those who claim to work for justice and, of course, talking apes. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of friendship and violence.

Most of the first act is a simple, enveloping visual treat - establishing the world as it now stands and savoring the unique visuals of San Francisco (and the surrounding area) in the aftermath of a near-total human annihilation event. Crumbling cityscapes, creeping plant life, reverberations of a lost civilization... this story lends itself nicely to vivid, poignant splashes of scenery, and the effects team is more than up to that challenge. In fact, moving on from that slow, thoughtful series of reflections is a feat the film struggles with. Though rich and layered in its own ways, the story plays second-fiddle to the mood at large, and often feels telegraphed by the events of the first film (not to mention the original series). It's a deep, thought provoking installment, with some lights-out physical acting from the entire motion-capture cast, but I couldn't shake the sense that it could have stretched itself much further than it did. When it came time for the parallel climactic face-offs amidst the fireworks of an unavoidable human/ape warzone, I kept thinking to myself, \"Is this really all there is?\" Firm, fiery and intelligent, but perhaps a bit too safe, too happy to fall back on a set of standard action movie routines. Beautifully dark, it's also a decided step down from the promise seen in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.",

James Franco is missing from this movie, I wanted to see more Franco/Caesar dialogue the new cast are just one- dimensional fluff pieces, and completely forgettable. The first 30mins of this movie I found a complete yawn, I found it unlikely some plot devices actually happened (really? take an already violent human into the ape camp? why? does anyone know his name or what he brought to the group really?) and does Hollywood really think we're that stupid? I guess so.Compared to the original movies, with their confusing and complex plots, diverse characters (even though they were mostly apes), sub-plots abounding between religious caste and military caste not least to mention Charlton Heston's confusion about what planet he was even on - time travel movies or anything related to paradox is very hard to pull off, yet it was done with NO CGI and somewhat simplistic costumes (ground-breaking for it's time though).No, what we have here is a simply violent adaptation and I was sorely disappointed as a result. I found the story bad, the script poorly written with no meaningful characters on the human side of the equation - possibly the most important, Andy Serkis was strong - but no one else was. Gary Oldman was the lone human stand out - but one person cannot pull an entire movie from a bad beginning, unless your Tom Hanks and you're stuck on an island. For entertainment this movie earns 1 point, for CGI also 1 point and Andy Serkis performance again 1 point. The rest of it is complete garbage, ALL the starting characters we see (the first 30 minutes of the humans - the ones that visit the ape camp) are completely forgettable. 3/10.

            "content": "Despite the heavy reliance on special effects, the movie features some good acting and manages to tell a story. That being the case, the movie has a major problem: the apes simply are not anthropomorphic enough to inspire empathy. As one of the humans, referring to the apes, says in the movie: \"They are animals!\" And he is correct. Unlike the original Planets of the Apes movies, in which the apes have actually become civilized, in this movie they are still animals ... and act like animals too. Instead of being worthy adversaries, they are vermin. True, the apes mimic some features of human behavior, but it comes off as entirely contrived. The movie sets up a conflict between the humans and apes that tests the limits of plausibility. The movie asks the audience to accept the premise that apes have feelings too, which is probably true of all animals. But when the movie also asks the audience to accept another premise, that apes are of equal intelligence as humans, then the movie becomes a fantasy. The scene showing a chimpanzee and a human being bonding as friends and equals is asking a lot from the audience which has to believe that cross-species friendship, based on equality, is possible. Even more preposterous are the scenes of hordes of chimpanzees fighting like soldiers, operating complex weapons and under a single commander. As much as one may want to sympathize with the rage of the apes, they're still animals. Yet, if one buys into the political implications of this movie, that the apes in fact have a legitimate gripe, then the story has some substance. One could even feel sorry for the apes who simply want to be left alone. Then again, the same could be said for a long list of species and for many human cultures as well that are now extinct. They only wanted to be left alone.",

You've got a sensible human man with his sensible wife, and a sensible ape with his sick wife and scarred son. They are teamed up with a trigger-happy ape-hating human on one side and a war-mongering ape on the other. Hmm\u0085 wonder what will happen? Yes, exactly that will happen and nothing else.This kind of stuff frustrates me and I hope it is not as obvious to you, cause then you'll probably enjoy this movie.

The motion capture and rendering of the apes are simply wonders of vfx and the environment work of nature reclaiming San Francisco is very well done. The effects don't really feel like effects, which is the highest compliment I could give an effects driven film. The apes are believable and never for a second do I feel like I'm viewing pixels. The premise of the film is unconvincing at best and the series of events that lead to all out war are based on flimsy gaps of logic. The humans who occupy San Francisco are running low on fuel for energy and a dam that could provide an alternate source of energy is in ape territory and the humans will lay to waste any ape in the way of that dam if need be. No solar panels in San Fran? Wind energy? The screenplay just needs a connect the dot plot point to introduce tension. The humans barely register as a presence and we get simple variations of good and bad characters. If Andy Serkis did motion capture for CG humans, he probably would have been more compelling than the black void Jason Clarke and Keri Russel leave on screen. As Ape society begins to crumble when the threat of the human element is introduced, we get the soon to be villainous Koba, who's intentions are telegraphed the moment we first see his short fuse. Even though the ape material isn't the most compelling stuff, it's still far more fascinating to watch than any of the human scenes. Though another connect the dot plot point is introduced with an assassination attempt on Caesar, that somehow no ape seems to witness - which lazily sets up the entire last act. The effects are fantastic and the money spent is on the screen, so while the film is riddled with narrative issues, it's still worth a view for those qualities.",

Reeves, and everyone else behind this, and 'Rise of the planet of the apes', want to tell a story so involved, and so true, that all of us do well just to lose ourselves in its narration. While the originals stood as contemporary re-imaginings of how it must have been during the era of slavery, with things straight, as well as flipped, this new series un-imagines that, and only asks to be viewed as a straight tale of conflict between two differing species. Make no mistake, this would have worked even without the outbreak of Simian flu, or the main protagonists(?) being apes themselves. It's just a tale of inevitable, and when it starts, escalating, conflict. Each action scene is so carefully interwoven into the situation that the entire movie just flows, and doesn't even allow me to add the suffix, 'from one scene/sequence to the next'. It just flows. The mo-cap, of which plenty has been spoken already, has to be the best ever. I cannot imagine the scale to which each technical team-member would have slaved their hearts out to achieve what is done in this, making this as impactful as a Pixar animated classic. Kudos.The performances? Much will be written of Serkis, but Toby Kebbell, Karin Konoval (Maurice) and Nick Thurston (Blue Eyes). Jason Clarke almost evoked 'the man with no name' in the rain with his poncho during one sequence. Intentional/not, I might never know. But it's always nice to be reminded of the western genre (this totally/tonally fits right in). Gary Oldman was fantastic, as he is always, while Keri Russell and the rest did their jobs, but casting them specifically did not do much for the film per se.The usage of sign language, even though its origin is left unexplained, is like a breath of fresh air, and its application has to be lauded.I've always maintained that CGI is magnificent only when it does not remind the audience of its existence. Other than for a couple of scenes with dire in them, I would not have been able to tell if something happening was actually shot, or if it was an effect. I'm sure the VG players would have a better time spotting their occurrence/s. Cases in point for the opposite - any John Cena movie explosion and Die Hard 5 (yes, I suffered through the entirety of the latter, and switched channels when I chanced upon the former).Plot-wise, this pays homage to the ape-centric movies, 'Conquest' and 'Battle', and not just by the name of the main protagonist. Both this one and its predecessor have totally moved away from the purported star-heavy reboot that was an embarrassment to Tim Burton's resume a few years previously.Whoever thought it was a good idea to do away with letterbox format and film instead in 1.85:1 should be kicked in the ...... Most of us were lamenting the absence of the widescreen aspect ratio, not just during the action set-pieces, but also during the quiet/meditative moments. Idiots! The human characters were not as involving, and for a movie with 'planet' in its title, this does very little to examine the plight of humans/apes on other continents (perhaps there aren't any, since there is no evidence of apes being shipped out, so to speak). More backstory, other than the title newsie-montage, would've been a good idea, and a significant departure from the original series.... I will be revisiting this quite a few times more fo sho, esp. if I get an opportunity to do the same on IMAX. Don't miss it!",

Living a peaceful existence in the wilderness of a San Francisco forest near an abandoned dam, the apes have carved out a life without humans who they presume have long died out due to the simian flu virus. Their leader Caesar (Andy Serkis) has set up an enormous community of primates and has taught sign language to his subjects, and some, like him, can even speak. The genetically-evolving apes are celebrating the arrival of a new baby, all the time wondering if humans have indeed been wiped out. But alas, the ape's idyllic lifestyle is rudely interrupted! When least expected, up trundles a bunch of those pesky humans led by family man Malcolm (Jason Clarke), searching for hydro-electric power. If the humans can restart the nearby dam, you know it really will be a case of \"lights back on, camera and... action\"! After a period of deliberation, negotiation and intimidation tactics between the species a raging battle begins.'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' presents a simple conflict of interests, but the characters on either side are written with an appealing depth. What could have easily become an annoying cavalcade of obvious mix-ups between species becomes something so much more fascinating. The humans' leader (Gary Oldman), for instance, who wants to decimate the apes if they won't allow access to the dam, is not a mustache-twirling sadist but simply a frightened and grieving man charged with protecting his small pocket of humanity. On the other side, the intelligent, heroic and non-belligerent Caesar has a scarred and bad-ass adviser, Koba (Toby Kebbell), who hates humans because they tortured him in the lab. Caesar still remembers the kindness he received from some humans and brokers a peace between the two factions. This does not sit well with Koba who longs to battle. He will soon get his wish.Matt Reeves takes the reins of this shrewd franchise and runs confidently with visceral wanton destruction. He conjures a spectacle, delivering both action and character drama, that has you cheering on instinctively. When you are sufficiently captivated by the story not to raise so much as a smile at the spectacle of an enraged chimpanzee on horseback brandishing a machine gun, then you have to give credit where it's due. Andy Serkis doffs the motion capture cap as Caesar. He gives Caesar a quiet dignity and, almost makes him human in his emotions. The digital effects are seamless and combined with Serkis' acting beneath it, a believable sense of compassion and anger is conveyed. Toby Kebbell excels in being completely terrifying under his ape guise, enabling the scenes between himself and Serkis to become tightly wound and impactful drama. The humans take somewhat of a back seat but help guide the story along with their meddling and moral turmoil.All through this riveting drama, your disbelief remains willfully suspended.

The motion capture is very well done. HOWEVER!!! I do not believe Andy Serkis deserves any awards consideration. Sure, he's talented and yes he is good at what he does, but IMO he's just as good as any other motion capture ape in this movie. Now onto the plot: WHAT PLOT!!!??? The whole plot was basically the humans had to start up a dam for electricity to the city....that's it and then the monkeys start becoming mad and it is apes vs. apes. The whole plot of the movie right there.The human characters are so boring and one dimensional that I felt nothing throughout the entire film. all they do is talk with Caesar and that is basically it. Gary Oldman is wasted in this movie as his talent could have been used somewhere else. The pace of this film is very slow and I never felt as if I was on the edge of my seat. I was honestly waiting for this film to be over.Rise of the Planet of the Apes was so much better than this film. That film had rousing action, good human characters, and above all Heart!!

The thing that carries this film is it well rounded characters, both ape and human alike. I didn't matter what species they were because they were so well developed it allowed you to see things from the perspective of every character and it became increasingly difficult to choose what side to support. Even when some did something that you couldn't support it was still easy to understand their choices and feel something for the characters who made them. All the performances in this film were excellent Andy Serkis continues to prove that he is an actor like no other he just perfectly nails the heart and soul of Caesar and there could not have been a more perfect choice to play him. Toby Kebbell has never really impressed me but I have to say I loved him in this movie, he nailed Koba's rougher and more damaged nature and makes it clear how much similar Caesar could have been to him had his upbringing been ever so slightly different. Jason Clarke was very good in this movie, he was very easy to get behind and never felt as if he was out of place. Gary Oldman was fantastic in this movie he easily gave the best performance of the human cast with the way he made you feel sympathy for his character. This film looks stunning and lot darker and more dreary than Rise but that feels appropriate for the darker tone this film is trying to convey. The world feels and looks as if it has been through hell and never makes you second guess that it has. The filmmakers really set the darker tone for the movie very early one and I loved that about this movie, its ability to go much darker when it needs to and always feels appropriate when it goes down that path. Matt Reeves directed this movie in a phenomenal way, he's great and showing scale as well as scope, he has a keen eye for action sequences which are all fantastic and nothing less than believable. The CGI for the apes is again spectacular, you feel as if you truly are watching walking and talking apes, thanks to the special effects in equal parts to the actors who so perfectly portray them. My biggest issue with this movie, like Rise, is the material for the human characters. Like I said they establish them very well and all make understandable choice the problem is that there story was just simply never as interesting. The arguing and tension among them felt quite standard and less interesting in comparison to the apes and the whole plot set up the repair the damn never really went anywhere. This new trilogy had consistently surprised me, I like them all a hell of a lot more than I ever thought I would and has always given me plenty to think about while I am watching them. This film looks amazing, has fantastic direction, well rounded characters with superb interaction between them. Despite some issues with the human characters I find myself enjoying this franchise more and more with every new release. 8.7/10: A- (Fantastic)",

I don't know why I seem to keep underestimating this series because I didn't expect this sequel, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to be that great. Not only is the film great, it's probably the best summer blockbuster this year and will no doubt make my top ten list by the year's end. The virus at the end of the original film has almost wiped out humanity. There are small groups of survivors who are genetically immune to the virus. One of these survivors is Malcolm (Jason Clarke) who is on a mission to find an alternative power source since his group of survivors, including Gary Oldman and Keri Russell, are running out of their resources. While out in the forest, he runs into the apes, ruled by Caesar (Andy Serkis). Despite an uneasy truce between man and ape, tension boils and war becomes inevitable. I know people were trying to rally for an Oscar nomination for Serkis and his portrayal of Caesar. That fell on deaf ears. This time around, expect them to make even louder noise. Serkis delivers his best performance in motion capture to date and gives us a deep and inspirational character here. Caesar is a born leader; he commands the screen just as much as he commands his apes. Stop with this nonsense of what is his performance and what the do the animators manipulate. Look at what is brought to the table; we have a compelling character that we care for. I found myself on the edge of my seat with excitement whenever Caesar was on the screen and his second in command Koba is right there with him. Scarred from numerous testing by humans, Koba is a classic tragic character. You know that he doesn't trust the humans; his experience with them is the complete opposite of Caesar's. You know where he is coming from and you know where he is heading. His actions are justified in his eyes and you never outright hate him. This is what great writing, performance, direction and stellar animation is here. We have two unforgettable characters at odds with each other, even though they both respect and love one another. If you were impressed with the motion capture animation of the first film, marvel at what they've accomplished here. You'll rub your eyes a few times thinking these apes were real. The attention to detail is astonishing and should rightly be awarded come Oscar time. A film like Transformers adds nothing new, special or awe-inspiring in terms of its effects. Sure it looks cool, but this film makes the special effects integral to the emotional core of the story. The facial expressions on these apes make you feel more emotion than what many actors try to achieve their whole career. Reeve's stages exciting action sequences in the third act, when both the humans and apes collide. The special effects stay first class. You never lose sight of where you are in the action. Reeves constantly makes sure that we as the audience, are aware of the action in correspondence to the characters. It's refreshing to be able to see what's going on up on that screen. All building up to the emotional climax. This film simply has it all. It runs a long 130 minutes and it feels a tad long due to some pacing issues, but a lot of those scenes are to flesh out the characters. Both apes and humans are given their time and no one really gets the short stick. We spend most of our time with the apes, but we never are told to side against the humans. There are individuals on both sides that make stupid decisions. The film's one clich\u00e9d hiccup is that it uses a one-dimensional character that has been written a thousand times before in these films to initiate the tension. I can handle one hotheaded trigger-happy one-dimensional character in this piece because we are given deep and interesting characters to actually care about. Dawn is an intelligent spectacular Hollywood blockbuster in a time when there are thousands of mindless boring flicks that companies just throw money at. This is proof, right here, that with patience, care and talent you can have an engaging thrilling film that people will want to see and talk about. Stop with the product placement, high priced trash that gets spit out of the ass end of Hollywood. We need more films like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.",

            "content": "Director Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) continues his hot streak with DotPotA, a sequel to the emotional and financial success from 2011. The premise (apes behaving and communicating like humans) remains terrifying for us hominids, but we continue to root for our supposed \"enemies\". It's a dark and scary film, not without moments of levity, which overcomes some clunky expositional dialogue with huge heapings of heart. Throw in one of the greatest characters in all of scifi (Serkis's Caesar), and a truly memorable villain, Dawn is an intense success. Ten years after the first film, Earth has fallen into a post-apocalyptic nightmare. Humans are dying off from spreading disease, and apes are advancing. This sets the stage for a much larger scale story than the first, dealing with temporary peace treaties and growing dissonance between worlds. So much of the film works, but aesthetics may be its shining point. The ape effects are still pretty spectacular, with the ever-competent Serkis doing some of his best work. There are amazing fire motifs, breathtaking destruction, inventive cinematography, and sets that are beyond fantastic. All of which leads to an end battle that pays off\u0085full of personality and exhilaration. Now, like the first the human characters aren't the strongest aspect of the film, although they are improved here. The filmmakers seem more focused on the complexities of the apes. \"Good\" and \"bad\" never painted in broad strokes, apes being simultaneously heartbreaking, scary, and integral. In the end, Dawn has all we love in great science fiction: complex characters, thrilling adventure, big brains, and deep soul.",

He's had pretty great success at making Apes films, as he was behind both this film and 2017's War for the Planet of the Apes. He also wrote the fun popcorn flick Under Siege 2: Dark Territory. Oh yeah - and he also created the TV show Felicity.Ten years later, a group of people in San Francisco struggle to stay alive in the aftermath of the Simian Flu epidemic that's wiping out humanity, all while Caesar tries to maintain dominance over his tribe of apes located in the Muir Woods.The humans are led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke, the remake of Pet Sematary) and they accidentally encroach into ape territory in search of a hydroelectric dam. Caesar's son Blue Eyes and his friend Ash encounter the humans and Carver injures the latter. Koba, a bonobo scarred by human tests, urges Caesar (again, Andy Serkis) to go to war with the humans. However, Malcolm, his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee, who was in The Road and played Nightcrawler in the later X-Men movies) become friends with the apes, even treating Caesar's wife Cornelia's illness.Judy Greer, who played that role, has a husband who is a huge Planet of the Apes fan. They had a chimp husband-and-wife cake topper at their wedding, while Planet of the Apes and Rise of the Planet of the Apes played at the bar.Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), another human leader, takes up arms, Koba goes into action. He sets the ape settlement on fire, nearly kills Caesar and blames the humans. When Ash refuses to betray Caesar's teachings, Koba throws him to his death and locks up anyone loyal to their fallen leader.War between ape and human is inevitable, even if Malcolm and his family save Caesar and nurse him back to health. Koba must fall, the first human army must be defeated and then the tribes of apes will be ready for the War for the Planet of the Apes.Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver returned to write this film, joined by Marc Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard, Insurgent, The Wolverine).I dig that the orangutan is named Maurice, which is a reference to Maurice Evans, who portrayed Dr. Zaius in the original films.The ending is pretty great, too. Koba is left hanging from a ledge after being knocked down by Caesar. He tries to say that \"Ape shall not kill ape,\" but Koba has already broken that rule many, many times by killing Ash and other apes. Caesar declares that Koba is not an ape and kills him.",

            "content": "I went into Dawn super excited to see the story of Caesar continued, and I was not disappointed.Dawn is a very different movie from Rise and I often find it very difficult to determine which I like more. I like different aspects of both films. They've become tied for my favorite movie, period.If Rise was emotional, Dawn was a roller-coaster. No single movie has brought tears to my eyes during so many different scenes. I haven't become so invested in characters in a movie for a long time, you can't watch it without feeling something for them. Most of that was due to the acting, especially in the ape characters. The performances were incredible, especially after you've seen behind the scene clips to strip down and see the actors themselves and how much they put into their roles, emotionally and physically. Some of what they express is so subtle but so powerful, and that is the movie's biggest strength. Without such amazing performances from the ape actors, Dawn wouldn't be half the film that it is. Weta really stepped up their hyper realism game as well, the apes look so real that I swear I could reach out and touch them. There was no point where I thought to myself \"That's CGI\", unlike Rise, where there were a couple brief moments. In Dawn, we see more ape characters developed than just Caesar as with Rise. I enjoyed getting to know more apes and its not a stretch to say many of them are very likable, or at the very least understandable in their motives. Its great to see how the apes as a whole have developed, the society they've created for themselves, and the forming of their culture. I could have watched an entire film, easily, focusing purely on the apes without any humans involved at all. The only complaint I have about Dawn is that I wish we could have been shown more of their way of life, not just the beginning sequences before humans show up and everything starts to turn upside down. In many ways, the beginning was a show of what could have been but was not to be, and in that lies the tragedy of what did end up happening. The ending has such a sense of hopelessness that its painful.This is the apes' story. And man, is it a story that I can't wait for more of. I can't recommend these movies enough.",

That is probably why it starts off in exactly the same way as Resident Evil, with a virus wiping off the largest part of humanity. After that, the film becomes like Terminator Salvation with simians instead of cyborgs. I tried to watch this film but matter how hard I tried, I couldn't keep my eyes on the screen for more than a minute each time. What makes this film incredibly boring is the production design and photography which maintain the same tedious visual style from the first to the last frames. Most of the action takes place in a ruined city, the type which an avid film-goer has already seen countless times in the past. I think this film would have benefited from a change of scenery. A nice stretch of Californian coast would be far better than the dark colors of this gloomy looking Matrix clone, although my own personal preference would be the Great Wall of China, it was they who invented the Monkey King after all. It would be nice to know what happened to the monkey population of the rest of the planet since the series is named PLANET of the Apes, however we don't get a glimpse of humanity outside the United States of America even though there are many Asian and African countries with a much larger monkey population. The zombies climbing the Wall of Tears are a nice touch in World War Z, you can only imagine how better the monkeys could've handled such a scene.OK, the credits were good but only because they used the same fonts as the old Apes films which by the way are far better than this one and the make up more sophisticated.",

            "content": "One just has to remember Tim Burton's 'Planet of the Apes' to realise how tricky it is to bring to life the humans-versus-simians premise which the French novelist Pierre Boulle had first envisioned and which spawned the five original movies that were released between the years of 1968 and 1973. And yet after Burton's ill-conceived reboot, Rupert Wyatt's 2011's 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' confidently overcame skepticism with a smart, gripping and exciting origin film that grounded the film in today's reality by using the search for the cure for Alzheimer's as a jumping-off point and making the apes the more sympathetic characters.Wyatt doesn't return for this sequel; 'Cloverfield's' Matt Reeves is at the helm, but if there were any doubts whether Reeves could fill in the sizeable shoes left behind by his predecessor, let us reassure you by the end of this brilliantly-directed, poetically-written and superbly- acted film that it is unequivocally just as good, if not better. Returning to script are writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and together with Mark Bomback, the trio has fashioned this follow-up as intelligent socio-political allegory of the sectarian violence that continues to rear its ugly head ever so often, in the process taking the franchise to new, ambitious and thrilling heights.Set ten years after the Golden Gate bridge shutdown, it sees the apes having escaped with their leader Caesar (Andy Serkis) into the redwood forest outside San Francisco settling into a peaceful community which has learnt to communicate with each other through sign language that is translated for our benefit with the generous use of subtitles. It isn't just apes of course; among those which return from the first movie are the orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval), the loyal chimp Rocket (Terry Notary), and Cornelia (Judy Greer), who is now Caesar's wife.Deliberately taking it slow for the first 20 minutes in order to allow its audience to settle into the routines of its simian characters, the pace picks up very quickly once they meet a ragtag group of human survivors led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke). On a mission to revive the city's electricity by restoring the O'Shaughnessy Dam, Malcolm and his group inevitably have to encroach upon ape territory, and the discovery of man amidst their home ground sets Caesar and his trusted deputy Koba (Toby Kebbell) on a divisive path that ultimately establishes the stage for their climactic battle. While Caesar is willing to explore the possibility of peace with the humans, Koba is deadly insistent on waging war in order to claim superiority - and it probably comes as no surprise that Koba gets his wish.It isn't just the apes that have to confront their trust issues with the other species; even as Malcolm tries to convince his kind that the apes aren't just savages, the memory that the species was responsible for the virus which killed many of their loved ones remains etched deeply in the minds of the human survivors holed up in a guarded compound in the middle of a decimated, foliage-covered San Francisco. Especially after Caesar's show of force following an initial altercation, their unofficial leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) starts to build up their own arsenal of weapons, the former military man still grieving the loss of his family understandably wary of the primates.There is as much character here as there is plot, so kudos to the writers for taking a character-driven approach to the narrative. Building on Caesar's personality in the first movie, this one gives him an opportunity to demonstrate the leadership he so professes as he forges an uneasy truce with the humans, proving himself to be both firm and compassionate at the same time. Koba is a persuasive contrast, a former abused lab monkey scarred by savage hate and therefore from an ideological standpoint clearly opposed to the idea of peace and goodwill. Malcolm and Dreyfus are their human equivalents respectively, both characters surprisingly textured as they develop and discover their response to the threat at large from their own experience with the apes.Indeed, there is mistrust between, as well as, within each species - and as we slowly realise, the human and ape stories come together perfectly to mirror each other, culminating in Caesar's sad but honest proclamation: \"I always think ape better than human. I see now how like them we are.\" Reeves works that internecine conflict whether ape or human to tense and frightening effect, ratcheting up the tension to build towards some truly spectacular action setpieces. Yes, this being a summer blockbuster, you can rest assured that the filmmakers have not forgotten to satisfy audiences looking for some visceral entertainment.Those who are familiar with the city may be able to pick out the resemblance to California and Market Streets in downtown San Francisco, which production designer James Chinlund transforms into an epic battleground where the standoff between apes and humans explodes in jaw- dropping terror. When all hell does break loose, it is truly a sight to behold, but what's even more admirable is Reeves' ability to balance these big scenes with some genuinely intimate moments, ending on a heartbreaking and surprisingly sombre note that packs a powerful emotional punch. Reeves finds new definition in 'emotional spectacle' - that's how good the mix of emotion and action comes together. On almost every level, whether storytelling, emotion, acting, or action, 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' exceeds its predecessor. It isn't just a great summer action-adventure; it is classic science-fiction, restoring the franchise to the heights of its glory with quite simply one of the very best films you'll see this year.",

The differences in the attitudes of Caesar (a pacifist) and Koba (a warmonger) reflect those among the humans. Caesar has resisted the base impulse towards violence, even though he was the victim of violence perpetrated by humans. He's the Nelson Mandela to Koba's Pol Pot.While it's not a masterpiece, I still think that this movie is a good allegory. It poses the question: if we band together, is it for a noble cause (embodied by Caesar) or is it for evil (embodied by Koba)?",

The movies nowadays are quite different.It is set in Northern California, San Francisco and surrounding areas like Muir Woods. Although the real Muir Woods looks quite different.Experiments with viruses on apes resulted in mutations and, when the apes of all sorts broke out, a pandemic killed almost all humans over the next several years. We meet them 10 years later and the apes, discussing mostly in captioned sign language, wonder if any humans are left.Well there are, a large colony in a very dilapidated San Francisco. But they are almost out of fuel sources and need to try to reactivate an old dam and its power generating facilities. A group hiking towards the site encounters a couple of apes, shots are fired, tension grows.So the story is about seeing if the apes and the humans can trust each other and cooperate, but mirroring the many movies of the past, where one or two malcontents stir up trouble, the apes have those too. Andy Serkis is Caesar, the leader who as a young ape had been hand raised by humans. He could actually speak as a result of his training and mutations. But he has to quash a rebellion and facilitate cooperation. A couple of big battles with weapons cranks up the excitement.This is an entertaining movie, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to friends. But it is hard to keep from chuckling at times, I mean after all they are apes, and seeing apes behave like humans was a bit too much for me at times.I enjoyed seeing Keri Russell as a doctor, I became a fan of hers in the very old TV series \"Felicity\", and the furor when she cut her hair short.

            "content": "Whenever people accuse me of being an unreasonable hater of summer blockbusters, I immediately refer to my love for 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes\u0085or perhaps it's because that was one of the few smart blockbusters in a while. There was a lack of superficiality and a lot more honesty\u2014about the selfishness of humanity, about the spine-chilling advancement of science and technology, about the rest of the animal kingdom's possible distaste for our kind, etc. Witnessing Caesar's ascent to leadership and pure intelligence, finally afforded the opportunity to oppose the human forces that once caged and abused him, was a major element that boosted the film's quality beyond any expectations. Now, with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the gradual rise and reign of the apes over Earth continues in the highly anticipated sequel. A decade after the events of the first one, Caesar and his followers have found refuge in the forests of San Francisco, trying to maintain peace between their species and the humans. Of course, certain balances of power and damaged relationships complicate matters, deeming this desperate attempt at coexistence utterly hopeless. First of all, the absolute strongest aspect of this blockbuster is its impressive use of technology; that of which helps create amazing performances from both Andy Serkis (portraying the relatively mild- tempered and subtly emotive Ceaser) and Toby Kebbell (portraying the deeply menacing/frightening and cunning Koba). To no surprise, the visuals are outstanding in their realism as to the appearance of the apes\u2014never a dip in the CGI's quality in order to prevent such a premise from becoming a blatant cheese-fest, which it could've easily been (apes on horses with machine guns, for God's sake). The production value\u2014 allowing for a fascinatingly different, alternate Earth\u2014and the design behind Caesar's lair is spectacular, and there's never any doubt that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes succeeds in its technical prowess. On the narrative's front, however, it unfortunately never matches the intrigue and thoughtfulness of its predecessor, which was led by James Franco\u2014a considerably more charismatic presence than any of the human characters here. We also had John Lithgow whose disease-stricken character brought a heartbreaking facet into the mix, again more captivating than any of the characters in the sequel. I mean, Gary Oldman (an otherwise fantastic actor as we all know) is barely given any material to work with in this case; Keri Russell really has nothing to do besides express her concern for her husband, Malcolm (Jason Clarke\u2014 the human lead of the film) who is fairly devoid of personality as well besides the fact that he's really curious about Caesar. In fact, Koba and the primate overlord are truly the only interesting characters in the story as their conflicted friendship resumes. I also found it distracting how kind and forgiving Caesar was depicted in this film as opposed to Rise. The filmmakers seemingly played it safe and shined away from a potentially engrossing human-versus-ape war and instead focused on the ape-versus-ape conflict that's stirred between two troubled sides. Herein, we're presented with a common tale about two political positions in a culture\u2014one is the good guy who wants peace and the other wants to eradicate the race, in question, altogether and solely live with his own kind. How often have we seen that? Well, the audience will be seeing it again, thereby stifling the momentum that Rise carefully and cleverly constructed in which the slow, but eventual, overtaking of the apes was a lot clearer. For the sake of further comparison, the 2011 installment presented a compelling study of scientific advancement and the apes' intellectual and emotional growth in their revolt against the ruling race that is humanity. Here, the apes try to be as benevolent as possible and forgive every wrong human action, as severe as they can be. In all honesty, there are very few complex characters in this follow-up; you're either outlandishly villainous like Koba\u2014or let's look at an over-the- top bully like Carver\u2014or a perfect upstanding citizen like Malcolm. Keep in mind that Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) does not possess enough screen time to dissolve the confusion formed around his exact motivations and true identity\u2014so, very miniscule depth there as well. In terms of the movie's overall structure, the beginning is deliberately paced, introducing us to the environment that the regnant apes have erected for themselves and showcasing the interactions between our primary apes. After a tense development of the two species' relationship, we're propelled into a war film that carries a familiar friend-gone-rogue plot (closely resembling Shakespeare's revered tale, Julius Caesar, and thus entering somewhat heavy-handed territory) that unravels quite predictably and, of course, leads to an ultimate showdown between the clear good and evil: Caesar pitted against Koba. Admittedly, plenty of epically staged battle sequences and dramatic clashes await, and I certainly enjoyed the intense segments on the surface. But when you observe the film from a narrative perspective, it's utterly lacking in the surprise and creative energy that astonishingly unleashed into cinemas three years ago.Side note: let's also note that particularly misleading poster which shows Caesar on a horse, aggressively taunting with his assault rifle, implying that he's fully prepared for war, which as we all know turned out to be the total opposite in the actual film.",

I heard that one of the biggest criticisms of the 1995 film based on the Michael Crichton novel, \"Congo\", was that they hadn't yet perfected CGI'd realistic looking fur yet, so again had to resort to guys in monkey suits. But with the recent couple films in the reboot series, they plainly have perfected the fur, but at the same time, I don't think the apes themselves look completely realistic. No matter- these last couple films- this movie, and 2011's \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\", I think are the best in the series so far. \"Dawn of the POTA\" picks up so many years after \"Rise\", after human civilization has almost been wiped out completely due to a Simian flu, and what few remaining humans are left attempt to restart a power plant near where our hero of the last movie, \"Caesar\", and his band of apes are taking up space. I think that even though the CGI hasn't yet perfected completely realistic looking apes/animals, we still get a good glimpse of the emotions from the creatures- THAT's where these recent couple movies have excelled. No James Franco this time, but we do see remnants of him in Caesar's memories- quite touching actually.

The Simean Flu has spread and wiped out the majority of mankind while a small but formidable band of apes has benefited from the genesis of this virus. A group of people are trying their best to hold on to what little bit of civilization they have left and doing that requires electricity. Accessing that electricity is the tricky part because it is in the heart of ape controlled territory. This is where my brother and I part ways.He identifies with the apes whereas I identify with the people. He sees the apes in a more human sense having a sovereign right to the land they occupy. He uses for his argument people of the past that have been intruded upon and had their land and rights taken because they didn't have the weapons, tech, or manpower to protect themselves.I, on the other hand, identify with the humans and see the apes as apes that happen to be more intelligent than normal. My argument: those apes can step aside so that humanity can survive. No, I'm not saying eradicate them, but I'm saying that if it comes down to human survival and ape survival I'm not having a second thought about the matter. Just because they can grunt out a few words doesn't mean that we sit down and negotiate. We need access to that area and you're in the way.I know I'm phrasing it in a very crude and blunt manner but essentially my point is that survival is paramount. People and animals alike will do some very extreme and not-so-civil things to survive; especially if they're on the brink of extinction. The very fact we were debating this issue so vehemently makes this a good movie. The 1968 Planet of the Apes was also rich with symbolism and a socially relevant message. Was it symbolism in this movie? Was it awaking a social awareness? I can't say. Perhaps it was for some and perhaps it was mere entertainment for others. Whatever view you have I still think the movie was done well and was a good prequel to the original.",

            "content": "I saw \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\", starring Andy Serkis-Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies, King Kong in King Kong_2005; Jason Clarke- White House Down, Zero Dark Thirty; Keri Russell-The Americans_t.v., Mission:Impossible 3 and Gary Oldman-Robocop_2014, Dracula_1992. This is a sequel to a reboot. It's a sequel to the Rise of the Planet of the Apes_2011, which is a reboot of the Planet of the Apes films that started in 1968-I think there were about 5 or 6 of them but I lost count. Anyway, this one takes place about a decade after Rise, with Andy using motion capture to portray Caesar, who is the ape in charge of a group of apes living in the woods outside of San Francisco. A deadly simian virus has just about wiped out all humans; with small groups that were immune to the virus-for some reason or another-gathering in powerless cities, such as San Francisco. Gary is in charge of that group of humans and Jason and Keri are a married couple that are scientists that are trying to find a cure for the virus. There is a dam that Jason wants to get up and running so that they can get back to being civilized, but wouldn't you know it? The dam is smack dab in the middle of ape occupied woods. There are humans that hate the apes as well as apes that hate the humans, which begs the question, 'Are apes really that much different from humans and can't we all just get along?' There is a video showing James Franco from the Rise, with a young Caesar, but there is no new footage of James. The motion capture is really well done throughout the whole movie and when the movie ends, you have no doubt that there will be another sequel. It's rated \"PG-13\" for the violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",

            "content": "I went to watch this film with very high expectations. There was so much acclaim in all these initial reviews that have come out. Everyone extols it as THE best film of this summer. My sons and I went to watch it even if the only screening we can watch at that time was in more expensive 3D. This 3D turned out to be unnecessary, but this film is deserving of all its advanced praise.The story of \"Dawn\" picks up ten years after the events of the first film \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\" Simian flu we saw developed and spread in the first film has now all but decimated most of the human population. In the forests, the mutant apes have established their own system, led by the alpha male ape Caesar.When a group of survivors enter the forest in order to reactivate an old dam for their energy needs, they meet the apes' wrath. There arose a battle of loyalty, trust and betrayal in both the human and the ape organizations, escalating into a deadly battle royale in the streets of San Francisco.For a summer blockbuster rich in computer-generated visual effects, \"Dawn\" is actually a very serious film. The first two acts had more words (many of them written in subtitles) than action, and may make some of the younger viewers impatient. The final act is an action spectacle that will undoubtedly be long remembered with its graphic yet poetic images of warfare. This sequel is really more about the apes than the humans. The humans were delimited to playing one-dimensional characters with hardly any back story. The lead human character Malcolm, who was assigned to lead the dam repairs, was played by Jason Clarke. He went on his mission with his doctor girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The leader of the human settlement is Dreyfus, played by Gary Oldman. You will hate him for what he is saying, but upon reflection, that is typical human behavior that he represents.But the apes were a different matter. They were all so well-delineated. Each face was different and all so expressive. The actors behind each ape deserve special mention for managing to evoke emotion from beneath make-up and motion capture technology. Tony Kebbel as the tortured Koba, Karin Konoval (a female) as the intellectual orangutan Maurice, and Nick Thurston as Caesar's impetuous eldest son Blue Eyes. Above all, there is the amazing Andy Serkis as Caesar, the quintessential leader of the apes. This is indeed an award-deserving performance.That is not to say that this film was absolutely perfect. There were some aspects which puzzled me. There seems to be so much more being written in the subtitles than what the apes were signing or gesturing on screen. I know that that scene where Caesar was back in the house of his old friend and trainer Will (James Franco) was nice and sentimental. But it strains logic that a long-abandoned video camera would still have two bars in its battery life. In the bigger scheme of things though, these are minor quibbles.You should go into this film NOT as you would go into a typical summer blockbuster film. You should prepare your frame of mind before you watch this. This film is not fun, entertaining, nor uplifting. Instead this is dark, thought-provoking and disturbing. There is no denying though that this film is a technological triumph in the area of visual effects, sound effects, film editing, musical scoring, cinematography and its effective direction under Matt Reeves.",

            "content": "Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the year and is definitely superior to the previous movie. Rise of The Planet of The Apes, while a good movie, did come off as a bit too simplistic, contrived, and black and white. It also felt a little to derivative. I felt like I have been here before. The CG, while good overall, looked a bit off at times. Fortunately Dawn has none of these things. With this film, it is clear, they have learned from their mistakes.This film takes place at least a decade after the previous film. The majority of humanity has been wiped out by the virus set-up in Rise. There some survivors. The ones we focus on is a small colony in San Francisco. We also follow Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his colony of apes as we see how they have thrived since the previous movie and have formed society of their own. Soon the two groups meet and the tension begins to rise. Now Caesar and the main human, Malcolm (Jason Clarke), and his family try to avoid all-out war.This film is near perfect, if not perfect. The cinematography is amazing. This is a beautiful looking film. The CGI is flawless, and is much better than in Rise. I also love the action scenes. The only action scene in Rise is at the end on the bridge. Here there is much more action and it's done beautifully. I also like how this film doesn't take any lines or story elements from the original franchise like Rise did, and stood as its own piece.The characters are good too. I like the main human characters. They weren't especially interesting, but I didn't dislike any of them either. Caesar and the apes are definitely what make this film. I especially love Caesar's rivalry with another ape named Koba. I also like Caesar's relationship with his son and how that is resolved.I also enjoyed the story this time around. I like how Caesar and Malcom are constantly trying to maintain peace while there others in both camps who want war and will what it takes to start it. I also like how the film doesn't really take a side here. In Rise it is clear you are supposed to side with the apes and that the humans are bad. Every human in that film besides James Franco's character is portrayed as narrow-minded, ignorant, bullies, or just stereo-typically evil. This film could have easily gone that route, but, thankfully, they didn't. Here there is a balance. There are bad humans but there are also bad apes who want to exterminate humans. I like how this film not so black and white says that the apes can be just as bad as the humans instead of just siding with either the humans or the apes.Overall, if you are a fan of Planet of The Apes, want to see a good summer movie, or just want to see a good film in the theater than this is a must see. I recommend watching Rise of The Planet of The Apes first if you haven't. Even if you do not like that film I still say to give this a watch.",

It's predecessor 'rise' was an excellent film but this edges it in pretty much every department, it's visually the best of the three 'Apes' films, has the best score and storyline, which is just chock full of dilemmas and character development. The film takes the time to show you background to all the major players - ape and human, and the film is all the better for it. The cinematography is superb and the film just has this dark foreboding mood throughout - it's just excellent and I simply cannot fault it.

Survivors in the ruins of San Francisco want electricity and send the main character and an entourage to restart a hydroelectric dam where Caesar has built his ape village. A turf war ensues, apes abscond with machine guns, an ape coupe happens, and there's a big fight between humans and apes in San Francisco.This film has some nice effects happening with the apes. The plot is pretty basic and the acting is nothing super-duper. The driving force for the dam expedition is a little weak: just that the San Francisco residents are low on fuel and need electricity. But what happens if there's no electricity? They'll light candles and be grumpy? That bit of plot could have used a stronger motivator with more serious consequences.Gary Oldman pops in and out, and I wish he had more screen time. The tropes are easy to see coming, so there are not many surprises in the scenes. Dialog is mostly okay, but sometimes bland.The ape assault with machine guns is pretty crazy. The apes also seem right at home firing automatic weapons, but I never saw one of them reload and I'm pretty sure they didn't have extra clips. I suppose we'll chalk up the number of bullets fired to movie magic.Verdict: A little better than average, but the story line is not incredibly strong. The fight scenes are pretty good once the conflict gets rolling. Overall, the film is worth seeing.",

After the outbreak of simian flu, the majority of the human race has been wiped out, and only a handful of immune humans are left to fend for themselves.After an encounter with a group of humans looking for ways to generate power, and after an incident which involved human shooting an ape, Caesar eventually allows the humans to get access in order to help them.But Koba, an ape who is bitter about being tested on so severely, thinks Caesar has a weakness for humans, and stabs Caesar in the back, trying to take back the titular planet.A sequel was inevitable, ROTPOTA was a phenomenal achievement, both story wise and technically.The sequel carries on the narrative from the very last shot of ROTPOTA, and this is a very clever turn from the writers, as it gives the apes the upper hand from the beginning.One cannot deny the monumental effort WETA has done on the ape effects, they are brilliant and as groundbreaking as Bullet Time.Serkis is once again king of the Mo Cap, and breathes life into Caesar, making him sympathetic and full of empathy, but at the same time very volatile and unpredictable.Kebbel though, almost steals the film as Koba, this is the fear factor of the film, and there is one scene, where he is toying with two humans, that is almost unbearable, because you just know something bad is going to happen.And this is the weak part of the film, the human element. Apart from Malcom, the humans are your stereotypical characters, and Russell is wasted as Ellie, just when you thought her character was going to be fleshed out a little more, she literally disappears.And then there is Oldman. And while the guy is a fine actor,there was no real need for his character to be in the film. I know it's supposed to balance with Koba, but his character is literally in it for no more than fifteen minutes, and doesn't really do much.Other than that, its a solid, intelligent movie, that proves that big summer movies can be entertaining, as well as a solid script, and clever narrative.Transformers: Age Of Exhaustion, take note......",

There is another human force coming but not arriving before the end of the movie. That appears to be the set up. The Ceasar character from Escape From The Planet of the Apes is still going at the end of this one. The special effects here and Ape CGI costumes are amazing.The battle sequence at the end is a reminder of a milder form of District 9.The human costumes are quite realistic though the humans do not get much to do in this one other than killed or be killed. There is a c-4 bomb sequence that is like the bomb sequence at the end of Beneath The Planet of The Apes. That one destroyed the whole planet but now that the film has moved to the Pacific Coast, the destruction at the end is more laid back, but these apes mean business. With the openings here I could see several directions this could go.In the documentary about the original series, FOX being broke, had to make the apes in the first movies into a primitive society. Rod Serling's original script treatment would have those Apes with a more Scientifically advanced society. With today's CGI, I think someone should go back and dig out Serling's original Idea and make it into the next film. Where to go with the next one depends.

At first it seems to work pretty well, taking up basically at exactly the point the previous movie left off (albeit ten years later) with the apes living in the forest outside San Francisco. They've progressed nicely, have built a nice home for themselves, and have learned sign language (which does seem more realistic than having them speaking fluent English would have been - although Caesar and his rival Koba do have some linguistic abilities.) Caesar is in charge of the ape society and everything seems more or less good with them. Not going so well, though, is human life. The simian virus has killed millions and there are a few stragglers left in the city, who are running short of power after all this time, and decide that they could make use of a dam to power their homes. Unfortunately, the dam in right in the middle of ape territory - and the apes are none too happy about having humans around.This is a movie about confrontations. Most obvious is the confrontation between the apes and the humans. Neither like or trust the other. Humans still see the intelligent apes as just plain animals, while many apes remember and resent their treatment at the hands of humans. Obviously, the human move into ape territory is going to lead to conflict, and that conflict takes up a good part of the movie. But there's also the confrontation between Caesar and Koba - another ape who thinks that Caesar is far too kind and sympathetic to humans - and a battle emerges between the two of them for the leadership of the ape community. As it turns out, intelligent apes are pretty much like humans. They want their own way, and eventually power and brute force determines which one gets their way. Those things make this a pretty dark movie when compared to the original.Somehow, this movie didn't really grab me. I have to admit that I even fell asleep for about 10 or 15 minutes and wasn't interested enough to go back to see what I missed, although after I woke up I did manage to stick it out to the end. I liked the original reboot. I found it very thoughtful and thought-provoking. But aside from the Caesar-Koba battle and the reflection on power and corruption, this movie lacked some of that thoughtfulness. In many ways, this became a war movie more than anything, with apes attacking the human city. The human characters are all completely new. There are no holdovers from the original movie. I did miss James Franco from that first installment. In this, Jason Clarke plays the main human character, but Malcolm didn't connect with me the way Franco's Will did. In fact, none of the human characters really seemed well enough developed to mean anything to a viewer. And - as I said about the first movie - somehow the CGI apes don't really connect with me either.I didn't expect this to be as good as \"Rise\" - and it wasn't. It was too much of a war movie filled with battles. (4/10)",

Talking about positives I'll start with what everyone is raving about: Andy Serkis, and to an extent all of the motion capture acting. What can I possibly say that hasn't been already said by everybody? I mean this review could be only about praising Serkis' talent. He is the key to the success of the whole movie because through his touching, brilliant performance he builds the film's emotional core that is essential for the story to resonate. Scene after scene you simply can't take the eyes off him, you can feel his presence instantly and to this for sure contribute some of the best special effects the industry is able to produce nowadays. The apes simply look like they are there flesh-and-bone and there isn't even one shot I can think about that had bad or unfinished CGI. The rest of the cast is perfectly decent, the only that truly sticks out other than Serkis is clearly Toby Kebbel. Cinematography is utterly brilliant and the choice of shots is stunning: there are some uninterrupted shots that where truly breathtaking and contributed to the creation of suspense spectacularly. Giaccino too is in prime form and delivers a very engrossing score. Matt Reeves really knew what he was doing because, other than there being a great screenplay, the storytelling, the drama, the character coherence, everything flows in a natural and spontaneous way that honestly surprised me on how actually good it was. This movie has probably the best storytelling I have experienced this year. This is probably why there were three or four minor story moments that didn't fit 100% to me. In an average blockbuster I probably wouldn't have even thought of them, but here everything was running so amazingly smoothly that they really stuck even though they weren't actually so problematic. The action scenes were brilliant too because they were so key to the storytelling they never would force themselves in and because of that felt all the more riveting. I think that I was genuinely on the edge of my seat for a full hour. The pace of the movie was nearly perfect, I do think that if they had cut or edited in a different way just a couple of scenes they could have achieved pace perfection. Other than that I had a kind of problem for the first twenty minutes in get fully involved in some of the characters, I was never bored but it would felt emotionally uneven for a couple of scenes, yet it picked up almost immediately. On a minor note I did hear three or four clich\u00e9d lines here an there and again this speaks to the quality of the movie because they stuck out since everything around them was excellent. I am not yet sure if this movie deserves a 9 or not I guess time will tell. Anyways I loved this one a lot, it is in every way better than its predecessor, which was pretty dam good itself, and it is definitely one of the best movies I have seen this year so far.",

The story on the other hand is passable but just didn't really grabbed my attention and emotion as the first one. With the development of the story being all super slow-paced and all. The beginning started off strong, than the story started to go in a pretty clich\u00e9 direction. However seeing how the first one ended, this is probably the only way the story could have gone. It has the right elements to make it a good movie, but I personally didn't find it all that great with the praise it's been getting. As the movie progressed it just started to get duller and duller. I was tired while watching this film, but I rarely fall asleep during a fresh movie. I however fell asleep during this one. It's a alright watch, but far from being standout movie compared to the first one.6.8/10",

            "review_title": "Does Dawn Surpass Rise?",
            "content": "Dawn, the anticipated sequel to Rise, has finally been released, but how does it measure up to it's predecessor. Simple answer is its just as good, and in some ways better. As far as sequels go, Dawn is about as good as they come, and like any sequel should, it builds upon what was laid out in the previous installment. Ten years have passed since Caesar, and his band of genetically enhanced apes, fought their way across the Golden Gate Bridge, and over time the apes have built their own primitive, yet strong society. The humans however are quite desperate, and do whatever they can to keep electrical power running, amongst the remaining survivors. As luck would have it, the humans must cross into the apes territory in order to keep the power going.The basic theme of this movie is about survival, and neither the apes, nor humans wan't to be the weaker group. The story on the surface is pretty simplistic, much like it was with Rise, but like Rise, the true strength of Dawn is in it's ape stars. Caesar once again portrayed by the brilliant Andy Serkis, is the heart of the film, and it's about his struggle to remain in control of his ape society. Koba portrayed by Toby Kebbell, is gruff, deadly, and at times quite tragic. Koba was introduced in Rise, but in Dawn, he's a fully realized character that steals every scene he's in. Caesar want's peace, but for Koba, peace is not an option, because humans cannot be trusted, as he points out, literally on himself, the \"true\" nature of humans. It's a issue that Caesar, and Koba could never see eye to eye on, and as a result begins to sever the bond between the two. Koba hates humans, because of how he was treated, and once he gains control he becomes everything he hated about the humans, with no compassion, or remorse, even killing apes who oppose him. When its comes to characters, Caesar and Koba, are without doubt the most compelling to watch, where as the other characters, are less interesting. In Rise the ape characters out shined the human ones, and with Dawn the outcome is no different. That said, the human characters are written well enough that they're serviceable to the story. The relationship between the apes, and humans creates interesting moments. How different, aside form appearance, are we really. It's a question that humans seem to struggle with throughout history. There's good, and bad, in every society, and people always feel threatened by something they don't understand. In Dawn there's apes, and humans on both sides, some are hostile, where as others wan't peace. That is the very nature of people, and since these apes are as smart as humans, they're also capable of being as arrogant. Its social commentary like this, that sprinkled throughout the film, that keeps things interesting.So what does Dawn do better than Rise, the world and scope is far more epic, and the effects are visually stunning, as are the performances, both human characters, and to a greater extent the apes. The weaknesses are similar to the flaws in Rise, narrative issues such as logic/plot holes, and a rushed, yet satisfying third act. Personally I felt Rise was more intimate, and emotional, whereas Dawn is more spectacle, though still emotional. All things considered, this is strong sequel to a good franchise, and does what any sequel should do, leave it's audience wanting more. 8.5/10",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an example of how rich Sci-Fi movies have come to be. Dawn takes place a decade after the events of Rise, the simian plague has reached through out the world and we come to see the situation of the remaining humans. Apes, however, are home to their forest wherein Caesar (played by Andy Serkis) is the leader. Earth is a frightening apocalyptic world for the humans, we are then introduced to Dreyfus (played by Gary Oldman) and his group of survivors as they are struggling especially when an accident occurs that may lead to a war between the Apes.Dawn is a definitive sequel and gladly takes you to the edge of your seat in it's 2 hour run time. The writing and pacing is great, unexpected sequences are handled well. There are moments where scenes feel calm, but in a matter of seconds these are changed with startling outcomes. The movie depicts realism. It gives emotional and sometimes heart-breaking scenes, both in the human and ape side.The CGI was unnoticeable. Not in a bad way, but rather in a good way. CGI was remarkably executed in the film. There were moments where I forgot it was just a bunch of CGI apes everywhere instead, I thought they were real live apes. I have a feeling Godzilla won't win the Best Visual Effects Oscar next year, Apes might just bring it home. The CGI wasn't the only thing that made the Apes great. This film did what Transformers films failed to do with their auto bots. The Apes had depth and character, they had feelings and they also felt very human, I actually cared and sympathized for Caesar and his apes, unlike the feeling I get towards the auto bots in Bay's Transformers films.The non-human characters were the stand outs of this film, especially Caesar. He has evolved and become a leader who will do anything for the freedom and peace of the apes. Malcolm (played by Jason Clarke) and his wife Ellie (played by Keri Russell) gave quite good performances, same goes with Gary Oldman. But they were shadowed by Andy Serkis' remarkable and unforgettable performance as Caesar. The fact that he hasn't won an Oscar, is unbelievable, he stole every moment in the movie whenever he is on screen. Koba (played by Toby Kebbell) was also remarkable, a very unforgettable antagonist, he reminded me of The Winter Soldier in Captain America although Koba was more menacing than ever. The action sequences were not the typical ones you see in modern blockbusters to date. First of all it was a battle between Apes and Humans, how the apes were handled in the action are rather different and it comes to a point where it feels realistic. The cinematography fits well to the action as well. I could barely remember a scene which was difficult to watch. The music fits perfectly in the movie, whenever action or suspense kicks in the musical score swells in beautifully.However, the movie still has it's flaw. The movie starts quite slowly, and there are quite boring scenes. Those were only in the first act, therefore it is a build up for the Second Act and Third Act which were the outstanding parts in the movie.Dawn is a step for the Sci-Fi movie genre. It's realism and symbolism to the real world is well received. So far this is the best movie of the great consecutive blockbusters of 2014. It sets the standards for sequels of movies, and how sequels or remakes can have so much potential. I am indeed very excited to see the next sequel and how this may tie up to the Planet of the Apes film. With it's top notch visuals. Scenes that bring you to the edge of your seat. Amazing acting which brought life to the apes. Breath taking sequences that will be sure to startle you. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes delivers an intelligent and well rounded blockbuster that I would recommend anyone to watch.",

Can these voices prevail though in the midst of an overwhelming desire for full blown clash?Whilst the built up to the main story was almost instantaneous, it proved effective in creating an atmosphere of tension that remained throughout the film. At almost any moment the audience thinks that mayhem is about to ensue. We follow the voices of peace in an uphill struggle to maintain the fragile peace where you cannot be sure who is the ally or the adversary.There is also a moral element to this film: as a leader it is sometimes preferable to compromise for the sake of the common good, even if your inner circle does not share that.Good ambiance, effective action and a tension prevailing throughout makes for a rather edgy two hours on the big screen.",

The sequels only got crazier (and worse), and once time travel got involved, you knew that it had to stop. Then in 2011, the series got a much-needed fresh start with Rise. And now the sequel is finally here, and it is quite possibly the best film in the entire eight-film series. During the credits of Rise, there was a little sequence involving the implied spread of a virus known as the simian flu. By Dawn, that virus has all but destroyed the world, reducing the human population to around a tenth of what it once was. In San Francisco, the human colony there is running out of power, and asks the apes to allow access to the nearby dam, thus allowing the two sides to live separately, but peacefully. Of course, it's never that easy. Due to a string of events which I will not spoil here, the good acting, phenomenal visual effects, precise direction, and almost-Shakespearean script come together in a smart, visceral blockbuster that will surely be remembered as one of 2014's best films.",

It is however the confirmed sequel to 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' \u2013 the movie that officially buried all memories of Tim Burton's misfire remake of the first Planet of the Apes film.The movie kicks off about ten years after 'simian flu' has all but wiped out the human race, leaving the animal population pretty much untouched \u2013 especially the primates. Now, our super-intelligent chimp from the first film, Caesar, is in charge of the local ape population just outside what remains of San Francisco. Him and his clan are living peacefully enough (under the mantra 'ape shall not kill ape') when they accidentally bump into a patrol of humans, scouting out the area with the view to repairing the local dam in order to restore power to the city. Let's just say that the two species never really see eye to eye.Despite the best efforts from Caesar and his human counterpart, Malcolm, (played by Jason Clarke) neither the apes and humans who they associate with want to get along. What follows is the gradual build-up from simple tension to outright hostilities between the two camps.If you have haven't seen the previous film (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) I would definitely recommend watching that first. Granted, you will probably understand much of the sequel as a 'stand-alone' movie, it's best to watch them in order. That was you can chart the rise of the franchise's 'true star' \u2013 the computer-generated ape himself, Caesar. He's obviously created digitally, but performer Andy Serkis deserved much of the credit for bringing him to life. Never has a CGI character been so lifelike and easy to root for. In many cases, he even eclipses the 'proper' human actors. And, just for a bonus, you have Gary Oldman in there, who, as usual, turns in an excellent performance.It's not often that a blatant sci-fi movie can appeal to more than just 'the guys,' but I think this new franchises of 'apes' movies can be appreciated by quite a wide range of people. If you're looking for a sci-fi movie with heart, then you could do worse than the two 'apes' films. Of course it's not perfect, I did feel it dragged a little prior to the ending \u2013 the total runtime is about two hours and I think they could have shaved about quarter of an hour off that. But, apart from that, I enjoyed it. Looking forward to the next instalment. No way the film-makers would let the franchise die now!",

This film is more so less different than the original, which Dawn is all about the apes. Caesar, Koba and Maurice (Karin Konoval) are just wonderful characters and are in many ways are lot more nuanced than their generally clich\u00e9d human counterparts. The scenes with Caesar and his family: wife Cornelia (Judy Greer), son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and their newly born son are genuinely moving and the way the apes have developed their language skills from the last film, completely convincing. The film is called Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to put it in its place, one would know where the story is heading but what a wonderful world to lose yourself in for two hours, however as the film goes towards the end, one is less interested in the overall tone of the film. The apes were far from interesting as we have seen it before.I have read somewhere that this film felt as a documentary and I agree completely with that comment. The notion of this as a documentary feel is what separates this to the original, and which is why I felt the original Rise of the Planet of the Apes was more enjoyable, fun and overall entertaining. Dawn isn't a bad film, but the overwhelming hype it has taken has reduced its value for me. Overall the film does have good acting and directing, great visuals, but the story is lacking and the tone of the film isn't too entertaining as a watch.- - - - - -As a rewatch 11/03/21' this film is a lot better on another viewing with paying closer attention to detail. It is more detail and longer in runtime than its previous film Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), and the tone is noticeably more serious. Dawn is more focused on the apes but we see character development and get a better sense of the characters. Jason Clarke as the lead is quite dull and bland, as are the other human characters bit more focus is on the apes. The story had a rather slow build but once the action comes into place, it becomes highly entertaining. Prefer Rise to Dawn but this film is still very good. Rating changed from 4 to 7.",

            "content": "The second movie in the rebooted 'The Planet of the Ape' series and the eighth movie in the franchise. After the excellent 2001 movie, it took a decade for a sequel. Long wait really looked worth and that success led to another quick sequel. I saw the night show before it makes debut in the next day. The crowd was in average number, but I did not bother for that and prepared to enjoy the show. Yes, I had a good time, but not a hundred percent satisfied. So I am going to tell what I liked and not.This story commence after 10 years from the previous movie 'Rise'. It is now post apocalypse and no one rules the world. The apes are living in a group peacefully in the wild. One day they encounter half a dozen of human survivors who are working out to put back the human dominance. The humans and apes do not want a war, but some people inside thirst for it because of the past suffers. Like the tagline, it is one last chance for peace. Does it work or not is what the movie tries to disclose.Have you seen the DisneyNature's 'Project Nim'? It is like what if something terrible happened to that project and Nim becomes a leader to his kind. Here it was Caeser who leads his race towards a fresh and civilized life. A leader must listen his followers and act according to the circumstances. In this story it reveals apes are not far behind in term of vengeance, betrayal and not believing in cooperation to build a better tomorrow together. It is all about the two different race wanted to dominate. This movie leaves a little clue before it conclude that next movie could be 'War of the Planet of the Apes'. I am already saying that will be a massive hit if it offers more action and especially to watch in digital 3D would be a treat for sure. Praying for it to hit the screen within the next two years of time.One thing I don't understand is that so far three movies were made in this series, but every time when the sequels are made the story leaps too much forward. Don't get confused, what I am saying was between these three movies the story won't follow exactly where the before one ended. It commences very much ahead where we have to wonder what might have happened in between the gaps. Yeah, they explain those in a commentary mode in the opening, but I always felt that was not enough. Though, few things make sense, like, somewhere somewhat it reveals the connection between them all.''It's just not about power! It's about giving us the hope to rebuild. To reclaim the world we lost.''Last time, I thought the characters from the first movie going to meet and it did not happen. So in this movie as well thought all of them come together and again the answer was no. Like I earlier said it leaps a long way without proper explanation. Every time new set of actors hops in like a reboot movie. It is not bad, but the story was just okay in this sequel, I mean not a genuinely written screenplay so I think that is why the popular names were missing in the cast. That is, they rejected the offer, I guess. When the press asked about that to the producer in an interview, he said the previous characters are all dead and the story moved on. But the real question is are you convinced by that? If you remember the first movie well like how it ended, somewhere Mark Wahlberg is going to come back in a future installment. That is what I have been expecting all the time.You know, this installment was largely ruled by animated ape characters. I can't say it was perfect, but almost. Those animated characters were in large numbers, I know the hard work behind, but still not convinced completely. Sometimes it looked made up of rubber and plastic than an organic body. World cinema is yet to give the best in that field. The master of motion capture performer, Andy Serkis had been brilliant like always. When there is a demand for character like this, he will be found in the front row. His skills really made those characters to display in a best way possible. So he was one of the highlights in the movie.When it came to the digital 3D, it was below par. Reason might be, it was a more dramatized story than filled with lots of actions and thrillers. Except in a couple of portion, the opening and the end scenes. In my experience this movie is not worth watching it in digital 3D. Since it was made as one you shall not say no to it because that is the future of the cinema and you should take part in the road it travelling.This movie was just good, not an awesome one like critics praising. The critics had a reason to do that, because they want 'Age of Extinction' fall behind so they are lifting this movie. For me, This movie was so simple, definitely not for who is looking for high octane stunt sequences and the story with twists. Entertainment is there and had great surround effects. I loved the first movie, the 2001 version and then the follow-up looked kind of afresh. So my rating kept falling movie after a movie in this series. Not in a large margin, but only by the fractions. Overall, one of the good movie that came in this mansoon.",

            "content": "I have to say, I'm a big fan of Planet of the apes movies. Since watching the first one when I was a kid, the images have been carved in my mind, especially one with statue of liberty, which I find to be one of the most astonishing scenes in history of movies.The Rise of the planet of the apes was really good so I had high expectations for Dawn as well.But my feelings are mixed, after I watched it for second time. The part of the movie where we see development of the apes civilization is incredibly well done, the feel, the look and the acting is superb, especially when it comes to tense situations between Cesar and Kobe.A close encounters between humans and apes are also very well done, extremely realistic, if we could say that for a movie with talking apes.There are two main drawbacks in this movie, and first one is the plot. I find it quite strange that humans found themselves incapable of producing electricity and their only hope was to reactivate the dam. I'm sure that in those days they had solar power and dozens of other energy sources which they could scrape together by visiting whatever is left in shops or factories. Their main goal was to be able to turn on a radio so they can communicate with other survivors across the globe. I'm pretty sure that one single solar panel could generate that kind of power.The second drawback is the acting on human behalf. The main actor, Jason Clarke, we usually find in a bad guy roles, so I was quite surprised to see him carrying the weight of this movie, and unfortunately that didn't look very convincing. Gary Oldman gave his routine, but without heart and soul, something similar what he did in Robocop movie, a lot of shouting and panicking, for the sole purpose of creating dramatic trailers which will draw audience to the theaters.The other supporting roles, including wife and son, just blended in this overall acting mediocrity. But still, I think this is a great movie, mainly pulled by Andy Serkis and rest of the apes gang, bringing a lot of thrill so you end up really caring for them, while for humans, well, not that much.The visuals are stunning, CGI is used incredibly well creating a believable cataclysmic atmosphere. My overall mark would be 7 out of 10, but because I really do enjoy these kind of movies, regardless of acting and plot issue, I will go for 8/10.",

            "content": "Very few expected 2011's reboot of a franchise - so clinically killed off by Tim Burton and his failure to grasp the idea of narrative sense - to be any good at all. Yet Rupert Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes was not only excellent as a thrilling action movie, but also carefully laid-out and thoughtful in it's scientific approach to the disease that ultimately led to apes conquering Earth and replacing humans as the planet's alpha species. Such a surprising success naturally leads to sequels, and when a director so acclaimed in his delivery of the first instalment fails to re- sign on, disaster is expected. But the apes have done it again, and not only does Dawn stay faithful to it's predecessor's code of story over cheap thrills, but it surpasses it in quality, gradually evolving into a serious study of war.Ten years after the events of the first film, most of humanity has been wiped out by ALZ-113 virus. The escaped apes from the first movie, namely chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis), bonobo Koba (Toby Kebbell, replacing Christopher Gordon), and orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval), are living peacefully in the woods believing the human race to be extinct. They communicate using sign language, though a few of them have learnt some words, and exist peacefully as a multi-ethical community. Caesar has two sons by Cornelia (Judy Greer) - Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and a newborn - and is the alpha with the facially and emotionally scarred Koba as his second-in- command.Unbeknownst to the apes, a small group of humans still dwell in the city, running out of the power supply that is keeping them alive. Led by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) and Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the pack is living together in a huge building amongst the decaying city outside. A small expedition into the woods leads to trigger-happy member Carver (Oz's Kirk Acevedo) shooting an ape in the head in fear. Caesar and his extended army confront them, but Caesar's sympathetic view of humans leads to him allowing them to return to the city, demanding they leave in human speech. Malcolm is astonished at the ape's intelligence and charisma, and returns with his girlfriend (Keri Russell) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) to treat with him.The cinematography and set design are astonishing, The movie doesn't just give us a plastic apocalyptic world full of CGI-laden establishing shots, but a world that feels real and lived-in. And interacting in this world are some of the greatest special effects in the history of cinema. WETA have outdone themselves here, not only managing to blend motion-capture in an exterior environment seamlessly, but also allowing the actors behind the effects to act. A lot has been written about Serkis's portrayal of Caesar, and it is the actor's best performance to date, but Kebbell too manages to bring emotion and devastation to Koba's face, bringing an astonishing complexity to what could have been a stock antagonist. When the two interact, it feels real. You tend not to gasp at the effects because it simply feels like there aren't any.When the inevitable smack-down ensues, it's after some spellbinding drama. There's no cut-and-dry good and bad guys, just the inevitable roll towards blood-shed. There's blame on both sides in equal measure, and it comments heavily on both species' natural inclination to go to war. They live peacefully apart, but once they discover each other things start to fall apart out of desire, greed and most of all, fear. The action is utterly thrilling, and although it offers such treats as the sight of an ape firing two machine gun's whilst riding a horse, it's mainly because we are so engrossed in the character's stories. Serkis and Kebbell deserve Oscar recognition, but probably won't get it. Tim Burton's ghastly 2001 effort has been near-enough wiped from memory, and this new franchise will surely go from strength to strength.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

The parallel war and peace initiatives make up almost the entire plot. Caesar and Koba fight for supremacy over the simians, Malcolm and Dreyfus try to drive the humans down different paths.What makes this movie a fairly outstanding episode in the saga is the quality of the cinematography and, of course, the CGI. The blend of actors into apes is stunningly well done, giving the creatures pretty well the same individuality as the human characters. The fight scenes are thrilling (I watched the 2D version), and the sets and locations give a wonderful sense of a city (San Francisco) sliding into decay and ruin. There's little likelihood that another movie can replicate the amazing 'reveals' at the end of the two Charlton Heston blockbusters that first introduced us to this topsy-turvy version of our future history, but DAWN, like RISE (the titles would have been better in reverse order), is a worthy addition to the currently popular genre of 'Origins' movies.",

            "content": "I have to say that I was genuinely surprised to find out that this film was not rated 15. Although I knew that Caesar was an Ape of peace from the previous film, it was hard to feel at ease in the first few minutes, as the hoards of various Simian beings all gather with some very aggressive stances and even their general appearance. To say that I found it a little bit terrifying would not be a lie and in the current climate of COVID-19, it bears striking similarities with regards to the human population and the situation that they had faced resulting from the effects of 'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes'.Getting over my cowardly feelings, I kept going because I knew that I would still enjoy the story. Its easy to recognise things from many other films and TV series that I have seen, none of which I can remember right now obviously, but let's just say that it's not an original concept. That isn't really relevant though as it is done very well and at least in a different scenario (I've never seen it done with Apes before).Nobody stands out specifically for their excellent performance, but there are no bad ones either, making it easy to watch.There is a huge irony to the whole \"Monkey See, Monkey Do\" idea and the attempt to be better than humans, but just ending up exactly the same if not worse. There are also a lot of issues regarding education, discrimination and prejudice that are handled well and could also reflect on life on planet Earth as it currently stands.It will be interesting to see the third instalment and find out how they get from California to New York and how Lady Liberty comes to be up to her neck in it? As well as how it all ends, before Charlton or Marky Mark turn up, dependant on your preference. If it is made as well as this film and 'Rise' it will be good.",

            "content": "Right after Rise of the Planet of the Apes one already knew that the story would continue, and that's where Dawn of the Planet of the Apes has come by. And if Rise of the Planet of the Apes only had come by in the same manner that any superhero origin story would have played out by setting up the tone for films yet to come, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes already has found itself more room to create a more distinctive identity. But being as I've never particularly been the hugest fan of the original film franchise, it's nice to see that these new films are able to form an identity of their own for it takes me by surprise how much I enjoy them. These aren't just mindless, disposable blockbusters that only find themselves living within the moment, these films leave behind an impact that calls out for far more - among many reasons I'm glad these new Planet of the Apes movies are around.The ending of Rise of the Planet of the Apes already begged for more questions to be asked in regards to what was only going to be made of mankind's future as the apes have only found themselves growing in spontaneous numbers. The Simian flu has already decimated the human population whereas Caesar and the other enhanced apes are already making a community for themselves, attempting to live at peace away from the humans. Perhaps answers to questions being asked about whether or not the humans and apes will find themselves able to live within peace is only going to leave behind predictable answers, and yet it doesn't make the final product any less riveting for what it is - it also feels rewarding just watching how everything will build up. For as the first chapter had focused on how the apes had found themselves coming to be, this one only had found itself sitting within a broader canvas and thus the fact it calls for more possibilities only makes an exciting product.In contrast to Rupert Wyatt's efforts behind telling the story present in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves coming into the director's chair has only found itself beneficial. For as functional as Rupert Wyatt's efforts may have been in allowing a story to come and set itself in motion, Reeves, best known at the time for Cloverfield and Let Me In, creates a far more distinguishing approach that not only has resulted in a better film than its predecessor, but has also left behind one of the better blockbusters in recent memory. Many of the highlights that we remember perfectly from the predecessor, whether it be Andy Serkis's performance as Caesar or the visual effects (although they are evidently more advanced in here) come back to shine, yet not without the clear calling for more because of the canvas that Reeves has created on the screen.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes finds itself spending far more time with its human characters while allowing the story of the apes to breathe in a life of their own. Because of this, it is easier to get a grasp on its own characters' motivations whether it range from Caesar's attempts to come at peace with the humans or Dreyfus's intention to wipe out their race to preserve humanity. In addition to having far more compelling human characters a cast that ranges from Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, and Jason Clarke, far more compelling antagonist motivations are present that ultimately allow for a greater character study all the way through because Reeves doesn't blindly paint these characters as villains for the sake of moving forward. In Gary Oldman's Dreyfus we still feel a great resentment towards his own actions because of what measures he would take to preserve his own kind, and at the same time within Koba we have actions that make sense from perspective. They aren't \"bad\" by nature, but that's why they've ever managed to leave behind a great impact with their own roles.Yet despite having so much more working efforts than Rise of the Planet of the Apes, somehow it also comes out as more expository. I appreciate how these films don't blindly go about with painting the human race within a single-sided light, but with the obvious political allegory having already been established - one aspect in which I find myself getting more critical of Dawn comes by, it has already painted within a broader and darker canvas because it has found itself free to roam after an origin story had already been set up, but it only comes to repeat a message already having been told, thus in part it finds itself losing a sense of its own identity. Sure, there's far more that I appreciate in the narrative that Matt Reeves has created as opposed to what Rupert Wyatt had presented only as a means of getting something done and over with, but a greater feeling of separation even from its own predecessors would also be much appreciated out of these films.Functioning as a sequel, what Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is servicing comes more than just as one film continuing what its predecessor has already established wonderfully. Even if it may seem more expository, there's still no denying that its freedom has also created what can easily be seen as a more confident and engaging affair altogether. These go beyond exciting action sequences and outstanding visual effects work, because Dawn of the Planet of the Apes also works beautifully in how it approaches its own characters with how they have come to be. In an age where one can dismiss blockbusters as being tiresome and repetitive, what Matt Reeves has presented with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is more than just exciting storytelling, it is fantastic blockbuster filmmaking all around.",

            "content": "Review: Now that I've finally watched this movie, I must admit, it is brilliant but it does take a bit of time to get going. The apes look amazing and there face expressions and mannerisms were excellent but after hearing all of the hype, I was slightly disappointed with the whole pace of the film. I loved what the director done with Caesar's character and the relationships with the various apes and humans was interesting and a joy to watch. I couldn't help but thinking that the movie might have been better if the director would have got some top class actors to work alongside the apes, but thats just my honest opinion. Anyway, the whole humans against apes concept was well put together and I couldn't wait for the Caesar vs. Koba showdown, which didn't disappoint. Its definitely a must watch for all movie goers and I can't wait for the next instalment which has been built up to me a major blockbuster like this one. Great!Round-Up: Jason Clarke, who plays Caesar's human friend, has a unique style of acting which isn't for everyone's taste. He has a distant screen presence which can easily make you forget that he was in a film. He's starred in movies like The Great Gatsby, Lawless and White House Down but I doubt that anyone can remember him in those films. He's also got a role in the new Terminator Genisys movie so he's obviously a actor that's in popular demand at the moment. Personally, I would have cast Gary Oldman as the lead in this film because it could have done with some emotion and depth but judging by the movies takings, it didn't really matter who played the lead. Andy Serkis has become the puppet master when it comes to playing CGI characters. His amazing movements and mannerisms as Gollum and King Kong, really made those movies great and with the new Star Wars and Avengers in the pipeline, there's no turning back for this unique actor.Budget: $170million Worldwide Gross: $709millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama movies about an ape colony fighting against the humans to save there humanity. 7/10",

            "content": "Much of the novel factor of Planet of the Ape franchise is how believably humane the apes can be, it's also a measure bar as comparing the movies of this franchise in order serves as prove of technology advancement. Andy Serkis has perfected a masterful interpretation of the ape-human mime hybrid. It's not an overstatement that the apes fare better and more convincing than the human counterpart.Visual is splendid and aesthetically pleasing. It's not as extravagant as other blockbusters in recent time, but the art direction offers a unique appeal. Different than most grayish dire post-apocalypse setting, the movie turns to a more organic setting, a lustful return-to-nature background while some of civilization remains still stand tattered. Glossy urban areas have now coated with rustic flavor while the apes territory is leaning towards early civilization settlement. One is deteriorating while the other contrastingly and gradually improves.The movie has one of the best uses of motion capture lately. Apes moves with fluid almost humanized motion even though some of the hunchback traits still persist. It's interesting to see such varied range of emotion that can be conveyed by the apes' while most of them only communicate with body language. Action sequences are well done; a couple of scenes are shot in very interesting point of view or continuous shot. It's a little heavier on action than the prequel.However, the humans aren't nearly as intriguing. Jason Clarke as Malcolm, the engineer and leader figure does a decent job, but he's eclipsed by Andy Serkis' Caesar. He's not really an engaging lead role as James Franco was, and it's a bit underwhelming when the movie tries to compare the two together. Gary Oldman as Dreyfus works with what he has. Being a man with practically a thousand faces, he can pull off any role, but here his character is rather unexceptional.The plot is a bit overused though; those who have seen Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas or Avatar will find little surprise. Granted, there's only so much this \"two civilizations\" premise could go and the movie does go for more mature outlook, but a lot of the scenes foreshadow any twist the movie could've had, even more so for those knowledgeable of the franchise. In the end Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does any movie strive to, it immerses the audience and makes them invest in the character's struggle. With the pace it's going the apes are here to stay.",

            "content": "Matt Reeves took the foundation laid in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and he just flat out ran with it, making one of the best looking, most emotionally involving and satisfying, and all around best built film of the franchise. Everything about this film's story deepens and broadens the world and the characters, the visuals back it up intelligently, and the performances even from the secondary rank of characters are all top-notch. This movie is great.In the very first two Planet of the Apes movies there was an overt pessimism and borderline nihilism when it came to humanity and how its current state was going to destroy the future. The franchise largely and intentionally forgot about that, and that always kind of bugged me. And yet, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes actually flies in the face of that thematic base, not presenting humanity as unworthy of its place on top of the world order, but instead it changes the dynamic into a question about the nature of evil and how it can pop up anywhere. Humanity isn't preternaturally evil, and neither are the apes, but it's the presence of evil in both of them that causes the conflict that breaks out.About ten years after the events of the previous film, humanity is a shell of its former self, and Caesar, the talking ape, has moved his tribe into the forests to the north of San Francisco where they are building the beginnings of a new society. They hunt, they sign their thoughts to each other, and they teach their young to read and write in the English language. Their idyllic life gets challenged when, for the first time in two years, humans encroach on their territory. In several ways, the clash of civilizations story that plays out in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes reminds me of Terrence Malick's The New World. Set in a more natural state with an Eden-like idealized society free from outside influence, it's the mere touch and knowledge of the further world that ends up toppling the current order. Things build until neither society can accept the new order fully, and the clash erupts.Well, the humans are moving northward because they are running out of fuel in their sanctuary in the heart of San Francisco. They need to find the hydroelectric dam that fed the northern parts of the state of California, get it back up and running, and redirect the power south. Caesar is smart enough to realize that if he cuts off the humans completely, they're desperate enough to simply come back in force and take what they need, so in order to save the lives of his apes, he allows the work with tight oversight. This does not sit well with Koba, a bonobo who was most cruelly treated by humanity in his previous life as a test subject in scientific labs. The peace that manages to work out between the small group of humans, led by Jason Clarke's Malcolm, and the ape society moves in fits and starts and feels like it could be the cornerstone of something new and good. However, prejudice on both sides keeps it from fully forming. Carver, another human, blames the apes for the disease that wiped out humanity, and his actions of mistrust end up taking the most innocent moments and defiling them.Everything goes wrong, though, when Koba, feeling untrusted by Caesar who seems to love humans more than apes, goes to San Francisco and finds the human's Plan B in the form of weapons testing. There was left a large cache of weapons behind by FEMA, and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman in a small but surprisingly touching role) is having them tested to ensure their usability if Malcolm's mission fails and they need to move in in force. Koba, in a fantastic scene, uses his past as an ape among humans to disarm the two guys testing the weapons and kill them, takes the weapon back, shoots Caesar at the height of the peace between human and ape, and leaves the gun as evidence that humans did the deed.Structurally, it's interesting that the movie is essentially action free until about an hour and a half into the film. There are moments of tension (great tension, by the way) and a very early hunting scene, but outside of that, it's just straight drama. That dramatic work ends up benefiting the movie greatly for when the action does break out and it embraces some visuals that could have felt really schlocky but end up feeling genuine and terrifying. Koba leads the apes in a charge to the tower where the humans have set up their sanctuary, and the apes use horses and the weapons cache to fire upon the tower. I mean, it's images of apes riding horses firing machine guns (sometimes two at a time) in front of walls of fire. You put that at the beginning of a movie or in a story that doesn't have the dramatic support, and it's a cool image but that's it. Because Koba has been so well built and the situation between ape and human so well established, it's an emotional moment of terror as the conflict we knew was possible and never wanted breaks out in full force, demonstrating visually the hatred that had been brewing in Koba the whole film.The resolution of the film is really emotionally satisfying as well. Caesar, spending some days to recover at the hands of Malcolm and his doctor girlfriend Ellie, revisits the home that he and Will shared in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, helping remind him of the gentleness of humanity in the face of the betrayal of his own kind. Recovered enough, Caesar takes some loyal apes into the compound for a faceoff with Koba, and, at the same time, Malcolm has to faceoff against Dreyfus in a similar conflict. The two play really well off of each other because Caesar's becomes a fight on the tallest parts of the tower with Koba, full of dynamic action, while Malcolm's faceoff with Dreyfus is a lowkey affair where Malcolm simply tries to keep Dreyfus from pressing a button. Cutting from one to the other feeds the overall tension, but we don't get overwhelmed by the action playing out. It's an exceptionally well-built final action sequence that way.This is the only movie in the franchise other than Conquest of the Planet of the Apes that really trusts the apes to carry the film. That's not to say that the human characters aren't present, they are, but they rather explicitly act as support to Caesar's story. At the same time, the human side of things are surprisingly touching. It's not that they have their own movies going on at the same time, but Reeves and his writers created enough depth to each of the humans so that they felt real, driven by their own wants and needs, and not just because the plot demanded their subservience. It really is Caesar and Koba, though, who are the stars, representing a conflicting vision of the future that they ultimately cannot bridge. The supporting apes from Maurice, the orangutan, and Blue Eyes, Caesar's eldest son, are as emotionally complex and satisfying as the human supporting characters.The movie looks fantastic with fantastic visual effects from WETA Digital making the apes convincing pretty much every moment they're on screen. The music is really good, even going so far as to evoke the atonal score that Jerry Goldsmith wrote for the original Planet of the Apes. Performances are great throughout, and it's all so very well written. This is an outright great film and proof that Matt Reeves is one of the best big-budget directors working.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is set 10 years after the events that occurred in the first film. This film focuses on a group of human survivors and a colony of apes that have also settled close by. A small group of survivors bump into a couple of apes whilst they are heading towards a dam - they need access to this dam as this is where the main power for the city is located. However, the Apes do not trust the humans and warn them to stay away. Undeterred, group leader Malcolm (Jason Clarke) pays another visit to the apes and asks if they can access the dam in order for them to bring power to the city. The leader of the Apes Caesar agrees, but on the condition that the humans surrender their guns. Initially there is peace between the apes and the humans, but Koba (an ape that was tortured by humans during the previous pandemic) does not trust humans and, against Caesar's orders, begins a war against the humans.Personally, I thought this film was better than Rise simply because it moves much more quickly. I found the first half of Rise to be somewhat slow and ponderous - the second half was fantastic, but I just felt that there was a bit too much filler at the start. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets going immediately; we have the breath-taking opening sequence (the visuals in this film like the first film are simple incredible), the early showdown between the apes and the humans. This sequel hooks you in from the start and the writers never allow you to become bored or to become detracted from the story.The other thing I liked about this sequel is that the writers continue to make you care about all the characters; I liked Caesar in the first film and continue to like him in this film. He's not too submissive, but he's also not completely unreasonable - he's actually a very good leader. Because I liked and cared for Caesar's character it also meant that I cared what happened to him - I was a little bit upset when Koba shot Caesar (although it was predictable that Caesar would be OK). It's thanks to good writing though that we end up caring for the characters. I think the most moving moments in the film were when Caesar was looking at old video footage and old photos from when he was a child (this was when he was laid up after being shot by Koba).The other key character in DOTPOTA is Koba; Koba begins as a somewhat sympathetic character, but unlike many of the other apes he's unable to forgive and forget(which is perhaps understandable given the fact that he was probably treated a lot worse than many of the other apes). He believes that all humans are evil and that killing all humans are key to the survival of the apes. I was actually quite shocked by how evil Koba could be; he even used Caesar's supposed death as an excuse to start a war against the humans even though he was the one that shot Caesar and this is also how he befriends Caesar's son. Koba was a great villain and his disturbing antics certainly made the film entertaining.In summary, DOTPOTA is an excellent sequel that is entertaining, moving, well-acted, visually gorgeous, with a story that is engaging throughout. I thought that the first film was OK, but this sequel is much better.",

            "content": "First let me get this one thing out of the way, the effects are good. However, nothing stands out with this horrendous movie. The human characters have no personalities at all. Malcolm is supposed to be sort of the leader, aside from Gary Oldman who doesn't do anything. Which is another point this film downplays Gary Oldman. Gary is a terrific actor, and to only have him hang around their sorta HQ the entire time and then dabble I don't know five minutes worth of action is a real insult. But meh his character is bad too. It's also weird because he seems like he is going to play a huge role when he first hits the screen, he is active and involved and then poof he is gone for half of the movie. I guess they might have been focusing on the apes, but the message of the film is harmony and balance between humans and apes, so I guess that doesn't also apply to equivalent amounts of character development. The apes were pretty cool though especially Maurice. Caesar was freaking cool, and Kabo was perfect in his role. The ape base was also pretty well done good looking. On top of all of this, there are some serious plot holes that I'm not even going to mention that they are so obvious. I honestly don't get all of the attention this movie is getting. Top 250? Look what American cinema has become,",

            "content": "Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes was one of the 21st century's most pleasant surprises even if it went on a bit. 10 years later, the virus released in the first prequel has wiped out much of humanity and the apes and humans try to avoid a war. We all know it's going to end unhappily, but the tricky thing is to speed towards the inevitable conclusion while still being compelling and entertaining. Do the filmmakers manage this? Yes, and then some. This isn't monkey business; this is a compelling, emotionally involving and viscerally thrilling blockbuster with both brawn and brains. Like it's predecessor, it's too long and it is predictable, although the predictability is pretty much unavoidable. There definitely was space for a bit more stuff, so this feels underfed. Aside from that, the film doesn't take too long to get going. 2 individuals involved have been snubbed: Matt Reeves and Andy Serkis. Matt Reeves is blatantly an awesome director, shown by this and 2010's Let Me In, and the fat that this is only the third directing gig he's got is ludicrous. What's even more ludicrous is Andy Serkis' lack of awards. Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar nomination. Maybe one day he's get the credit he deserves.The rest of the cast are great as well. Gary Oldman doesn't appear that much, but he stands out. As stated earlier, we all know where the film is going, but there are various deviations from expectations. For example, you expect Gary Oldman to be an antagonist who wants to destroy the apes for no reason, but his character's far more well rounded than that. The script, for a blockbuster, has striking amounts of emotional depth and the movie is actually very affecting throughout. Visually, the film is a showcase and virtually every frame brims visual awe and has loads of stunning sequences. A highlight is a long, uninterrupted shot on the top of a tank. Overall, the film is a powerful post apocalyptic thrill ride which feels genuine and honest, yet also provides a white knuckle thrill ride in which you are emotionally invested in the thrills. This may be a controversial thing to say, but I think this is the best of the franchise so far (although I've only seen Planet, Beneath, Rise and Dawn) and just beats the excellent original.9/10",

As I had expected this film was a racial allegory, and we were apparently supposed to be rooting for the apes. Although the filmmakers did at least add some complexity, making some of the apes, as well as the humans, venal and power-hungry. The acting performances of the human characters were adequate but nothing special. As for the apes, you can't really say much with the actors so covered up. The plot sinks through massive holes. For example, weapons in armories are not stored loaded, and people, much less intelligent animals, who are unfamiliar with guns will never figure out how to load them. Cannot recommend this film.",

            "review_title": "Incredible Sequel with All The Right Qualities",
            "content": "It's about the middle of July and usually about this time we get a blockbuster to save us from the bland, and often carbon copy, comedies that fill the theaters. While normally the movie of choice is some big superhero movie like the Dark Knight or Spiderman, this summer lacks justice driven superheroes running around in tights. Instead the middle of July feature has some harrier characters dishing out justice, ones who were inspired years ago when science fiction wasn't all about special effects. I'm talking about Planet of the Apes, and today I review the latest installment in the series by director Matt Reeves. So let's get cracking on this sequel shall we?Three years ago we learned the origins of how the apes began their journey into dominance over the planet Earth, the ending leaving a cliffhanger that opened up a wide array of possibilities for the sequel to follow. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes picks up ten years after the ending of the first film in a world where humans are on the brink of extinction and apes are the fittest for survival. From the very beginning Dawn opens up with a dark and somber mood, the mere opening hunt a precipice for the intensity that is to follow. Within minutes we are introduced into setting, and immersed into the drama at hand, foregoing drawn out explanations and tired dialog intense scenes and getting right to the situation at hand. Through the use of imaginative design, cinematography magic, and some simple, though effective, dialog the story pans out and keeps the plot going. Over the course of the entire movie, the savage wilderness the world has become keeps one on their toes, wondering what event will offset the perilous balance the world is currently in. While most of it is predictable, from some very obvious character designs, I was engrossed in the movie, happy to see Reeves pushing my suspicions to the limit and keeping my adrenaline pumping with action that fit the timing and lasted an appropriate amount of time. These heated moments would then disperse and often open up characters to conveniently timed interventions that allowed for more details to enfold. For this reviewer, this is the art of storytelling, building components such as action and CGI around a story instead of the other way around. Speaking of CGI, let's talk about the special effects of this movie. Once again the design team has created beautiful effects in the tarnished planet of Earth. The chimps in particular are gorgeous in design, with hair, skin, and scars mixed together to give the main apes differentiating qualities to help tell them apart. Their movement is fluid, the apes lumbering, swinging, and acting in a manner equivalent to their real life counterparts adding more to the realism at hand. Andy Serkis' talents continued to impress me in this film, as he brought the humanity to Caesar in many forms from facial expressions to the awkward hybrid gait he sports. Of course what impressed me the most were the battle scenes, where the fast pace, and explosive action are true tests to the animation at hand. Dawn passes with flying colors, the animation remaining fluid, as the camera captures the hectic warzone between man and ape. Best of all you actually get to see the action, as opposed to other movies where the camera can't seem to stand still long enough to see anything. Though not only are the monkeys well designed, but also the world itself is incredible from the decaying metropolis that was once San Francisco, to the secluded fortress of the monkeys. I felt the world before me could exist, impressed with the creative integration of nature and architecture mish mashed together in ways I would never had thought about doing. Yet the biggest thing the visuals and acting did for me, was stir up a wide array of emotions. Dawn of the Apes is filled to the brim with intense moments that bring out a wide variety of responses over the course of two hours. Caesar himself opens up many of these doors, his facial reactions in particular reflecting his soul, while also being portrayed as the hero from well angled shots. Even the other monkeys will get you worked up as they try to adapt to the changes in their world, only to be treated like scum in a manner that similar to racism. Yet, a few rogue monkeys also reveal the darker and inhumane, or should I say inAPane, manner that makes them no better than the humans they so despise. Of course the biggest thing that affected me was seeing the death of the apes, their high-pitched screams of terror penetrating my core. As for the humans, they too have some moments that are emotionally moving, but they paled in comparison to the CGI simians. Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, and Gary Oldman did a fine job acting, but they took a back seat for a good portion of the film, the exception being Clarke, merely providing a little story and situation relief when needed. My words can do very little to justify how much I enjoyed this movie. The dynamic character that is Caesar continues to evolve, bringing so many people into the world and creating a story worthy of introducing us back into the nostalgic world. With great action and suspense, incredible visuals, and a wide array of emotions, this may be one of the best sequels I have ever seen. Therefore I strongly encourage everyone to head to the theater to see this film, as it is also one of the best for the summer. I look forward to the next movie in this series, and hope Reeves will take lead again. My scores for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes are:Action/Drama/Sci-Fi: 9.0 Movie Overall: 9.0",

A pandemic, resulting from the laboratory experiments that created the intelligent apes, has killed most of mankind, while the simian colony has been able to develop in sophistication and language. This movie has a different director (late reserve Matt Reeves who has already been signed up for the next in the franchise) but two of the same writers (Rich Jaffa & Amanda Silver), so there is strong continuity.Again the action is in San Francisco and the redwoods north of Golden Gate Bridge but now the forces on either side are much more symmetrical. Furthermore we have doves and hawks in each camp: Caesar (wonderful Andy Serkis) and Koba (Toby Kebbell) among the primates and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) among the humans. Clearly the human-like apes can be seen as a metaphor for people who do not look or behave quite like the majority in any community and the message of the movie is that all groups have honourable and evil characters.As with the original film, the special effects are brilliant, with performance capture conjuring terrifically realistic apes (well done, Weta Workshop) and some convincing post-apocalyptic street scenes mostly put together in Vancouver).

            "content": "Dawn of the planet of the apesIt's fine thing to see that Hollywood has some good momentum to show the good side of itself, and this franchise is the one that it should be proud of since it's timeless themes about human nature, morals and racism never seem to get boring or over-debated, also these are remarkably presented here (in this franchise)And that's why from this moment I would consider myself as a fan of the Planet of the Apes, as I adored the original 1968 piece, and now these two really enjoyable ones that came in 2011 and 2014, we shall say that this franchise has the power through these ages to maintain it's freshness and intelligence. The Rise/Dawn of the Planet of the Apes both show how this theme should be look like for this new generation, and man, they do it so well! But before I get into reviewing the sequel, I had an opportunity to see the \u0084Conquest of the P.o.t.A.\" a day ago and even though it lacked visual and solid narration, the ending Caesar speech left me speechless, and practically the apocalyptic scene showed the \u0084Birth of the P.o.t.A\". What kept me stunned is the character of Caesar, his appearance in this ending was frightening, balancing the moral questions between positive and negative terms in a way, that the audience couldn't tell if it's a good or a bad thing that these apes took control over humanity. These modern pieces (2011, 2014) depict this character, Caesar in more dimensional way though, these motion pictures in their run-time both manage to make complex emotional connections between the audience and some characters with different views in the film, making the movie fresh and alive, and make us believing the situations throughout the happenings. So the sequel: Story: After a solid kick-starter origin story we get into an amidst- apocalyptic world where both party has it's own way to assimilate into this new environment: the apes kinda start a new life creating their recently born civilization, and there are the humans, who actually have to get use to the huge back-step system of theirs and actually continue their living with the tools and technology that they can still use and which work. And you guessed well, they gonna have problems with each other, even within groups, but let's not talk about the specifics. The emotion centered story really has many to give even though seemingly it isn't complicated, but that's why it is necessary to inform that it's center is the emotion relations which give huge weight to the conflicts between humans and apes. CGI: Even when I was watching the 2011 ape movie, I was mesmerized about the technological implementation they could achieve in that, how the apes became so realistic that it actually was believable on the screen even though we still see it's CG, but that's what is great about these two movies \u0085 I don't mind about these computer generated images, because they are done with great attention and ambition, and they emerge really well with the real environment. I usually stay away from these effects used in movies, but these deserve attention, which for they don't even cry for, well for me at least, mine is always taken as I see them here.Music: I was so pumped up as I heard the classic elements given in this soundtrack here which were representing the classic movies in some places, it really gave the hint of these happenings having overshadowing factor, as the whole franchise actually emerge into one in these moments. Overall it is a good soundtrack with huge Hollywoodish monumental sound, but only these \u0084classic\" moments were highlighting. (These tracks I spoke of are titled on OST as : \u0084Close Encounters ... \u0084and \"Monkey to the city\")Actors: Quite solid from the \u0084human\" side, however of course playing an ape it's more interesting part, and were pretty well done. Check out some behind the scenes videos, they are very interesting\u0085 The guy who played Smeagol actually is a solid actor (Andy Serkis), I'm starting to realize that. Important things to mention: -The conflict between these groups is well crafted, no matter how you want to make nitpicking comments on these products, the quality of filmmaking shine on the screen as you watch these, and relatively, compared to todays Hollywood norma, the Planet of the Apes (as a franchise) is remarkable creation, even if you watch the classic, or the prequels.The action packed adventure relies on characterization, to create different values which are built up on different world views, and with that the storytelling and sympathy becomes complex and multi-directed, but mainly balanced. The prequels mix some main story elements from the classics forming a new one, additionally showing the whole picture in new, fresh form, which maintains the intelligent message of the whole franchise, but also adds new dimension that wasn't seen before on this field : fantastic visual, entertaining surface. Overall: It's a must see motion picture, with it's huge multi-ambitions it deserves great gratitude and respect from the audience, as the Hollywoodish mainstream plagues the media and still some of the products can keep their head up to say: \u0084Yeah, we can show something new and clever here ... we got some QUALITY\" ... so that's what I call simply this product: A Quality One!",

            "content": "After the apes rose up in rebellion and fled San Fransisco, a plague descended on mankind, setting the stage for the inevitable clash of two cultures. With human civilization in decline and ape culture on the rise, it is a fragile and fearful time for all. It would only take a few bad misunderstandings to set off an all-out war between men and apes.That's pretty much what we get in this follow-up to Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It starts off a bit slow, but builds momentum and tension as the two sides of the conflict rub together. By the last act, it becomes a shooting war. It's not quite as tight as the first film, especially since your enjoyment could hinge on whether or not you care for the human and ape characters. However, the film doesn't linger too long on the drama, even though the film is attentive to all sides of the conflict.What matters the most is the story. Not only is is a sequel to Rise of POTA, but it also borrows the plot and ideas of Battle for POTA (which, ultimately, remains the weakest of the franchise thanks to its cheap and dated look, and poor execution of the story). Dawn improves on Battle substantially, if for no other reason than it gives the characters a fresh new life and emotional anchor that audiences can latch onto (specifically, regarding Caesar and his ape tribe; the human characters have their moments, but never really take the spotlight enough to make us care). The story proceeds to underscore the key themes behind the apes' civilization - the moral battle between taking action or enforcing pacifism - and it's a struggle that endures for the entire picture and drives the characters. It all builds up to a moving tale of treachery; the ultimate turn of events mirror the takeovers and oppression of typical human dictators, and the film provides a stark reflection on how the rage of a few unchecked individuals could ruin peace for everyone.This film is crafted with decent photography. Acting is not bad; the ape characters easily steal the show, with Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell bringing their characters to life marvelously. Gary Oldman is as great as ever, although his role is pretty small. Jason Clarke is okay. Writing is good. This production uses quality sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music seems quaint, but it works.This sequel continues the chronicle of the new POTA saga sublimely, and for anybody who enjoyed Rise, Dawn should satisfy.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",

            "content": "After experiments on chimpanzees infected with the mind-enhancing Simian Flu virus go awry, the chimps escape and the backfiring virus decimates most of the human population. Complete background is available at planetoftheapes.wikia.com: It might be helpful to look over this site before seeing the movie, especially if you're like me and haven't seen the earlier RISE Of The PLANET Of The APES. The chimps, along with gorillas and orangutans--also subjects of experiments or possibly liberated from the zoos?--develop a rudimentary civilization of their own, hunting with spears and arrows and riding horseback. Small contingents of humanity survive, however, and soon a band of apes in the forests near what's left of San Francisco encounters a hold-out of these survivors. There are some attempts to peacefully coexist, but . . .DAWN of the PLANET of the APES (\"DPA\") is a fun, enthralling, and carefully filmed prequel that does a nice job of showing the back-story of the earlier \"Planet of the Apes\" films of the '70s. It begins as a thoughtful science fiction drama, gradually descending into more of a fast action-driven thriller. Still, I'm sure a thriller is what most people are after here, and I'm not sure how it could have gone any other way. Even in the violent latter portions, there are some touching moments and interesting turnabouts, with excellent special effects throughout.There are all kinds of potential themes and parallels in this film. The dual dove/hawk power struggles between the competing chimp alpha males--pragmatic and basically peaceful Caesar versus embittered Koba--and two human alpha males--conciliatory architect Malcolm versus the more bellicose former Chief of Police Dreyfus--are especially interesting and do much to support the story. As in the earlier films, some may find the apes a bit over-idealized with all their noble \"Ape not kill ape!\" business. Chimps can be quite vicious and are often cannibalistic: Apparently they're supposed to have evolved beyond that here (even though they obviously haven't completely). A few more choice minutes toward the beginning on how the ape society develops, particularly in how the orangutans and gorillas, who take a vague cheap seat to the more numerous and practical-minded chimps, are supposed to fit in would have been a plus. There's one gibbon or monkey sentry shown early-on, but s/he's apparently a loner. Yep, a more diverse ape society would have been great, but I guess you can't expect everything. While it can be fun to analyze and interpret DPA, too much of this is likely to ruin a film that's intended mainly as simple entertainment.All that being said, there's some interesting character development in DPA: Caesar and Koba are particularly fascinating even though the former seems more like a man in a chimp's body than an evolved chimp. Perhaps that's the point: For better or worse, brilliant Caesar was more responsive to the early experiments and became \"more like us.\" Still, why oh why does he speak English even to his fellow chimps? Nevertheless, Andy Serkis does a magnificent job with the voice, the motions, and everything else he was given in portraying Caesar. The costume design is more problematic. The primary chimps, along with the cute babies (actual chimps?) look quite real, but many of their supporters are less so. While the orangs and gorillas look real, they are a bit bigger-than-life. The humans all look amazingly clean and well-groomed considering the conditions under which they've been living. Still, the human acting is generally good, with some fairly memorable performances by Jason Clarke as Malcolm, Keri Russell as his nurse-wife Ellie, and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Malcolm's son, Alexander.For all its kinks, DPA does an admirable job of showing some truly fantastic situations in the most convincing manner possible, and I'm sure anyone who's enjoyed the other \"Planet of the Apes\" films will like this one.",

Gary Oldman is excellent as usual with an absolutely phenomenal motion capture performance from not just Andy Serkis but from literally everyone.The only issue is that there is not enough James Franco but that's an issue that can be sidestepped for now as this film sets up what looks to be a thrilling climax to what has been a fantastic series so far what's best is I still don't know the path the sequel will take but from the ending that left me stargazed to the end of the end credits I can just about be sure.Rating: A+ Comment: Every world leader needs to watch this film to teach them what true leadership is about.",

            "content": "Andy Serkis gets top billing in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and not without good reason. It's possible that without his performance the movie might have been just another forgettable, big-budget Hollywood special effects prequel, but he makes the movie come alive in a way that from now on, he should no longer be dismissed as just \"that CG guy.\" After playing Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, and the big ape in King Kong he has cemented himself as the king of The Uncanny Valley.Serkis' performance brings unexpected levels of emotion and conflict out of a character created out of computer generated imagery. Caesar is an ape of very few words, but his face speaks volumes. It's an effect so beautifully done that after a while you stop trying to see the visual effect and start feeling for the character.The performance builds on what Serkis created three years ago in 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes. When we met Caesar then, he was a lab monkey burning with distrust for the Homo sapiens who had caged him up in a science lab and fed him a drug to give him human intelligence. Now, 10 years later, he has grown more mature and more brooding and more thoughtful.The story picks up 10 years after the previous film, the virus called \"Simian Flu\" has decimated most of the world's human population. Man has withered down to the bare bones, while the ape society has flourished in the Muir Woods outside of San Francisco. We see Caesar as the leader of the now tribal apes who have developed a primitive society not too far removed from those at the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey.There is a dividing line, however. While the apes have evolved, there is a tense but festering hatred between the ape world and the human world. Both are on tenterhooks with each other. Man lives in the ruins of the cities while ape makes his home in the woods. The drama kicks off when the humans (who live in what is left of San Francisco) discover that their supplies are depleting and the only way to keep from running out is to start up the nearby hydroelectric dam \u2013 which unfortunately is deep inside ape territory.Misunderstanding begets misunderstanding. Man goofs up, and the ape's mistrust grows until \u2013 horror of horrors \u2013 they discover that man has a stockpile of guns. That only scratches the surface. There's a lot of plot in this movie, a lot of story threads to work out but the story isn't the most interesting element. The best thing about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the level of tension that director Matt Reeves is able to maintain. The earlier scenes are the best as we can clearly feel the lines drawn between the two sides and also the conflict in Caesar's soul as he questions his moral values. He finds himself at odds with his second-in-command, a nasty ape named Koba who is prepped for a violent conflict. The apes all seem like individuals, and despite the fact that most of them look alike, you can tell them apart.Those are the good points. This is a problematic film in many ways. It's too long; the message is repeated over and over; the dialogue is perfunctory, and the narrative moves uneasily back and forth between ominous dread and emotional leanings. It's an uneasy mixture that leads to an ending that is bittersweet when it should be knocking our socks off. The great tradition of The Planet of the Apes movies going all the way back to the 1968 original is that they always end with a punch in a gut. This one closes on a note that tries to be emotional and the result is painfully awkward. Director Reeves wants to have it both ways with the emotional and the suspenseful but he has trouble juggling both at the same time. The movie is a jumbled mix of elements that work meshed with elements that do not. It's a good movie that leaves you wishing for something a little more surefooted.",

Yes, Apes talk. Now you know this isn't going to work, right? Each side has its own hothead who wants nothing to do with this. Let the games begin. I don't know if there were real acting Apes in this, or there were CGI Apes, or Humans made up to look like Apes. This was unbelievably good and everything regarding the Apes was seamless. Hard to believe, I know. Okay, Andy Serkis was Caesar the Top Ape so we know he was dressed as an Ape. There were others, too, dressed that way. The story is a simple one as you may have already figured out. It's the cinematography, photography and CGI that win in here and hold you. Like I said it's all seamless. The CGI is unbelievable. You will believe. And, you may find yourself caring for the Apes.When you see the Apes fighting and swinging among trees you may ask yourself: are they real? These scenes are that good. Nice to see Jason Clark, who did a good job playing Malcom, finally getting a movie shot as he had been in some TV police dramas that didn't run too long and that was sad as those shows were very good as was he.Gary Oldman and Keri Russell were good in supporting roles as were the rest of the cast. We last saw Andy Serkis as Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. He played Caesar in that movie and again in this one. He plays Caesar to perfection. The over-riding slogan in this and all Planet Ape movies is: Ape does not kill Ape. Too bad Humans have learned nothing from the Ape movies. Because you may have seen The Planet of the Apes back in the day, you may suspect who is going to win in this one. There may be another Planet Ape movie before we get to see the remake of Planet of the Apes. I am sure there will be a remake. Will check to see if Vegas has book on it.

Very intense shooting scenes and at times you can't tell who are good guys or the bad. The lines of what is right and wrong continue as the humans opt to step back for the apes to figure it out among themselves. The movie also spends a lot of time building up the story to prepare for Apes 3 that it seems the filler of shoot them up attacks within the fog of war are used as filler before the end credits get you set for the next movie installment.",

            "content": "So this movie is about intolerance between people, this, if we continue top push the analogy until the end but also war of territory and lack of frontier between the resemblance between men/animals also, from a physical standpoint, monkeys and men. But that is probably what made me dislike this movie where I also reached to a certain boiling point, got completely bored and checked out before the end. So that leaves us with one or many problematic. The first one being the angle under which this movie was shot.It kind of reminds me a Voltaire like 'philosophical tale', a weaker version of that. You could sens the morale \u00e0 la Jean De La Fontaine coming full speed at the end : unite and do not make war. While the premise is actually right, the movie in itself was quite predictable and cheap in that regards. I do not like the high-standard morale under which they shot this, trying to give people lessons of life because it really dries out the film throughout once the lesson was already assimilated half-way. What else was left then afterwards ?The other quite annoying arguments are the 'Monkeys are wiser than men, more diplomatic than men' etc. that you can read in certain scenes is quite preposterous too. Animals react to their natural instinct even if they have some part of intelligence, yet, this was very rarely represented and you even had the impression that the human beings present in the movie are the ones being savage and animals while the monkeys are completely the inverse for the most part [...] but also dominant where man would be under their mercy.The second. From a pure aesthetic standpoint, the movie is quite beautiful. The rendering and reactions of the apes is quite realistic though at times you could feel them being fake and overdone -; however globally it was good. But, the story is cheap. Even a five year old apprentice film writer could have come up with such a scenario. There is also literally no focus whatsoever on why part of the human race got exterminated and why are the monkeys dominating.I did not see the first part though but it would have been great to throw in some flashbacks like so many films do.That said, the flow of the movie is from an overall standpoint, dynamic but from my personal perspective, the main reaction that comes out off me is \"bored\". I lost attention quite quickly and especially at that first 'romantic' scene that tries and soften the spectator. I found it to be heavy redundant and clich\u00e9'd to an underwhelming maximum.At last, certain characters are as useless and invisible as sun in full and bright daylight. Kodi Smith-McPhee is the case in point of somebody who just does not find his place in the movie. He's even painted as some kind of dumb retarded person whose only dialogues are 'Is he OK ? ; Is he going to survive ?' yet, he does play an \"essential\" role in the movie as he appears in way too much scenes for what he globally does.Jason Clarke's acting can be perceived in both ways. Sometimes he simply was not credible and looked scared -; and even when he tried to look scared, he did not look scared. I hardly really perceived his emotions when he was trying to convey them.",

First, the acting, our lead characters Ceaser (Andy Serkis) and Malcolm (Jason Clarke)both maintained a great performance throughout the film, the film also had a supporting cast made up of Keri Russel and Gary Oldman, (and that is only naming a few) who both gave a good performance, although i did feel that Oldman's character was a bit preachy, it also seemed that his character's morals were muddled but this may have been a simple mistake somewhere in the story. Other than that issue i enjoyed the acting. The film was quite normal when it came to the styles Matt Reeves used to convey the story, to be brief i didn't find the directing to be anything special. Now onto CGI, and i can say it looked amazing for the most part, the apes looked amazing but any other animal such as deers, not so amazing, now i know the budget has to go to the important things but maybe just before releasing the film just touch those effects up a little. To conclude, the ending to this movie was pretty good, but has now left us on a cliffhanger to see the next movie. I hope to watch the 3rd movie in 2016 and i can say i recommended you watch Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. My final rating 8/10.Jacob's Review: This movie is an epic experience and the best film to be released this summer if you can take chimpanzees with machine guns on horseback seriously. The problems that arise with the film are only minor. Firstly, the dialogue can be occasionally weak, in fact, the weakest part about the movie is the human element, again. It is improved however through more motivated performances with real conflict and struggle. The lead, Malcolm, I originally thought was just another Aaron Taylor Johnson type but it is more passionately acted so the need for more depth and complexity can be side-noted. Gary Oldman plays a character who I originally thought was going to be the generic Avatar bad guy who is just blinded by unguided prejudice but that was replaced with a character who you can relate and understand why he is going to great lengths to protect his people. The direction is slick and the scenery is gorgeous. The real achievement is the special effects, action and ape element. The CGI is beautiful but every computer based performance for a bear looks incredibly fake. This is a CGI heavy film but it would be worthless if it didn't have an emotional core that drives the film. The action is enthralling and motion capture presentation is great. Andy Serkis as Caesar gives a complex and heart-felt performance as well as his ape cohorts, especially Koba, the villain. Koba is a disgusting and abhorring character and it is great to see him getting his ass kicked. This is the Dark Knight to the Batman Begins, The Empire Strikes Back to Star Wars and deserves a 9/10.",

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of the enduring acclaimed blockbusters of this Summer but I struggled to see why it's necessary. What is it bridging in this franchise? It didn't really answer the question. It's the bleak followup to a relatively bright film in hindsight, depicting a very obvious war that needn't be shown, especially if it wants to say it's due to one irresponsible character. The film is just far too simplistic and on the nose to resonate. It's passable and not necessarily stupid, but it induces eye rolls for being inexplicably bland. Neither the human characters or apes are interesting or essential, as rousing as a Gary Oldman speech can be. It's a shame coming from the director of Cloverfield that it's so visually compromised, though the dark grade is nice enough. Sure, the visual effects are good, but the film takes no risks and it just did nothing for me. I won't be around for whatever the third is going to claim to be.6/10",

            "content": "Not having seen any of the original 'Apes' films (even the Tim Burton remake), I really liked RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES because of its emotionally resonant story and awesome special effects. DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES continues in the same vein, while covering different thematic territory. No new ground is broken, per se, but the manner in which it is presented and the talent involved lend it some freshness which would otherwise have been missing from what is already a really good film.DAWN takes place about 10 years after the events of RISE, when the Simian flu has killed off a large portion of the human population. The apes have migrated to the forests and started their own primitive civilization, while the humans hang on to what little they have left in the ruins of the city. With fuel about the run out, they seek to gain access to a power-generating dam, but that dam is located right in the middle of ape territory. Soon, mistrust on both sides leads to a conflict that has far-reaching consequences.One thing I noticed continually while watching this was how far special effects have come. It was only 15 years ago (or so) that we were still using people in ape suits to portray apes, but now since RISE, they are done in motion capture. They already looked really good and photo-realistic in RISE, but here in DAWN they look even better. I think that Andy Serkis did some of his best work ever here, and also the actor who played Koba, Caesar's right hand \"man\" (and later, nemesis). The digital augmentation of the sets and locations was also seamless and created a world you could really believe in.Anyway, moving on to more important aspects. The human cast was all portrayed very well, the standout being Jason Clarke as Malcolm. His character is kind of a human counterpart to Caesar, in that he only wants what is best for his family, and that he is more pragmatic when it comes to certain situations. There's also Gary Oldman as Dreyfus, someone who leans more towards the confrontational side, like Koba. Even though I think his character wasn't given enough development, there was one scene which really sold you on his plight and gave the audience a potent emotional connection to him. Across the board, all of the performances were excellent.Thematically, the film deals with conflict and how we handle it, how it starts, how trust is broken. It's a very basic story, but one that should resonate with viewers of all ages. Also, with the ape culture, there's kind of Animal Farm thing going on where you have two leaders vying for the trust and respect of the people. This is replicated to a degree with the human cast, but the bulk of the movies' themes are handled when the apes are on screen.This leads me to the only thing I can really pick on with the film: that is, while the themes are certainly important, they are handled in an overly broad and unsubtle way. The apes basically act as mouthpieces for the core ideas of the film, and at times you might be tempted to roll your eyes, but then you'll just move on because you're that absorbed in the world being created and emotionally involved with the characters.Overall, I think this represents a significant step up from the previous one, which was already very good to begin with. It's one of the best films to come out in Summer 2014, and I highly recommend that you see it.",

            "content": "But still very good all the same, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a film that does an excellent job at continuing the rebooted tale without jumping over too many plot points. It lacks in pure acting ability, but that is strictly reserved for the poorly cast human characters. The apes are portrayed, acted and integrated into the world with seamless precision, allowing for the needed suspension of disbelief.The story is quite familiar, but also refreshing, a turn of events that the first film in the rebooted franchise doesn't foreshadow. With humanity seemingly at a moment of extreme crisis the world over, Caesar, the original ape who developed increased intelligence and who became the leader of his kind, has led his people into the thick forests of California to establish a home. The entire film centers around the interaction between a small colony of humans and Caesar's tribal apes.It all progress with fantastic tempo, the pacing only surpassed by the anticipation it builds in the viewer. \"What's going to happen?\" is a question many movies attempt to have the viewer ask themselves, but only the minority actually succeed at. This film is in that excellent minority.The only flaws, to my eyes, were as I said: the humans. Gary Oldman, despite being casted in a type of role I've always felt he was suited for, is underutilized in comparison to certain other people. These others, a mixed bag of performances, are mostly overshadowed and at times insignificant to the apes themselves. Perhaps this was inevitable when considering the story, but I do feel that more could have been done to provide a more balanced and engaging human colony in terms of casting and performance.In the end, I got my money's worth and then some, with only the smallest complaint to offer. Now, my opinion may be more favorable to the reboot as I am one of those who have never seen the originals (shocking, I know), but I can't imagine this film or the last doing any disservice to the classics of the past. Worth the price of admission, and shines well above your average summer blockbuster fare.",

            "content": "In the distant future, a worldwide virus has killed most of the human race. A community of survivors lives in the ruins of San Francisco while a tribe of very advanced apes with human-like qualities lives nearby in Muir Woods. Tensions and violence erupt between the species.Although this is a science-fiction film and had opportunities for new paradigms, the old chivalry paradigms are still used particularly in the ape community where the men do all the hunting, fighting, and governing while the women stay home and give birth to baby boys. (As an aside, why is it that nearly all on-screen births are boys? If girl children are never seen to be born, then how can there end up being mothers to give birth to baby boys?) On the human side, there is a major female character but, as usual, this number is kept to the usual maximum of one.Besides the misgivings, this is still a finely made film mainly for the special effects and the make-up prosthetics. It is also a good metaphor for current and past wars among humans. Each tribe in the film has a minority of wise people with good hearts who try to find peaceful common ground with like minds on the other side. Sadly, they are attacked for this by members of their own tribe. Does this sound familiar?With this insight on \"humanity\" and constant action, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is an entertaining film.",

It's a perfect sequel to bridge the origin story into a larger issue in \"The Planet of the Apes\" series. Matt Reeves and the writer team had successfully shown life of two different species, their own problem to survive from end of the world circumstances also brought explanation of why they couldn't be together without any silly script or plot holes.But of course most achievements should be rewarded to the using of visual effects and it's department (considering almost every scene involved them) who had created realistic look of the apes itself especially for Caesar character. Caesar is undeniably flawless in this sequel and the outlook easily makes him an iconic leader to his colony. Though perhaps the movie felt too serious and struggles with monotone score, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is a breathless franchise with brain and rich of heart and emotional depth.",

Andy Serkis is to no surprise again brilliant as Caesar, he is the character he plays 100 %. Jason Clarke plays a great role as Malcom, really giving the character some depth and feelings. Gary Oldman, always puts a smile on my face with all his accents, and he really does play the role as Dreyfus to great success. Tony Kebbell also plays a great Koba, only improving on this chimp, who is filled with so much hate and despise for humans.Best thing about the movie is the little video clip with James Franco, so emotional it really hits you hard.One of the best Sci-Fi movies i've seen to date and probably one of the best movies this year so far. Only contenders i see would probably be GoTG or The Hobbit. Captain America and DoTFP was great but this movie takes it to a whole other level.

            "review_title": "One Of The Greatest Sequels Ever",
            "content": "Just as it says above, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is possibly, maybe even most likely, the best sequel I have ever seen. From start to finish, I was 100% interested. It is in the top five movies I have ever seen. Anyway, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of the rare cases that a sequel is better than the original. Seriously! I loved this movie more than Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Don't get me wrong, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic movie, but somehow Dawn bettered it. Possibly because Matt Reeves is a better director than Rupert Wyatt (sorry Rupert - it's only my opinion, though). Even though Wyatt is a great director, he just isn't even with Matt Reeves. Reeves directed other great movies such as Cloverfield and Let Me In. His way of purveying all of the scenes was great, just like in his other films. OK, so, the general aspects of the movie. The story, first of all. The whole story was so great at following the first film that it was almost as if they were both the same movie, just in two parts. It is very rare to see a fun and interesting story in an Action/Sci-Fi movie these days, because all of the good plots are used up already. However, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an original story and stayed fun to watch until the end. The fact that the writers came up with a way to display the apes as a civilization, just fantastic. It made the apes easier to sympathize with. Next, the characters. As with the first movie, there were apes such as Caesar, Maurice, and Koba. The human characters were completely new, and they included the always awesome Gary Oldman as Dreyfus, the great Jason Clarke as Malcolm, and Keri Russell as Ellie. Since the last movie, the motion capture has increased dramatically in quality, which made the apes even more believable, surprisingly. Now, all of the characters were either fun or despicable. Just like in the first movie, the writers and actors worked together to create characters that you really cared about, or hated. In fact, they even did that with the apes, which is awesome. As with Rise of the Planet of the Apes, there were quite a few characters that you could just flat out hate, and that is another thing that should be in a good movie. Now, the acting. The acting in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is just as good as it is Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The acting is actually the only thing that didn't improve at all in Dawn. With stars such as Andy Serkis, Gary Oldman, and Jason Clarke, you would think the acting would improve, but it didn't. Everyone displayed their emotions and said their lines very well, still. Now the visual effects, of course. Rise of the Planet of the Apes had extremely good visual effects throughout the whole entire movie, and so did Dawn, but Dawn had better, because it was made three years after Rise, of course. The detail is so amazing! You can make out the hairs, the facial expressions, the muscles moving, even the difference in skin tone. Rise had great effects, but they were much, much, much better in Dawn. Lastly, the music. The music is catchy and fun to listen to while watching the movie. Michael Giacchino did a wonderful job making it intense and serious. I thought the music helped intensify the action sequences, which included some of the best battle scenes I have ever seen. The battles appear so realistic because the apes are so human that it is almost as if the battle was going on between different countries. The battles were also sad, because a lot of people die. The fights were so intense that I caught myself gripping the arm of my seat a couple times. That doesn't happen a lot for me, so that's saying something. SO, overall, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was an amazing movie, and I was not disappointed at all by it. It might be the best summer movie this year. See ya!",

It's easy to point the finger at big studios whenever anything goes wrong, but here they have done the right thing. They've hired the right directer, the right screenwriters, the right crew, everything needed to make a crowd pleaser that people will still be watching even after the colder months have set in. The movie's finest achievement though is that it shows how real conflict, be it big or small, actually starts and grows as every side, even the \"bad\" guys, have a valid point. I liked how most of the focus is on the apes themselves and that Caesar is crushed between two conflicting minds. And when the action comes it's really well done and carries even more weight owing to that fact that it's actually about something and not just for the sake of filling in gaps between the story. For a reboot on a classic movie series, this for me is as good as it gets, and if the third is as good then this will be a brilliant trilogy of films.",

            "content": "As an unashamed fan of the original Planet of the Apes films (which I once picked up for under a fiver), I am more than happy to enjoy this Sequel to the Reboot of the Remake of the Planet of the Apes. What's been delivered is another entertaining film; almost, but not quite the equal of its predecessor, with a decent story and characters, and special effects at the top of their game.This is the eighth film in a franchise rich with possibilities, which has always reflected the concerns of society, from nuclear war, slavery and segregation in the 1960s and 70s, to the 21st Century concerns of animal testing, genetic engineering, global pandemics and our relationship with the environment, always with the chilling edge that comes from displacing humanity from its comfortable position as the planet's dominant species.As a quasi-prequel to the first Planet of the Apes (1968), we get to see this process in action as we return to the titular planet (spoiler: it's Earth!) some years after the aforementioned pandemic which appeared as the end sequence of Rise, killing 90% of the human population. With no humans seen for some time, the thought in the now thriving society led by ape liberator Caesar is that the last survivors have perished, but a chance encounter on a hunting expedition reveals the truth.An expedition of humans has ventured deep into ape territory with the intention of restarting a hydroelectric dam to restore power to the ruins of San Francisco. With a deep mistrust of humans at the very core of ape doctrine, the plan becomes a tense diplomatic mission as the humans and apes negotiate to avoid another brutal conflict and needless loss of life.Caesar is played by master of motion capture Andy Serkis and amazingly, the motion capture was largely filmed on location in the forests of Vancouver, the CGI seamlessly integrated with live action. As a character, Caesar is rare among apes in that he was raised by a human and can see the good in them.Our human hero is Malcolm (Jason Clarke), a survivalist and engineer, who is in charge of the expedition, but is not much of a leader. Neither is he a diplomat, but he is level headed enough to develop a relationship with Caesar, with whom they share a common goal which transcends the interspecies squabble \u2013 each has a family they would do anything to protect.The real leader of the humans is back in San Francisco: the militaristic but pragmatic Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who has already lost his family (he swipes through their pictures on a prominently placed iPad \u2013 in shops now!) and has little desire to understand or relate to the apes.The previous director Rupert Wyatt is replaced here by Matt Reeves, who gave us found footage monster movie Cloverfield, where the tantalising excitement of citywide destruction just off-screen was undermined by the idiotic decisions made by the protagonists. There are shades of this frustrating characterisation here with one member of Malcolm's team, Carver.He is nothing more than a catalyst; right from the opening scene, where he shoots first and thinks later, wounding Caesar's son Blue Eyes in the process, everything about him screams \"I'm the arsehole who's constantly going to jeopardise this fragile diplomacy\" \u2013 which is barely saved from the brink of collapse more than once before the inevitable final showdown.Koba fills this role for the apes, but he is a stronger character and an established personal rival of Caesar, who tries to corrupt the younger apes, including Cesar's impressionable young son Blue Eyes.We also remember the dramatic \"No!\" \u2013 The first words spoken by an ape in both Conquest and Rise, when Caesar flexes his vocal chords to deliver an ultimatum to the humans, but the apes here tend to converse in sign language amongst themselves. Perhaps they see spoken language as a hallmark of humanity, but they prefer to save their English skills to dramatically intimidate humans, reminding them that they share a level of intelligence which apes may even have surpassed with their sense of community. While the apes have built a new society from the ground up, the surviving humans continue to scavenge in the ruins of their decaying civilisation, relying on old technology.There's a great scene about halfway through the film. Power is restored to an old petrol station in the woods, and as it flickers into life a song plays from a stereo: The Weight by The Band, a song which is both religious allegory and an exploration of the music which flows from the American South. Its thematic relevance extends to include references to Judgement Day and the American civil rights movement.Hearing recorded music and seeing artificial light, symbolic of humanity's legacy, offers a spot of hope, which is inevitably undercut by the melancholy of the world lost and the inevitability of an impending finale, which I'm going to talk about now, so stop reading to avoid spoilers. Hey, I've already told you that they managed to get the power back on so Gary Oldman can charge his iPad.The audience wants a fight, we've paid to see apes with machine guns, and a fight is what we get, courtesy of the hot headed Koba and unrelenting Dreyfus. Lamentably although hell inevitably breaks loose, credibility is stretched. The previously pacifist apes are far too good at using the machine guns they have only recently stolen from the humans.We know the apes have both intelligence and physical strength on their side, but it's hard to explain hold their own so well against the trained human guards. Ultimately, they overwhelm the humans with sheer numbers, when they might have concocted a strategic assault using some kind of unique and established ape advantage, such as their non verbal communication, or climbing ability.",

            "content": "If I'm going to be drawn away from my humdrum life, I want something convincing and compelling going on that will make me feel as if my time was well spent. With very few exceptions this movie fits the bill.There's a lot that's uncomfortable about meeting a superior species that movie makers like Ridley Scott have mined profitably, but what if we were being challenged for planetary superiority by an inferior species? What would be our reaction? Sheer terror? It would be hard to imagine if we were at full strength and this movie acknowledges that. It begins with the now intelligent apes not sure whether men still survive. (They've been decimated accidentally, by their own hand.) Some do survive and they might have lived separate and apart from the apes if not for one thing: the apes control the area around San Francisco's power source, a hydroelectric damn.Now you might construct a reasonable expectation in your mind of the kind of shenanigans that occur, but what you will not see coming is the extreme artistry and insight displayed by almost everyone involved in making this movie. It really makes the old Charlton Heston movies seem almost as crude as crayon drawings.These apes under the leadership of Caesar (James Franco's rescue from the first movie) have developed to the point they know right from wrong. Though they too struggle with doing their best, they are clearly as worthy of world domination as we are. And for most of the movie I suspect the audience is on their side. That by itself is worth the price of admission given the way most people look down on animals.My only (slight) disappointment was that Keri Russell doesn't have as great a role as she could have had as she's a favorite of mine, but Andy Serkis and whoever is responsible for making him look as convincing as he does are almost breathtakingly convincing and masterful. The execution here and in the rest of the movie, is, to my eyes, well nigh flawless and, therefore, irresistible and moving. The standards on display are way above anything I've ever seen before and even outdo Gravity, the previous high point.In short, this film is not to be missed.

The hero of the movie \"Ceasar\" has no clear outer motivation, he is the leader of the tribe, he is basically after nothing but continue the status quo so the scenario has no enough thrust for the bulk of the movie because the hero has no apparent visible goal. He also lacks viable conflicts. He is stupid while Koba has a point. He truly knows if humans get their hands on power, they become stronger and they attack apes. First it was the hatred of humans which was thrusting Koba's actions in the story but then he was proved right. Ceasar never listened to Koba, and at one point attacked Koba and hit him hard to the point of death. So Ceasar estranged Koba who had a valid point. Under Caesar's leadership, apes were waiting for the humans to get stronger and attack them. Under Koba's leadership, apes attacked humans and won the war and Koba's conspiracy to kill Caesar was not the result of evil intentions or his appetite for power but for the benefit of ape nation. So Koba is nit the villain. He is a hero with dark side but Caesar is the stupid hero. Now despite these apparent fact, from the assassination of Caesar to the end of the movie, the screenplay tries in the cheesiest way to demonize Koba. So we have a stupid hero who has no outer motivation till near then end of the movie which his goal became the removal of Koba and return to power. We have a villain who is not really a villain and as result we do not have and sensible conflict between two characters. Also none of the humans fit into the category of hero or villains so the movie was about Caesar and Koba. There was another point. The poster of the movie shows a scene from the battle of apes and humans which does not exist in movie. The movie could use an additional 20 minutes of battle action but for obvious reason (Money, return on investment, guaranteed sell of franchise) cut short. I as a cinema goer feel cheated. I waited and waited and waited to see that bridge fell and when I least expected the movie to end, It ended.

            "content": "'Dawn' takes place ten years after the virus that was teased in the previous film became a worldwide crisis, and killed hundreds of thousands of people. The apes live peacefully in the woods and have evolved to using sign language and basic speech to communicate and have managed to build a community for themselves. The humans meanwhile are starving for electrical power, and its the damn on the apes homeland that can give them the power they need.The film is really an Ape centric movie. It focuses on how the apes have come to the point where they are more like humans than they know, that they are capable of things they thought they would never do. It's a journey for Caesar and the next step in the evolution of apes until we finally see something similar to the original '68' film.Caesar is played to award winning caliber by Andy Serkis. Many don't think that motion capture is a viable form of acting because 'it's the computer that does the acting', well I'm here to say that Serkis performance shines right through the CGI, but not to an extent that we see Serkis in spandex acting like an ape. The combination of flawless effects with high quality acting gives us this character that we never think twice if he's real or not.That goes with all of the other apes as well. Toby Kebbells Koba is almost on the same level as Serkis Caesar, the anger that Kebbell portrays gives you the sense of a tortured soul that just wants revenge on the people who tortured him. I think a very understated performance is Nick Thurstons Blue Eyes. The emotion that we get out of this character is huge, but not over the top. The scene between Caesar and Blue Eyes is heartfelt and made all the better because, once again, we never question the reality.The humans are criticized for not being fully developed, and while I agree to an extent, the humans really aren't the focus. Jason Clarke is a man who simply wants the best for his son, paralleling Caesar, and he isn't the typical leading man, just like Franco in 'Rise', he's someone who just wants everything to be normal and peaceful, he doesn't want war. Keri Russel and Kodi Smit-Mcphee are probably the least developed among the human cast but its isn't a loss, it doesn't take away from the film at all because the characters do whats needed and thats just fine.Gary Oldman gives a good performance as Dreyfus in a limited role (sadly it seems thats his thing nowadays, limited roles). A scene where he looks over pictures of his family is tear jerking and all the character development we really get from him but thats all we need to realize that he isn't a villain, he's a man who blames the apes for the death of his family and wants revenge. That's an interesting thought as well, there isn't really a villain in 'Dawn'. Dreyfus has a reason for his actions as does Koba to an extent so really the story is about survival and not good vs evil.Overall, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is a smart, character focused film that shows the summer blockbusters can be clever and emotional without being heavily action focused as well.",

In both the Ape population and the race of Man there are those who only see bad in their opposites and there are those who can see beyond the stereotype they believe them to be. Man as always, has that arrogance which makes them think they are the superior beings, but this film pushes you to think twice about that. A little odd, I must say to hear the Apes talking, more odd to see them riding horses. The Planet of the Apes Films of old featured humans dressed as Apes, with this production we had Apes looking like Apes in the correct proportions and somehow that made them more fearsome. There were however, moments of extreme tenderness reminding us that these were just beings, trying to raise their families as the humans were.

Scene trying to give everything more details made it more unbelievable. The metals in background bent like paper and the tap that metal piece took while falling was just another dirt mark to the wall of pure ugliness . Its just a futile battle between black naked apes and the white and clothed apes that too when none knew how to fight. 1 day and Caesar's wife's all well with antibiotics n guess what is all ready to go to the city just because that jackass asked. Only good part was the song berzerk that played in the trailer of the expendables3",

This edition truly humanized the apes...partly because of the approach and partly because of Serkis. I was pretty moved and engaged for the first 60 minutes or so. It eventually devolved into an ape action flick, complete with an ape Rambo...but it still mostly worked. Especially when seen as a metaphor for how humans relate (and fight) across lines of difference. I'll stick around for another sequel!",

            "content": "So after seeing War for the planet of the apes, i thought i would watch the last two to get a better look on how War fits into the perfect trilogy. And after revisiting Rise which was great, i saw this movie again and i personally think is not only the best in the trilogy, but one of the best sci-fi films this century has to date. Dawn of the planet of the apes takes place 10 years after the ape leader Caesar leads a revolt against the humans and frees his imprisoned apes. And in this one we see the apes create a civilization and things are going pretty well. Until a colony of humans are discovered and both groups struggle to maintain peace. First of all, this movie improves greatly over the 1st one with CGI and it looks amazing. We also see more characterization from Caesar and also some human characters. This movie also gave 2014 the best movie villain.... Koba. He was just great and he did things that were terrible but you also understood why he does what he does. The conflict between Caesar and Koba is just perfectly well done. We have a character that wants both groups to live side by side, and we have a character that just acts out of fear and vengeance. The plot is amazingly well done and there is not one dull moment (that i found anyways). The score is also epic. I better stop talking how great this movie is, sorry i do have a habit to talk a lot. If i was going to pick out one little flaw it would be that the human characters are not as interesting as the apes. I wasn't bored when the were on screen, i just found myself not as engaged as when Caesar, Koba, or any of the apes were on screen. But that is just a little flaw, it doesn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece. So in the end, Dawn of the planet of the apes is a masterpiece in every possible way. I loved it when i saw it in 2014, and it kinda grew on me as i watched it again. The action was amazing, the characters were well done, the score had me on edge, and the plot always had my attention. A+ or 10/10If i was gonna rank these movies it would go like this: 1. Dawn of the planet of the apes 2. War for the planet of the apes 3. Rise of the planet of the apes",

Take John Wick, a super cheesy movie with the most cheap story ever, and guess what? It has the same rating as this masterpiece! John Wick is incredibly predictable and not one single review is complaining about it, but rather praises the action scenes. Hello? Wake up \u00abprofessionals\u00bb!Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is brilliant, the plot is extremely enganging, the villian is one of the best characters ever. He's backstory makes completely sense and allows you sympathize for him. Not only that, but it switches over from apes to humans and back and forth all the way.In my opinion it's the perfect sequel, to ROTPOTA (Rise of the planet of the apes)\nThe visual effects are revolutionary, the characters are interesting and makes you wanting more, the plot is incredibly engaging, the Andy Serkis is a genius.So over all, the idea is good, and the execution is brilliant!

Certainly everyone is as entitled their opinion as I am to mine. Suffice it to say, if realism is your biggest concern, maybe a movie about apes taking over the planet is not for you. There are lots of how-to documentaries on survivalism and end-of-world scenarios. Yes, movie-guns often expel more rounds than real guns. Sorry, some dialog and emotional interaction was warranted for the narrative build up. The storyline may have deviated from your expectations, or from the lore of the original movies - though those vintage films did have people wearing rubbery ape masks that jiggled when they talked. So I think this is an improvement. Oh and more good news: with all the CGI, the preponderance of violent explosions was not real. For films that burn through natural resources, see the Fast and Furious franchise or anything with Jason Statham.Cheers to the writers and actors and all the craftspeople and artists involved in this film. Bravura performances, outstanding soundtrack, a fantastic film all around. Thank you.",

The characters in this movie are so well done from the apes down to the humans. You understand the motivations here and you feel what each character is feeling. I feel I got a very realistic portrayal of the inside of an extra intelligent ape community, their complexities, their similarities to us. Just stellar film making all around. Caesar has more depth here than he did in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, here is a father a husband and a leader. He is the mosses of the apes and you see his importance to the tribe every time he steps on screen. These apes owe him everything. I thought I would miss James Franco here but Jason Clarke provides plenty of interesting moments here to make you fall in love with his character just as much as you did with James Franco. The action here is well done and the villains really stand out, you've got Gary Oldman who is sorta a play or more a mirror of Koba the villain on the Ape side. These two men are both similar in their one sided view on each others race. Its only Ceasar and Jason Clarke's characters who see the possibility of peace between ape and human. The movie leaves an obvious opening for the clearly bound to happen sequel. Just as I had dubbed Xmen Days of Future Past king of the summer this movie came and stole the crown. This truly is one the greatest years for movies I've ever seen. Even surpassing 2012 with The Avengers and The Dark knight rises. i highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see a great movie.",

            "content": "Who would have thought that Hollywood, a place that masters illusions, could give us talking apes that ride on horses, fire guns, and interact with humans without turning it into a something ludicrous or even laughable? \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is such an achievement. It demands us to take its subject matter seriously and it does so with persuasive reasons. Set 10 years after the ALZ-113 virus has obliterated most of the human race, apes and the surviving humans remain as the two main species. The question of who will rise as the dominant one becomes the predicament as tensions between the two skyrocket into all-out war. The film exceeds just as much in its action sequences as it does in its more neutral moments. The apes are fully developed characters, who communicate perfectly with sign language (accompanied by subtitles) and the writers present these creatures with enough material to make their characters comprehensible. The meticulous motion-capture improves the film's plausibility. For all 130 minutes, I thought I was seeing real apes communicating with one another. The visual effects are that convincing. Just as successful is the story. For an \"ape\" movie, the story is original and much darker in tone. The comparison of human's distrust and paranoia with one another to apes becomes an apparent driving force in the plot. Instead of humans battling each other, there is a situation of apes against apes. They too can have differences that can cost lives.While the apes garner much attention, the supporting human characters take a backseat. Great talent like Gary Oldman has very little screen time, and is only given one short scene for his character. It's a poignant moment, but it feels almost wasted for such a phenomenal actor. Other characters are equally disregarded. The center-most point of the film though is the relationship between the ape leader Caesar and the lone human father Malcolm. It is a nice interaction to view, for both value the same goal of peace and unification, whereas the others of their kind desire the opposite because of past wrongdoings and misunderstandings. It's human and ape nature to fight what they fear and hate. Only the few and smart can see the good over the bad. \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is a great feat in movie-making. It is the ape movie that audiences have wanted for decades.",

For all the flaws in the plot the film roars along at a great pace and is full of impressive set pieces which leaves you little time to get bored.

On the opposite side, we see the apes and what they've created. Ceasar is their leader and they have built quite the foundation in the woods near the Golden Gate Bridge.Andy Serkis as Ceasar is simply brilliant. His motion capture acting might be the best in the business. Not only is it his motion and the way he moves but the dialogue as well. The special effects on all the apes is beyond great because you can tell what their emotions are. I think because of that, I liked it more than I thought I would.When it comes down to the big fight between ape and man, the action junkie inside me loved it.

            "content": "A calculative and decisive group of apes waits patiently for their leader's signal to attack a herd of deer. In true predator style, these fearsome apes swing through the trees in the Muir forest while some even encounter an angry bear. Back in their forest lair, Caesar learns of his newborn son and cherishes a life that they have managed to sustain as a group but is wary of any potential threat to their home. Director Matt Reeves ('Cloverfield') shifts focus to the phenomenal development of the apes as the hyper-intelligent surviving species on the planet, leaving the remaining humans to blandness. It is quite an achievement however, to engage the audience with apes that speak and delineate emotions rather than humans, when they are in conflict. The credit for this goes to the performance-capture technology and its shining beacon \u2013 Andy Serkis. After their 'Rise' in the previous story, the apes face an uncertain future on a planet that has been dominated by a now hostile species. In Caesar though, they have a leader who will bring a new 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' but he must first establish order and defend his family against adversaries both within their sanctum and out there in the city. It has been 10 years since the simian contagion began wiping out a significant part of the human race so when the Caesar company finds a group of humans wandering off into their territory, a shocking verbal warning sends them back to their base in the ruins of San Francisco where their encounter is downplayed by their skeptical leader, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman). The ape army marches to the gates of the human fortress to establish their boundaries and to avoid any conflict. In such an intense scene, the restraint displayed by Caesar and his subordinates is marvelous. Soon after, with a looming power crisis and no other option, Malcolm (Jason Clarke) has to venture into the Ape territory and request them to allow repair work on a dam that can restore electricity to the city. Much to the annoyance of his first subordinate Koba, Caesar permits these humans to work under strict monitoring. With the cunning Koba on one side and a defending Dreyfus on the other, conflict was quite an inevitable outcome to an idea of two states co-existing in a fragile world. As stockpiles of guns are discovered, Koba smells war against the deceiving humans and it doesn't quite help that in his past, he had been subjected to atrocities by them whereas Caesar had seen love and care. Battle lines are drawn and the leader is unfairly ousted. The march of the misdirected apes into the city is set to determine who the dominant species of the planet will be..... There are some epic moments in the film that are enhanced by WETA's astounding work in the CGI and the performance capturing technology. The opening sequence with the deer hunt and a bear attack is thrilling while the showdown of apes riding horses into San Francisco to expose their might in numbers is spell binding to watch. As Koba turns to the dark side and rides aboard a runaway tank heading directly into the human fortress, we witness the carnage all around through a rotating camera mounted on the guns as both sides suffer grave casualties in a fight to defend their homes. Koba's cold hearted murder of a fellow ape crosses the boundaries laid by Caesar's virtuosity and it also displays the mad rage within his trusted second-in- command. The final battle is no longer between two species but between the two most powerful apes who need to establish leadership. Reeves has fun with the CGI in this sequence which yet remains credible due to its execution. But there is nothing more powerful than Caesar's silent walk down the stairs, amidst the remaining apes who bow down to respect his command as the leader who shall protect them against the oncoming attack by more humans. That war, has already begun....Andy Serkis is truly the wizard of facial expressions with his infinite range and adroit ability to portray emotions. Caesar's posture and composure certainly make him an intimidating leader but a laudable performance by Serkis that has a human like range of emotions expressing concern, love, despair and agony, makes the film special. Along with his motion capture co- actors, Andy Serkis does the impossible by making us believe that we are truly watching some very intelligent apes on screen. Reeves' 'Dawn' is a darker tale that represents the survival of the apes in their secluded home. But it lacks the intrigue towards an unknown conclusion as all the battles lead up to a predictable end. In the overall scheme of things, this movie doesn't make much progress in the storyline which will result in The Planet of the Apes. Yet, it is thoroughly enjoyable due to some nimble performances by Andy Serkis and the other ape actors behind WETA's exemplary work with the performance capture technology. The drama and emotions surrounding the simian community is engaging and they command your attention much more than the humans possibly could. Hopefully, there are no humans at all in the next installment because that will really be a triumph of story, characters and technology in epic 3D.8.133 on a scale of 1-10.",

The plot itself is pretty straightforward, ventures in four main aspects - home, family, war and future; predictable but full with moral values. The apes are mimicking human by having the same personality which indirectly let audiences to see our own real personality from what had happened among the apes this time. Although the climax does not seems to be extremely exciting, the most successful move of this film is to hire Michael Giacchino as the composer who has contributed both horror and emotional types of scores to enhance the darker tone of the film.",

This movie completely rocked though, I really enjoy not seeing people in monkey suits, and the seamlessness of all of the scenes where Man, and Monkey are face to face. The special effects are just that good. There seems to have been something in that serum they took that makes them really good with guns as well as sentient, but that is somehow never touched on, and the only flaw I really noticed. 10 years later, and the world has changed so much that most people will not believe it possible, but you take us out of the picture for a couple years, and everything will grow right back so it all fits really well. As in the last film there is a strong bond between Cesar, and a few of the humans as he is really the only \"ape\" who was really ever treated well by \"us\". Gary Oldman is good as the leader of the survivors who has lost everything, and only wants to save what's left of humanity, until these talking \"animals\" show up, and get in the way. Cesar is such a powerful character, that you can easily believe that he is real, and actually interacting with the other characters, in fact all of the simians are so well developed, and full of life that you will definitely have your own favorites in no time. Really worth the $300 that it costs to go to the movies (where they have smaller cups, and no longer give refills. What's that about?) but if you want a great movie that the whole family really will enjoy, and though there may be some stuff to scary for the little ones, there are also some really heart warming moments that you will wish they saw if you hadn't brought them along, so your call, but that's how I saw it.

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of those rare breeds of film where the sequel is better than it's predecessor, and boy, how much so. While I enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes, for me this sequel is on another level for everything from the amazing visual & special effects to the development & characterisation of the apes.This film takes place 10 years on from the outbreak of \"Simian Flu\" and the human population has been all but eradicated while apes have learned to adapt & become more intelligent. When the apes - led by Caesar - and humans encounter each other, a trust gradually begins to evolve between the two, but that trust is thrown into jeopardy when Koba, Caesar's \"No. 2\" comes up with a plan that will cause the two bands to go to war with each other.Another rarity with this sequel is that it has a good story to go along with the fantastic visuals. All too often a lot of big movies attempt to blind you with effects to make up for the lack of storyline, but that's not the case here as the story, while maybe a little bit predictable, blends a good deal of tension and suspense. There are also underlying messages within the storyline too, with the main one being that with all that has gone on before, you still get the humans that act in a manner that causes ill will.The visuals, as I have mentioned before, are stunning. From the realistic look & movement of the apes to the ruins of a demolished San Fransisco, everything is so seamless. I enjoyed the way that Caesar - and the other main apes for that matter - was portrayed as well....they gave him a kind of real on screen presence that seemed to give him that Alpha male kind of dominance. With all this new motion capture, as well as other techniques, it just goes to show how far movies have evolved with the technology available now.Add a good cast to all of the above and you have a very enjoyable movie.This is definitely one that is worthy of at least an 8 rating.",

My final words of my review of Rise was \"I'm really looking forward to seeing the continuation of the story and seeing how this promising new franchise will continue to develop.\" I'm pleased to say Dawn of the Planet of the Apes continues this in good stead in the very capable hands of director Matt Reeves (who has already signed up for the third film). Dawn picks up ten years after Rise where we find the Simian virus has virtually wiped out most of humanity except for a few who are living in the ruins of San Francisco. First though the film directs us smartly to the Apes where we see leader Casear (another excellent performance by Andy Serkis) and his family (wife and two sons) along with other Apes like Koba (Toby Kebbel), Blue Eyes, the son of Casear (Nick Thurston) and Maurice (Karin Konoval) living peacefully in the woods hunting deer and interacting through sign language for years without seeing a human until one day they come across a group in the woods led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) with his wife Ellie (Keri Russell) and son Aex (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Tension is immediate between the human and Apes, which becomes more complicated as the humans need access to a dam to restore power to their base, where the Apes live.Whilst Malcolm and Casear though initially sceptical about one another want peaceful co-existence between the two parties, it's further complicated by human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who hates Apes as well as Koba who dislikes humans as they treated him badly by keeping him captivity and experimenting on him. Throughout there is a delicate uneasy balance between the two parties until an all out war is the only outcome. The differences between the humans and Apes in how they feel (Malcolm and Casear want peace) and (Dreyfus and Koba want war) is nicely mirrored, but this isn't a simple case of good versus evil as soon Malcolm and Casear find common ground through there interactions with each other of love and family. But Koba increasingly angry at the humans and his distrust leads him to turning against his own kind in hurting Casear (as at first Blue Eyes agrees with Koba) and punishing any Ape that sympathises with the humans as he goes out and leads an attack against them.Of course the CGI effects are just amazing as the first one as the motion capture performances are terrific. Again through the facial expressions and words Serkis and Kebell are the two most impressive stars in the film as we feel for both of them, the peace yet scepticism of humans Casear has as well as his love for them (shown in one beautiful scene where Casear watches a video of Will from the first film bonding with him) and the burning hatred Koba feels for them. The human actors gave decent performances too, but the Apes were the real stars of the movie. Over 15,000 people helped make this film and it shows with the incredible amount of effort you can see was put into it. Mesmirising music is provided by Michael Giachinno, the action sequences are terrifically done and very entertaining to watch and there are some truly touching moments in the film between the Apes and humans (mainly Malcolm and Casear) but also between the Apes when Casear watches over his family and Blue Eyes when he apologises to his father for letting him down. This gives the film heart and some substance.The themes of peace, war, nature and family are touched upon, but without any real exploration (though family is to an extent), which is why this stops short of being a brilliant film and a rating of no higher than an 8. I'm not sure what else they could have done to explore these themes, but I just felt the movie was missing that little something extra. The biggest weakness though regrettably like the first movie is the human characters who are not all that memorable. Malcolm makes the most impact, whilst Dreyfus is a wasted opportunity (played well by Gary Oldman) but his screen time is limited. We know his hates Apes, but his motivations are not really explained, though in one scene he cries when looking at photo of his lost family who presumably were killed by the virus, which hints at something, it doesn't come across particularly well (Does he blame the Apes for killing his family?) Malcolm is serviced by a wife (who is a doctor and saves Casear) and a son who are there to maybe humanise his character. But like the Vet Caroline in the first one, they are completely expendable and really didn't need to be in the film at all.However though Dawn didn't blow me away, this was as good as Rise and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. It's rare to find sci-fi's that have intelligence as well as heart, but this one has it in abundance. I look forward in great anticipation to the third film.",

            "content": "Quite possibly the greatest sequel, period. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is without doubt, the best film of the entire franchise. Just like the last film, the best thing about the movie is Caesar, played brilliantly by the always fantastic Andy Serkis, who has turned the genre of motion capture acting into an art form. Caesar goes from being a revolutionary into being a leader, Serkis' commanding presence transcends into Caesar's command over the apes. I also a huge fan of the ending, when Caesar is pushed to break his own law by murdering the villain, Koba. I always find it compelling when heroes or leaders are forced to break the morals in order for the greater good such as Superman in Man Of Steel. Koba is also shown to be compassionate and caring, such as allowing the humans to work on their electricity, all in an attempt for peace, showing Caesar to be much more than a one dimensional lead.Another great quality in the film is Koba, the villain. One thing I must say, is though he was a vicious antagonist, I actually ended up feeling sorry for him. From the first film one could see that he had been a victim of long term suffering as a result of being tested and his hatred for human beings is coming from. Apart from that, he is a completely awesome villain. When he murders the two guards (after putting on the cute monkey act) was terrifying for two reasons, one it was terrifying and two it completely contrasted our cuddly perception of apes with the reality of how fierce and powerful they really are, it reminded me of the orangutan that murders a woman and hides her body in a chimney in the novel The Murders of Rue Morgue by Edgar Allen Poe. Koba also represents the side effect that if animals were to gain the intelligence of humans then as long as the positive qualities like ambition or desire for freedom (as shown by Caesar in \"Rise\") they would also inherit the negative aspects such as hatred, bittrernes and prejudice. I also love the dramatic irony that in the mission to eradicate humans, the thing he hates most, Koba almost becomes more human (by showing negative human qualities).The human characters were also likable, but it must be said that the biggest surprise was Garry Oldman. In all the trailers, he was made out to be the villain, but in the end he turned out to be one of the most sympathetic characters. The man had to balance the pain of losing his family along with leading the few human survivors. I honestly felt sympathetic when he blew up the tower, and I probably would have done the same thing in that situation. Malcolm and his family were also likable as they were able to be good without being one dimensional, as they had all experienced pain as a result of the disease and were all trying to avoid feeling such pain themselves.The best part about the film was the story. What I loved was that it was not actually humanity's fault that the two species went to war but in fact it was the fault of the apes, as it was an ape (Koba) that started the war, showing that, if given the intelligence, animals could have the same potential to be cruel and evil as humans.This has been one of the best reviews to write about the best film (so far) of 2014. Dawn of The Planet of the Apes is a must see.",

Would it still end in bloodshed, violence, apes riding horses while at the same time shooting two machine guns (like come on really??)? Especially considering that it has been proved that female primates were just as likely to demonstrate leadership.This movie plays in a dystopian future, and once again the writers fail to imagine a society that has changed and developed, no everything is the same, including the stereotypical role of woman, who stay silent and out of the way, and the males who stay dominant and violent and capable. Even without woman I wonder, why cannot Caesar and Jason win this time. The caring father, the pacifistic ape, the empathetic protagonist? But no of course, male has to be violent, temperamental, \"strong\" etc etc. And that is why I am calling this movie a male-centric, men-ego-trip movie. I did enjoy watching it for its cgi, good job weta, and if I switch my brain off I can even enjoy it as the action blockbuster that it was.",

            "content": "Dawn picks up ten years after Rise in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The virus has spread, wiping out most of humanity, while simultaneously boosting the apes who have thrived and bred. The film opens with the apes, with the fate of humanity left a mystery both to them and us (if you haven't seen the trailer, anyway), as a telling conversation between Maurice and Caesar tells us they've seen no humans for two winters. Suddenly there's an encounter as the humans who have settled in nearby San Francisco have branched out to fix a dam for electricity. What commences is two hours of political tensions as the humans negotiate to continue their work on the dam while the threat of war constantly looms over both communities.What the film does do great is blur the lines of villainy. There are individuals on both sides who could be deemed villainous, despising everything about the other side. In a way you can almost sympathise with everyone as well. Koba has a deep-seeded mistrust and hatred of humanity due to the mistreatment he suffered by their hand, while Carver and Dreyfus see the apes as nothing more than animals and do what they can to defend themselves. This mistrust between these two sub-factions escalates as Koba sees the human's weapons as a threat. Is Koba wrong in trying to pre-empt the human's actions? And are Carver and Dreyfus wrong for making sure they're armed just in case? No, not really, and yet they are quite obviously the antagonists.Another thing the film does really well is run parallels with current politics. In particular the climax near the end becomes very reminiscent of the Nazi's gathering up and shutting away the Jews because they're different and unapproved of. On the flip side there's also a parallel to how muslims are often treated today; hated as a whole thanks to the actions of a few. It's not Muslim exclusive, but it's one of the most prevailing intolerances in the world today that leads to many of our conflicts. As is in real life, the movie makes a point to show it goes both ways, as I mentioned with the Koba/Dreyfus mistrust. Without trying to spoil too much, there's also a polarised succession that results in a division of one of the communities, and the loyalists of the old leader are treated the same as the enemy. A straight-forward summer blockbuster, Dawn is not. It's seeped with social and political commentary, some subtle, some not so much.As with Rise, the true stars of Dawn are the ape actors and CGI team. Andy Serkis is on top form as always, bringing more of a dominance and rugged experience to Caesar than last time. As an ape, he's starting to get on a bit, and his aged wisdom certainly shines through. Judy Greer gets under the CGI costume as Cornelia, Caesar's mate, but she literally lies around for three quarters of the movie, stands up defiantly, and then is never seen again. However the actor/ape of the movie is easily Toby Kebbell as Kobi. I'm a huge Toby Kebbell fan. He's a hugely underrated actor that keeps getting stuck in bad movies, or in this case is unrecognisable, but honestly his performance as Koba as unparalleled. He's terrifying and threatening while also giving the movie some of it's only source of humour. Also, if there was any ape in this movie that truly showed how intelligent they really are, it's Koba. He may be the villain of the movie, but he's probably become my favourite character of the franchise so far.The CGI has stepped up hugely since Rise. While in Rise, there were moments where you could sort of tell the apes were CGI, here it's easy to forget. The amount of detail on them is phenomenal, not just in their movements and facial expressions thanks to motion capture, but also how their fur works, and the furrows in their brows. Even the ape's tongues are rendered to absolute perfection. I literally cannot fault these effects. Not even a little bit. It brings the ape characters to life. Just like in Rise, they're each given an individual personality which makes them instantly identifiable. My only real criticism of Dawn is the inconsistency in ape communication. They start the movie pretty much exclusively using sign language. They can write and read as well, but no big point is particularly made of it. However, by the end of the movie they're speaking full sentences to one another. Obviously it was a creative choice to build up the amount of ape speaking, in a way maybe to reflect the urgency and tension of the inter-community politics? However I just felt it was a bad choice. Can all the apes talk, or is it just a few? Why use sign language if they can all just talk to one another?Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a solid addition to the franchise that even surpasses the quality of Rise in just about every way. The effects are better, the acting is better, the story is better, hell the climax in Dawn is actually a satisfactory conclusion whilst simultaneously setting up the next movie. As I said, the only thing I can fault through nitpicking is the ape communication, but let's be honest, that's not really enough to ruin your enjoyment. I give Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a fantastic 9/10.",

The clich\u00e9 ridden script is tiresome and often gets in the way of enjoying the film as the action grinds to a complete halt and drags with little exciting character development. While the plot and the interactions between the humans and the apes is predictable the visuals are fresh and often spectacular. The battle scenes towards the end of the film hit a high note with stunningly crafted moments of carnage and destruction, but without a convincing emotional centre and a hackneyed plot the journey feels nowhere near as worthwhile or harrowing as that of Rise of Planet of the Apes, which built suspense masterfully towards a wholly satisfying and engaging conclusion, something which this film fails to do. It doesn't draw you in and instead relies heavily on special effects to create interest, and while there is no doubt that the initial forest scenes in the first act and the sheer marvel of destruction in the third act make for some serious eye candy, the middle of the film sags unbearably and makes you wish it was at least thirty minutes shorter. Andy Serkis does a wonderful job bringing the ape leader Caesar to life but it's Toby Kebbell as the lead villain Koba who really steals the show with a menacing complexity brought to the character. Aside from some truly incredible special effects there is little here to savour, which is a shame because the previous film was a great blend of intelligent thrills and emotional resonance.",

            "content": "Very few sequels outdo their predecessors. Some will credit Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather Part II as the greatest sequel of all-time while I find the wonder and amazement in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back as the best science fiction film of all-time. When the first trailers started to appear for Matt Reeves' Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the follow-up to Rupert Wyatt's reboot from 2011, I was ready for \"Cheesefest 2014.\" I thought we would have apes and monkeys speaking long, drawn-out stories about politics, life, and love. Similar to Tim Burton's reboot failure from 13 years ago. What we get in this stunning edition is an action-packed, multi-layered story that stands as the definitive summer blockbuster. Actually, thinking about it, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes isn't just a summer blockbuster, it's a full on dramatic epic. Starring Andy Serkis as Caesar, the film takes ten years after the events of the first film. Humans have been nearly wiped out of the Earth, and Caesar and his fellow apes have built a civilization in the wooded and abandoned San Francisco area.The growing debate about motion capture is put to the ultimate test in this second installment. For years, fans and pundits have championed the talented Serkis in his role as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings films, most pertinently in The Two Towers. Other films followed with a similar argument including James Cameron's Avatar since then. In the 2011-2012 awards season, some critics came around to the idea. Serkis scored a nomination from the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Supporting Actor, a huge feat for the motion capture community. I'll be honest, I've never embraced the idea of an actor getting recognition for this type of performance, not that I'm against the notion, I just haven't seen something that made me champion a performance....until now. Serkis' turn as Caesar this time around is a fully realized and gracious work that stands as one of the great performances of the year. It's a gorgeous triumph and the highlight of the entire picture.What makes the film even more special is that Serkis is not the only actor that shines this time around. While Serkis has carried the torch for motion capture actors for years now, he has some company in Toby Kebbell who plays the conflicted and vicious Koba, Caesar's right hand ape. Kebbell's multi-layered and glimpse into his inner-darkness is stunningly profound. He raises a plethora of intriguing questions about the nature of justice and the power of vengeance. Unrestrained, violent, and at times, downright terrifying, Kebbell is sensational.After sadly losing the Visual Effects Oscar in 2011 to Martin Scorsese's Hugo, Reeves' film is ready for a second bout. Everything that sings in the film is due to the visual effects team. There's a big pay off to the intricate detail they spent on each character. The entire technical team should be applauded. A panoramic look through a perspective of a tank along with a reflective look through a window, Cinematographer Michael Seresin emotes as one of the most exciting veteran DP's that we should be ashamed to have forgotten. Composer Michael Giacchino knows how to set tempo, build excitement, and pull back when necessary. His score is pretty darn spectacular on every musical note.Where the film falters unfortunately is in the development of the human characters. Trite, boring, and utterly predictable, especially when it comes to the women, leave much to be desired. Jason Clarke's Malcolm balances some of the over-the-top back stories with true, natural talent. Equally effective as James Franco in the first one, Clarke continues to explore his acting options well as his career continues to elevate.I love nearly everything about Keri Russell. I feel she is a phenomenal talent that has proved her abilities several times over including currently on FX's \"The Americans.\" Unfortunately for her, she's relegated to virtually nothing with the occasional screaming of Malcolm's name, and a lazy back story that involves A-typical female behavior. I'm very pleased to see Kodi-Smit McPhee getting older and growing into himself. I thoroughly enjoyed him here. Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman kind of wallows around the film. There's no real arc to his character and if you pluck him out, I'm not sure if anything changes. Overall, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets the job done and does it well. Astounding direction by Matt Reeves that blows anything that Garreth Edwards did in Godzilla look like a high school musical. It's one of the best surprises of the year along with being one of the finest. The film is now playing in theaters.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, a film by Matt Reeves, is extremely high on emotional side. It is great to see the emotional connect between humans and the apes. This movie really explores what happened after 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. If 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' was spectacular, this is super-spectacular. The presentation of the movie is so natural and simple that one gets to relate with almost all the characters. Everyone has the right to live on this earth, be it animals or humans, one cannot afford to become the threat for the other. The evolved apes are trying to live their own lives and humans are in the struggle to survive. Each character, whether humans or apes, has been so well crafted and detailed. We get to feel their loss, fear, insecurity, efforts for survival etc. It is great to see the sentient apes, talking, expressing emotions like humans. Apes are shown to be quite rational and forgiving in comparison to humans. In spite of them having experienced human cruelty and imprisonment, now they want peace and just want to be free in their own world away from humans. This movie tells the story of how the declining humans and the ascendant apes come to be at war.The movie begins from where the 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' finished. In the first film, humans gave the apes their intelligence with an experimental drug. Ten years later, humans have largely been wiped out by contagious and deadly side effects of the same experiment. A quick montage gives us an idea of all these happenings since Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It narrates the wake of a flu epidemic, followed by violence and chaos. As a result, Dr. Willman (James Franco) and other millions of people are dead. Human civilization has become almost extinct. The survivors have cobbled together a society in the ruins of San Francisco, with Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) as their leader.On the other side, apes are in the initial stage of their civilization. Initial frames of the movie shows Ceaser (Andy Serkis \u2013 what an amazing performance), leader of the apes, with his family and fellow apes in a forest. Outstanding scenes with the apes swinging off the trees, jumping off the walls. Blue eyes (Nick Thurston), teenage son of Caesar and Cornelia (Judy Greer) is shown to be impulsive and short-tempered. Koba (Tony Kebbell), Caesar's adviser feels that Caesar is too affectionate towards humans. Koba has lot of angst towards human beings since he was a test subject for them all his life before he was freed by Caesar. Caesar's second-in-command cum great friend is Rocket (Terry Notary), who is also the honorary uncle of Caesar's children.Humans and apes are almost oblivious to the existence of each other, but the situation changes when humans come face to face with Blue Eyes and Ash (Doc Shaw), Rocket's teenage son. Humans had come there hoping to tap an energy source, basically to gain access to a hydroelectric dam (in apes' territory) which could provide long-term power to the city. Ash is shot at by one of the human Carver (Kirk Acevedo). While Carver calls for rest of his fellow armed survivors, Blue Eyes calls for the other apes. Caesar orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, Caesar brings the apes to the city where he orders the humans to never enter ape territory again.Dreyfus believes that humans can survive only when the last ape is killed. According to him, after all, apes are just animals. Whereas, Malcolm (Jason Clarke), Ellie (Keri Russell, Malcolm's second wife) and Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee, Malcolm's son) feel otherwise. Malcolm convinces Dreyfus to give him three days to reconcile with the apes to gain access to the hydroelectric dam in their territory, which Dreyfus, distrustful of the apes, arms survivors using an abandoned armory. Caesar allows Malcolm to work on the dam's generator, provided they surrender their guns. Humans stand in stark contrast to the mostly peaceful apes, who are willing to accommodate the humans if that's what it takes to avoid a war. As Malcolm, his partner Ellie, and son Alexander work, they bond with the apes. Things are smooth when someone does a foul-play and humans and apes clash. Who plays the villain? Who emerges as the planet's dominant species? Does the movie answer as to who is truly at fault for the ultimate destruction of humanity. Watch the movie. The motion capture technology used here is also so perfect, which translates minutest details into animation. Andy Serkis as Caesar tops the list of performers in this movie. Caesar's emotions, rage, sympathy, concern everything is so beautifully captured.",

While the look and movement of the apes is effective, I still prefer the old 60s film in this department, where the more human stances and clothes made the apes fascinating and more fun to watch. The human characters are no match for Charlton Heston either. Worst of all is the semi-soap opera feel of some of the emotive scenes and the deadly dull piano music that drones on in the background, adding a wearying portentousness. It aims for an epic quality but forgets that epics require larger than life, ambiguous characters with universal interest, and even the best ones here -Caesar and Koba- are not quite that interesting. In fact, the only truly interesting part was not the fact that apes are proven to be just as capable of evil- their rivalry for leadership, from which human power hunger possibly stems, is well-known; it is the newsreels of the effects of a virus in the prologue. What is happening to the world in the 2020s was clearly predicted back then. How long ago 2014 seems! Back to the film: another issue is it feels long because it saves dull and predictable action for the end, by which time the mind has switched off. How much better and unforgettable was the end of the1968 version when films were still mainly aimed at adults...",

            "content": "The following review will contain some light spoilers. So if you do not want to hear anything about this film, then it would be best not to read my review.Three years after the release of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, comes one of the greatest sequels ever made. Not only should it be considered one of the best sequels ever, but I strongly think this may be one of the greatest films ever. The story is so flawless, and then executed perfectly by director Matt Reeves, that it will have you interest and even leave you wanting more. This is my review of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.This sequel was written by Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver. Jaffa and Silver both wrote Rise of the Planet of the Apes, while Bomback worked on films like The Wolverine and Total Recall(2012). To be honest, I was very worried about this story taking place in the future, because I thought it would take away a lot of the much needed details. Surprisingly I left the theater without any worries about that aspect at all. They were able to craft such a perfect story around the distant future that filling in the middle didn't seem just. The movie moves along perfectly, although my only real complaint of this film is the pacing towards the end of the film. It felt very sticky and lost a little glow over the first half of the film. Not to say that makes the film unwatchable or anything, it just doesn't move along as nicely towards the end. The film overall is heavily character driven. A lot of the action appears towards the end of the film. This just ends up working perfectly as we follow Caesar(from the first film) and his followers and family. Over time as Caesar is tested once again by the humans, he is also tested by another ape, Koba(Toby Kebbell). The story here is simply fabulous. The film may seem like it moves slow to those who aren't into character driven films, but for someone like me, it was great. I won't go into full details of the story, but I will leave you with this, if you want a truly amazing story, this is the best movie to choose for the year of 2014.Matt Reeves sits in the director's chair in this installment. Rupert Wyatt who directed the first film did not return, and while I loved that movie he did, this was a step up in my opinion. Matt Reeves is widely known for directing the massive hit Cloverfield. This is a completely different type of film, but he dominates the film. As I mentioned above, there really isn't a lot of action until the latter part of the film, but when the action heats up it is shot perfectly. Mostly done with CG, everything works amazingly. The CG doesn't feel overdone and tacky. Some of the high rise shots of San Francisco are amazing to watch as it is set in a future where disease ruined the world, and are probably even better on large format screens, if you are lucky enough to watch this film in that format. Andy Serkis is back again to play the likable Caesar, but there are new faces this time around. Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, and Gary Oldman are all new additions and they all play a fantastic role in this film. Oldman as we all know is an amazing actor, and the same goes for this film as well. Clarke, who is becoming a bigger star recently, really holds his own as the lead character along with Kerri Russell. While I don't see Russell winning any wards, her performance is solid. As I mentioned Andy Serkis is back as Caesar, and actors like him do not get enough credit. Hopefully that will change with films like this. He was yet again perfect in his role in the motion capture department, and actually gets more lines this time around. So, big thumps up for the acting and directing in this film.Michael Giacchino provides the score for this film. He recently worked on Star Trek Into Darkness, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, and even worked with Matt Reeves on Cloverfield. his score in this film is nothing short of breathtaking. For fans of scores, like I am, this will leave you feeling the film as much better. He doesn't overdue it like some composers tend to do, and his handling of this film should be considered for a few awards.Overall this is easily one of the best films I have ever watched, while some may not be into this type of character driven film that could be slow in your eyes, people with movie tastes like me should leave the theater feeling very satisfied. This is a must watch, and while I didn't watch this film in 3D, with great CG work, and being filmed with 3D in mind, you probably can't go work. Again, one of the best sequels ever made, and easily in my top films list.9.7/10",

That is perhaps only reason I can't give full five stars to this movie. Apes are animated beautifully and elaborated. Andy Serkis is brilliant as a Caesar. Movie grows epic with Caesar's character. Even human characters are interesting, especially Gary Oldman as Dreyfus. Matt Reeves has made a perfect summer block buster movie and it is nice to know that he already works with a sequel.

            "content": "'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' does a great job of continuing the story from 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', without picking up directly where it ended or doing any gimmicky flashbacks. The graphic of how the simian virus spread was quite original and the opening shot of Caesar - and indeed the first 15min or so - does a great job of showing so much, without needing any talking.The setting is still Muir Woods in San Francisco, but a lot has changed, with the apes now living peacefully and successfully in the forest and the humans a desperate mess in the city. I was amazed by how quickly I was cheering for the apes and, if not despising, then at least not caring for the humans at all! Caesar (Serkis), Koba (Kebbell), Blue Eyes (Thurston) & Maurice (Konoval) are the main stars here, with Dreyfus (Oldman), Malcolm (Clarke) & Ellie (Russell) merely making up the numbers. It's great to have Serkis back as Caesar, the \"king of the Apes\", with such nuanced and believable body language and facial expressions. Hard to believe he has gone from obscurity to the world's greatest motion-capture actor in just over 10 years! He's now responsible for three of the biggest characters of all time - Caesar, King Kong & Gollum - and he'll be in 'Star Wars: Episode VII' next year!So much happens in this film - it's tense and dramatic in parts, then a full blown war in others and a political tug-of-war in others, and often times both \"sides\" are trying hard to do right, but something prevents that. It's definitely not boring and flies along, looking great, and importantly too - sounding great, with a nice score underneath and throughout.Seeing as this is the seventh film in the franchise (no one counts Burton's 2001 remake, right?), it definitely leaves you wondering and anticipating what will happen in the third of the \"prequel trilogy\" and see how they link them to the original 60s/70s films. It will also be amazing if they have the third prequel made by 2016, considering how much CGI & motion-capture detail they will need for the epic 'conclusion'...",

            "content": "Dawn is a great film. It has good characters, great visual effects, a compelling plot, and some amazing cinematography.Go Watch it now. Enough said.Although it isn't perfect:My main (albeit minor) problem with Dawn is the human characters. Rise was great in that regard, since Caesar (I know it's spelled the other way, I like this spelling better) was the only ape until about half way through and the main focus of the film was the relationship between him and Franco's character. The advertising of Dawn lead on that Gary Oldman would have a much larger role as the primary antagonist, but he was a minor character at best (similar to the Bryan Cranston situation in Godzilla). The real antagonist is Koba, the scarred ape from the first movie. The advertising implied that Oldman started the war, but it was actually a coup by Koba. Even though the advertising was well put together, it is very misleading.The main humans are a father, stepmother and son, who go to the ape village to try and fix a nearby hydro-electric plant. While Koba is very species-ist against humans, Caesar is compassionate and allows them to work at the plant, which pisses off Koba, who then attempts to assassinate Caesar and start the coup. The problem is because the focus is primarily on the coup, there isn't enough characterization for the human characters, even the main ones.Technically speaking this film is amazing. It is one of the few obvious but well used bookends I've ever seen. Usually I don't notice bookends, but it was rather blatant in a good way. The shots are amazing, and I would like to reference two particular ones, being the 360 tank shot and the single take running and hiding shot. shots like that, especially ones in heavy-CGI films, are hard to do, so that's automatic points toward the director.It's good.

            "content": "Quickie Review:Caesar (Andy Serkis), the first of the genetically evolved apes leads a new society of his own kind. Now a decade after a deadly virus outbreak, the surviving humans threaten the existence of the apes' way of living. For mutual benefit of apes and humans a truce is struck, but there are those in both races that believe only one of them can be the dominant species of Earth. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (DotPotA) is one those movies that blends blockbuster action and intelligent drama almost perfectly. Technologically, this movie is truly revolutionary in capturing the characters behind the motion capture for the apes. Story telling wise, it is packed with great emotional depth, personality, and relevant social commentary. This is no doubt one of the best movies of this summer.Full Review:DotPotA was definitely one of my most anticipated movies of 2014, especially after the brilliance of Andy Serkis's performance as Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. I must say the movie delivered in all that I wanted. There few things that irked me, but in the end it did not deter me from my enjoyment of the movie.The crown jewel of DotPotA is of course Andy Serkis's Caesar. It is already known that this man is a genius when it comes to bringing emotion to a motion capture animated character, and he continues to give the incredible performance in this sequel. There are times you might even forget that Caesar is an ape, because of how subtle in his delivery and believable as a character he is (yes, a talking ape is believable). He brings this presence in every scene that demands your full attention. There is one new addition to the cast that took me by surprise, and easily is one of the highlights, that is Toby Kebbell as the ape Koba. An ape that has been mistreated by humans all his life, Koba only holds anger and hatred for all of human kind. And Kebbell does a great job of making us understand where the character is coming from, even when he goes about hatching devious and morally questionable plans. Let me remind you, both Kebbell and Serkis are achieving this with only sign language and the most primitive of spoken languages.I also like the world created, a decade after the viral outbreak. You get to see how the apes are evolving their society. They seems to have traditions, schools, and a real culture. So fans of the original Planet of the Apes, will enjoy seeing the genesis of the ape society. The city of San Francisco is now overgrown by nature, it seems like it must be deafening silence walking through those once bustling streets. Meantime the humans seem to have pulled together in these ruins and built a functioning community. The story was actually unpredictable. I thought I knew what to expect, how the plot will unfold, based on the trailers, but thankfully I was very wrong. This is the reason I won't go into the story but rest assured you will like what you see.Finally, this brings me to the things that I didn't like to see. So much care was put into the story telling and bringing out the personality of the digital apes, but I have to admit I was unimpressed by the effort put into the human cast. Sure they were functional, but considering how great every other aspect of the movie was, I was surprised by how stereotypical the human characters were. There is so much exposition given on each human, you know exactly what that person is going to do in the movie. Yes the story is unpredictable, but the actions of the humans weren't. It even got to the point where the cast was literally telling the \"a**hole\" character that he is the a**hole guy. Don't tell us, show us. Actions speak louder than words.In the end, I was able to ignore that one flaw and enjoy the movie as a whole. I am definitely going to watch this another time just to see Caesar be awesome. Overall I loved this movie, and you'd be missing out if you don't go watch it.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, an ultra mini-reviewBest: the sets and CGI of San Francisco post-outbreak are fantastic. It looks very realistic. The ape home in Muir woods is also a great set. The set designers and CGI graphic department are top candidates for the Texy Award in special effects this year. Good: The film makers got us to actually care about CGI apes, mostly. And the relationship between Caesar and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) is well portrayed. Okay: the CGI of the apes is pretty darn good, except for the child chimp. It looks too jumpy and cartoonish. The apes on horse looked great, however. The acting is fairly good as well. Keri Russell as Ellie, Malcolm's partner, didn't suck. I guess I should mention Gary Oldman. Done. Okay, but with issues: The basic story. The plot is okay, but it's a bit predictable. The story does bring up themes of trust, biology, evolution, anger and forgiveness in a mostly thoughtful way. Both the apes and humans have \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" in their midst. That is at once refreshing, there are no clearly good or evil groups as in Star Wars, but it is also a bit clich\u00e9. The dialogue is sometimes excellent, but it is also often unintentionally campy. Not good: The family scenes when Caesar's child is born is straight out of a Disney wildlife special. It's cloying and overly sentimental. The Music: In the beginning it is overly dramatic, as if the film itself wasn't dramatic enough. I was worried they had hired John Williams and his musical pomposity. The music got better, but it wasn't great. Rating: Matin\u00e9e. It was entertaining without too many faults, and what else can you expect from a Planet of the Ape film? Peace,Tex Shelters https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sHMCRaS3ao",

And what I like with these films is the the effects are here to help the story become real ,unlike with the Transformers in which the effects are in the spotlight and the story, characters, themes and good writing are left out, here is almost the reverse.To our main ape Ceasar, damn ,from pet to revolutionary to leader and father he has quit a life and in him we see the best of both world come together and make one of the best character of modern movie history. As for the humans ,you feel that they are desperate and in all honesty they lack the necessary skills in order to survive with out the comforts of heirs society before its collapse. Also we see that they have difficulty accepting that the apes next to them aren't just animals but intelligent beings with families of their own. From the apes point of view there are some of them who share ironically the same distrust with the human due to their previous treatment from them. In short who is to blame... both!In total a good and thoughtful look to the theme of distrust of \"the other\" and who our own faults blind us to see what is best for us.",

            "content": "The movie takes place ten years in the future. Humanity has suffered a severe pandemic of a virulent unspecified disease and only pockets of humans have survived. One such pocket is in the San Francisco area. Supplies and provisions are running scarce and the humans desperately need a viable energy source. Nearby is a hydroelectric dam that had provided energy, but it's been on the fritz since the scourge struck. The leader of the humans, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), has sent out a team headed by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) to go to the dam and see what it'll take to get it up and running again. We see the team earnestly trekking through thick underbrush and a forest of trees to reach the dam. But this forest is inhabited by other creatures too. Chief among these are the apes. And they don't like humans invading what they deem is their home ground.Many of the apes suffered at the hands of humans. Some in zoos; some the subjects of medical experimentation. The rest have picked up on the fear that humans engender. The leader of the apes is a chimpanzee named Caesar (Andy Serkis). Although we later learn that he was treated kindly by a human who was endeavoring to teach him language, he, like the rest of the apes, dislikes humans. He confronts the human party and tells them in no uncertain terms to stay out of ape territory and to go back where they came from.Dreyfus is upset by this news, for he knows they must find a viable energy source very soon or the human camp will collapse in chaos. They desperately need power to establish communication with other human groups who have managed to survive. He charges Malcolm to take his group back into the forest and effect a peace between humans and apes so they can reach the dam. Malcolm reaches an accord with Caesar and the team reaches the dam. The human team manages to get the dam running again, supplying San Francisco with needed hydroelectric power.However, reaching an accord with humans has stirred up trouble among the apes, and several of them protest. Among these is Koba (Toby Kebbell), a chimpanzee who bears the visible scars of incarceration and medical experimentation. When Caesar tries to quell their objections telling them the humans are trustworthy, Kobe screams at him, \"All humans lie.\" Meanwhile, back in the human stronghold in San Francisco Dreyfus believes it will be inevitable that the humans will have to fight the apes for hegemony. He opens the armories and humans begin training with firearms and weapons for the inevitable confrontation. Koba, always suspicious of humans, enters the human compound and playing the dumb ape before two humans, grabs one of their automatic rifles and shoots both of them. He then takes the rifle back to the ape camp. At first he intends to show Caesar the threat they're facing, but when Caesar seems too cuddly towards the humans, Koba shoots him, severely wounding him.A few of Caesar's followers remain loyal to him, but Koba stirs the apes up to attack the human stronghold. Malcolm is aghast. Warfare breaks out. Malcolm helps nurse Caesar back and Caesar realizes through Malcolm and his previous trainer that some humans are good. But Koba and his ape followers breach the human stronghold and it's war with no mercy. Dreyfus kills himself to bring down a whole tower in an attempt to disrupt the ape attack, and Caesar and Koba duke it out to the death with Caesar eventually winning the contest. At the end Caesar realizes that peace between the two species is doomed to failure because although some humans are good, like Malcolm, many more are like Dreyfus. The movie ends ominously with another war brewing.The costuming and special effects in this movie are first-rate. The apes are very convincing. It's good sci-fi, but it's not a true prequel to the original even though the title suggests otherwise. I saw the original Planet of the Apes when it came out back in 1968. In that movie three astronauts set out on a rescue mission to a distant planet. Their ship crash-lands, with one survivor, George Taylor (Charlton Heston). Taylor believes throughout almost the entire movie he is on that far-away planet, which mysteriously has a civilization consisting of speaking apes and savage humans devoid of language. No one who's seen the movie will ever forget one of its most salient lines when Taylor roars at a gorilla who's manhandling him, \"Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape.\" No one who's seen the movie will ever forget either the ending, when Taylor discovers the shocking truth that he was on Earth all along, albeit an Earth in the distant future.A slight quibble. Although in the original, the apes presumably achieved high intelligence through genetic mutation from exposure to radioactive fallout from the warfare set off by humans, in this movie it's unclear how the apes became as intelligent as they did.8/10",

Stereotypical rednecks abound, and terrible decisions by people who clearly were political and intelligent enough to get the whole thing organized. So bad, I fell between not caring about the human side, and actively being happy when they got murdered.Ape side of the story was solid, much better acted, and so on. Worked great. In between were the humans who did the primary interaction with the ape society. Sometimes shockingly stupid, but on average okay.Overall story is fine, but too much dumbness for physics and geography. Not sure why the citadel is fake, why they had to mess with where things are in city of SF, why they had to add a fake dam in the North Bay somewhere ill defined, etc. So much to work with there, they could have done better. Also: radios don't take that much power. Battery + solar would be enough to talk to those they do to set up the plot for the next movie, and gensets? Easy. Etc. for other solutions.

As a side note, I did get to see the trailer for The Guardians of the Galaxy in 3D and that one looks like it will be worth it. This film proved to communicate two distinct points; one, that there is always at least one bad seed in the bunch and two; dealing with kids can be a handful. Once again Andy Serkis (Caesar) made you believe that he was more than a man plugged into a green screen. The believability in his movement and expressions makes you realize that maybe he has attained a PhD in character acting. Brilliant! There are always a couple of folks that would rather fight than work for peace; and no, I'm not talking about the Republican Party (smile). Gary Oldman (Dreyfus), who did not really want the war in the beginning, had no issues jumping right in the middle of things when it did get started. Then there was Kirk Acevedo (Carver); he is the idiot that you will definitely love to hate. It is always the characters that have the most fear that seem to do most of the damage. Speaking of which, Toby Kebbell (Koba) had the task of filling that role on the opposite side of the house. I just didn't know what to say about this guy, but I was not surprised since he was the one with the most anger (and rightly so) from the last Planet of the Apes film. The humans that wondered into Ape territory, Jason Clark (Malcolm), Keri Russell (Elle) and their son Kodi Smit-McPhee (Alexander), quickly became the ambassadors for any good that was still left on the human side of the house. I thought that the film ran at a pretty steady pace and although there were no \"OMG\" moments, it was still a really good story. I do have to say that there may be \"OMG\" moments for younger viewer who did not grow up with the apes like folks from my generation did. Of course there will be another \"Planets\" film, which I am looking forward to just to see the evolution of Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) if nothing else. This is definitely a film worth seeing on the big screen, just save the 3D up charge.",

The plot line and script seemed very weak. Amazing that a film with Gary Oldman could have such mundane script writing. In fact that's what was so disappointing. At times it seems part Lion King, part Jurassic Park. While the scenery and the effects kept my interest, I just felt like I had seen parts of this movie before. The human characters were stereotypes that seem to be inserted into too many special effects blockbusters. With so much more quality programming available today (thanks Netflix), I expect more for an $11 movie ticket. Again, it's probably worth seeing just for the special effects, but it could have been so much better.",

The great thing about this movie is that it's not very clear who's good and who's bad. Both sides have good people and apes and bad people and apes. The documentary feel of this movie also helps instill emotions that would have otherwise not have been had this been filmed in a traditional way. See this is 3D if you can because the depth and detail make you feel you are right there with the humans fighting the war against the apes, and once you see the apes' side you feel as of you are right there quietly observing. When a human looks down the sight of his rifle, you feel you are that human about to shoot the ape. The great thing is that even if you haven't seen the previous installment \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\" you can still understand this perfectly. The first 20 minutes are apes doing sign language with subtitles on the bottom of the screen but you can still understand even without them. This film conveys human emotion really well, and the score is breathtaking. If the Academy doesn't nominate this for best score I will never forgive them. Listen to it on a surround sound system, and just let it sweep over you.\nGrade: A 10/10 5/5 stars",

It's not just every other action film out there which is a mass produced fast food product.

Andy Serkis is so good too. I would love to see him in a role without his prosthetic make-up or without him doing a voice over that shows his true talents. Any film I ever see with Andy Serkis where he's just Andy Serkis in the flesh never really shows his true talents such as films like this one or Lord of the Rings.

The action was well done too, but I had problems with it because it was too violent. Plus, the apes seemed to know how to handle guns a bit too well.The main problem I had with it that's just like a pet peeve, is that the apes were riding on horses. Out of nowhere they had horses at their beck and call. I just can't get over that.The facial expressions on the apes though, really conveyed their emotions. Even though they all generally look the same, with the expressions, you could tell what was going on behind each of them. For example with Caesar's son, you could really see the innocence on his face.Also, the relationships between the humans, apes, and human and ape had some good depth in it. It really conveyed how there should not be 'in- groups' and 'out-groups', because there will always be exceptions. That I give a thumbs up to.Lastly, the ending. It felt like it just cut short and ended with no point whatsoever. Like the whole movie was to prevent this one thing and then in the end, it's just like f- this.

            "content": "After the 2011 sci-fi action drama hit Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which is a reboot of the Planet of the Apes series, the story continues further in the sequel, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. This film is not just an epic story that's about the conflict between humans and apes, but it's also a gripping and emotional story that strongly reflects on our society and civilization as a whole.The first act of the film is simply remarkable. 10 years after the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes where Caesar freed the evolved apes, we get to see how the apes form a colony. They established a society, much like us, but living in peace and harmony. They went on hunting together and communicate with each other mostly with their hands (sign language and sounds). On the other hand, humans are almost completely wiped out by the ALZ-113 virus spread (Simian flu) and become a minority. But, everything starts to change, conflicts start to arise when the humans accidentally found the apes during a small expedition to start up an old hydroelectric dam to re-power the city with lights.The film shows how the two different cultures (man and ape) gradually clash...how a series of small acts of violence, betrayal of trust or personal acts of aggression can incite a catastrophic war in which neither side truly \"wins\". Rather than spoonfeeding the audience with heavy expositions, the film lets the characters draw you into the story, slowly in each moment until you begin to see the real world parallels that exist throughout the history of mankind.The CGI with motion capture in this film is superb and top-notch. The motion capture actors (Andy Serkis as Caesar, Toby Kebbell as Koba, Karin Konoval as Maurice, Nick Thurston as Blue Eyes, Doc Shaw as Ash, Terry Notary as Rocket) did a fantastic performance and managed to imbue the apes with various emotions: anger, fear, happiness, regret, heartbreak, sadness, frustration, hatred, love, etc. All of the apes look real and lifelike that you think of them as characters with distinctive personalities. These apes live, breathe, think and feel, just like us.Each main character in the film has strong, understandable reasoning for what they're doing. They all try to protect their own people, in their own way. Caesar, the wise ape leader who desires peace for his people, constantly tries to show strength in his leadership in order to achieve it. On the other hand, Malcolm, the human lead, tries to understand the apes, work out their differences without discrimination, in hopes that peace can be maintained as well. Koba, the film's antagonist, much like Caesar, is different compared with the rest of the apes...He has seen the worst side of humanity (unlike Caesar, who has seen the best side of humanity). Dreyfus, the human leader (his shout \"They're animals!\") and many of his peers show their discrimination and contempt for the apes due to their own personal reasons.The film tries to show different character perspectives from both sides, their own fears. The truth is no matter how hard both sides trying to justify it, they are both wrong. They believe what they're doing is ultimately right...for the safety of their own people. Despite their best intentions, these people and apes can be easily corrupted when they have a gun placed in their hands. It also shows how fear and hatred can lead anyone do the wrong things...how dictatorships are born, which echoes our actual history. It's a cynical depiction of nature of men through apes. It eerily shows the horrors of our society that exist even today.Throughout the film, Caesar constantly shows the best of humanity, but sadly his family of apes end up with the worst parts of human nature. By the end of the film, you can feel Caesar's regret, sadness and heartbreak...which is both moving and thought-provoking at the same time. In short, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is truly a cinematic masterpiece. It's a sequel with a strong purpose and socio-political message. This film reminds us why we go to the movies. It's certainly one of the best films of the year! Two thumbs-up! Very highly recommended.Rating: 9.5/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/07/",

            "content": "I recently saw \" Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" and was very admired by the movie storyline. I have enjoyed the first part of this film and it was excellently done. It is a movie that mixes action, comedy and sci-fi genres. The storyline picks up ten years after we saw Andy Serkis (Ceasar) and his fellow simian escapees seek refuge in the woods near San Francisco, and although the film's trailers already gave away pretty much everything that happened during that time. The apes in the movie have the best character to express their emotions.One of the main reasons that I really like this movie is that the actors contributed a very hard work and excellence job to represent the character that the movie needs. This movie has the best actors like Andy Serkis being the male lead who has a good passion to play and accomplish his part. Gary Oldman do not disappoint the way he plays his role. Keri Russell is magnificent and obviously beautiful throughout the film.Ten years after the worldwide deadly virus ALZ, the human civilization is completely destroyed. In San Francisco, (Andy Serkis)Caesar has become the leader of evolved apes and has a son, Nick Thurston(Blue Eyes). When Blue Eyes and his friend Ash stumble with a group of humans under the command of Malcolm and there is a friction between them. However, Caesar orders them to return to the derelict San Francisco City. Then he goes with a group of apes to tell them that they do not want war against the human, despite the hatred of his second in command (Toby Kebbell)Koba against humans. However Malcolm returns alone to the woods to meet Caesar to explain that they need to repair the hydroelectric dam to recover power in the city to save the survivors. Caesar accepts his argument and let him work with his family and a few technicians in the dam. Meanwhile the leader of the humans (Gary Oldman)Dreyfus decides to arm the survivors since he does not believe in the apes. However Koba wants the war against mankind and he provokes a situation of intolerance and consequent war.It looks amazing for starters, the cinematography and lighting are of great beauty and atmosphere and the scenery is equally striking. But the visual highlights, and most likely the best thing about the film, are the special effects for the apes, that they look so real and that it's hard to believe that computer did them and it is a testament to how good they look.I have no problem with the willing suspension of disbelief or escapism. A film doesn't have to make perfect sense in \"the real world\" for me to appreciate it. What i do have a huge problem with, however, is the lazy and cavalier way this movie utterly cuts loose from the premise so carefully set up in \"Rise\", and which i was intrigued to see explored further in this plot less, pointless travesty.There is also the misunderstandings and the distrust between the two sides, for while they are told to discard their weapons, there is one that always has to ignore the request due to the fear that by discarding their weapons they open themselves up to being attacked and being defenseless. Of course there are those who are always looking for a peaceful solution, trying to work together, however the peaceful ones are always being undermined by the war mongers, who for some reason seem to have the loudest voices. Despite the actors great performance the main storyline led to an epic fail which made the movie pointless, meaningless and horrible.Finally, the movie was done by the best actors who did their part in an outstanding way. The cinematography of the movie has used the latest technology and it also has a nice setting. Despite all this, the climax of the movie had a terrible way of resolving itself.The reviewer is an undergraduate student at China.

            "content": "If there would be one film to compare Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to, it would have to be The Dark Knight, in which it is a sequel to a fantastic film that manages to out-do the film it was proceeded by. As far as Summer Blockbusters go, this is one of the best I've seen in the last decade. It has the epic action set pieces and incredible CGI that we've come to expect, But also a great story, fantastic performances, and emotional depth that many of these Summer films are missing. A majority of the dialogue between the Apes are translated in English subtitles as they communicate with Sign-Language, which was a very ambitious move by the filmmakers as that element alone could easily turn-off some audiences. While there is no doubt the technical aspect of the film is highly impressive, it also succeeds outside of it as well in telling a survival story between the Apes and remaining Humans on earth. The film doesn't take any sides between the two species portraying them equally both having their protagonists and antagonists. We don't find ourselves rooting for either side, but rather sympathizing with both of them. Their some beautiful and incredibly touching moments of the Apes and Humans connecting with each other throughout the film, creating a great sense of dread and intensity considering the dramatic irony of the events to come later in the film. Despite these moments being the more quiet and peaceful in this extremely dark film, it makes them all the more tough to watch. The human characters in the film are portrayed very well. While the relationship between Ceaser and Jason Clarke's character isn't quite as strong as his and James Franco's character in the previous film, it doesn't hurt the connection between the two's relationship at all still hitting an emotional chord among the viewer. The action sequences are absolute breathtaking including a great battle sequence and fist-fight between two Ape characters during the climax. It's only a little over halfway through the year, but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best film I've seen so far this year. It's an intense, emotional, and thought-provoking films that is not only impressive on a technical level, but in film making generally.",

Little did I expect it to be such a bomb. At least for us, which is why we were so surprised. We had heard nothing but good things about this film and were sorry we missed it in the theaters. (We rarely go to theaters anymore)**Nothing but spoilers**The main tension of this film surrounds the surviving humans living in a decaying San Francisco wanting access to a long abandoned hydroelectric power facility in Marin (Ape) County. OK, for the sake of argument let's say there is such a thing; the humans are in San Francisco. Somehow this abandoned plant is still tapped into the power grid and can direct that power only to S.F.? Keep in mind that S.F. and the peninsula are a couple of Meccas for Solar Energy use. In 10 years has Solar power become nonviable? In another plot motivation - they need the power to call the outside world for help with their survival. They have running cars, there are no doubt generators that still function in hospitals or motor homes and such, why would they need the main power grid to run a radio? Plus it's been 10 years and NOW they want to contact 'the outside world'? (Obvious setup for the next film)Now here we have the desperate and electricity-ignorant humans crossing over to Marin (Ape) county (that has a wealth of solar powered homes that actually feed into the grid) to 'discover' a colony of smart apes is blocking their way to the abandoned power facility. The Apes warn them to stay away but ignorant 'power hungry' humans come anyway \u2013 war ensues. This is one of the main reasons it fell flat for us. The story was SO weak the only reason to watch the film comes down to seeing the amazing visual effects \u2013 and that's the reason I gave this 4 stars, the Ape work is outstanding. Other technical nits to pick (what the heck)1) How was it apes are such good shots when they first pick up the guns? And how is it the guns seem to have an inexhaustible supply of ammunition? 2) Why have the remaining humans congregated in unplugged S.F.? Marin (Ape) County (or Napa or Sonoma counties) would have made more sense as there are farms and beautiful solar powered homes and facilities. 3) Why did the survivors build the gated fortress? (if they didn't know of the mean apes) Was that to defend against bad humans? If so where are they? 4) How did the human survivors go 10 years and not know about the rising Ape population?5) How quickly do ape populations grow? Man there were a lot of them.6) (super nitpicking) The poster for the film is for the most part unrelated to the story. The apes are not in Oakland, the bay bridge (for all we know) is still intact. I really hope for the next film they manage to write a stronger story but I certainly won't waste my time seeing it in the theater.",

            "content": "The Lord of the Rings trilogy is remember fondly because 'Return of the King' was a cinematic masterpiece and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was great origins story. 'The Two Towers' does not get talked about as much as the first and the third, however it plays a supremely critical role of carrying the story forward, building upon it in a meaningful way and setting up the stage for a grand finale.That is exactly what 'Dawn of Apes' does as well.We were treated to a realistic and masterful adaptation of a classic sci-fi franchise in 'Rise of Apes'. 'Dawn of Apes' bears the brunt of improving upon that masterpiece easily. It tells a story, both emotional and exciting about how Caesar tries hard to make a home for his new colony of intelligent Apes, knowing full well that the cruel human race wont let them live by themselves so easily. But the undoing of peace is caused as often by enemies within as by external foes.This is a thrilling tale that begins with tolerance, attempts at peace, friendship, then betrayal from within and finally an unavoidable descent into war. It is aided along expertly by Andy Serkis who by now has to start getting at least Oscar Nominations for his work with motion capture. Because, while the special effects themselves are spectacular throughout the movie, it is ultimately Serkis's mastery of acting that breathe life into the Caesar and make us think we are witnessing a very very real character.The performances from the other Apes, primarily Toby Kebbel as Koba, and from Jason Clarke are themselves quite excellent and keep the audiences on-edge till the very end of the movie by truly immersing the audience into an intriguing narrative. Little would you expect to be so captivated in the drama by CGI Apes! The plot itself is so well crafted, it lends credence to the violent third act, which in another movie, would have been dismissed as meaningless exaggeration.A separate note on the CGI itself: it is so well done that you might as well believe they brought in real Apes, gave them some real brain-enhancing serum and they actually acted in front of the camera ! A true masterpiece of motion capture, led by the man himself, Andy Serkis. The other special effects used to make up a post-apocalyptic San Fransisco are equally worthy of mention. The entire world feels alive in a way that helps immerse the audience in the story.So, to sum it up, not only does this film move the Ape trilogy forward but also offers a complete stand-alone sci-fi experience. A worthy successor to a worthy reboot!",

You marvel at the cast of ape who in spite of being unable to speak and using made up sign language portray some real emotion.The film slowly builds and build from an average film in to a great one, then from a great film into the possibility of being the best film you have ever seen, then for no reason at all of the apes learn to speak English overnight, despite many of them never seeing a human before, all of them pick up guns, and use them without any training, even those who were against using weapons and killing, and every female character is written out of the script. Without giving much away the second half of the film was beyond terrible.It had so much potential to discuss war, crime, prisoners of war camps, the meaning of life, but instead rewrote the script and million times, until you feel like you are watching a different film. Frankly, between edits they actually forgot several of the main characters, I still cant figure out what happened to the token black guy, I cant believe that the actors put up with it.Honestly, go and watch this film but as soon as you see Koba the bullet-proof ape, impervious to fire, charge a tank on his horse, throw whatever is left of your popcorn on the floor and leave thinking that you have just missed the end of an amazing film.",

            "content": "In the first part of the movie we experience the life that the apes that got away from the humans created themselves. At the head of this clan is Caesar, whose story had been told in the previous film Rise of the Planet of the Apes. He presents himself as a very strong and charismatic leader. He reigns from love, is a wise leader and has the respect from his clan. But he's also troubled by the past, his family, the survival of his clan and by the humans who fear the apes. Only his lieutenant Koba seems not to be able to get over the hatred he developed for the humans because of what they did to him when he was still a lab-rat. But didn't Caesar himself feed this rage by giving Koba the approval to kill the doctor that tested on him, at the end of the Rise-movie? 'Ape not kill ape' he teaches his clan, but there he also states 'everything else is okay'. The rest of the movie is a result of the choices Caesar made, so long ago, when the humans re-appear in the lives of the apes.Andy Serkis once again get's into the motion capture suit, after Gollum and King Kong, and delivers a fantastic multi-layered Caesar. Gary Oldman creates a strong 'human who does anything to survive'. And when you get to see a bit more of his past, you understand him. He reigns from fear for the future and pain of what he lost and in his eyes the apes are the embodiment of that. Jason Clarke is the opposite; he wants to work together with Caesar and understands that these apes should be treated as equals, not as beasts.Although this movie is over 2 hours long, there is not a second I was not on the edge of my seat. O my, what a trip is this movie. From the very beginning, when you learn the way of the apes, you feel that this will change very soon. The expose of this movie is quite long but very well done; slowly, layer by layer it builds towards the re-appearing of the humans. It's a very clever and well-written script and the director didn't let himself be tempted to sensationalism. The result is a beautiful story with strong acting and fantastic cgi. Not for one moment I thought of the apes not being real. I simply loved it and am looking very much forward to the next part of Caesar's story.",

            "content": "The industry of filmaking is about making people like/dislike a true or sci fi movie. It all depends on how well is made, whether it has a good casting, a good story, the impression it gives, a good direction and the visual effects. If you add all these together, the result is a blockbuster movie like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Yes, this flick might be predictable at its worst, but so was the Lord of the Ring trilogy, the original Star Wars trilogy, Avatar and many others and nobody can deny these movies were successful. In Dawn you have a great human casting: Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and on the CGI; you have Caesar, Koba, Blue Eyes and Maurice. Then you have a great direction, the impression it gives on people is what really I like the most: First impression, it indeed makes you believe for a while that these CGI apes are real, the other impression is the message it gives people about the neverending conflicts on the real world, whether it is about money, race, political, religious or social issues, in this movie is about humans and animals. I was expecting to see this sequel ever since Rise of the Planet was released 3 years ago. I was blown away by the magic of the special effects mixing with humans and studios settings and the magic of thinking if at one time in the past, the Neandertals or the cro-magnons one million years ago clashed with the homo sapiens much alike it does in the apes franchise. If you thought that Caesar is a great CGI character, in this movie probably Koba was just as good, the facial expressions of these man made characters evokes real human emotions and I simply can't get enough of it. So, I already began my countdown to the release of the next ape's sequel, if everything is put together like the previous two, I will be writing a very similar review like this one.",

            "content": "Ever since I missed the opportunity to watch it in cinema, I have been waiting anxiously to watch it at home. I really liked the first part and this just goes above and beyond it. The movie starts off where the last part left off, we see how the ALZ113 drug that enhances Ape brain activity acts as a deadly virus for humans. Majority of humanity is wiped out due to it. 10 years later, Apes are living peacefully whereas humans are trying their best to survive. Ceaser, the leader of the Apes, might very well be one of the best CGI characters to ever put on film thanks to Andy Serkis amazing motion capture performance. Definitely deserves an Oscar for this. People involved in motion capture of other notable Ape characters like Koba also deserve a nod. They all had personalities, emotions and whatnot and I really felt involved with them even if most of their conversations consisted of sign language, now that takes some really hard work to accomplish. On the other side, we had human drama and characters. Where other movies focus more on humans, who usually are lame, this movie (Reboot franchise) greatly succeeds here. Not only does it know where to focus more (Apes), the human characters themselves are pretty good and any scenes with them doesn't feel like distraction. Other Directors should take notes from this movie. Leadership, family, loyalty, survival and love are heavily focused themes in the movie and we get to see a great execution of all of them under a mostly dark, gritty environment. Aside of all the drama and conflicts, we are treated to some great action scenes too. Beautifully shot and directed with some awesome continuous shots. All of it is complemented by a great soundtrack, which fits perfectly to the atmosphere of the movie.The CGI work is some of the best I have EVER SEEN. The Apes look more real than real apes if that makes sense. Another awesome movie of this year's amazing summer season. One of the best of the year so far. Definitely a MUST WATCH. Now I can't wait for the third part.8.8/10",

Rise, had the dynamic touch of emotion, action, humor, and intensity to make it a brilliant prequel. \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" is a more somber and serious movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.The movie starts a decade after the first one (prequel) with the apes in complete control. Caesar is the undisputed king of the apes and has started a family of his own. What little humans are left, attempt to cross into ape territory so that they can repair a dam and provide power for their community. As you can predict, this creates tension between the apes and humans, thus propelling the plot forward. That's all I'll say about the plot.The cinematography is outstanding. You can tell the director and DP worked hard to give the backdrop a very authentic feel. None of the backgrounds seem animated or green screened to me. Everything has a very gritty, real feel to it and that lends well to the story.Acting is amazing...by the apes... The motion capture REALLY shines in this movie. Animators did a tremendous job. I found myself thinking that the apes looked real after a while and had to remind myself that they were CGI. A movie definitely shouldn't be judged on its graphics, but on this occasion, it really is a spectacle. I haven't seen \"Transformers,\" yet, but I can almost guarantee that it's got nothing on this movie. Sorry, Mr. Bay.The plot is heavily ape focused and light on the human focus, but in my humble opinion that's how it should be...The whole story focuses around the de-humanization of the human race and the humanization of the simians.Although it's a somber movie, there are still plenty of laugh out loud moments throughout so be prepared to chuckle.Also I've seen people on this board criticizing the movie for lack of realism. It's a movie about TALKING APES for crying out loud...If you want a movie that's \"realistic\" go watch something else.This is a great summer blockbuster. Highly recommend checking it out! - JB",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is obviously the sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes and carries on the story from the first movie as you would expect. The premise is that the Saimian (I think thats how it's spelt)flu has wiped out a most of humanity. Though as you would expect the Apes led by Caesar have created their own home in a Californian Forest. Eventually they discover an isolated pocket of humans looking for aid who they see as a potential threat. The story essentially focuses on the relationship between the two species with both groups just looking to thrive and survive whilst demonstrating how similar they are to each other through various events in the movie.Now to quote another critic I follow, this movie was never afraid to take risks and always kept me guessing. The story originally didn't appeal to me when I heard about it but the movie works so hard at making you emotionally invested in it that it's just too hard to resist. It has it's share of light hearted moments delicately balanced with harrowing dramatic scenes that tug at your heart strings fused with some fight sequences that truly are a sight to behold. The entire cast of this movie were truly fantastic, the Apes look and act like Apes and the humans in the movie are interesting as opposed to just being there as in a lot of movies (i.e. Avatar). Seriously if Andy Serkis doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for this performance it will be the biggest awards farce since Ricky Gervais was allowed to host the Golden Globes. As you can expect the CGI is fantastic, when you see the Apes conveying emotion it looks so genuine it gives Kristen Stewart a run for her money. The only issue I really have with this movie is that at times it seemed that this movie lacked pace. Personally I didn't mind it too much but if your a expecting a purely testosterone fuelled action adventure then this movie isn't for you.Overall this movie excelled in near every way possible. The story was great, the ending was satisfying and perfectly set up the sequel without baiting it too much like in the X-men movies (I swear to god all they talk about is this upcoming war which whilst it seems cool begins to get repetitive and nauseating). The acting, cinematography, music and CGI were all terrific and managing to pull them all off together so well truly makes this movie worthwhile. In sequel terms this is so awesome in comparison that it rivals the Dark Knight trilogy I'm not even kidding. Now I can only hope that this movie has a sequel that does the previous two true justice.",

Caesar admits war is inevitable even though he has proved that human and ape can become friends.Human and Apes simply can't live peacefully together (Heck, even human themselves repeatedly fight each other).

He was broken by the world and thought he was helping the apes, then suddenly at the end he becomes simply insane and angry. The other \"villain\", Gary Oldman, is vastly underwritten - in fact the humans are in general. This film is less about a rift between humans and apes then it is about Caesar realizing apes aren't just inherently good because they're apes and not humans.

            "content": "In this review I will focus on what I thought was negative. Post 2000's, three directors made \"origins\" movies for the Planet of the Apes classic about the distant future of an Earth ruled by apes. Three movies about a self-evident prequel implied in the classic. The first by Tim Burton being a little bit more of a remake, the two others offering a plot that's just a total conversion of a zombie apocalypse plot.Because \"origin\" movies are a trend we have to get one for each classic, but at some point it has got to stop with the \"almost there\" episodes for Planet of the Apes and it's time to make a real story. I am an idiot to think that with \"Dawn\" in the title the movie would deliver something about a Planet of the Apes, but with a high rating of 8/10 on IMDb as of today I didn't expect Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to be just this: the dawn. Again. Second time, and without James Franco (Then what's the point?). \"Origins\" movies that redundantly repeat the implied preceding events from a cultural classic need to add something, and I don't think an uprising of very-humanly reasoning and communicating apes is an addition to what we already knew. We imagined it, we've seen it, maybe not in Full HD, but we definitely got it, only we come back for something new, which this movie doesn't really deliver.So what else didn't I like?The visual technology has maybe advanced a little bit, and the apes look even more real, and with human-like facial expressions (Serkis- like) and posture that the viewer can detect, you can tell the difference between the apes, you can start to learn their names as they are repeated several times, but here's the problem: by the time the Earth becomes the Planet of the Apes, the characters will change, be replaced and the public will not really remember because we're human and can't even distinguish separate species among the apes family to begin with. The bad guys. Unsurprisingly Gary Oldman had to be \"that guy\", you know, like Stephen Lang in Avatar. \"That guy\" who from the very first appearance represent the narrow minded, the conservative, the pepper in humanity. The guy who ruins a good thing by being too stereotypical. Whenever that happens in a movie, the real bad guys are the unimaginative writers. The good guys. What did they do again? They talked. Past the few scenes you might think they helped in the plot, but you'll actually have to thank chance and miracles that affected the turn over of events nearing the end. So basically they have good will, and they are supposed to balance out Gary Oldman's character's bad influence. Which by the way is just this, bad influence. His character did little to no damage in the events of the movie (in a city that was already in ruins), so he could have just kept quiet during the entire movie and it would have ended the same. The end. Remember Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes from 2001? It was barely an open ending, more like a big twist acting like a final question mark to mess with you, but it feels in no way like a \"to be continued.\" 13 years later, it was not continued, so I was right to assume so when I watched it in the theaters. Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes both end with an obvious \"to be continued...\" open ending. What's next? \"Just two more hours before the Planet of the Apes\"? \"Please Bear with Me, it's Almost the Planet of the Apes\"?Yes, it is visually entertaining, but if you're going to make sci- fi, write a story already!",

This is well proved with his earlier movies like Cloverfield (2008) and Let Me In (2010). And now he teams up with the writers of Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and brings this much improved and very successful sequel, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and it is magnificent. Right from the very beginning to the last scene this movie will take you through an emotional journey of man and ape alike and puts you in a tight spot as a human to determine the fate of things to come and decide write and wrong.Ten years after the pandemic decease humans are at the brink of extinction. The apes who have survived lives in the woods formed up massive crowds and a form of civilized living. But when the humans bring war to the Apes door step and Apes leadership is questioned, the battle rages.The very first thing that will blow the minds of the viewer is how insanely good looking this movie is. Thanks to the astounding works of the computer graphics and set creation the green rainy forest and the abandoned dying city both look absolutely realistic. And when the thought provoking plot is mixed up with ultra-realistic expressions of the apes this movie can sink right down in to you. And speaking of the plot it's carefully written to give the viewer a very good perception of things occurring and the flow is very good.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes as a story is completely far-fetched and it is amazing how it works this well. But if you're expecting more and more battles of large scale and less talk (or sigh language) then it might disappoint you a bit. But never forget that battles are never justifiable without the correct amount of emotions. And here the wait for the final battle is worth every bit of drama and once you realize that the world will never be the same again for Apes and Humans both there is slight hope left for both. And amazingly you might wish that apes will find their peace once again. Make your own judgment of who's to be blamed, us or our ancestors.",

A thrilling action film with an intelligent narrative and plenty of heart, it was an almost totally unexpected and very pleasant surprise. For 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes', director Matt Reeves continues the story where Wyatt left off, and Reeves has satisfyingly made a sequel of such impressive quality that is at least the equal of its predecessor and in many aspects surpasses it.The story takes place a decade since Caesar led his fellow apes to begin a new life away from captivity in the forests beyond San Francisco. The group has expanded and thrived and constructed a sort of ape city among the trees. Here, Caesar has continued to command the loyalty of his fellow simians and remains chief, while he now also has a young family of his own to protect. Back in San Francisco, many years have now passed since a deadly virus born from the gaseous form of the drug ALZ-113 (referred to as 'Simian flu') has all but wiped out the human race, though a pocket of survivors exhibiting a genetic resistance remains in the city. The apes and humans have thus been segregated until a chance meeting with a small band of human explorers reunites them once more, bringing back some old memories for Caesar while igniting tensions between the two groups that threatens to boil over into all-out war and a battle for evolutionary superiority.The film plays on the natural mistrust that the apes have of the humans, and vice versa. While much of the fun of 'Rise' was in watching Caesar's ascension to power as a Spartacus-style leader of his fellow down-trodden apes, 'Dawn' focuses on Caesar's struggle to maintain a fragile peace between his own kind and the race he was brought up amongst. Chief antagonist is Koba, Caesar's general and one time laboratory bonobo whose innate hatred of the human race threatens to destroy all that Caesar has battled to build. In another motion-capture acting tour de force, the outstanding Andy Serkis is again the subject for Caesar's movements and expressions and gives an astonishingly powerful performance that is full of presence, depth and charisma. Caesar has all the makings of a classic film character.Human performances again mostly take a back seat to Caesar's ongoing struggles. Gary Oldman is great as always but is a little underused as the embattled leader of a human fraction living within a guarded tower amongst the ruins of San Francisco, but Jason Clarke has plenty to do as Malcolm, the lead of a small group of engineers that take up a role in diplomacy and begin to form a strong bond with Caesar.The exhilarating action scenes and set pieces are of a grander scale than in 'Rise' and with the use of some truly spectacular digital effects that are as realistic as any you will see, makes for an absorbing visual feast. But the finest achievements of the film lie in it's thoughtful, emotional core, that cleverly aligns our sympathies with both apes and humans and makes for a moving and thoroughly rewarding experience that is far removed from the one-dimensionality of today's brainless blockbusters. Never mind that 'Dawn' heads for a not entirely unpredictable conclusion, this is a quite beautiful film that has clearly been crafted with great care and intelligence. A fabulous achievement.",

Meanwhile, the humans are struggling to survive as they have become dispersed due to the effects of the virus that was released in Rise. When a group of survivors from the San Fransisco area run into two apes, the plot will be set in motion as these two factions will collide.I gotta say that after the good work done by Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, I was hoping for a sequel to up the ante and present me with even bigger stakes. Not only did Dawn do that, but also served up a kind of character depth one doesn't see too much in a summer blockbuster. We all know of Andy Serkis's legacy in motion capture performances and he once again delivers as Caeser, the ape leader who must deal with the human issue, while also having to prevent a rebellion within his own ranks. This bad seed among Caeser and his apes is Koba, an ape who seeks revenge given the abuse he suffered at the hands of humans. Toby Kebell gives the surprise performance in the movie as Koba turns from a trusted right hand adviser to a treacherous villain. The humans take a back seat in terms of plot importance, as should be expected from a movie with Apes in the title. Still their secondary role is effective and names such as Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and Gary Oldman give the performances that were asked of them.Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is unlike any movie being released nowadays.

Now I finally get to see what has become of Ceaser and his tribe, and boy did I. Dawn starts off showing us an average day in this society the apes have built up in the last 10 years; and that just to start off was fascinating, the shots you see, the feel of it all is just unlike anything you've ever seen. Soon after you start getting the plot, the humans need to get to a big damn to restore power but the forest of the apes blocks their way. Now through the various interactions between apes and humans you are holding your breath just hoping for both their sakes every single meeting between them goes well, you can feel the power of such a sight of these apes and how scary they must be; even within the ape tribe itself you see trust issues start with one of the apes - the incredibly freaky-looking Koba. You can also see from the humans apocalyptic camp how they're getting so desperate you know that the climax isn't going to be nice. Now with this story you may start predicting certain events but after jut a few more scenes you realise the plot is going a completely different way, there were most definitely a few surprises in there for me, so as whole, the storyline was fantastic. The actors themselves, well, who can fault Andy Serkis, the king of motion-capture does an excellent job, I love how realistic this apes moved and look, just great; the humans although weren't bad actors I just wasn't as involved in their lives as I was the apes, I had been with Ceaser longer so these new people we had to like just were OK, not bad but nothing special. Of course I have to touch on the special effects, the CGI in this movie was out of this world, some of the things you see I probably couldn't distinguish between physical prosthetics. The feel and tone of this film is so unique you come out the cinema thinking 'wow'. The only critique I have is probably that there are one or two clich\u00e9 events or lines of dialogue but in the end Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was Awesomeness.",

            "content": "This is a visually compelling movie which attempts to illustrate how much easier it is to start a war than keep a peace. Unfortunately, the script seems to have been written by a bright 5th grader with no idea of how anything works. Every scene has a couple logical or continuity problems which are annoying if you know anything about power grids, power plants, tunnels and explosives, antibiotics, the climate of California, the distribution of power plants in California or the flora and fauna of Muir Woods. The only thing to eat there for apes would be banana slugs, and not once do they show the inside of one of those sequoias, which is just a shame. Ironically, the film makers have decided not to give the apes clothes, making them into Ken dolls instead, but even an ape is going to want a jacket in Muir woods on a rainy day. No primate, human or otherwise, is going to stay in that part of the bay area without ocean trade. Of course, San Jose wouldn't look very compelling covered with ivy and poison oak, but at least it has arable land and the sun shines. However, many of the negative reviews forget that in this series the intelligence of the apes is not evolutionary, but comes from the deus ex machina of a magic virus that makes you smart, but then kills you if you are human, but not if you are an ape. For this film, this is logical consistency.More annoying are the uncharacteristic things done by people and apes just to move the plot forward and create formulaic dramatic situations. We know so much about ape psychology that the idea that more than a dozen chimps could live together peaceably is nonsense. \"Ape no kill other ape\"? Not likely. Also, if you met a talking ape, wouldn't you try to talk to it? And not once does anyone point out that humans are apes. At least the intellectual is still an orangutan. Gary Oldmans character is better drawn than the reviews would make you think and there are a couple cute scenes, but mostly you have to suppress the thought, \"Why are they doing that?\".",

I don't think there is any but it is a very good portrayal of two different societies. The savages and the domestic switch sides in this movie.So is this a movie about humans fighting against monkeys or monkeys fighting against human? Both.

            "content": "When was the last time you were watching a big budget summer blockbuster and in the first fifteen minutes, the characters and their relationships were established without any spoken dialogue, all while keeping your interest? \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" had the difficult task of telling a serious, live action, relatable, human story, despite most of its main characters being apes. This was a technical challenge because they needed to use motion capture technology to transform tons of human actors into realistic looking apes with believable movements, yet the performances of the actors playing the apes and the CGI are both incredibly natural most of the time. This was a narrative challenge because they needed to find out the best way to communicate the thoughts of the apes, yet they managed to make their actions speak for them and their few words hold so much more weight. This was a financial challenge because of the high budget needed to make the film and the general publics willingness to read subtitles, yet they managed to keep them engaged.Again and again, Matt Reeves continued to exceed my expectations with this film, not only making me genuinely care about a bunch of apes, but by telling a smart allegorical tale about racism, war, and technology's role in humanity. You don't have to see the first film in order to see this one, since all the exposition you need is cut together in a clever montage showing the downfall of humanity and the rise of the apes, allowing this film to stand on its own. After humanity began to fall from the virus, the apes became independent in the forest and began living creating their own civilization, while, unbeknownst to them, a group of immune humans lives near by, trying to restore their civilization by holding the belief that electricity will help them get back to the place they were before. When the last resort to power their city is by using water, they are forced to come into contact with the apes that are living on the dam, and tensions begin to arise.The visceral, emotional climax of this film is incredibly shot, with many long tracking or panning shots showing the all out pandemonium happening around them, as well as an intense, hand to hand fight scene, all done with almost entirely CGI characters.The film delves surprisingly deep into the origins and hypocrisy of war, showing how preconceived notions start fear and hostility, which fosters more fear and hostility, which blinds one side from the good people in the opposing group, and blinds one group from the bad people in their own group. It also shows how even the possession of weapons just causes more paranoia, causing the other group to feel the need to protect themselves with weapons, pulling both groups further and further apart from each other, despite how similar they may be.",

I honestly believed it would not be as good as Rise of the Planet of the Apes, going of sequels stereo types, but it surpassed that by far! The whole film is moving, inspirational and intriguing. Everything I look for to be able to enjoy a film and to say I enjoyed this would be an understatement. There is a mixture of sad scenes, artistic scenes and uplifting ones. There wasn't one moment I was bored or looking away from the screen. The opening scene helped with this as it sums up the film completely and puts it in motion.When the film was over, I was gutted and would have happily watched it again! As soon as I got home, I watched clips of my favourite scenes (MANY) and the making of the film. This, however, was unintentional seeming as this isn't the sort of thing I am normally in to but just like the film, I couldn't stop watching them... I was amazed. Now, I couldn't write a review of the film without mentioning the superb performances from Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbel. They were brilliant and without them, the film wouldn't have been as exceptional! I really do urge you to go and see this film as no matter what, you will enjoy it. Why do you think it got straight to the 159th best film ever and an 8.3 ranking?",

            "content": "-Dawn of Planet of the Apes is the highly anticipated sequel for the prequel Rise of Planet of the Apes. And since it is not called \"Dawn of Planet of the Human\" we know exactly how it goes down.-By the way the film was Great!! It was the perfect runtime with a great pace, great characters, and an emotional story.-The plot is executed excellently! Seeing good characters that are fighting for the same thing and the bad characters fighting for the same thing as well is really captivating. Also in this, the apes are totally in charge, so it is fun to see how that plays out too. One of the few drawbacks in the film is that not much gets accomplished in the film. I could sum it up pretty easily, but I won't spoil it because it rocks.-The cast was great. Gary Oldman and that other guy were both great and deep characters. Andy Serkis did Oscar well! He is as good as Caesar as he is Gollum. Yeah.-The music was very good. Michael Giacchino combined the emotional elements of Rise of Planet of The Apes with the ape-like feel of Jerry Goldsmith's original Planet of the Apes score. One of the other drawbacks is that the Goldsmith style of ape music is almost ambient music instead of captivating pieces.-THE EFFECTS WERE FLAWLESS. As good as Avatar. I kid you not, there were several shots that I literally thought (and think) were real apes. This film WILL get an Oscar not for CGI, if not a win! -Content was not too bad. There was some violence, some intense images, and some language which included like 2 S-words and one F-word. Not toooo bad, but not a \"Hey, take your kids to see apes wipe out mankind! :D\" kinda film.-That said, Dawn of Planet of The Apes is thrilling, and 2 hours of character, amazing effects, and a story that won't really let you go until the end. I would say Dawn of Planet of The Apes is easily worth seeing in theaters! (Note: You really need to see Rise of Planet of the Apes first)",

            "content": "10 years after the end of \"Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes,\" Simian Flu has killed 99.8% of the humans, putting people in a new Dark Age. As the humans struggle to survive, apes, under the leadership of Caesar (played by Andy Serkis), thrive in the new world order. It is the \"Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes.\" It is remarkable to see what the apes have created in 10 years: a home within a forest; a school that teaches young apes sign language; Caesar having the ability to speak; and a set of laws that apes have given themselves, such as \"ape not kill ape.\"For a decade, Serkis and his group of hundreds of evolving apes haven't had contact with humans, assuming all people have died. This assumption is quickly proved wrong when two apes run into a small group of humans, resulting in an injury to an ape and fueling more distrust between the two species. But a human, played by Jason Clarke, makes a plea to Serkis to allow the humans to work in ape territory so that the humans can get back electric power and have some semblance of civilization back.After discussing the delicate situation with his inner circle of apes, Serkis decides to help the humans instead of making war with them. Serkis not only hopes of a peaceful future with the humans, he's also aware that the humans still have guns; and war with the humans can mean total destruction for the apes. Unfortunately, his right-hand-ape, Koba, is not of the same mindset; and Koba's hatred for all humans will make him do whatever it takes to destroy the fragile peace so that an all out war against the human survivors will be triggered.My most memorable, movie moment of \"Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes\" is the scene immediately before Koba leads an attack against the human city. The humans, alerted to the impending assault, have manned their towers and gates, heavily armed with automatic rifles, machine-guns, and grenade launchers. They wait and stare at the open road that leads to their city. It is quiet, but it is only the calm before the storm. Beyond where the humans' lights can reach, the sounds of hundreds of apes screaming slowly becomes audible.I have seen every \"Planet Of The Apes\" movie, and this is the best of them. From the beginning, I was amazed. Yes, \"Dawn\u0085\" doesn't have the \"holy s*#t\" surprise ending of the first movie (the 1968 version, not the reboot), but it does rival the first movie's social commentaries; and of course, it crushes the first movie when it comes to action and special effects.One final thought: watch and listen carefully during the scene when the apes were discussing what they should do with the newly discovered humans. I immediately thought that this probably played out hundreds of years ago when Native Americans were discussing what to do with the newly discovered white settlers on their lands.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",

This one was light on the action and focused more on drama with conflicts igniting within the human world as well as the ape world. Basically it was about united we stand, divided we fall, for both sides. With that in mind I think the more advanced the apes get in the films the more like humans they become, and not in a good way and I think that is what Ceasar, the leader of the apes, is going to start realizing. I think this film is just setting the stage for a third installment of the new \"Planet of the Apes\" motif anyway. So if there is another installment of the \"Planet of the Apes\" theme, hopefully there will be lots of action in it, but like I said before, this is a good film it just wasn't as exhilarating as the first.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the ApesDirected by Matt Reeves Starring: Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, and Toby KebbellHollywood is often criticized for making bad sequels to movies. I do not believe this statement because those who think this are not \"seeing\" the good ones. Take Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the sequel to the \"Planet of the Apes\" reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which caught everybody off guard back in 2011. Fans of the old Planet of the Apes movies thought it was going to be nonsense because the Apes were special effects and not Kim Hunter in 5 pounds of ape make-up. What the average moviegoer did not know at the time was that Andy Serkis was in the movie. With roles like that of Gollum, King Kong, Ape (Caesar), and Godzilla, actor Andy Serkis has brought many miraculous creatures to life on the big-screen through motion and performance capture technology. Now he plays ape Caesar once more, giving a transcending performance that will make you believe these were real apes! Dawn takes place ten years after Rise where a virus has killed a vast majority of the human population, leaving only a few groups of survivors around the world. The group of focus here is outside of New York City and is being led by a man named Dreyfus (played by an always good Gary Oldman), who has come across a big dilemma. His camp needs fuel and power and the only solution lies at a damn where another camp is, only this one is run by Apes. Caesar and the apes have created a bit of a society for themselves over the past decade and do not want to risk losing everything they've fought so hard for. However, war between the Apes and Humans is inevitable and one side has to give. \u200bMatt Reeves (Cloverfield) directs this Blockbuster-film spectacularly to the last frame. It is without a doubt his best work and will probably open many doors for him as a director in the future. The greatest compliment you can give to a film with a lot of visual effects is not even noticing them. The visual effects in this film look so real and are the best I have seen since the blue people in Avatar. I believed all of these apes were real and was engaged every second they were on screen. The character Caesar is one of the most interesting characters so far in 2014. Even when he is not on screen you are wondering where he is and what he is up to. Though there are many terrific aspects of this film there are a few problems. Other than Caesar, all of the characters are one-dimensional \"what you see is what you get\" characters. The acting is on point all around, but these characters were poorly written and it is a shame because there were signs of some interesting back-stories for a few of them. There are also a few logic problems with the film, which may sound funny because it's a movie with talking Apes on Horse, but I cannot get into these issues without spoiling some rather huge plot points. Overall, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a really fun time. It is not only a great movie, but also a great sequel!",

The audience will be left to wonder the entire movie on whether they are actually using real apes and gorillas or they are all CGI. This is truly an amazing special effect.From the scripting to the storyline, it's just flawless. Every element of the movie is consistent. Every interaction among apes, among humans, and between humans an apes, are just so natural as if there were really a connection between apes and humans. Every natural phenomenon, social interaction, and cause-and-effect relationship between all parts of the movie is just perfect.To put in analogy, consider Transformer. It's always difficult to accept the fact that the super advance robotic sentient has a terrible targeting system. And their sophisticated ability to transform is just ruined by the producer when they can't even transform into a powerful weapon which can destroy their enemy. For instance, why would they use old-fashion bullets instead of electrically charged lasers or EMP burst which can cripple their enemy completely?In short it is a terrible movie in terms of consistency and integrity. But Planet of the Apes is entirely the opposite.The director did a pretty marvelous job in keeping the emotion and tension between the human colony and ape colony.

            "content": "If anything, marvel at the xylophone in the score.Because Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is merely 'great enough.'This is a movie for those who like the first. It's conceivably enjoyable for the uninitiated, but I don't advise it.The film opens with credits akin to Edge of Tomorrow; a smattering of newscasters and politicians reporting on the spreading influence.The visual images are grafted onto an international map in which an infection travels like a web. The dreaded lines arc from to dot to dot, like the mice in The Rescuers hopping a seagull from New York to New Orleans. Coincidentally enough, much of Dawn is shot in the same Louisiana city.And I'm not sure if the rest of you know, but they're letting broads into the screen writing business now. This is the second movie I've seen lately with a female screenwriter (Amanda Silver). The other, Jane Goldman, is credited as a writer on X-Men: Days of Future Past.Look fellas, if we don't do something, pretty soon the Hollywood sign'll be painted pink!Anyway. The difficult thing about science fiction is the viewer's required to buy in. Whatever universe the filmmakers create, no matter how fantastic, the world must follow the rhythms of reality.If genetically evolved apes fight their way free of society's clutches, the battle will be considerably more horrific than what occurs in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.I don't delight in dismembered limbs, but the lack of realistic action creates an inescapable awareness. One can't help but realize the humans are ethereally cushioned from agony.I like the first movie, but I didn't love it like some people. The main problem is the rating. PG-13 movies are usually four-quadrant films: Enjoyable by men, women, the young and the old. Thereby maximizing profit.So although the Dawn is better than the Rise, I'm not all that excited about Planet of the Apes.It works because it's quality filmmaking. The camera-work is excellent. There are several long takes, including one on top of a tank. The lens does two complete turns for a double panorama shot on a set full of teeming apes.I'm not sure if they're extras or just CGI, because the effects are strong. Ironically enough, the only time I noticed a slip is when an ape is carrying a human, and the flailing legs are clearly animated.Plus, the writing's strong\u0085for PG-13.The dichotomies drawn between apes and humanity are well-crafted. Each individual character (be it simian or homo sapiens) is well-rounded, independently recognizable and compellingly motivated.The stakes are high, the settings are elaborate and all the right themes are explored.The climax leads me to believe this isn't the last we'll see of the Planet of the Apes. Perhaps there's even a plan for quadrilogy.But who knows if we'll still be interested after number three?Be that as it may, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is great. That's all.Catch it in the theater if you've got an interest. You'll like it.Just don't wait for anything after the credits. Apart from a quote that says the production supported 15,000 jobs (which isn't the clearest statistic) there's just more ape noise.And you'll get plenty of that along the way.",

The fact that audience members can so easily relate to and thereby care deeply for our primate pals is of course due to the stunning motion capture CGI technology on show, such a method that is currently making huge strides in redefining the fantasy and sci-fie genre. It is because of this technological magic that our lead protagonist Caesar (played by Andy Serkis, mesmerizing) alongside other lead Apes look and feel so real.DOTPOTA is set some time in the fairly near future after ROTPOTA. Still in San Francisco, a group of Apes led by Caesar have made camp up in the hills, with small groups of humans still left scattered around the earth after the virus went viral. With Caesar striving for peace between humans and apes, things turn sour when another ape (Koba, genuinely frightening) has doubts about Caesar's leadership skills and contrasting feelings about the presence of humans near camp.A tad too long, the film can feel repetitive at times during the third act, with battle sequences seeming to occupy the majority of screen time and the lack of human interaction forcing too much ape talk which can be a tire to keep up with. However this is just nit-picking at what is probably one of the best movies so far this year, possibly the best in it's field. Right from the opening close-up of Caesar's war-painted face to the concluding set piece, it never ceases to amaze viewers, a compliment largely due to the masterfully crafted scripting and a plot that is constantly second guessing clich\u00e9 expectations.In conclusion Dawn of the Planet of the Apes offers a huge step up from an already fantastic reboot, even if the editing department could have done a slightly better job.

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes stars Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, Gary Oldman, and Toby Kebbell in a sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes that manages to make an improvement over the predecessor. Although it did not surpass my expectations for a good sequel, the action and character development kept me entertained throughout the film to leave a sense of satisfaction. However, like a lot of other blockbusters that came out in 2014, the hype for this film went way overboard. It is simply a good film, but nothing great or mind-blowing to write home about.First of all, the one thing that keeps this sequel from being exceptional is the average story. The story-line in this movie is really nothing to rave about as it is easy to predict where certain events are going to happen. Basically, when you've got a simple plot that doesn't add anything new or groundbreaking in terms of storytelling, it tends to bring the quality of the film down a notch. Also, certain plot holes come about that are never really answered throughout the story as well as the obvious use of exposition scattered within the dialogue.In terms of interesting characters, the main star of this blockbuster is the leader of these intelligent, ambitious apes, Caesar. His character has grown a significance of maturity since Rise and it definitely shows thanks once again to the astounding motion capture performance from Andy Serkis. Toby Kebbell's performance as Caesar's 2nd in command, Koba, is also a big standout showcasing his character's lust for vengeance against the humans. Pretty much, the apes are the stars of Dawn while the human characters are pushed to the side with the standout being Jason Clarke's Malcolm as the main human protagonist trying to push for peace.The one thing in this action-packed blockbuster that really deserves some praise is within the visual effects and cinematography. The top-notch C.G.I. effects from WETA are nothing short of excellence showing the fierce nature of the all the apes to life. On the other hand, the cinematography brings out the dark, dreary environment of an apocalyptic San Francisco. After seeing Dawn of the Sequel of the Reboot for the 2nd time, I've to the realization that this is just another typical summer blockbuster with a story that's told several times before. Despite having impressive visuals and two strong motion capture performances from Serkis and Kebbell, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes remains to be another over-hyped sequel that simply good, but not great. I still give this film a recommendation if you are so curious to check it out, but don't expect anything groundbreaking in return. Overall, I give this a 7 out of 10.",

I'm sure it will lead to more sequels like the original set of Ape films. If you haven't seen Rise of The Planet of The Apes, I highly suggest watching that one first. That one is better than this one and there are several references back to that film in this one. Go see it, it is a long film, and pay good attention while you are watching it. I saw it in 3d but that is not necessary at all. You will enjoy the amazing characters done in total CGI special effects. That is the best part of it.",

I have big big expectations and I hope it will deliver! Especially, since it has even better rating than a previous part, which I loved! Can't wait to see this post apocalyptic world! Let's go!2 minutes - it looks like they are explaining how it all started, so if you haven't seen the first part you will have a background anyways. It's worth to watch it though.13 minutes - yea, watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) first if you can, it looks like it is a proper sequel (same characters, not so long after the previous movie etc.), even though it was made by different director. It also feels much slower... at least for now.17 minutes - hooray! Gordon... I mean Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg... eh no, Stansfield! Damn it! I mean Gary Oldman! I love this guy! I hope it will be one of the main characters and they will show him a lot! There is also Miguel Alvarez from the Oz series :) 23 minutes - hahaha Gary already delivering his greatness + the movie really starts being interesting! 40 minutes - it is amazing how apes communicate and how it evolves 1h 20minutes - now that is brutal as hell... + the apes supposed to be smart... It looks like their intelligence boost slowed down considerably...1h 38minutes - you can't tell if something is CGI or not anymore... This movie is so well made, hats down...1h 50minutes - a little bit too typical Hollywood ending for my taste...If I had to pick which one is better, I would choose Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011). Don't get me wrong, the both movies are great but I was hoping for a little more from this one...tgchan's rating : 7.5 /10",

            "content": "To make a film full of apes running around is simple. To make it interesting; well, that's a challenge. To make it compelling and stunning and top-quality; well, that's worth recognizing.Where \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" left us to pick up is an inhospitable earth, where almost every human has been whipped out from the deadly virus. What's left is a small habitant where leftovers of resources keep the last survivors alive. During that time, not very far away in the woods, we get to know the encampment of the apes. Time is spent on understanding the culture, feelings and order within their world. Ceasar, the leader is presented as a appreciable human-thinking ape: with morals and fairness... apparently things he learned from his human mentor-father.But Ceasar seems the only one to believe in humans. His struggles of passing along his wisdom is mostly failing. The main reason happens to be the fact that the other apes do not share experiences of happiness, joy and love from the humans. They mostly remember the torture and humiliation the humans put them through. And when the time comes for them to actually encounter, a superior ape named Koba will find a way to turn their will against them. \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" benefits from your low expectations. Sure, the previous 1st installment was decent, but how much can you really wait for in this type of film? Still, creating a dark and realistic world was surprisingly fun and sensible. What also counts as an achievement is the convenient and without-realizing-it way you find yourself feeling for the apes as much as the humans. And what a guilty pleasure was it to stare and follow Andy Serkis as Ceasar (wrongdoing his absence from Oscars, personal opinion, although understandable reason that he had CGI help).The way the family relationships of apes are developed is excellently put. And all situations involving them are portrayed with honesty and common sense. In simple words, the director does well by not thinking \"let's make it cool\" all the time but prefers to ask himself \"how would it happen if it would be real?\". That results in our advantage: the silly and campy funniness from the previous generations movies of the \"Planet of the Apes\" movies is gone. The franchise suffered enough from deadly hilarious and wacky pictures. Forget all that; this is serious film-making and definitely worth-viewing.",

            "content": "Maybe contains very minor spoiler personally I feel like these films are such a shame because really the concept of a cross over period between a virus wiping out humans and apes taking over as the dominant species on earth could have made such a great film in my opinion. But everything is really unrealistic and badly done in my opinion. from the idea that there is some magical chemical which can give apes human-like intelligence (even though their brains are 3x smaller than ours, they are missing important intelligence genes and brain areas etc), to the idea that an apes vocal cords could allow it to speak in English just like a human but in a slightly gruff voice, to the unrealistic CGI, the way these apes behave, move etc and are able to use things with human like dexterity. The apes are basically just coming across as slightly more dumb/savage humans in suits cognitively, and unrealistic CGI things in how they move. And It is really such a shame. The film basically makes no sense when it could instead have been a sci-fi film which was plausible and reailstic. The film is similarly full of silly unrealistic scenarios like.. why didn't the guys in the tank have the hatch closed as opposed to driving into a pile of apes and allowing them to all go inside the tank and kill the tank crew... really any reason to drive into a huge pile of apes in a tank with the hatch open instead of closing it? In my opinion what should have happened in these films is the virus should have wiped out the majority of humanity and maybe affected surviving humans cognitively in some way, causing surviving humans to regress a bit and go back to a hunter gatherer lifestyle, go forwards a few million years and now some apes have evolved more intelligence and are the dominant species and are enslaving humans. Make the apes distinctly different to humans, give them weapons and technology, homes etc befitting apes not humans, bear in mind their own natural habitats, their physicality (e.g. less dexterity and control over strength, an ape probably would find it very difficult to pull a gun trigger well etc let alone aim one, an ape still wouldn't be able to make the same noises as humans but have their own language etc) make them distinctly different from humans not just coming across as slightly more savage and primitive humans.The films could have been good and interesting sci-fi, but ended up being too unbelievable, unrealistic and too much bad CGI in my opinion. Also no decent character development or storyline really or anything. Basically the story is a group of humans and a group of apes end up fighting and thats it.",

In Caesar, you have a complex being full of depth who simply wants to exist in peace and provide for his loved ones and community. But as history has shown, life is often one tragic story full of violence, deception, and sorrow. Yet hope, if truly sought and fought for, can also exists behind all that shadow and horror. As Caesar so profoundly put it \"ape started war, but human don't forget\" and these words could not be any more valid, especially during these dark times. With all their complexities, humans still do remain the most violent and treacherous of beasts. Go see DoTPoTA. You will not regret it.",

I reminded myself of how Rise of the planet of the apes brought us the real beginnings, of Ceasar and his followers, of the James Franco character and how the virus began. Rise was a real masterpiece in the making, great story, staggering effects.Dawn takes this to a whole new level, heart, depth, unbelievably good special effectsThe time and effort spent on getting San Francisco, the red wood forest, the country to look ravaged, deteriorated and completely desolate over its time span is eerie...the effects team deserve huge credit for this...not a single pixel is ignored.The human characters are well brought together, its just a shame that the plot is too intense to allow for more character development in some of the people....that is my only negative to this film.I just sat back and completely revelled in the wizardry and wonder of the effects, the action....the apes. You can easily forget that the apes are CGI, they are THAT good...If you thought Rise was good in the CGI department - Dawn simply Rises...and rises again!!Koba and all the ape characters, Maurice, Bright eyes and the others are wonderful on screen, their communication and the depth of them all is just awesome to watch.I never believed I could feel emotion towards a CGI character, but because they are THAT believable, you feel their pains, their struggles... and it is a credit to the film that it pays off.GREAT film, worth seeing for the action scenes, the depth of the characters, the pains they go through, the effects, I could go onI hope that a 3rd in this franchise is being produced - to really drive this Apes saga forward.Go see it....",

            "content": "3 1/2 out of 4 stars.Rupert Wyatt's 2011 film \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" rebooted \"The Planet of the Apes\" series very well. 3 years later, \"Rise\" gets a sequel in Matt Reeves' \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" and its really good. \"Dawn\" finds Caesar (played by Andy Serkis) 10 years after \"Rise.\" The genetically altered apes live in the forest outside of San Francisco and most of the human population has died because of the virus that was unleashed in \"Rise.\" Caesar is now a husband and father and lives in a peaceful community with the apes. However, things turn when the humans come back.\"Dawn\" is a well done sequel. It builds on the themes and motifs of the first one. For themes, we see the scars of animal cruelty (both physical and psychological) and the importance of family. For motifs, we see eyes and the out stretched hand for permission. Thanks to the modern visual effects, it feels like the eyes are the window into the souls of these apes. \"Dawn\" has great motion capture visual effects. Its a stunning and visual treat. The opening scene with the apes hunting is very exciting. The apes look and feel real. Serkis is great as Caesar. Although he is replaced by beautiful visual effects, he captures the movement and voice of Caesar so well and gives him have a heart. Caesar is just visual effects, but Serkis gets you to feel Caesar's love and pain. This film is about fathers and sons. It's about generations and the violence we continue to pass down somehow. Caesar symbolizes the best of humanity while Koba (played by Toby Kebbell) represents human cruelty. These ideas battle themselves out both verbally and physically. It can be tragic at times.There is a storyline with the humans played out by Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, and Gary Oldman and they all are fine even though they feel more like stock characters at times. I think the film is at its best when we are with the apes dominate the screen though. We saw Caesar, Koba, and Maurice in \"Rise\" and we get to watch them grow. We get new ape characters like Blue Eyes and Ash that we start to care for. I was more interested in the ape side of the story and sympathized with them more. Humans can be such jerks. Michael Seresin's cinematography captures the grand scale of the film. Michael Giacchino's score is really good for the most part, but there are times where I thought it may have been a little exaggerated or distracting. Giacchino's score does a wonderful job of capturing the essence of the small and important moments though. Reeves' \"Dawn\" is a good follow-up to \"Rise\" and does what a sequel should do, build on the first and explore new areas of the universe it set up. It's smart and has great visual effects. \"Dawn\" is emotionally engaging and exciting. It's a blockbuster done right and I'm curious to see where this series can go.",

Cesar is the star of the movie (Think Spanish Monkey version of Optimus Prime) and Koba the PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) monkey is his co-star. The humans are plot devices that need to be there, and they in no way steal the show.

We enjoyed every scene, even the ones that reflected on Caesar's background and that of the current characters motivations were brief and effective. The were several powerful events throughout the movie for me. The non-verbal ques between Apes to show all the range of emotions and meanings (i.e from leadership to child rearing) and the makeup/costumes were near perfect. The dialogue between man and ape gave apes respect immediately and allowed the apes to have a command role throughout the film without the \"stupid animal\" stereotype. These Apes would kick your ass in a second. Apes had a unity that humans often lack. That's where the film took off for me. At the :juxtaposition\" of the logic and superiority of man and the stupidity of his actions and his failure to demonstrate supposed superiority. Mankind suffers because we don't maximize our greatest strength: his ability to love and unify others in a like purpose. The movie showed us how male-led societies are short-sided in understanding the consequence of their actions (namely the spreading of the Cimera virus) but its a metaphor for current failings. The theater sold out. Long- but enjoyable. All actors were believable in their fear. Standouts- Acevedo + Ceasar: Excellente!",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying I was never actually impressed with the first film at all. It seemed cut short and changed direction in a way that made very little sense. That being said, the second movie felt the same way. Now, as far as action movies go this has done a great job at that. I'm not going to say that this wasn't a fresh change in those regards but the script was terrible. The actors did a decently good job but everything felt like they just wrote in an excuse for certain shots and to decide an outcome that better represents the portrayal of Tim Burton's version. Anyone who assumes that these films are wrong and will differ from the others, don't forget that they literally made mention of Tim Burton's film with a news story and headline in the paper, that was in the first film, of course. So. This is supposed to be a prequel to Tim Burton's remake of the original. I assume the next one will be the last. With that said, let me go on to what I mean about terrible scripting. First off. The beginning of the film started with two apes who found their way in a tree-line and met up with a group of humans. One of them, was straight up over-the-top trigger-happy guy. As the film progresses this character seems to be the climax for just about /every/ conflict. It's one of the biggest action clich\u00e9s. Of course, I wondered \"Why don't they just kick him out of their stupid group and let him stay home?\" Well, they said \"He's the only one who knows how the water dam works.\" which you know what. That'd be all fine if he actually ends up doing something, which he doesn't. He just tells them they need to clear the debris and the rest of that segment the other group members do it on their own. So I am 100% certain that they just made that line to create an excuse for an unrealistically over-the-top trouble maker who can give the writers a thoughtless excuse to create tension. If you still don't think so we can go further up the line. They just took his word for it, they could've asked him not to cause trouble, because you know.. They said they'd kill them if not otherwise. Further on the movie portrays Garry Oldman's character as a bad guy near the end. \"I'm going to blow us all up because I tragically lost my family so now I'm senseless.\" Where as the main character disagrees, threatens to shoot his friend he's known for how long and they built a town together, just to side with an entirely different species based on a few days. The Apes caused all the trouble in the first place despite that there seems to be recognition of this \"I'm sorry that we killed all you guys, but you can't stay in your homes now. Go away, humans. But we're cool, right?\" and that was the end.. Well no, wait. We saw a 10 second closeup of a CGI face, what a way to end an action film. Not like they could've ended it with a short portion of the only-spoken-of military entering the scene before credits roll. Moving back a few moments they just acquired guns, and all a sudden know exactly what rounds they need, and we see an ape on horseback dual- wielding two LMGs and their apparently special-ops skilled firearms tactics forced the high-ground humans to take cover IMMEDIATELY because obviously, despite having had guns for presumably years, it never mattered. All in all? In terms of writing, the story, and character arcs. This film was terrible at it and the director obviously had no shame in that. This was just a summer blockbuster that aimed to make money. It did just that. So , I give it 6/10 rather than a low-score. Because I enjoyed the action. It was fun, I don't regret watching it. It'd deserve a 7 if for not forcing me to pick it apart due to how insensible it was. Am I also the only person who felt like that one 20-year-old son could've not been in the film and nothing would've changed? Also, why is the main character okay that all his friends just got killed, including the innocent radio guy who didn't want to be there? I mean, like. Nothing made sense. It was almost as bad as when in Oblivion the girl was totally okay that her husband was just a fake copy , yet she'd giggled like a teenager who tried love for the first time. It was the same thing. Nothing made sense. rant over -",

I grew up with the originals and saw a dusk to dawn when I was a kid at a local drive-in just down the road about a 1/2 a mile (Btw the Tri-Way is still open with 4 outdoor screens).

            "content": "-SPOILERS-This film was better than Rise in many different ways. Films that have sequels are mostly hated and are truly rubbish! For example: Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen, that film was funny but lacked the power that the first Transformers had, most of the films did. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes had another director but was powerful in action and story, Rise had the same power but something in Dawn had it. Apes riding on horses made an exceptional \"WOW\" from people but only once scene in Rise had the Apes on Horses. Koba was more of a character in it as in Rise he was a lonely, saddening ape...Caeser's son(Blue Eyes) wasn't a big character but was indeed in it for a long period of the film first appearing at a Bear Hunt with Caeser. Cornelia is actually the proud wife of Caeser and Queen of the Apes and I'm saying of every Ape in the world...Cornelia is later shown sick and the sad thing is Caeser seriously throws his wife in a river to protect her from Fire, but she doesn't die. Its unknown what shes dying from but I may not have been focusing much...Caeser is also getting another son, unknown name...sadly...I call him 'Raven' the film calls him 'Caesers Infant' not his real name by the way, he doesn't know anything yet since his JUST born...I have to say the films CGI was magnificent and the acting superb, AWESOME ACTION (98% MORE THAN RISE) and OMG...the motion capture was well done.

            "content": "We've come a long way since 'Jar Jar Binks'. From a CGI character so bad that he almost single-handedly destroyed the Star Wars universe, to a group of CGI super-smart apes so impressive that they have completely reinvigorated a 1960's classic. (Let's ignore the forgettable 90's remake).It's hard to even begin reviewing 'Dawn'. It's just so damn good. If you liked its predecessor 'Rise', this is significantly better. If you didn't care for the first in this reboot/re imagining-prequel series, see this anyway. Some have said 'Rise' was a little slow. I disagree, but I can see that point of view. 'Dawn' by comparison is faster than 'The Flash' on anabolic steroids.So, let's start with the apes. Unless you really try, it's hard not to believe that these chimps, gorillas, and orangutan are real. They completely outshine their human actor counterparts. That's no insult to the fine actors in this film, who are all excellent. Gary Oldman, in particular, gives a powerful portrayal of the emotionally tortured leader of the survivors of the man-made virus which has all but wiped out the human race.But, the apes. The apes! The depth of of expression in their faces, their authentic mannerisms, the exquisite detail in both sound and visuals, the way they interact and communicate with each other (which is 90% sign language with some basic spoken sentences), all add up to the single best display of CGI in the history of cinema (get out of the way Avatar!!!). But, to only praise the CGI would be to overlook the actors behind the apes. Led by Andy Serkis (the veteran of motion capture performances like 'Gollum' and 'King Kong'), the portrayals of the actors that bring the apes to life are extraordinary. Their movements and mannerisms are so authentic that you forget that there's a human in a skin tight suit covered in motion sensors cavorting around like a monkey underneath the digital images on screen. Serkis deserves an Oscar for his efforts here.There's also a great story on display. The slow burn of the smouldering events which gradually escalate misunderstanding and fear to all out war are pieced together with rare expertise. The way the human/simian conflict mirrors those of our own history is a poignant reminder of the ease with which our hatreds and prejudices blind us.One measure of the quality of the film is, although you're waiting for the inevitable battle scenes to arrive, it's an easy wait. The drama, tension, and especially, the evolving relationships between Serkis's 'Caesar', leader of the apes, and his family and tribe members keep the movie rollicking along for the first two thirds. And, then, when the final conflict arrives it does not disappoint. It's part sci-fi, part drama, part action, but all class. Go see this movie. It's the best of 2014 so far.'Dawn of The Planet of The Apes' \u2013 9 out of 10P.S. Apes on horseback rule.www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews",

They've managed to breed, hunt, talk a little better and even ride horses. So, in 10 years the apes evolved and humanity was almost wiped out. Might seem a little too fast but it's definitely an interesting scenario. The story is actually quite simple, not as complex as I expected, but it leads the movie to a more elaborated conclusion. The way the apes turn against the humans was quite a surprise. There are several plot twists, which is great because it surprises the audience. The movie also comes with new characters and I think everybody played well, acting doesn't seem to be an issue. There were major improvements since 2011 as for the Visual Effects and CGI. The apes were very highly detailed, the fur in different environments looks really convincing, so did their eyes and basically everything. This movie proofs that CGI is getting really close to reality, and it will definitely leave a landmark in the VFX industry. Overall the movie was absolutely amazing, in my opinion, this is best 2014 movie I've seen so far. It is worth watching.",

            "content": "Who would have thought that a sequel to a prequel after a failed remake would end up being one the best movies of the summer? Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes what its predecessor started and turns it into one of the best summer movies in years. We pick up ten years after the first film. The apes have settled into their home in the forests while the humans have fought and tried to survive the Simian Flu as well as the fighting caused from the depletion of resources after the population dropped. For ten years the apes have lived in peace aside from the occasional run-in with humans that are briefly alluded to. The apes have a good society; they hunt for food, they have become advanced enough to make weapons and ride horses, they teach their young, and most importantly, they live in happiness. Things change, though, when a group of humans show up looking to use a nearby dam for power. After some disputes and a confrontation in the human settlement, the apes allow for the humans to access the dam.It is interesting how the writers paralleled the lives of humans and apes. Both are just trying to survive, both have lost loved ones, and both are skeptical about combining the two species even if it is minimal. The humans, who are led by a man named Dreyfus, played by Gary Oldman, are becoming exceptionally desperate for survival. They are quicker to assume the apes mean harm and often threaten them before the apes threaten them. The apes too are hesitant, mostly an ape by the name of Koba, an ape from the first film, who has many scars from \"human work.\" His skepticism leads him to find out that the humans plan on assaulting the apes, but he knows that Caesar, the hero ape from the first film and leader of their civilization, will not stand for initiating violence. This begins a conflict that will eventually divide the apes in deciding who is right to follow.The film, which runs a little over two hours, feels far too short, which is usually a sign that the movie is good. There is not a dull moment in it. From the start, the tension keeps the film running. You never know when it's going to crack and turn into a full-out war. The human characters are relatable. Malcolm, played by Zero Dark Thirty's Jason Clarke is a man who sees something remarkable in the apes. He tries to befriend them instead of killing them. His wife was killed, and all he has is his son, played by Kodi Smit-Mcphee, and Ellie, played by Keri Russell, who has lost a daughter. Everyone is a victim in this film, which makes the consequences so much more dire. Though the humans are interesting, most of them do not hold a huge role in the film, especially Oldman's character who is depicted as the villain in trailers but is missing largely from the film itself.While the human acting is solid as can be, it is good that they are written interesting enough for us to keep focus when what we really want are the apes. The apes are fascinating to watch. While it is a little disorienting to see them talking at first, they are very sophisticated. The motion capture and detail in the apes is phenomenal. They appear almost real in some sequences, and it is very hard to distinguish reality from CGI. This can all be credited to the talented team of motion-capture actors including Andy Serkis, Toby Kebbell, Nick Thurston, and many more. With motion-capture like this, it is brightening the future for better technology and ways in which to use it to enhance films.There are numerous fantastic set-pieces. From the decaying San Francisco, to the ape sanctuary, to the tops of skyscrapers, to the battles in the streets, they are nothing short of spectacular. Each action-sequence seems to top the previous, especially the climactic battle sequences in the heart of the city with apes on horses. Yes, you heard me. And no, it is not funny like you would see in a YouTube video, it is actually quite terrifying because of how closely it resembles the original film series.In many ways this film feels like (as the reviews have said) Star Wars. But to me it felt more like The Two Towers than Empire Strikes back. Sure it is easy to say that the film is like Star Wars in a way that the first film could have been a standalone film left open-ended for a sequel. Yet this film feels more like Two Towers because it has that impending doom feel like Lord of the Rings. We still know the end-game for this series of prequels, but any of these films could be enough to leave the rest open for interpretation and speculation. Yet, as good as the previous one did, and as well as this one will surely do, we will be treated to more installments that fill in the missing pieces. All I can say is, bring it on.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best movie of the summer thus far. It combines fantastic CGI and motion capture with an extremely tense story, excellent battle scenes, and the feeling of impending doom for a film that exceeds its predecessor on all fronts. If you have not seen this film, I beg you to do so.For more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com",

            "content": "Family.This movie is about family. Caesar has a family, in a large sense, because he watches over a colony of apes. He also has a family. A son, a wife, and a newborn. His former foe Rocket also has a family. Jason Clarke has a family too. He has Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee. He has a slightly larger family, which includes the other men who go out on runs with him. Then he has his human camp family, which consists of a few hundred survivors that have held up in the city.It's about what you would do to keep your family safe. Not just alive, but safe. Caesar understands that. Clarke understands that. Their families keep them grounded, and keep them thinking about safety first.Koba does not have a family. Koba is evil.Gary Oldman does not have a family. Gary Oldman is evil.I mean, sure, they have the family in the larger sense. They have their community. But neither of them have a wife or children to ground them like the other characters. The film is sending a subtle message that not having a wife and kids will somehow cause you to slowly unravel, and become unstable. Koba moreso than Oldman. You could even call Oldman a situational villain. He's a guy who is a villain by circumstance, and probably a rather nice guy the rest of the time.It's important to note that the other human identified as a \"bad guy\", also never mentions a family. Rather, it is suggested that he lost his.The humans are almost an after thought in this film. They are slightly underdeveloped, but I think it credits the strength of the Apes when you would rather see them on camera than actual actors. The plot of the film revolves around the spread of the Simian Flu (what Tyler Labine's character, Franklin, had in the first film). It has spread worldwide. There were wars. Billions died. Now, a few survivors are held up in San Fransisco, trying to get the lights to come on.Caesar has built a strong community. They even have a little camp, with huts and structures to keep themselves out of the rain. He's teaching them to write, read, and talk. Caesar is not the only ape who talks in this movie, and he can now speak sentences, albeit sounding a bit like a caveman. I'm excited about the possibilities of the third film, and where they'll take us.Andy Serkis is brilliant as Caesar. Absolutely brilliant. You need to understand that he is actually standing there, where Caesar is standing, in every frame. He moves like Caesar, like an Ape. He did countless hours of research, watching apes interact with each other, in order to master this performance. Some actors get nominated for Oscars, and their performance was only a few minutes of work. Maybe a few days of shooting. Serkis doesn't just deserve an Oscar, he demands an Oscar.I understand how difficult it must be for the Academy to recognize this, so I've decided he should just get an honorary Oscar. I know he's not deathly old, but he still deserves recognition for the body of work he has created as a motion-capture actor. And for what it's worth, Toby Kebbel is pretty brilliant as Koba too. Sometimes, it's easier to play crazy, and play the villain, than it is to be quiet, and just command the scene with silence. Often, Serkis has to act by commanding stillness, whereas Koba acts through a gruff growl, or a sneer. Koba is anything but still and quiet, he is treacherous and dangerous in every frame.My favorite films of 2014 so far have all been summer releases. Dawn Of the Planet Of The Apes joins those ranks, and is quite possibly the best film of 2014 so far (that I've seen). My top 4 are all summer sequels. Dawn took the impossibly strong foundation in Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, and built on it a more fully realized world, with even greater developed characters. Those characters\u0085 are apes. The fact that you can pull that much emotion out of computer generated imagery goes to show how great the motion capture talent is. Maybe one day, they'll have their own Oscar category. For now, I just have to say Bravo, and hope Serkis gets his due.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the latest installment of the Planet of the Apes Sci-Fi series that over the years earned a cult status in cinema due to its never outdated allegorical significance and exotic, dystopian world in which our closest animal relatives, the apes, hold up a mirror to us as mankind. This time we are presented with the simian leader's effort to maintain peace between his species and the last surviving humans, until the dynamics of mistrust, fear and hatred dash any good intentions and pave the way for a belligerent conflict that culminates in an action-packed, visually impressive and emotionally gripping finale that offers some extraordinary beautiful scenes in terms of cinematography and camera work, which are very artistically ambitious and constitute a great deal of the attraction of this movie. The story itself, although following traditional and therefore somewhat predictable patterns, is well-paced and atmospherically dense, managing to arouse interest for the characters, and most of all it has the merit of having a message rather than just being a framework for sensational action. Only a certain inaccuracy on part of the script authors - for example the exact number of the simian group seems to vary from scene to scene - and some inconsistencies concerning character development as well as issues with logic and physics, and unfortunately a notable fluctuation in authenticity of the CGI effects, which sometimes slightly mar the magic of watching real apes talking, prevent this Sci-Fi gem to be a true master piece. Nevertheless, it's a very strong and entertaining continuation of the franchise and worth a visit to the theaters.",

This one however does not live up to its expectations. The setting is more darker, with the apes now living as a small community under thatched roofs in the redwoods. Their peaceful life gets interrupted when humans trespass their home (the woods). If the first one was about apes getting intelligent and smarter, with Caesar wanting a home for them in the woods, the second one is grim with anger, betrayal, war and bloodshed. As in the first one, Caesar is the center of attraction of the movie. The performance capture and modern technological advances are well used. In summary, good for a watch or two; but not as brilliant as the first one.",

            "content": "I'm not a Planet of the Apes fan. I never have been. I've only really seen the first original film and maybe a few episodes of the TV show. I always thought it was a bit corny in my book. But I understand the sci- fi nostalgia of it. It never appealed to me. I was kind of happy the first remake failed. I have lost a lot of faith in Tim Burton and the film just looked awful. When Rise came out there was so much negativity surrounding it. The news of re-shoots and James Franco distancing himself from the film wasn't inviting. I had no plan on seeing it for a long time. But it was a hit. Even with the die hard fans it was winning approval. I didn't see it until it was on demand. The film shocked me. I was sucked into this emotional story in a big sci-fi reboot/remake. The effects were awesome, Franco's character was appealing but it was the work of Andy Serkis and WETA making me feel for the apes. I was so pleasantly surprised I shouted from the hills that people needed to see it. I had heard that there was a second film coming and I was pleasantly happy about it. But I remember saying that they need to keep the director and the emotion of the first film. One of those two happened. Matt Reeves took over the helm for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and it's nothing but positive. This sequel is bigger and even more emotional than the first. The film takes place ten years later. That is shown in a very haunting and close to home opening sequence. The apes haven't seen humans in two years. A small gathering of humans have ventured out to find a dam where they can start the power for the city of San Francisco. This leads to much that I don't want to give away. There's so much emotion in this film. For the first twenty minutes or so we are treated to the apes life they have built. It's gorgeous, beautiful and will easily take any viewer and place them in this new world. Honestly, WETA has done such a great job with the apes in the film the whole film could have been about them and I would have been just as invested. Andy Serkis' performance as Ceasar is outstanding. In this film his character is now middle aged with a family of his own. He is the leader of the group of apes and with all that on his plate the humans emerge. It's a gripping performance with so much nuance. I'll be shocked if he doesn't get some kind of nomination. Every one of the apes in a main role including Toby Kebbell as his right hand Koba are excellent. Jason Clarke is great as the main human in the film trying to also preserve life for his family. But each of the human characters give enough to keep a good balance in the picture. Gary Oldman is good but his appearance in the film has been greatly exaggerated. It's more like an extended cameo. This is one of those films that in the world of big dumb box office hits keeps everything intelligent. There's nothing here that makes the audience feel dumb. Along with the sci-fi element and the action scenes this film does great to convey thoughts of gun control. It's so refreshing to see a film tackle some hard topics in a big tent pole feature. Matt Reeves will be the next IT director because of this film. The look, the feel, the performances and the way the film is shot screams \"I have serious talent\". He has now proved he can do the small film (Cloverfield) and the big budget summer films. I can't wait to see where he goes for the third film in the series. Being the nerd I am I have trouble changing my views on certain topics. But I never thought in the same year I would change my thoughts on two big nerd staples. First was my finally coming to terms with my love of X-Men after seeing Days of Future Past. Now comes my complete change in thought about Planet of the Apes. It could just be Matt Reeves direction and Serkis' performance but this is the second sequel that takes everything about the first one and grows it. Instead of just banking on the name the filmmakers, cast and crew throw their heart and souls to make a not just a better film, a great film. Nice to see that some people haven't given up on the intelligence of the film audience.",

            "content": "When I first saw the trailer for Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I remember posting a Facebook status: \"Slap the word 'Rise' to a franchise and make a reboot out of it\". Little did i know that it'd be one of my favorite movies of the year. The movie was a brilliant reboot for the franchise especially considering what Tim Burton had done to it way back in 2001. Rise Of Planet Of The Apes told the story of Caesar the Ape and how he started an Ape Revolution and the movie also ended setting up everything for a sequel.Enter Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, and when you are done with pronouncing the overlong title, the movie picks up the story after a decade or so from the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, most of the human population had perished due to the Simian Flu and Caesar has started his own herd, his own family deep inside the woods. Going in for Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, I had no clue what was in store for me, the opening scene itself blew me away and I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. While Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes was for the most part commercial and pleasant, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is definitely dark it gives out that grim feeling. The story is well crafted and leaves no room for a single speck of boredom. If you were someone like me, I am sure you would have tried to piece together a sense of story from the previews but believe me, the movie goes nothing like you've ever imagined, predictability takes a back seat and the movie throws at you, everything you've never expected.Needless to say Caesar is once again the core of the story and it doesn't disappoint, not even a bit. The movie was about 130 minutes but it kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting more. Its well paced and you will never feel one scene out of place or unnecessary. Instead of dialog-ridden human sequences, I preferred the ape sequences more, of course it was a total pandemonium what with the apes screaming and making a ruckus but when Caesar's on screen there no possible way to get my eyes off it. Like many even I wanted Andy Serkis to win an Academy Award for Best Actor for playing Caesar in Rise of Planet of the Apes, such was power and perfection that he had brought underneath the layers of CG and you can see more of that here. If I had to give you one single reason to watch this movie other than Caesar, it would be his trusted right hand, Koba. Koba is insanely intimidating and could be considered one of the best anti protagonist in recent times. The humans, played by Jason Clarke, Keri Russel and Gary Oldman did their parts well. Jason Clarke did bring about a sense of empathy backed up by Keri Russell while Gary Oldman's character was a prisoner of his own tragedies from the past.The visuals have been beefed up to an extend where you'd think twice seeing an Ape, if its indeed CG or real. Its a huge leap from the first movie and there were scenes where I was truly dumbfounded. I know 5 years from now, there might be something more advanced and visually arresting than this, but when I was watching this at the big screen, all i could do was gape at WETA's visual wizardry that went into the movie. Michael Giacchino's score became that icing on that immensely appealing cake.Having directed movies like Cloverfield and Let Me In, Matt Reeves skillful direction comes into play and makes Dawn of The Planet of The Apes a great watch. Had i to concise and compare Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, it would be with The Dark Knight, Rise of Planet of the Apes being Batman Begins of course. I know I went overboard here comparing it with the Dark Knight, but still it deserves to be compared with no less. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is undoubtedly one of the best movies in recent times, I even felt it's a notch above X-Men Days of Future Past. I can assure you this'll be one of those movies that'll keep you glued to your seats. On a surface it looks like any good summer action blockbuster, but there's more to it that meets the eye just like the undertones of Rise of Planet Of The Apes. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is not monkey business, well sorta, but its still a must watch and SHOULDN'T NOT BE MISSED.",

            "content": "As of this moment, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is easily the best film that I have seen in 2014 so far, and more than that, it is the best large-scale science fiction/drama/action film that I have seen in years. I would have to go back to something like The Dark Knight or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to pull up another film that floored and impressed and entranced me the way that this one did.This is basically the best possible, most compelling thing that could have been done with this franchise. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) was a terrific, thoughtful new spin the concept. Dawn is the further evolution of the concept, and it is breathtakingly powerful. This in an intense film, and it changes gears from beautiful to frightening, hopeful to tragic, several times to great effect. The philosophical questions (raised by this theoretical premise) are very heavy. This may be fiction, but a scenario of similar effect is not beyond realistic imagination. This film makes you think.I will not get into individual details, other than to say that they are pretty much uniformly excellent. The only thing that I really found disappointing was one of the human characters, whose reckless behavior feels more like a plot device than a realistic characterization. Still, that is just one very small part of what is an astoundingly well- executed whole. (And honestly, what would our world be without random idiocy to start wars and mess things up? It happens, sadly.)Bottom line, there have been several good films so far this year, in the broad category that this one fits into, more or less. I loved X-Men: Days of Future Past, and not to take anything away from it, but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best film of the year, so far, and I would not be surprised to still feel that way at years' end.This is an incredible experience. Note that the running time is fairly long, but it is hard to find fault with that. I was fixated on the screen from start to finish. Also, there is some intense imagery (although not of the gore/blood variety) and I would not recommend this film for young children. That being said, for basically everyone else, there is no recent film that I would recommend more highly than this one. Heart, intelligence, hope, fear, thrills, release. Incredible.Edit: I find it very interesting that seemingly almost all of the \"helpful/not helpful\" votes cast on reviews chronologically the same or more recent than this one...have come from people who apparently do not think that this film is good. Which is to say that most of the reviews are very positive, and most of them have been voted \"unhelpful.\" I have never observed any pattern quite like this.So, just to say, again: I have only seen a handful of big budget films in the past decade that--in my opinion--deserve marks as high as this one. Of course, it only works if you are part of the target audience. This is an emotionally thoughtful film first and foremost. It has some incredible action and spectacle, but if you go looking for that, or if you expect a film with this many characters to somehow spend even more time on each one of them (I feel that the character development is more than adequate) as some complaints seem to suggest, then you may be disappointed.But, again, there is no film yet this year that I have been more impressed with.",

But the story just felt a bit 'samey' - another film about 2 groups bashing the hell out of each other.The third instalment is in the box set, ready to be viewed and I hope it lives up to the standard of the first.By the way, I'm pleased I watched this after our own real life Covid-19 pandemic.

The movie plays well on the themes of Trust and Betrayal, and that without them \u2013 Tragic results can follow - a mirror to the start of conflicts and war throughout human history. The movie takes part 10 years following the events of the first. Andy Serkis, reprising his role as the Ape Caeser, via performance capture, now heads up the Apes. The virus from the first movie has resulted in the Death in what appears to be the majority of the human population. The remaining humans that are in San Francisco (location of the first movie) seek to get the power back (has been lost due to catastrophic events of the virus) on through a Dam in the Woods, where the Apes now reside. As mentioned, the themes of Trust and Betrayal are front and center. The Apes are very believable \u2013 A Visual Effect Nomination at the Oscars is a safe bet. At points during the movie, you may wish the Human Characters got more moments, but not underused enough to bring down the movie. Overall, A Great Movie \u2013 9 out of 10.",

The film's underlying message is trite and has been expressed better in other films.Aside from the lacklustre plot and banal message, the character portrayal is also quite run-of-the-mill.All in all, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is typical Hollywood fare: family-friendly mediocrity.

            "content": "Dawn of The Planet of The Apes Review I'm delighted that this is the first review to be posted on our blog, what a treat. I was quite saddened to hear that Rupert Wyatt wasn't returning after the huge surprise that was 'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes', it was a fantastic origin story for Caesar, however Matt Reeves vision firmly highlights that this is Caesars story and it was executed perfectly. That statement was in no way hyperbolic, I mean perfectly. The deadly ALZ-113 virus known as the Simian-Flu along with civil unrest has brought the human race to its knees, with the exception of the seemingly immune, remaining survivors. The apes, led by Caesar live peacefully in the Muir Woods of San Francisco. An altercation with humans eventually leads to a fragile truce, it is however broken leading both sides to the brink of war. That is about all I can say in terms of the story, it may sound a little mundane, it is anything but. There is an abundance of adjectives to describe this character driven masterpiece, these are but a few- breath-taking, thought-inducing, pulse-pounding and enthralling. The direction Matt Reeves took this movie is brilliant, it is character driven with Andy Serkis' Caesar at the helm. There is much rumour surrounding how Reeves actually got the job, apparently the executives at Fox wanted to make the sequel more human-centric and focused on the collapse of humanity. However Reeves pitched them a story involving the ever-expanding ape civilisation because of how well Caesar was set-up in Rise. Obviously they agreed and it has paid off big time, this movie is full of grey areas, it isn't all black and white. It's virtually impossible to pick a side, personally I took a lot of political and racial messages from this movie and about how people are inherently xenophobic for the most part resulting in a hate or distain for those who are different despite there being bad and good on both sides. The overall tone of the movie was great, Reeves coupled the compulsion for hope and survival with the anguish of hopelessness expertly. Two words, Oscar nomination. Andy Serkis' portrayal of Caesar is one of best performances I have ever had the pleasure of viewing, his screen presence is captivating. He is a strong, wise, thoughtful and intelligent being who makes Optimus Prime from the latest Transformers seem like a bumbling idiot. He unequivocally deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Also his performance-capture partner in crime for this movie Toby Kebbell (Koba) has reinforced the message that performance capture isn't just a gimmick, Serkis and Kebbell have an on screen relationship unlike anything ever seen before because of the technology used. Koba in a sense an extension of Caesar only far more extreme, he is a great character making Caesar question certain decisions while also showing vehement hate which is completely understandable due to his relationship with humans. As for the human performances, which are admittedly overshadowed by Caesar and Koba are still tremendous allowing the story to progress at a nice pace. Jason Clarke does a great job showing that despite certain obvious differences that co-operation and respect will allow for far more progress to be made rather than violence and intimidation. Keri-Russell and Kodi-Smitt McPhee do a serviceable job and I have no qualms with their performances, it's obvious that they didn't have much to work with other than going along for the ride with Jason Clarkes character (Malcom). Lastly the chameleon that is Gary Oldman once again shows us why he is one of the greatest living actors today, in fact he has a scene in this movie that almost brought me to tears but he didn't even say a word- what the hell?! Moreover there is one other scene involving the hijacking of a tank which had my jaw firmly on the floor for at least 5 minutes, it was for a lack of a more verbose word, epic. I have but one fault with the movie and that is the lack of explanation of the fate of James Franco's character from the first movie. I suppose you could say it was his job to further the development of Caesar but still I would have enjoyed even one line or one scene showing what happened to him following the outbreak of the virus. The setting of the movie is beautiful despite it being essentially a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Along with the beautiful visual effects of the characters and the setting the score blends seamlessly with everything that is going on on-screen. Every little intricate detail down to the fact that this movie was shot on location 95% of the time enhances what is in my opinion the best film of the year. Furthermore the pace ensured I was not bored for one second, this is obviously a credit to the editing and direction of the movie which were once again top notch. I hope I haven't inflated any expectations with this review, but I loved it, If you're a fan of the first movie you will love it also, it is better in every way. Heck if you're a fan of movies in general you will at least enjoy the story and the performances. 'Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes'- 5/5.",

            "content": "As said above there are plot holes (and spoilers) that make the humans in this movie seem more like stupid apes then the apes themselves. First plot hole which is necessarily just the story's fault is how exactly did the simian flu happen, i watched the first film where one character was infected and the main sign given when he possibly might have spread the flu was when he sneezed blood but most would know how to protect themselves from a flu that's spread that way. The only way it could infect so many is if it was a protean virus that could manipulate ways it infected, not a flu.Second plot hole is how people seem to have forgotten that the apes ever existed, even though they were the cause of the flu and also what happened on the bridge. You would also think the government would take some action but it seems they just forgot about their existence, even though there were so many possible eye witnesses even James Francos character.Third is how exactly could the world fall apart? I can understand the flu part to an extent but as to why it fell apart where everything that was working perfectly fine is not being put to use. Also considering that the woods where the apes live were the only place affected by the apes so it's not like they were in constant peril around the world to not be able to use everyday tools.The the final big plot hole is in the end of the film when they find out that there are people \"up north\" coming to help as soon as they make contact with them. You'd think that people would stick together in a time like this, but later on it's explained that they are soldiers.. So why were they not sticking together the whole time? Why did they barely find out that they exist? It's even more confusing when you know they've had power the whole time enough to communicate with them via radio. Shouldn't they have united sooner?I'm also tired of hearing people say to be in suspension of disbelief, because I watched Hocus Pocus a movie about witches were almost anything can go. Where a cat can get run over and be perfectly fine after wards but a zombie gets hit in the head an it falls off even though they are both under the same witches magic and have both been dead for years. LOL NO.Well in the end the movie may have plot holes, but it isn't a bad movie, even though i think Keri Russel and Kodi Smit-McPhee's characters have no real reason to exist. Some of the apes are kinda hard to tell apart until you hear their names. Personally I don't think it's deserving of it's current rating of 8.5 or to place #152 in the top 250 films. But hey, when Jurassic Park has only the great effects for its time keeping it in the top 250 who am I to say that this can't right? :)I rate it a 7.5 for good effort and decently executed film.",

The story is meat and potatoes basic but done intelligently. There is a surprising lack of dialogue with a LOT of ape subtitles but it all works well. This may be the best blockbuster that utilizes the least amount of actual dialogue in history. The ape's FX really is as amazing as most are saying but it's the other CGI that kind of disappointed me. Scenes like the bear kill and the interaction with baby ape seemed awkward and poorly done for some reason. It's almost as if the film was using different FX houses and not everything meshed. Again, that's just a minor quibble in a very good film. I do wonder if there's anywhere left for this franchise to go. Anything from this point forward would seem tedious unless they don't go full Planet of the Apes and keep the humans in the game and spin off a drama/war story element.

But what I can tell you is just how thoroughly fleshed out all the films characters have become since Dawn. While certain members may be missing, possibly due to the extinction caused by Simian Influenza, the big characters (Caeser, Maurice, Koba, Rocket) all return in due form. More vicious, more invested in survival, and more outraged with the possibility of human encroachment, every one of the apes has it's own vested interest in what ultimately turns into a gorilla civil war. Pun intended.Epic scenes, epic violence (they really pushed the PG-13 envelope), epic sounds, the harmonics of several hundred chimpanzees trumpeting in the middle of establishing shots, everything about this movie is epic. The struggle for all vested species is intense. Several stand-offs just have you saying to yourself, \"WTF is going to happen next!?\" The plot is simple, yet not easily executable. Encroach into another specie's territory at the risk of loosing all known resources, or face a war against each other? Cold war and civil war antics are only a matter of time.

It took me a long time to get around to seeing the first one and I imagine it's for the reasons most people had: The first movies with Heston just seem silly now. Not to mention the first reboot was utter crap. So naturally I had reservations about ANOTHER reboot of this obviously silly franchise. But it's not silly at all. In the age of biological scares and pharmaceutical companies clamoring for the next dollar and neurological diseases affecting more and more people, the premise of these movies actually seems... viable. Dare I say, realistic. Not just the premise, but you actually care about these characters. And I found myself actually caring more about the apes than I did the humans. Dawn re-emphasizes everything that's set up in Rise and continues the story many years after its cliffhanger ending. It explores the origins of human hatred and bitterness through the burgeoning ape society. There is good and evil on both sides and ironically enough, the film brings us to understand and even empathize with both. The beauty of this movie is that in the end you really don't know who you're cheering for because everyone is justified and everyone is (in some sense) doing the right thing.Do yourself a favor and even if you have reservations about this reboot, go find Dawn (but not before you've seen Rise) and give it at least one viewing. I'm confident you'll want to view both of these films again and again and that they'll most assuredly find a place in your Blu-Ray collection.",

Dark Cloud returns goes to Fort Pecos and discovers that the cowboys have plenty of arms. The cowboys are celebrating the return of their water by dancing. Dark Cloud and his Indian army ride into the compound to lay siege to the cowboys. Dark Cloud manages to charge with his Indians through the gates and break their wall down.By daybreak, Dark Cloud and his followers have taken cowboys as prisoners, declaring that they now know what it feels like to be caged. The Indians that refused to follow Dark Cloud have been locked in a carriage. Wise Man and the other trapped Indians break free from their carriage and break the cowboys out. They find Leaping Bull and tell them about Dark Cloud's plan to get the female Indians and young ones to join him, including Blue Flower and their newborn. Together, along with John Wayne, they head out to stop Dark Cloud.Dark Cloud and his followers have gathered at the top of a tower. Leaping Bull dives in and tackles Dark Cloud, knocking him off a ledge. As he hangs on for his life, he looks up at Leaping Bull, who pulls Dark Cloud's arm up. Dark Cloud tells him, \"Indian not kill Indian.\" Leaping Bull looks him down and replies, \"You are not Indian.\" With that, he drops Dark Cloud and allows him to fall to his death.The free and surviving Indians come up to the tower to reunite as a group. Leaping Bull says that an Indian has already started a war, and that John Wayne must go and protect his own family. The two of them acknowledge their friendship, but also the fact that the chance for peace is gone. At the end of the closing credits, the sound of howling Indians and the scraping of rubble can be heard.",

If you want to watch this movie, my advise is to watch Rise of planet of the Apes first. This will help you to understand why Caesar can trust human and why Koba will never trust human. The tension between Caesar and Koba is well developed and the script, I would say, it is a bit philosophical. Caesar builds his tribe based on principle that ape doesn't kill ape; but, at the end Caesar has killed Kobe because Caesar declared Kobe is not an ape. I think this is a message about human civilization. The part I dislike is the presentation on bonding between father and son. Emphasis is largely on the apes; but, the presentation is not very touching. The director has mentioned issue of kid's participation in war; but, there is no further elaboration. Perhaps the director doesn't want to give too many question to the audience. Although this movie is largely played by \"apes\", this movie does give audience to think about human civilization.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes 9/10- I did not really have high hopes of the original movie Rise of the Planet of the Apes, but I gave it a shot and I was pleasantly surprised. It had stunning CGI effects and decent plot but I feel like it still had room to grow. Now, three years later the sequel to the surprise hit has come out and I could not have higher hopes for the film(especially since this summer has been a little weak.) I am pleased to say that this sequel far surpassed my expectations. With stunning visual effects, well-crafted intense and emotional scenes, and a well-developed plot, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes far surpasses its predecessor and brings the best summer blockbuster in two years.As far as the bad stuff about this movie goes, there is not much to say. Yes, in order to make a successful sic-fi action movie, there is a certain plot pattern that you must follow but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is still original in every sense of the word. That pretty much sums up the bad stuff.Now on to everything else. I will start with the CGI(computer generated imagery) effects since that is the biggest achievement of the film. I have not seen this good of CGI since Avatar. The way that make it seem like those are real super-intelligent apes and gorillas standing there next to humans is incredible. I was particularly impressed with the confidence the effects department had to use close-up shots on the apes faces and show all of the detail. It was not just the apes that were a CGI challenge either, the effects department had to CGI horses, deer, and obviously a near-destroyed city. I hope that get the credit they deserve for this because they should be given an Oscar for the incredible work they have done. The plot is nothing that will win an Oscar but as far as summer films go, it is the best ever. Remember how much people loved Avatar because of the visual effects but wished it actually had a well thought out plot, this is what they wanted. This is the movie that should go down in history for the accomplishments it has made. I mean just when you think you knew what was about to happen, the movie takes a completely different turn and keeps you on your toes the entire time. Its really hard for a film, in my opinion, to be so flawless in all of these areas and still be a completely bad-ass movie too. Now we come to the acting. I feel like the Academy Awards should give awards for motion picture acting because Andy Serkis, who plays Caesar, is a tremendous actor. All of the effort he puts in to his roles is amazing and it was amazing all of the mannerism he was able to master for his role. Toby Kebbell, who plays Koba, I also feel went above and beyond with his performance. Jason Clarke did was he was asked to do for the movie and I am pleased at the direction that his career is going. Gary Oldman was really the one to talk about in this film after Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell of course. I kind of felt that he did not put in his best effort after Batman Begins, but I am pleased to see that he still has a lot of great acting left in him. There are so many reasons to go see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Ground Breaking CGI effects, incredible plot, top of the line acting both on screen and off, and a general bad- assary about the movie. I recommend that you see this film as your first choice walking into theaters.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",

            "content": "I'm not sure a film has ever followed its predecessor so perfectly as this one, and unfortunately that's not a compliment. Everything that destroyed the great potential of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and reduced it to barely watchable is back in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.Once again it is the writers' total inability to write believable \"bad guys.\" They're all absolutely idiotic, irrational, unbelievable caricatures, on the level (or even worse) than one-dimensional films like Avatar.And that's a real shame, because this is not at all a one-dimensional film. The \"good\" characters are done so well, and the story itself is pretty good, but just like in the prior film, the writers prove they have no idea how to move a story along without having absurd, unbelievable antagonists doing stupid, unbelievable things, and then the good characters inexplicably not disavowing and turning against them.One stupid character ruins the entire relationship between the species in the film, while simultaneously ruining the film. The idea that he could panic and shoot an ape in the first scene is absolutely believable, even if his reaction afterwards is over the top. But his behavior after the apes spare them is absolutely absurd, counter-intuitive, and unbelievable. And then, for contrived plot purposes which are later discarded without even being discussed, they have to bring him BACK to the apes, and his fellow humans don't even make him apologize. That should have literally been step 2 of any plan to go back. Step 1: make contact. Step 2: make him apologize. You'd have to be the dumbest, most clueless people on earth not to do that.Then, because the moronic writers still can't think of anything intelligent, or even new, to move the plot along, they have the same guy completely illogically and unreasonably overreact a second time. And then we find out that he's not just terrible, he's the dumbest man who ever lived.See, the apes tell them they can't bring guns. There are only like 6 of them, and hundreds of apes, so even if they all had automatic weapons they could never shoot their way out, so having guns would only mean they could take some apes with them before dying anyway. So even if they had ill intent leaving their guns behind is meaningless. But despite that, this complete idiot decides to smuggle a gun in. Because him having one gun was somehow going to make him safer? Getting caught with it is a potential death-sentence. Using it is a guaranteed death-sentence. There was absolutely no logic to it. But hey, the writers couldn't think of how to move the plot along, so there it is.Then we get the leader of the human colony, who is also apparently a total nutter making decisions that make no sense at all. And they break open their giant armory (not unreasonable), but only have 2 guys there (apparently the 2 dumbest men in the entire colony), whose job it is to test all the guns. But instead of just test-firing the guns, these idiots blow through loads of precious ammo apparently just joy-shooting all the guns even after they've proved they work. And you don't need me to tell you about how utterly stupid their entire exchanges with Koba are.This film had such potential, just like the first one, but terribly written \"bad guys\" ruined it, just like the first one, taking it from what should have been a very good film to something barely watchable.",

Much like its predecessor, the films is visually stunning with incredible motion capture performances and memorable cinematography. The human side of this story is a bit lack luster in comparison to Rise but thats a small issue as the rest of the film is jaw dropping in every other way. The action sequences are uncomfortable to anything I have ever seen and we are given incredible character development for both our protagonist Cesar as well as our antagonists Koba who's rivalry carries this film and sets up the next installment in this franchise perfectly!",

Wherever women dominance in a show there's definitely one or more people wonder about it, point it out saying ''wHy'' but when it's all male beings they don't. What's funny is no matter what form they take male beings are always same, they get emotional, hysterical, and violent easily. No matter ''human'' or apes it's always male beings that start wars. They just act like monkeys like they've never evolved. What hopeless creatures. In that perspective what a great representation this show is.",

These tiny details make Dawn a unique piece of cinema. All jungle scenes are done so well that they make real footage of National Geographic seem ordinary. All apes and humans characters make you root for them even the evil ones. Caesar's elder son's emotional journey is soothing and his younger's son's first encounter with humans is heart warming. At the same time, ape Koba's encounter with two humans guarding the weapons and his ever rising conflict with Caesar is chilling.",

            "content": "'Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes' was released in cinemas in 2014, and is the sequel to the surprisingly impressive 2011 hit movie 'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes'. Set 10 years later, and the world spreading disease that is hinted at in the end credits scene of 'Rise Of\u0085' has wiped out most of the human population, the apes have grown in both numbers and intelligence, and live on the outskirts of San Francisco as a community led by Caesar. With no interaction between humans and apes for so long all seems well, but the remaining humans in the city are struggling as the power source they need is dwindling and the only hope is to reroute power from a hydroelectric dam back to the city. Only the ape community now live so close to the dam and a power struggle ensues between the apes and man. The apes blame humans for the history of experiments and captivity they endured, and the humans blame the apes for the virus that wiped out most of mankind. There is also a power struggle going on amongst the apes themselves too, as Caesar still has some compassion for man and doesn't wish for any further confrontation between apes and man, but realises the relationship between species will always be strained. Yet one chimp, named Koba, has let his hatred of humans fester and grow and sees them strictly as the enemy, and although he respects Caesar as his leader, he begins to distrust Caesar's feelings for humans. This movie is outstanding. Director Matt Reeves certainly delivers. 'Dawn Of\u0085' looks amazing right from the opening scene, the action is plentiful, there are some incredibly powerful scenes with some genuinely emotional moments too, but it has to be said, it is the power struggle between the apes themselves that is the film's most fascinating element. The special effects are fantastic. The motion capture work with the apes is truly impressive. Andy Serkis is back as Caesar, and his performance in 'Rise Of\u0085' was incredible but in this, he just gets better and better. He really is the heart and soul of these movies. I can't understand how this man has not been given an Oscar for his performance capture work. Jason Clarke plays Malcolm, who forms a bond with Caesar. He is a good actor and his performance is very natural, at times it honestly looks like he isn't acting. Gary Oldman is also in this movie, and as in every film he has been in he is just superb. His role as Dreyfus, is almost the human equivalent of Caesar. He is the leader of the surviving humans and will do anything to protect his community, just like Caesar with the apes. As much as this movie is visually spectacular, the direction, the cinematography, the music, and the performances, there is such a fascinating, emotional core to this film where you get really involved and attached to the apes. 'Dawn of\u0085.' improves in every way from its predecessor. Everything about this movie is better than 'Rise Of\u0085', and as Matt Reeves has directed the upcoming 'War For The Planet Of The Apes', I am very excited for its release. This is a superb film. Make sure you add both 'Rise Of\u0085' and 'Dawn Of\u0085' to your DVD collection.",

            "review_title": "Dawn of a New Kind of Filmmaking",
            "content": "I've long been awaiting this sequel to 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which means my expectations have been building for three years. To say the least, I had very high expectations. I was weary going in to this film. The change in director, cast and tone made me nervous. Reeves and the writers were asking us to follow Caesar, our favorite ape, which isn't hard to do, but not writing in familiar human characters was a risky move. This sequel almost doesn't feel like a sequel, it almost feels like a reboot. The first 15 minutes of the film is entirely about the apes. You do not see a single human in the first 15 or so minutes. This was a brilliant move. It introduced us into this entirely new world, one we weren't yet familiar yet. We meet, yet again, Caesar, who is now the leader of 300 or so apes, married to a sick, pregnant ape; and father to his confused, reckless and emotional son Blue Eyes. Then there's his loyal followers, his right hand men, and those who follow because he is the strongest ape. And then we are introduced to the movie's main villain: Koba. A multi-dimensional, hate- filled, anger driven villain who's resentment towards humans eventually leads him to his defeat. Koba truly does love his kind. He wants them to be safe. And that's his original motive in fighting the humans. But his motive shifts later in the film when his narcissism and inferiority are fueled by Caesar's disagreement, driving him into a blinding anger and irresistible thirst for being in control. Shortly afterwards, we are introduced to our main human cast. There's Dreyfus, leader/dictator of the small band of humans, who's role is big but screen time is small. Told simply through emotion and no words, the past 10 years have ended in nothing but tragedy for this man. The implied death of his family inspires Dreyfus to lead and protect his people, and eventually forces him, in the end, to topple the tower and inform the military of the ape's existence. Carver is the first human to appear on screen. The shot he fires that injures Ash is arguably the beginning of the war. In my opinion, if Koba and Carver's characters had never existed, peace would have been achievable (at least temporarily), but their constant disobedience, unreliability and dishonesty were the largest catalysts in the inevitable war between ape and man. It doesn't take long for Malcolm to establish himself as our main man. Jason Clarke performs the role perfectly and delivers a character strong enough to carry the film through it's entire 130 minutes. Just like its predecessor, do not go into the theater expecting an action film. It is not. It's a sci-fi, a drama. Moments where a director would throw in action, Reeves instead hands us a thought-provoking, character-improving scenes that make this film as great as it is. I don't want to give too much away, but the film isn't about war, the film is about loss and survival and hope and the difficulty in maintaining peace. It's about how we, as humans, need someone to blame for our losses. We strive for revenge though it is and always will be our destruction. The CGI in this film was better than it was in Rise. I felt as if what I was seeing on screen actually was real. The sound mixing was superb. And the entire film itself is what I'd like to call a masterpiece. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will not only revolutionize motion-capture CGI in films, but hopefully it will inspire other writers and directors to realize that there is a balance between action and character development. That, when working together, they can produce something magnificent. Just as Caesar believed would happen if humans and apes had only been willing to sort out their differences. Superb!",

            "content": "Summer season is back once again, and because of it we usually get an onslaught of films to cash in by being mindless, but entertaining films. While many films in the summer season follow this format, there are some exceptions to this rule. Occasionally you will get a much more intelligent smart film that while being fun, also forces it's audiences to actually focus and think about the events on screen, rather than just simply absorbing explosions and mindless violence for two hours. One of these exceptions was Rise of the Planet of the Apes, an absolutely brilliant film that was not only a surprisingly solid prequel, but it was as good (if not better) than the original Planet of the Apes. It was an intelligent, fun and complex film full of great performances (especially that of Andy Serkis) and ideas. It was so good that it instantly became one of the best films of 2011. So naturally, I was excited for this follow up, especially when it got glowing reviews from critics and the public alike. Sadly, I'm not as enthusiastic. While there are great things in there, it is mostly a disappointment that it a step back for the franchise.The plot is that a while after the Simian Flu from Rise has wiped out most of humanity, the apes led by Ceaser believe that they are at peace. However, the remaining humans are trying to survive and are often clashing with the apes to do so. Add some loose cannon apes intent on wiping out these humans and the fact that the humans needs to use the ape's land in order to get energy creates a potential conflict between ape and man. While the plot does manage to continue Rise's story, it does feel a lot more simple this time around and therefore the overall scope of the film feels smaller because of it.This also extends to the rest of the writing as well. Whereas Rise had complex themes about humanity and love that while detailed were very subtle, the themes here are blatant and are in your face without any sort of subtly whatsoever. This is further cemented by the extreme one- dimensional characters in both groups, with a gun-happy prejudiced man in the human's corner and an evil ape called Kopa in the apes, intending on killing the humans and taking over the apes, feeling that Ceaser is too soft, even if he is a fascist ruler who kills or imprisons his own when they don't agree with him. This is blatantly obvious symbolism for how a totalitarian state is weak as they are usually ruled by evil dictators who have no sense of co-operation or reality. Sure this may invite comparisons to Animal Farm, another story that uses animals to represent a totalitarian state, but the whole story wasn't just based on symbolism, whereas here, a lot of the story is structured through this symbolism and seems to rely on it heavily because of it.Because of this, the other strong elements of the film suffer. The strong first half of the film has many emotional and interesting moments and like Rise develops many complex themes with the apes becoming more human and some of the human characters are becoming more animistic in order to survive, creating an interesting contrast between the two. However, this is dumped for the more abrupt action heavy second half, which scraps these themes in favour of obvious political commentary and one-dimensional characterization as unlike Rise which took the time to build up to it's action oriented climax, the action here comes abruptly, only being here it seems because it's a summer movie and feels utterly forced because of it. Sure it has good action, but takes any the intelligence of the film. It doesn't help that the characterization is pretty bland too. Sure Ceaser is still a brilliant and interesting character, whose scenes are often the best in the film, as he faces issues of war, betrayal and being a father, and Andy Serkis delivers another brilliant mo-cap performance, even if he doesn't have as much screen time as one would hope. However, the rest of the characters don't hold up as well. The aforementioned one-dimensional characters of both species are not interesting, Jason Clarke's Malcolm is a good if uninspired hero, his family are given barely anything to do and Gary Oldman's character is merely a plot device to get the story to where it needs to go, and is the biggest waste of a great actor in a film since Kate Winslet in Divergent, even if his character's actions are a lot dumber. It also doesn't help that the film feels smaller than it's predecessor, which is rather odd for a sequel to do. The world feels a lot smaller, the simple plot feels more like a plot for the 70's POTA TV series and there's not much in terms of grand spectacle. There's nothing that matches the ape riot of Rise or anything in director Matt Reeves' Cloverfield for example. It honestly feels more like build up to future films than anything, feeling more like a stop-gap rather than something on it's own. True, the film isn't completely awful, as there are some things that are good, even great, here. The CGI is great as usual, the performances are brilliant and there are moments here and there and as it's own film it's not too bad. But as part of the Apes franchise, it is about as average and as disappointing as Beneath the Planet of the Apes, and shares the same problems. There is interesting stuff, but it tosses aside that in favour of blander characters and a smaller scope than it's predecessor. It's not bad, but rather more disappointing. Hopefully future sequels can fix the film's problems, but as it stands, the franchise is dangerously close to losing it's way. Wait to rent it.",

WETA also returned to make the apes in the Dawn even better than Rise.I personally was a little apprehensive I thought the 2011 revival was less than desirable, I found the apes to be a below the standard expected in the modern blockbuster. However this time around in Dawn, the apes were incredible, if you were to watch not knowing they were CG, you would believe easily that these were real apes. Which really helps buy into the story, you feel like these apes truly are apes that have started evolving to rival humans, given they have been evolving rapidly over the 10 years since the ape revolution.Some of the motion capture performances in Dawn were incredible, stand outs in that bracket well, obviously one had to be Andy Serkis, we all know he is the go to man for mocap and this film is no different for others. The other stand out was Toby Kebbell who is a newbie to the franchise playing the returning Koba (played by Christopher Gordon in Rise), Kebbell was phenomenal as Koba this time around, Koba is physically and mentally broken and Kebbell shows that in his performance it oozes intimidation and fear in equal measure, up there with some of the great performances by Serkis himself in my opinion.The complete contrast of Serkis' Ceaser an ape of compassion, love and understanding to Kebbel's Koba was an incredible watch on the big screen. Their performances really help you feel like you're watching apes, something Rise was lacking I found. The technical heights (even literally) that Dawn reaches are incredible, some of the CG in the film will rival the best you have seen.Not to say that wasn't a few parts of the film that were a let, one scene that comes to mind included two light machine guns, you have to see to believe the mediocrity of it. It is something you expect to see in a B movie or a spoof film, didn't really feel right in this blockbuster master-class. Plus the complete under usage of Gary Oldman, in my opinion by far the greatest actor in the film, I mean nobody even comes close to his ability to me, and to under use him was a travesty. Second time this year a huge blockbuster has underused their best actor, \"Godzilla\" did the same with Cranston.Overall, the film was a great watch, packed to the rafters with action and drama with a nice splicing of character development. Director Matt Reeves makes the most of all things at his disposal (Oldman excluded) and uses them beautifully making one of those rare occurrences in which a sequel is superior than is predecessor. Highly advise this film, making my excitement for the third more than I ever expected after the first, Matt Reeves has brought a new lease of life to the apes franchise which I'm hoping is a long lasting franchise. If you didn't like the first I will say Kebbell and Serkis' performances will blow you away in this film along with the CG and the story.",

            "content": "Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a solidly good film but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes expands on everything established in that film to great effect.The film is set ten years after the events of Rise where the ALZ-113 virus has spread across the globe wiping out most of humanity. Caesar's community of apes has grown considerably, and they believe humans to have wiped each other out until two apes stumble across a human in the woods and the narrative starts to progress.What I really liked about the narrative was the dynamic of the separate communities of humans and apes, with both just wanting to do what is needed to survive. In that sense the distrust certain humans and apes had for each other was understandable, even for the villain Koba who's hatred for humans fuelled most of his actions. This was rather thought-provoking and I enjoyed how that was explored.The special effects are brilliant once again with how the apes are brought to life and appear like they are a real part of this world, and from that Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell give excellent performances as Caesar and Koba respectively. Their dynamic as contrasting characters was one of the best parts of the film, which was fulfilled in a very cathartic way with Caesar dropping Koba from a great height to his death after he had betrayed him.However, for the human characters the performances were rather bland, especially from Jason Clarke, and surprisingly Gary Oldman who is usually very assured. His character didn't have much to do in the narrative either which was a little disappointing.In the end though this was an emotionally complex second instalment to the Planet of the Apes prequel trilogy, and one that sets up the final film in an effective manner.",

I really felt that it was sort of like a director's cut more than anything else.What really made it great was that it followed Ceasar and his ape tribe. It also really took a short view of the humans and the virus that plagued the world. It stuck to it's story and made us believe that these apes were creatures that have feelings, family, and overall an emotional brotherhood connection. AND it gave you the spook factor of living in a \"lost world\" and gave you that tense grab of the unknown.One thing I felt they pushed was the fact that guns were a major plot wrench that fell into the gears and messed up this almost peaceful utopia between humans and apes to live as one. But what it did do is set up this series for about ten more sequels and allow you to branch out into different parts of the new Planet Apes world.For those that liked the first reboot Apes movie, you're going to have a better time with this one.",

After a virus infects the human population people are dying because of this virus. For the next 4 years humans were fighting this virus. Then another 4 years fighting each other. Caesar who leads a community of apes has a wife and 2 children. A couple humans walk into Caesar's community and ask him if they can fix a dam that can help their community of survivors have electricity. This leads to a peace agreement between the apes and the humans. But that only last for awhile while each side is preparing for war. *Review: This is probably one of the best sequels that I have ever seen. 1. The Dark Knight 2. Empire Strikes Back 3. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Those are my top 3 sequels ever made. Andy Serkis as Caesar is amazing the academy needs to give him a Oscar nomination for this role. Or once he stops doing motion capturing the academy needs to give him an honor award for his career. The visual effects even look better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The visual effects also need a Oscar nomination. The acting is really good too also there are better characters. In Rise there seemed to be some characters that were just useless. Also the action scenes are just amazing and they are very intents. I was at the edge of my seat during those scenes. They don't reference that much from the old Planet of the Apes but some from Rise. The score in the film feels like from the 1968 version. The story is very interesting but it does feel slow at times but that doesn't bother me one bit. This movie just has some great moments. You get to see apes fight a bear and another ape riding a horse while shooting 2 machine guns. Overall this is probably one of the best movies that I've seen so far this summer. Also I can't wait for the sequel and Matt Reeves is returning to direct the next movie and I trust him. \"War has already begun.\"-Caesar",

            "content": "I was very cautious about this sequel. When it was announced, I wondered how they could possibly top Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Then Rise director Rupert Wyatt bowed out and I had even more fears that it was going to be a Tim Burtonesque ape disaster. I needn't have worried. Matt Reeves has come in and done a superb job of directing. Fox also wisely kept Rise writers Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa on board. They started out writing movies like The Hand That Rocks The Cradle which was okay if derivative. There was no indication that they would have the capacity to write anything as layered as Rise or Dawn of the Planet of the Apes then. For me, they are the best screenwriters currently working in Hollywood and I'm not alone in thinking that. Steven Spielberg has hired them to write the new Jurassic Park movie Jurassic World while James Cameron has them working on two of the Avatar sequels. Praise from Caesar(s).The expert writing is old-school brilliant. It is patient, this is not a dumbed-down action movie to placate non-English-speaking markets. The story and characters have the complexity of a novel. Perhaps this will make movie studios see that audiences want intelligent movies that stand up to repeat viewing as Dawn will and not forgettable junk that's little more than chewing gum for the eyes.The crux of the story revolves around several power struggles. Ape leader Caesar, raised by kind humans, is struggling internally with his love for humans but also with their capacity for cruelty towards animals that he experienced first-hand in Rise. His second-in-command is Koba, a laboratory chimpanzee who was never shown the good side of humanity. As Koba puts it, he was caged and tortured and points to his scarred body as an example of \"human work.\" He wants to wipe out all people. Koba is the embodiment of human guilt over our treatment of animals. He would be the villain of the piece but he was made so by humans and like all great villains, you see where he is coming from and you even slightly admire and like him until you remind yourself that he is a killer (Shakespeare did that with characters like Richard III). If animals did rise up against us, they would be totally justified in annihilating us as that is what we have done to them since the dawn of time. The power struggle on the ape side is reflected on the human side. Gary Oldman is the Koba of the humans; he fears apes, doesn't trust them and wants to obliterate them all. Oldman is only in the movie for about ten minutes at the start and end and you kind of wonder why a great actor is given such little screen time and so little to do. It was probably a marketing thing. He is the only real big name actor in this movie and they needed someone to put on the poster to sell it. The writers understand that drama is conflict and with these constant power struggles and hunting and war scenes, there is non-stop drama from start to finish in Dawn. The writers come to the fatalistic conclusion that however much the Doves on both sides try to placate the Hawks, the Hawks will get their war in the end.And get his war Koba does in spectacular fashion. The scene where Koba rides screaming on horseback through flames with two machines guns blazing is like something out of Scarface (the way the apes speak also has more than an echo of Tony Montana.) There is also a nod to The Godfather when Caesar just barely survives Koba's assassination attempt (with a name like Caesar, he was always going to be a target for that) and starts doling out sage counter-attack strategies to his underlings like Brando's Don Corleone did. When the apes set fire to the San Franciscan human enclave, it's hard not to push the Caesar analogy and see it as Rome burning.The directing, ape acting (especially the indispensable Andy Serkis) and special effects are also superb but, more importantly, they mesh together perfectly with the writing to push the whole thing to another level. The Motion-Capture or Mo-Cap has evolved to the point where they can finally do realistic CGI eyes (just look at how bad the eyes of Jabba The Hutt are in the 1997 Special Edition of Star Wars to see what I mean but it was 17 years ago and technology has moved on a hell of a lot since then). No longer are the eyes glassy-looking, hollow and fake. These ape eyes show concentration, emotion and depth. For the first time, there is believable consciousness behind the eyes. They even end the movie on an extreme close-up of Caesar's eyes, there's confidence for you and the effect stands up to scrutiny.The Charlton Heston ape movies had Orang-Utans (the politicians/clergy) using Gorilla muscle (the army) to suppress the liberal scientist Chimpanzees. Gorillas have been docile so far and will have to start morphing into their militaristic future selves in the already-planned next Apes movie. That goes for the Orang-Utans too (We see in Dawn that Maurice is clearly The Lawgiver of the Heston movies teaching young apes their commandment that \"Ape Shall Not Kill Ape.\")I rarely want to see a movie a second time in the cinema but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of them. I was disappointed with X-Men: Days of Future Past, it was good but not great as I thought it would be. Edge of Tomorrow was okay but Dawn is the real deal. This will be looked on as a classic in future years and rightly so. It's thrilling to see a franchise so many of us grew up with being done better than the first time out. Long may it continue.",

            "content": "After the success of the first installment, one would think that it would be easier to evoke sympathy for the apes, the humans, or even the circumstances of this movie. But the only thing I can be happy about is that no chimps were harmed in the making of this movie because they are mostly CGI.The CGI, although not perfect, is not bad. That's not my primary complaint, nor are any of the special effects the reason I rated this a very middling score. The humans are simply unlikable and you kinda want the apes to win throughout, since they seem to be the more sensible of the 2 groups. One of the opening scenes is with a human shooting and killing one of the apes because he was afraid, though the ape made no aggressive gesture. If someone killed your son, what would your reaction be? The apes make a decision far wiser than the one I would have preferred. Add to that the same character defies the truce agreement while the apes allow the humans to do something that benefits them only, and the wiser of the 2 groups is immediately seen. Humans could use some of that retrovirus to become smarter, because their actions throughout the movie again and again prove that they are the lesser race.There is a bright spot in the movie and that is the acting done by Caesar/Andy Serkis. He brought a very humane character to life, and certainly made him the hero of the film.The plot itself is stale. Humans live in a community where they state they have an energy crisis, but instead of seeming worried, every member seems fat and happy, and they have enough provisions to truck around the area without issues. The plot stated that they were running out of diesel, presumably for generators, however, since the world is lost, my guess is that there is a ton of fuel in trucks all over the area. But no, these humans have got to get to a dam, which evidently works on 1960s technology, doesn't offer any benefit to the apes, although the apes control that territory, and somehow half a city lights up after being in the dark 10+ years without anyone throwing on a switch, and without any dusty circuit breakers blowing. So this plot is extremely formulaic, without any human creativity -- introduce 2 groups fighting over some introduced conflict point, throw in some backstabbing and betrayal and some really poor leadership decisions, and voila! You have the plot for about every un-creative film ever created by Hollywood. Usually, you want the humans to win (you won't in this case), and usually there is a clear hero and villain (aside from Caesar, again, not the case). What you are left with is a bowl of porridge, unexciting in any way, and maybe even a little upset that someone had to expend energy in bringing you this poor dish.This film could have set up the humans versus apes in a much better way. It could have introduced internal conflict and competing self-interest better, it could have done a lot of things. But it didn't. And that's why this film deserves its mediocrity. If not for the passable CGI and some very good acting, this film could have been made better with chimps writing the plot and directing.",

            "content": "Hollywood isn't exactly in the greatest state anymore. Year after year we get reboot after reboot, prequel after prequel, and sequel after sequel. It's getting stale but people still continue to buy into it. But if there is one reboot/prequel/sequel that I want people to buy into, it's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the sequels to follow. The fact of the matter is that this new rebooted franchise and its two films have become some of the smartest films to come out of Hollywood as of recently. Both have an incredible balance of well-crafted action pieces and dramatic scenes and Dawn only emphasizes that more. Dawn takes place ten years after the original film and Caesar played wonderfully once again by Andy Serkis leads apes in a community, some of them being from the previous films (Koba, Rocket, and Maurice). Caesar is also married to Cornelia (Judy Greer) and they have a son named Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston). Everything actually seems fine for this community at first, they haven't seen humans in two winters according to one of the apes but they eventually run into a pack of humans who simply want to get power using a generator at the dam nearby the ape's community. This obviously leads to some serious problems with argumentation on both sides with humans vs. humans, humans vs. apes, and apes vs. apes. Though it also has a sense of empathy and understanding between some of the human and ape characters that made the Apes franchise what it was in the first place. The movie manages to craft together a riveting drama that never lets up and is incredibly entertaining and thrilling to watch for the entire run time and that in itself is great to see in a Hollywood blockbuster.It isn't just repetitive action scene after action scene instead the scenes have depth and wonderful cinematography as well. The action scenes can even be frightening to watch and are extraordinarily gripping and feel very similar to the scenes from the previous Apes' films: Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for the Planet of the Apes. But the scenes are even better in Dawn with the gorgeous CGI the movie has that makes these apes so utterly believable. The movie manages to throw allusions out to those sequels in a playful and smart way (especially with the very last shot of the film) instead of in a forceful way; it's genuine treat for fans of the franchise\u0085as this entire film truly is.Dawn just makes me a happy film-goer. It makes me excited to go to see big budget movies again if they can actually be like this. The movie manages to explore real, serious conflict between these characters and give them strong emotional resonance without it seeming forceful and in the way; it feels real and honest and not hollow and shallow like so much is nowadays. It isn't clich\u00e9 or contrived rather it is intelligent and absolutely engaging to watch on screen, the story is strong and so are the characters that inhabit this story. The characters are truly complex on both sides and aren't two-dimensional and it'd be almost impossible for the main set of characters to be two-dimensional with the conflict set upon them. As a whole, Dawn is an extremely violent, enveloping pushing Hollywood drama but it never leaves its science fiction or genre film roots, it manages to remember what it is while also giving something entirely engaging and unique in the realm of repetition, it is exactly what Hollywood needs right now. As a new fan of the Apes franchise (I just marathoned through each and every film fairly recently), this movie places second out of every single film with only the original being the better film mostly for the sole fact that the original film certainly had more interesting political/social commentary than this film really had but Dawn decided to move away from strong political commentary and went with a solely riveting drama and it worked. Oh I forgot to mention, Michael Giacchino's score\u0085wow. That is all. Just incredible, I don't even need to talk about it more; best score of the year so far, just absolutely sweeping pieces of music.",

            "content": "I am treating this movie as being one movie in three parts, so my review of all three parts is the same. Trilogies are often weak. And often trilogies don't make a lot of sense. The filmmakers just want to make more movies, and the studios are happy to oblige if it means making more money. A good example of this is the back to the future trilogy, where the last two films are kind of redundant. Another example is the last Star Wars trilogy, where the finishing movie sort of destroys the goodwill that the first two films in the series had built up. But this trilogy is a true trilogy. The first film deals with the young life of the protagonist, the second deals with his middle-age, and the third deals with the last act of his life. So it is possible to take all of these films as one. What do they suggest to us? The animation of the non-human, this is done in a sympathetic and really moving way. It's also interesting to see how the technology developed from the first movie to the last movie. Instead of talking about each individual film as something that's cut off from the others, I will make one big review for all three. The good things about this film are its plots, the special effects, and the action. It touches on big themes of man's hubris when it comes to dealing with other intelligent animals, and also the hubris that can cause catastrophe in the pursuit of money, or even just to save someone you love. It makes a person ask themselves tough, and yet profound questions. For example, are you really a good person, if your actions cause the deaths of billions of people? Is murder ever acceptable? I like also how there is this contrast between the main characters of Caesar and Koba. The movie presents Caesar as being a noble leader in the first and second parts, but by the end while it is not clear to those around him, it is clear to himself that his selfishness, and his desire for revenge, have had more disastrous consequences for his people, than the evil actions of his nemesis. The things that are bad about this series of films are so inconsequential that it is almost pointless to mention. Almost, but not entirely pointless, because it can teach us how even perfect works of art, are not perfect. So, here are the flaws in this masterpiece. The first thing is that Caesar leads an ape rebellion in the first film, and this rebellion mainly takes place over the span of an afternoon. The apes that Caesar leads are fighting to get to one particular place. As they are walking to the battle, there is a sign which has been painted with the symbol of their rebellion. Which is the window that Caesar saw from his room growing up. So there are two logical explanations to this; the first is that Caesar painted the symbol on the sign so that the other Apes would know where to go, and the second is that one of the apes stole some paint and painted on the sign as they were making their way to the battle. The other major mistake is in the character of Koba. He is presented as being just a smart as Caesar, but much more violent. He is a bonobo. Bonobos are a species of great ape, like humans or chimpanzees, except they differ from their cousins in the fact that they resolve their conflicts by using sex. As a result of this, they are much less violent than humans or chimpanzees. It doesn't detract at all from the story, because you have to be an expert primatologist to understand the difference between Koba and the other apes. The last mistake, is not really a mistake at all, it is a storytelling choice. In the first movie there is a human character who is quite close to Caesar. In the second movie, he is nowhere to be seen. There are two reasons, one is connected to the events of the second movie, and how it would have been very unlikely for that human character to survive them, and the other is that the story isn't about the humans at all it's about Caesar and his community, and their growing into full humanity. In fact, none of the human characters reappear in any movie of the series. The last thing I would like to mention, is again something that might seem to be a mistake, but is a stylistic choice, and that is Caesar's voice. In the first movie he says two words. By the second movie, he says a few sentences. And by the last movie he is speaking in full paragraphs. The only other ape that speaks as much as him, is Koba. By the end of the series, an ape, who has only used sign language, says a few sentences. This stylistic choice, shows Caesar coming to grips with his humanity.

It's different from what you'd expect it to be. The CGI is phenomenal, and is beautifully shot. It has a sense of realism about it, the apes feel just as real as the humans, that's how good the effects are and performance of the actors who play them. Don't try and guess the plot either because again, it's deliberately done in a way that you think you know what will happen but there's little surprises all the way through. I've seen comments saying 'it's boring' it really isn't. If you listen to the film, the plot and storyline makes so much sense and keeps you on edge all the time. The cinema I went to, people let out gasps and I could hear people sobbing. It defiantly is better than anticipated. The actors are great in it. And I really can't understand why anyone would even consider this film as rubbish, it's literally fantastic.",

This movie skyrockets past Rise of the Planet of the Apes, giving this film a much higher adrenaline rush. From start to finish it makes you wonder what is going to happen next and it depicts brilliantly the struggle of \"ape v human\", \"ape v ape\", and even... \"human v human\". You will appreciate this film 10 times more if you have seen Rise. This is because in Rise, they help you get attached to Caesar and how he is really just like a regular person. Caesar is the peace between the Apes and Humans, but unfortunately there is always a villain, in this case it is Koba. If you became attached to Caesar in Rise, you will become more attached in Dawn. I am looking forward to watching the next war, but also skeptical of where the series is going. What is next for Caesar? In my opinion, Caesar is now the star of the show, and will be the leading role in the next film. Unlike the previous 2. Tip of the hat to the actors in this film, they were all phenomenal. A very well done to Andy Serkis who relentlessly deserves an Oscar nomination for his efforts.Best of the summer? I would say top 3. Not the best.",

It picks up perfectly from Planet of the Apes movie from 2011 and This movie definitely deserves the ratings it's getting yet I wouldn't put it at the number one spot as blockbuster of the summer. Definitely at number two though. I am eager to see the third following and what the future beholds for the very little humans left!

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was promoted to be a bigger, better and even yet more epic than its last film (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, in which was the reboot of the franchise) and with the great direction of Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In), a truly well chosen cast consisting of Jason Clarke, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Andy Serkis and Tody Kebbell and backed up by a great story of emotion, survival and action. Dawn of Apes succeeds to be a worthy sequel of the series by far and it overthrows the previous installment.The story takes place years after the climatic events of 'Rise' where human life has now become fragile and seems to have nearly wiped out its kind off Earth, while Apes seems to have a place called home among the destroyed human life, with many of their kind in peace and lead truly by leader Caesar. The relationship between Man and Ape here is dangerous, broken and untrustworthy but it may have a chance to reconcile when humans offer for help in getting resourceful power for their collapsed city from the Ape's homeland, dry of resources to survive. At first, it seems unlikely for the humans but Caesar is keen to help them under the promise that they leave his kind alone. What follows next is a battle of emotion, trust, redemption and even determines the future race of both sides; they will face each other with personal experiences, discovered power and fight on till the end.What I really enjoyed about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the fact that it takes the concept of survival further than what Rise of Apes did, Reeves having experienced a sci-fi adventure themed films such as Cloverfireld brings the bleak vision of collapsed civilization, showing the humans as broken spirited but determined to survive while the apes are seen as powerful but face problems of their own as much as the humans undergo. Emotion plays a big part along the apes and human character, showing who is good, bad or even undecided, and Reeves as well brings some big action sequences half way of the film, that makes the tension break further than what it has done already.Performances here are truly phenomenal and it features some amazing character work from Clarke (in his first leading role for once), McPhee, Russell and Oldman. The ape characters again are truly amazing and are taken slightly further here, with Serkis giving another powerhouse performance as Caesar. Acclaimed visual effects team WETA Workshop help provide the film some truly beautiful yet realistic motion-capture effects of the apes, which proves both to audiences and the film-making industry that they are truly award worthy and are the best in what they do, and Serkis brings an important role in proving motion capture performance along with Kebbell and co. The music score here is composed by Michael Giacchio (Star Trek Into Darkness, The Incredibles and Speed Racer), he brings both an epic and intense score in the vein of Hans Zimmer's work. Lastly the script has a lot of major qualities that could be even considered for awards, showcasing some great moments of tension, heart, action and even bravery that the characters undergo.Summarise, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is truly a spectacular sequel and as well a box-office hit for winter (Summer for the Americans) and it should get enough attention from the fans of the reboot and even the original film series.Facebook 'MovieNerd91' for my reviews :)http://movienerd91.weebly.com/",

If this is the first time I get the feeling that maybe I should just go and not see the whole movie I don't know, but I still got that feeling. Already at the beginning watching the apes talk makes me wanna laugh, thats all. It's just hilariously, thats all it is and I can't take them seriously. The visuals are nice, I can't deny that - but I am not watching movies because I want cool visuals, I am watching them because I want it to be a good movie with a good story and good characters and a good script. I don't feel like this had any of these. The movie is boring, predictable and never really exciting. Neither did I ever get emotional with the apes. Not even once.

Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of him. There is enough action, emotion and epic special effects to keep anyone amused. The whole thing was just so perfectly put together.

            "content": "I was very eagerly waiting for this movie to come out after being spell bound by the last one. I am glad to say that this is even bigger and more beautiful. The movie starts with a brief introduction of the last movie so that even the first timers of the series won't have troubles over connecting the dots. This movie takes place ten years later from where the last left off. Most of the human race is wiped off in Simian Flu while the survivors have gathered in a colony, in efforts to reach out the others who are alive in any part of the world. Electricity is running out, there is very little resources left. In order to start with the power problem they go out in the dense forests with plans of restoring the long lying unused dam for hydro-electricity. This is also where the Apes have established their home, living as a family and being by each other's side in difficulties. It is then the clash begins and certain situational misunderstandings and betrayals take it to another level of twists and thrill. The director has done a fantastic job of keeping the audience engaged by keeping the Apes enraged. The music seems very familiar and thus conventional. It's difficult to individualise it as a signature tone for any of the characters or even the movie. The acting has been top notch, particularly Andy Serkins who is now going to be known by this film among other fantastic characters that he has played. The cinematography looked enjoyable in few scenes like the time when the war begins with the tumbling horses ridden by the Apes and one other scene where an Ape called Koba rides a tank breaking the wall that served as human shield, though it is not picture perfect everywhere. But these technical flaws can easily be overlooked with the screenplay that balances emotions, drama, and action and thrills very well. It certainly leaves you with satisfaction and thus will serve as a great choice for the weekend.I am certainly looking forward for the third one (it has strong clues of return), to understand what new magic trick will the director now impress us after raising the bar so high.",

People, when they take away your guns, then they are going to take everything. The Chinese were stupid for handing their guns over to the government. I saw the movie which looks good in 3 D, and I liked the part where the monkey, Buka shoots the leader with the gun and claims the humans shot him, then burns down their village, and claims the humans did that. That's what governments do to start wars, like 'Gulf of Tonkin' in Vietnam, when the U.S. painted our boats like Vietnamese boats and attacked our own boats to get support from our people to start a war. Governments always lie to start wars. I saw no redeeming or social value in this, though, and you won't walk out of this movie wanting to improve your life.

            "content": "When a second installment of a series is released, it's always crucial to see how it built up from its foundation. In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, multiple ideas, themes, and discoveries introduced on the first film are expanded upon, improving the series' direction as a whole.This includes: Being able to behold--in thorough detail--the lifestyle and construction of the apes' habitat as reigned by Caesar. Establishing more ape characters who are emotionally resonant and well developed with their sense of identity. Seeing the devastating effects of the spread virus in San Francisco.And Finally:Building on the relationship aspects between human and ape, focusing on their perspectives towards each other, and the apes' morale towards humans. This last point is what brings Dawn into smart, thought- provoking material. The relationship dynamics are complex, and not as black and white as you would expect them to be. Viewers can end up sympathizing and hating characters from both the humans' and the apes' sides, as there is a mutual connection and similarity drawn between the two.However, keep in mind that this is a distinct change from the previous movie. The first movie, was adventurous and curious in the sense you watched Caesar and others grow up in different environments (lab, suburbia, kennel) etc. all the way to the revolt. The tone was also much livelier. The new tone is darker, more serious, and relies on the drama more so than the energy spectacle of the first. However, at the last act of the movie, you will get the battle sequences you've been waiting for.If it's another thing for sure the apes are given the focus they deserve, you might even say they have MORE screen time than the humans!All in all, the technical dynamics are great, but could use more flair, more energy. 7.5/10",

            "content": "In 2011, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' caught everybody off guard. After the terribly misguided remake of the original 'Planet of the Apes' in 2001 by Tim Burton, people weren't expecting much from another reboot of the franchise. So it was a pleasure to discover a clever, entertaining new entry into the franchise. Instead of actors portraying apes in heavy make-up; We were giving brilliant CGI apes, and a central ape named Caesar portrayed through motion capture by the king of the artform, Andy Serkis. This new film is a worthy continuation of that 2011 reboot, although it lacks in some aspects. Regardless, this is a solid summer sequel with unbelievably realistic CGI, solid performances, and heavy emotional resonance. We begin 10 years after the conclusion of the last film. The 'Simian Flu' has spread around the world and wiped out most of human life. The apes on the other hand are doing just fine. Flourishing actually, living in the dense forest of San Francisco in an impressive fort-like structure built from the trees surrounding them. Ceasar is still the leader amongst the apes, and their loyalty to him is unflinching. Early on, we see two younger apes in the woods hunting, when they come across a human wandering alone from a group of humans. This alarms the entire ape tribe, and Ceasar with all of his mightiness speaks once more and tells the humans to leave.It so happens that a population of humans have a genetic immunity (at least for now) to the Simian flu. They're residing in San Francisco, but are on the verge of using up all of their power reserves. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) returns with his group from the woods and informs the humans leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) about the exceptional apes in the woods. Dreyfus is determined to reach a dam reserve in the woods that can restore power to their city, and let them begin to rebuild their world. And he will get this done, at whatever cost. Malcolm insists that he and his crew can get the apes trust through Ceasar, that will allow them to rig the dam without any conflict. But then, we wouldn't have a movie. So as anyone should see coming, there is much conflict through betrayal, and mistrust; Leading to the last hour of the movie that plays out exactly how one would expect. War.Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) has taken a definitive dark, broody tone in this film. For me personally, it feels like 2 films in 1. After the first hour of the film, I was convinced I was watching a masterpiece. Then once the cards were laid out, and we realize that we've been building to an exuberant action film for the latter half; It's just okay. The sum of these two halves balance out for me to become one good film. Not great. Not groundbreaking. But a good film. My biggest issue against it is the amount of emotion and time spent building the ape characters, which I appreciate. But then dissolving all of this time into an hour long battle sequence in the end. We form bonds with Caesar's family, and his inner circle of most trusted apes. They've all evolved a form of communication with hand gestures (we read subtitles), and through this language, and the miracle of facial motion capture; We understand their emotions. We see into their souls. This is the strongest point of the film for me, and I wish it could have stayed on this track throughout. They revisit it towards the end, but we've already been distracted. However it's the first time I believe in this long standing series of originals, reboots, and remakes that we really see into the apes world and psyche. For that, I applaud Reeves and his team. And the work that Andy Serkis does with this motion capturing is unbelievable. If not an Oscar nomination, the man needs high recognition as an actor. The work he does which includes Gollum in the LOTR series, King Kong (2005), and countless other films; The man is extraordinary. His movements, dialect, facial expressions. It's all spot on.In conclusion, this is another solid entry into this Summer's array of blockbusters. I still prefer 'Rise' over this one. Perhaps it was due to my low expectations and high reward back then. Who knows? Regardless, 'Dawn' has solid performances from good cast. It's an emotional ride for the first half, and then an action packed (perhaps too much so) roller coaster for the second half. Some people have hailed it as flawless. I could've used a bit less. However, even I can admit: An ape on horseback firing duel assault rifles, is simply badass.",

            "content": "The star of this show is without a shadow of a doubt Andy Serkis' Caesar. The character himself is a much more complex ape than we saw in 'Rise'. He has to balance Vito Corleone-esque family duties with an at times burdening leadership, whilst also having to contend with the mesmerisingly malevolent Koba (Kebbell). The range of emotions that Serkis is able to portray through the magic that is Mo-Cap is incredible. After a while you forget that each of the Monkeys that we see are all men clad in green morph suits and laden with small sensors. This could be the film that makes Mo-Cap relevant in the same way that the superlative Avatar made 3D a serious concept in Hollywood. Fortified by Caesar's brilliance, I don't think it's too far a stretch to say that this form of production is the future of special affects, as it's allowing acting to make a comeback after over a decade of computer generated monopoly. That being said, the actual action sequences are stunningly executed and are rich with tension from beginning to end and there are times when this feels more like an action thriller than a sci-fi.Less convincing are the humans in the piece, as well as a slightly predictable main story. Malcolm, played by the ever dependable Jason Clarke, is perhaps the only human who is allowed a back story and enough time on screen to grow and show some depth. His chemistry with Caesar really drives the story onwards, but the rest of the human cast seem somewhat underused. The epitome of this is the brilliant Gary Oldman, who is only afforded a small amount of back story and time on screen and I feel like that's a waste. Moreover, Clarke's new family just seems like a very blatant attempt to force the viewer to see the overriding similarities, not differences, between the apes and the humans. However none of this ever really annoys to any great extent as the mixture of the Apes and the action remedies any minor problems.Therefore when you look at this as a whole it is simply fantastic. It's a sprawling action epic laced with heart, tension and deceit and builds upon 'Rise's' positives. Towards the end of the film the sun does indeed rise and the light of dawn floods through San Francisco. Of course when you look at the film trilogy (with a third installment expected in 2016) this does represent the birth of a new Earth and the start of a war but it may just signify the latest evolution to sci-fi and visual effects.

But I was quite excited to see dawn of the planet of the apes because the first one was great, and although i thought it would be hard for the sequel to compete with the rise of the planet of the apes, it's safe to say it is just as good. Dawn of the planet of the apes tells the story of the special ape Caesar from the first movie who is now grown up and is the leader of the ape family, and his 'adventure' in helping humans get back on their feet after the epidemic of a deadly virus.\u00a0 Dawn of the planet of the apes is a great movie with a great moral behind it. Honestly I was really angry when Koba killed Caesar and blamed it on the humans, it was totally unfair, but then i realized that it is fair to capture humans because what they had once done to the apes are worse than just putting them in a cage. This movie is an example of what goes around comes back around, but it can come back ten times worse. Not every humans are the same, they share similarities but that doesn't make them the same, and its not wrong to be a bad person, everyone has been bad, but it is not okay to turn our backs on each other. People are disgusted by animals but we can be worse than them at times. We put each other through hell all the time when we should have treated each other with respect and care cause we are family. I enjoyed the two hour movie all around. The storyline was okay, but my favorite aspect of this movie is the special effects. It's flawless. The movie was a little boring in the middle but it didn't bother me that much. Dawn of the planet of the apes is a great movie to watch with your family and friends. It is a movie about friendship, family, and trust. But not only the beautiful parts of it. I give it an 8/10",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is about hyper intelligent apes who have been genetically altered by humans. In the beginning of the film that causes no problems for anyone. In fact, the remaining humans are unaware of these super apes. Humans have almost completely died out from a deadly outbreak of a virus; which was made in a lab by scientists. Time is then manipulated, as ten years fly by within minutes. We are quickly taken into the near future. The remaining humans in San Francisco are nearly out of power, and are in desperate need to find a new source. When the humans explore for a power source, and stumble into the apes, they kill one. The apes, led by Caesar, are furious. They set specific boundaries that cannot be crossed by the humans. An early conflict arises when the humans need to cross, as they think they have found a new energy source. It is a dam on the apes territory. This dam could potentially power the remaining human's civilization. Written by Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver and adapted from the original novel, \"La Plan\u00e8te des Singes\" by Pierre Boulle, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a sequel to Rise of the Planets of the Apes. It is the 2nd film in the prequel series to the original movie Planet of the Apes. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is Directed by Matt Reeves. Jason Clarke as Malcolm, and Gary Oldman as Dreyfus star in this movie, as leaders of the human survivors. Keri Russell also stars in the movie. She plays Ellie, a human survivor and Malcolm's love interest. Andy Serkis voices Caesar, the leader of the apes. The Major Dramatic Question of the movie is \"What will happen next?\" This movie ends with a major cliffhanger, and the audience is left questioning to themselves about the future of this movie franchise; what will happen of Malcolm, how will the war between the two species go, are there more human survivors? A major psychological theme that recurs in this movie is greed. Koba, Caesar's 2nd in command, has an undying hatred of humans, lasting at least ten years after humans nearly died out. Caesar tolerates humans and their needs during this movie. Koba cannot stand how Caesar trusts humans and requests he rethink his policies towards humans. Caesar does not consider turning on the humans. Koba then attempts to kill Caesar and frames the humans. He then gains trust from most of the apes, who think their beloved leader, Caesar is dead, to attack the humans. Koba was willing to kill his leader for more power and to become the new leader. His greed proves to Caesar later in the film, that not all apes are great beings. This movie questions character motives. It asks why people, or the genetically modified apes in this case, act the way that they do. This makes the film a Psychological Realism. It's theme's and character development are the primary Elements of Drama involved in the movie, making it a Character/Thought Emphasis Genre. The characters Koba and Caesar have vastly different perspectives of the humans, and how to engage with them. One of the main elements of the movie is how they fight each other to get their way. A hugely important theme in this film is leadership. Leadership is relevant both in the human world, with Dreyfus and Malcolm, and in the ape world, with Caesar and Koba. Each leader has different approaches and works to influence their people. Caesar is a multi-dimensional character. In the exposition of this feature, he is a strong leader and wants nothing to do with the humans. When the humans need his help, and diplomatically request access to the dam he hesitantly allows them into the apes land. By the resolution of the movie, he realizes how many humans can be great people like Malcolm, Ellie or Will Rodman (from Rise of the Planet of the Apes), and ends up helping Malcolm, by warning him of the inevitable war. The major conflict in this movie is a physical one. It is the war between ape and human. This movie is much closer to the Fantasy side of the Scale of Verisimilitude. Even though parts of this movie is believable, the majority of the film is not possible and is a work of Fantastical Science Fiction. This movie is a fun summer flick. The CGI makes the apes look very real, helping the audience get really sucked into this fantasy film. The apes language use is slow, menacing and concise. They're deep voices are startling and add to character of the apes, particularly Caesar. The action scenes are exciting to watch. Both the depiction of how the humans live in their post- apocalyptic world, and how the apes live, in their forest tree houses is interesting. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes satisfies the Dual Purpose of Art. It entertains, arousing plenty of emotions. It thrills, excites, and terrorizes, with the thought of a interspecies war. It also instructs, stimulating the thoughts of the audience. It questions what will happen next, and how will the war proceed. This movie was a worthwhile watch, and an exciting, engaging film.",

A terrific idea!Although I abhor violence,and there was plenty, I found that it had so many moments of tenderness, understanding, and hope for both species.

This film captured the despair, the hope, the confusion of humans, as well as the apes, living in Muir woods. This film showed so much authenticity. Oh, there were questions I'd give the screenwriters, but basically, it pulled me in. Excellent CGI, and those EYES! Unbelievable. Do see it! You will be in awe!",

The Picture is fantastic!! but watching it in 3D doesn't enhance the experience much. 3. Great Acting (for the apes character) seriously, they overwhelm human character.some people don't like this movie probably they think it is kinda silly watching apes talk to each other.but whatever others said, you should try to watch it, and don't forget watch the previous one first, so you can fully enjoy this one.",

The story line keeps you wondering what will happen next and how will the war between apes and humans start. I found apes riding horses weird. But I guess this should be something normal in the movie since apes, like humans, were already speaking, building homes, and firing machine guns. The interesting plot twist was an ape deceiving his leader which started the war. At one point in the movie I thought it would happen but then as Ceasar exercised his leadership, I thought no one would dare deceive him.The apes' scenes talking to each other were great. They made them seem to interact with each other the same way humans do. Even the facial emotions. The facial emotions that were shown were just brilliant. The way the movie ends was also great. It makes you eagerly anticipate a sequel while thinking that for sure it will even be more amazing than this movie. This is a must see sci-fi movie that keeps you strapped to your seat and completely interested from the first till last minute.",

Rise is a stellar film- it pushed the bounds of motion capture technology and breathed fresh air into a near-dead franchise. It was a new story that did not follow the path it was expected and presented an interesting look into the history of the mythology of the films. Despite all this, it does fall short in some areas, but one of which is not the human characters. James Franco's Will is very fleshed out and essential to the plot. Unfortunately, this is where Dawn falls short. There are very nice moments with Malcom and his new family, but they just feel one dimensional. That's not to say I did not root for them and care for their relationship with the apes, however. They just felt plain. The actors did a fine job with their material, but it wasn't much to go on. Some characters were even just there to be there, since we need a big apocalypse group. But, for there ape counterparts, there is more to say. Andy Serkis, obviously, does a fantastic job. All of the mo-cap actors made me believe I was watching super-intelligent apes. Their mannerisms are spot-on. The directing is stellar- Matt Reeves is able to elevate his material and present a tense atmosphere. There are several jaw-dropping shots and great ape VFX. All in all, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is a film worth seeing for the apes alone. You feel as if you are with them, watching their primitive community and seeing their amazing interactions. But if you like big action, you will also find yourself at home with Dawn.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed the very first movie of the POTA franchise, the one with Charlton Heston. I think first movie of the POTA(1968) was one of the major stones of the sci-fi genre. So this is why I am a huge fan of POTA, and I always enjoyed watching it. I also liked the first one in the 2010s, but this one sadly is not an enjoyable movie.In the beginning I was shocked when I saw CGI effects of apes. It looked so realistic. It was not very impressive though. With these graphics apes are looking so lifeless. Because CGI effects was so much unnecessarily detailed and you can clearly see that these apes are CGI, and its annoying. But I have to admit that every little detail of characters was at master level, but unfortunately they were looking unnatural. Second thing that disturbs me is the message that the movie is trying to give us all the time. The movie deals with some moral problems too much. And these moral problems start to get boring. In the beginning you see an ape trying to educate other apes and that ape writes on a wall, \"Ape not kill ape.\" So it was a message that tells to us in some ways. And the message is, apes are not killing its own kind but humans are. And yes, that is true; creature of human is killing other humans with some meaningless reasons. But in the end apes are attacking a small colony of people who survived after the disease, and start a war. So in the movie humans are generally is very oppressed, and you see apes are the villain but humans are just a peaceful creature. Normally the leader of apes Cesar was not wiling to start a war, but in the end Koba witch is another dominant ape, dethrone Cesar, and becomes the leader and than attack humans. You always see humans very peaceful, not apes. But I wanted the opposite, to saw humans what it truly is. Humans are a destructive creature, and in the movie even if they have small numbers after the disease, they have weapons, rocket launchers, bombs, but somehow they are not using these against apes. And the funniest thing is, apes build their home around a dam, and humans need that dam because they need electricity. But they are not attacking apes with some primitive weapons and spears, they are trying to negotiate with them, and that is not a human way normally. But in this movie humans are the good side. They always try to show us that some people are good and some are bad, some apes are good and some of them are bed. I liked to see humans to attack apes, and than see these apes trying to defend their home with a lots of action scenes. Sadly in the movie they wanted to show how good some humans are, and not everyone is bed intentioned. So the moral message that they want to show is not to blame every one for the mistakes and violence of others, and not everyone is evil minded. It was also a message to racism. We mustn't be prejudiced for the ones we see firs in our life. But this message starts to get boring, and finally I just want to see some action but the action never starts until the end. Last and the most important thing that disturbs me is the lack of action scenes. There is a very few action scene, and I was hoping to see more action. I know that people who liked to see action scenes with a lots of special effects bought a ticket to this move. However there was just only one good action scene, and it was at the end, and a very short one.What a disappointment for me. And I'd like to know that how this movie got a score of 8 in the IMDb. For me, Dawn of the planet of the apes cant be rated more than 5,8. But my score is 5,2.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was definitely one of the stronger movies of the year. The story was strong, it wasn't predictable, and it didn't feel familiar. Lately, this is a rarity, and a refreshing one at that. I felt very satisfied at the end of the movie, but was hoping for more; to me that is the sign that I have watched a superior movie...Cesar and the apes are pure movie magic. It's amazing to think that the entire movie was based around CGI motion capture characters. They looked and behaved in such a realistic way that I forgot I was watching animations. Serkis has to take credit as well -- the man is a motion capture genius. He has completely immersed himself in this character which adds much to the believability of a thinking, talking chimp. Toby Kebbell wasn't far behind with his portrayal of Koba...I was shocked when I saw he played Koba...I think you may have found your calling Toby -- your performance here was by far the strongest I've seen from you.The only flaw with this movie is the human characters. I don't think they were bad, but Franco had such a strong performance in Rise, and his character was fleshed out so much more, that I just don't think this group was in his league. That's important because I didn't feel as if Serkis stole the show in the last movie, but I really think he did here. Because this movie had such an important role to play in the history of this universe, I would have hoped to care a little more about the people in it...but alas it wasn't to be.It's rare that a reboot/remake is so far superior as Dawn is to it's predecessors (minus Rise of the Planet of the Apes of course). This is probably one of the best, if not the best, reboot series ever. Many people were concerned when they said they were going to reboot the reboot a few years ago and look where we are now. I would venture to say that overall I enjoyed this a little more than Rise simply for the increase in scale and the spectacular special effects.This movie was a nice reminder of why I enjoy film and going to the theatre so much...so thank you for that.",

Just like first part this part as well is battle between good/bad, trust/betrayal, anger/wisdom, relations between good human and apes. Very rare movies these days leave you thinking after you leave the hall, this movie is one of them. I am already excited to see 3rd installment of this series which is due in July 2016.

            "content": "In 2011, Rise of the planet of Apes has revived the Planet of the Apes franchise successfully, and it garnered commercial and critical acclaim. Rightly so. Building up on a predecessor that nailed so many aspects just right is definitely a daunting task. And despite a few shortcomings, Dawn was able to actually pull that off in style.Dawn is a perfect blockbuster, with enough amounts of emotion, intelligent writing and action making it one of the few films that do so very rarely. The last movie that gave me such impression - a sensible blockbuster - was The Dark Knight Returns.The story picks up after its prequel, leaving a few details cleverly dropped and for the viewer's imagination. Our super-intelligent ape Caeser, who made it home at the climax of Rise will mature much over the time and is the leader of the 'Tribe' of monkeys in the wild. Of course, the human survivor territory and the Ape territory are effectively separated, the humans staying in the amazingly realized New York City devastated after the outbreak in Rise and the monkeys stay in the wild, among the high trees, inhabiting them. The survivors come up with a plan to revive and old dam for the sake of electricity since their stored up fuel is getting exhausted. The plan is good enough, except for the fact that the dam falls into the Ape territory. What happens after that forms the rest of the story. I shall not analyze the story here as it requires a lot of spoiling to the people who have not seen the movie. There are a few clich\u00e9d moments that form the main conflict and it gets predictable towards the end. Except for that, the story never bores you. It's really good and there will be enough plot twists to keep the interest high up. The screenplay leaves you with enough back story to characters on each side that you will find that its hard not to root for a particular side - humans or Apes. It also tidies up the premise for a wait-worthy sequel.A story so good needs a top-notch cast to support it and carry it. On the human-side, there is Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, Keri Russell among others and they all do a commendable job. A good soundtrack and great cinematography among many other departments make the Ruined New York extremely believable and immersive. The 3D was particularly effective in the latter part of the experience.Now for the real deal. The Ape side. In Rise, Caeser's motion capture actor Andy Serkis has done a fabulous job and the motion capture was equally well done. But Dawn builds up on the already spectacular performance and as a result, the performances of all the Apes, specifically the main characters and more importantly Caeser, were jaw dropping. With this movie, Andy Serkis has proved that he is positively one of the best motion capture artists out there. Every detail, every frown, every sneer, every smile and every muscle movement was wonderfully captured with a ridiculous amount of authenticity. It is extremely hard, not to be impressed by Caeser's character as well. On one hand, he is the leader of the Apes and on the other, he has seen the loving side of the humans. His attempts for peace, his decisions and his ties to his own family (oops!) definitely remind us of a few great leaders of history.There are only a few complaints I have about this movie and everything else is so good these complaints might look like knit-picks. Some of the characters in the story were unnecessary and the love angle between two characters though welcome, did feel a bit out of the place. The story eventually gets predictable but by then there will be virtually no main scene left to guess. The pacing slightly drops before the second act and picks up very soon. And that's all I've got.If you were allowed only one movie this whole summer, this is the one I'd pick. Dawn is a sci-fi blockbuster so well made that only a few movies reach its level of storytelling and intrigue. If the visuals don't impress you, the soundtrack doesn't elevate the mood and if the cast doesn't pique your interest, then the character of Caesar should do the trick. He is like nothing you've ever seen. That ape is a show-stopper and I'm running out of adjectives here.",

            "review_title": "\"As tense as the Sword of Democles\"",
            "content": "Before I watched this film, I was dubious about whether or not it was a good idea since I had not seen the other films in their entirety apart from the original Planet of the Apes, starring Charlton Heston, a long time ago. I felt the trailer of Rise of the Planet of the Apes told me everything I needed to know about the first prequel. Perhaps I am wrong as I still haven't see that one but would love to now I have seen this one. I can tell you now that this film stands exceedingly well as an achievement on it's own. The prologue briefly gives context to this film and throughout it is easy-to-follow and a captivating experience. I was worried at the beginning that it was focusing too heavily on the apes since for the first 5 or 10 minutes after the prologue you don't see any people or hear any words. The apes use sign language to communicate which is subtitled but increasingly speak in English as the film progresses. Nevertheless, I think this provided the right approach because it encourages the audience to see things from the apes perspective rather than an exclusive human perspective against the apes. As Caesar the ape says to his son later in the film, \"the humans and apes are closer than I first thought.\" The apes are given a lot of human qualities and thinking, which I think is greatly enhanced by the seamless CGI and the mesmerising performance of experienced actor, Andy Serkis as Caesar. Therefore, this film provides strong characters for the audience among both the humans and even the apes which we are able to empathise with. One of the reasons for this is because the apes have names and distinctive appearances too. Once these characters and the humans clash, it adds to the audience engagement.This film bears some strong political themes established by the character development. I observed four factions among the two species: The diplomatic humans, the diplomatic apes, the antagonistic humans and the antagonistic apes. These four factions can also be applied to the X-Men film franchise between the mutants and the human species. This enables civil disagreements within species that I did not expect. Much like the X-Men films, I believe even the antagonistic characters can be empathised with in this film such as Koba the ape when he points to his scars and quotes Caesar viciously explaining \"Human work\"; or Gary Oldman's character, Dreyfus, when he looks at photos of his family who I assume perished as a result of the previous conflict. I wouldn't of first thought of this film as emotional but there is some emotional focus given to specific characters which give reasoning behind every character's agenda. Also, the character background perhaps initiated by the previous film Rise establishes conflicting perspectives across the characters. Despite Gary Oldman not having many scenes in this film, he is given enough scenes to establish him as a worthy character.This film is beautifully directed and skilfully paced. There is one particular camera shot I liked where it is fixed to a spinning tank and in this slow motion panoramic shot, you see the chaos unfold. This film is as tense as the Sword of Democles. The slightest wrong move made by any of the characters could have drastic consequences. These opportunities for disaster are positioned throughout the film making it an enthralling experience for the audience. The best thing was, most of the time, I honestly didn't know what was going to happen next! Since this is a prequel, I assumed I knew how this was going to end but the narrative played out very differently to how I expected, even the ending. Like with the prequel trilogy of Star Wars, we kind of know what's going to happen and there's this foreboding feeling that we know the bad guys have got to win to establish the connection between the prequels and the originals. However, I personally felt this film had a satisfying ending and certainly gives the impression that there will be another film to follow, which I was also not expecting!The soundtrack is also very good and adds intensity to the film. I especially love the creepy sporadic high notes to accompany the creepy human-like apes in some of the tracks that give this a homage to the originals. Also, check out the soundtrack and you'll notice cringey puns in most of the track titles!This film is certainly thought-provoking and had me thinking about it in awe for days. It does everything a film should do. It is unpredictable, visually spectacular, captivating, emotionally driven and a film that can be philosophised over; in this case, the politics of leadership and engaging in war. There is not really any humour at all in this film but it is excellent as an action/adventure/sci-fi film. It is not gory but has some violence and threat in it. Personally, I don't have any criticisms for this film. However, Mark Kermode raised a good reservation in his review of the film in saying that the female characters could have been stronger. Nevertheless my girlfriend, who is a passionate feminist, took me to see this film and she enjoyed it too and holds the film industry in high esteem for it. I am pleased to see that this series of prequels are not being made by Hollywood for the sake of making money (although I'm sure this is certainly a primary objective for reviving this classic franchise). Hollywood has exploited a great opportunity to explain the origins (as they have with other fictions) of the Planet of the Apes which were not previously explained and I am confident in saying that they have done the classic franchise justice by doing so. I am keen to see the other films now and I hope you are keen to see this one.",

I thought 'CGI' of Sarkis (Caesar) chimp came across 'intelligent' enough,so glad they made it into a sequel.BUT mainly, I was really impressed with \"Rise\" after recently viewing PBS series featuring an Oranutagne (can never spell that) named 'Chantek', and his similar, real-life story of learning sign-language and communicating quite sufficiently until made to transfer to a confined circumstance. It was heartbreakingly true. (He called the other orangutan's 'orange dogs' via sign language when he was confined after years of human contact}. I wonder if the producers of Rise of The Planet of the Apes knew of Chantek's story. I see in 'Rise' that there was 'cameo' of an orangutan next to Caesar's cage, in the movie, perhaps a 'nod' to Chantek? Thank you. Everyone should encourage the Chatanooga Zoo - Facebook - or contact Dr. Lyn Miles at University of Tennessee at Chattanoogato who discovered it's nurture versus nature', at least for our brother simians - that allow us to communicate our feelings between species, and just let poor old Chanteck to an occasional ice cream cone!

Matt Reeves is a confident and excellent director as he constantly does a close-up on the apes faces. He also manages to make the apes extremely human and you really connect and feel for them. The human actors and characters were good, especially Gary Oldman. Andy Serkis is phenomenal and deserves at least an Oscar nomination. The story always takes unexpected twists and turns which made the movie unique and the action is probably the best we've seen this year.

Much of human population has been wiped out by simian flu and the rest by wars among the survivors. In this post apocalyptic world the freed aped population hasn't fared much better; living like a stone age tribe, they only learned how to make spears, ride horses and speak some English. Even though human and ape populations haven't met yet, a clash is inevitable. This film focuses on the war between human and apes for dominance. It has a well written, flawless story. CGI is above average and believable. There is a great deal of it: monkeys, horses, a bear and a very big explosion. Also acting is above average. The casting of relatively unknown actors (except for Gary Oldman) could have been a disadvantage, however it all seems to work. It smoothly fits the pieces from the last film together and opens doors for another episode in the series. Is it worth watching?If you don't like monkeys, don't bother. But it is entertaining, there is hardly wasted time, fast paced and it's a good summer entertainment. This is the best summer movie I have seen so far in 2014. And one final spoiler. Don't be fooled by the sound effects at the very end of the film, it is coming from the speakers.",

This movie is one of the top 5 movies of the year for me. The CGI in this movie is so amazing. After watching it for a few minutes you forget that the apes are fake. Overall this movie was a refresher for sure. This sequel was 2x better than the first one. Ceaser is such a great overall developed character, he has so much depth in this movie and his movements are amazing. This is a popcorn movie for sure.

Andy Serkis (\"Gollum\" from LOTR) was simply phenomenal as Cesar. It was a heartfelt (somewhat familiar) story of what happens when harmony is threatened by those who use deceit to achieve their personal goals and how that deceit can poison a culture. It is also a testament to love, loyalty and trust amongst, not only members of one \"culture\", but amongst those who strive to cross the lines between cultures that differ so wildly in the hopes of both living in peace and harmony.",

You see, I'm not familiar with the original series, but as a stand-alone film, Rise was awesome. The problem was, there weren't enough ape scenes.But now, Dawn has a lot more apes, a lot more action, which means, you'll have a much better time. The movie is so meticulously detailed, it's jaw-dropping. You won't think the apes are actually people acting and wearing a strange black costume (until you see a behind the scenes), because the special effects are so amazing. I'll be sure to pick this movie up when it comes out. If you are a fan of the original series or just like action movies, this is an awesome movie for you.",

But most of all I loved the message of the movie. There are a few messages that the movie tries to impart. The most important message for me was : You have to forget the past. We as individuals and communities must learn to forget the wrongs of the past to create a good future. Other lesson is that no community is good or bad. It is individuals that are good or bad. Different communities can live together. Also what stands out are the leadership qualities of the leader of apes. If every leader would think so much about their people and peace at large we would have a different world. Overall a very well made movie with mix of great story line, good moral lessons, action, CGI etc. Must watch.",

            "review_title": "Shakespeare level of story telling *minimal spoilers*",
            "content": "The best in the series. Dawn takes a tremendous look on humanity and our way of life. It is great to see and hear how the apes live in a mirror image of early humanity. One man says, \"They don't need electricity or warmth, which is what makes them stronger.\" Throughout the movie there are more parallels to an ape and human life, Caesar's family versus the family of Malcolm (the human protagonist). Malcolm sees so much of him self in Caesar that eventually betrays the humans to help Caesar. This wins over the viewers hearts more thoroughly to side with the apes.Other than that the characters have fascinating relationships with one another, resonating a Shakespearey feel. Especially with Caesar (ironically named) is leader of the Ape republic and has almost absolute loyalty of his followers other than Kabo, whom seeks to overthrow Caesar, and is constantly undermining him and acting behind Caesar's back. Which gives us the sense of Brutus in the story of Julius Caesar. And there is again another relation to Hamlet. For Caesar's son is constantly living in the shadow of his superior king father. He starts of shy and obedient but we see his struggle of changing as Kabo establishes more followers, and his choice whether or not to stay loyal to his father.There are much more great characters in this, along with overall superb story telling. On top of the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the front of the line of CG technology, which assist in the awe of the movie and make way for incredible action scenes. I hope this movie gets as much credit as it deserves.",

            "review_title": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: A Glorious Sequel",
            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of my all-time favourite films. Here is why: It is heavily emotive, powerful, and dark - a worthy sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes, featuring a fine cast, superb visual effects, and a laudable score from Michael Giachinno (The Incredibles, Spiderman: Homecoming) bound together in the tale of a well-woven series of tragic misunderstandings that lead ultimately to the bloody outcome of total war (quite literally). Firstly, I'd like to comment on the plot. The beauty of the conflict between man and ape seems to be contained in the fact that neither side is truly evil, and that neither side desires war, but rather peace. Paralleling reality, war - that inevitable and inescapable fate which, by the means of often indirect and convoluted paths looms incessantly closer despite everyone's best intentions - draws men, women and children inside of it in a living tornado of human lives. Some have accused the franchise of a predictable and typical story; but consider that most of the audience is already familiar with how this story ends, making the movies more character- centered as a result. The real conundrum is not so much which race gains control of the planet, but rather where Caesar is driven morally (a theme further developed in War). As in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, we are not concerning ourselves with whether the new Death Star survives the rebels' attack, so much as we are concerning ourselves with the fate of our characters - will Kylo Ren accept Han Solo's invitation to renounce evil and return home? The plot is relatively simple, yet soulful and meaningful.As a means of countering repetition of my previous review on Rise, I shall tend to be brief on matters I've already addressed. Our new ensemble of actors is refreshing, and lends the movie a new context. Enough recognizable faces reprise their roles as familiar characters such as Caesar, Maurice, Koba and Rocket; yet, we are treated to a whole, fresh crew including Gary Oldman's Dreyfus, Jason Clarke's Malcolm, Keri Russell's Ellie and Kodi Smit-Mcphee's Alexander. Though our new human protagonists are comparable to our previous ones, they differ so much as to add something quite new to the trilogy. The movie maintains fine general character continuity, and they fit nicely into the synopsis, without becoming too centrepiece, which I admire. Dreyfus especially provides abundant material for thought. He is a villain wrought by misunderstanding and circumstance - not entirely culpable for his actions, which, owing to his ignorance, he sees as the only logical path to take. He was originally a family man, not a war general or governor of thousands. Again, misunderstandings pave the way for ruin. Perhaps my only criticism here would be Alexander's lack of pertinence to the overall story. He was intriguing, yet in retrospect, feels unexplored. In the face of the sequel, seemingly his and his family's history was cut tragically short, leaving little room for imagination to conjure a future for him.Visual effects have improved notably since Rise, and Matt Reeve's recent comment on them is worthy of note. To paraphrase, he pointed out that Weta is often straining itself to reach new heights as movies are made. If a particular texture or metaphysical reaction is required for a movie such as this one, hitherto unaccomplished feats are then nominated order of the day. Thus capabilities are stretched and extended with each new production. An understanding of this can perhaps aid viewers in assessing the state and stage of progression we are in - as always, we are constantly making rapid advancements in technological areas. Another noteworthy item is the amount of work involved in creating these visual effects. For instance, one of Dawn's most complicated visual effects-heavy shots was rendered a total of 1200+ times, and completed only a couple of weeks before the movie opened in cinemas. Meanwhile, Giachinno's score meshed well with the tone of the movie - dark, deep, powerful (though minimal), tribal and occasionally rather mischievous.Finally, I want to give a word on Matt Reeves' expert directorship on this film and in general. The biggest reason the Apes trilogy resonates so effectively with its enthusiasts is the priority Reeves gives to the emotional connection the audience shares with the main protagonist (i.e. Caesar). He likes often to talk of this intimacy, and of the internal emotional and moral struggles that occur inside Caesar (and hopefully Batman, given a few years down the track). A second thing - Reeves directs movies not like a business, but like a passion. He isn't afraid to experiment, and seems to really care about the story he presents. Maybe there lies the key to why his movies are as powerful are they are. And maybe in ten years' time Matt Reeves will be a common household name. My final point is Reeves' apparent zeal for building and shooting on large sets, constructed largely from natural resources (as opposed to green-screening the movie into existence), thus really bringing the movie's fictional world into reality - resembling the typical Christopher Nolan style, which I also much appreciate. In closing, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of my all-time favourite movies, ranking quite closely to its predecessor, and I highly recommend it to anyone who values a gripping narrative, gorgeous visuals, and superb acting wrapped together in a powerful film. I have seen it about five times since its 2014 release, and I plan on many more viewings. The trilogy is mostly solid the whole way through, and all three films are worth your time. If you love film and have yet to watch it, you're certainly missing out.",

            "content": "This review is for all the people left scratching their heads. Yes, this film is predictable. It is about talking apes. It is a film with barely any surface level morals. Now that we've established that, this is a nearly perfect film, and I'll explain why. The first, and most important reason this film received such high praise is for filmmaking. It is filled with unbelievable film school nerd payoffs like the foreign film tributes in the way the early scenes are shot in near silence. Without saying any spoilers, there is a tank scene and a steady cam continuous shot near the climax of the film that may be the two most well filmed scenes of the year. I do have to admit though, had the plot not been so predictable, the steady came scene would have been more effective. Though this is the most incredible aspect of the film, most viewers couldn't care less about this, so I'll move on. The next reason this film is so good is that the characters are real. Koba is a nearly perfect tragic villain. Caesar is an incredible example of a flawed hero. Every character in this film is doing his best according to his own experience. This is a story about real life struggle. There is no good and evil, only difference of opinion. That is part of the reason it is so predictable. Because no one ever acts out of character in this film. Which is incredible character development. The story telling in this film is great for a very unique reason. Things that you know are going to happen, happen for very well thought out reasons. Everyone should've gathered that this film is about humanity. Each ape takes what it learned from humanity to influence their character. This is a great way to continue the themes from Rise and show how conflict is created in society. Again, I don't want to write any spoilers, but all of the big tagline type lines serve as clues to themes, set up for the ape world that is inevitably coming, and character development. That should help you reexamine some of the lines you originally found cheesy. So, there are a few things you have to understand when watching this film. You can't expect a summer blockbuster. Instead, expect something more along the lines of Children of Men, Gravity, or Cloverfield, which is another example of a mislabeled and misunderstood film. All of those movies are similar to this one in the way they are masterfully filmed and hold their real messages well below the surface. This film is the story of all human conflict, cultural differences, and misunderstanding. It's everything Crash wanted to be. It is a movie that suffers from a lack of balance only in the way it presents itself. Dark Knight was a similar film in many ways, including villain characterization through dramatic scenes and diverse filming techniques, but it achieved mass appeal because it held its themes both on the surface and on a deeper level. This film is only on a deeper level. So all these low ratings are really just from people who expected a movie about monkeys.This movie is not for everyone, and I'm not trying to change anyone's mind about it. I'm just trying to explain why it was so highly praised by film nerds since so many people don't get it.",

            "content": "When Rise of the Planet of the Apes first came out in 2011, I was surprised by how good it was. It was so good that it made it in my top 3 favorite movies of 2011, and it's even one of my favorite movies in general. I had been anticipating the sequel ever since 2011, so I had been following the movie from the very beginning. When Matt Reeves was cast to direct, I got excited, as he had directed Cloverfield a few years prior (which is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time).Today when I finally sat in the theater for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, I didn't know what to expect. Some of the thoughts whizzing through my mind included: \"Will it be as good as the first?\", \"Will it be disappointing?\", \"Will it be amazing?\", \"Will it be terrible?\", \"Will I be able to take the apes seriously?\". When the opening logos came on, I braced myself, hoping that it would be good. Two hours later, I walked out of the theater with my eyes and mouth wide open, completely mesmerized by what I had just seen. Was it good? Oh yes. It was GREAT.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes picks up a couple of years after it's predecessor. Speaking of it's predecessor, there are several connections to the first movie. Because of this, I strongly recommend seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes before seeing Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (not only because it's important to the second, but because it's a great movie). But if you see the sequel without seeing the first, you'll probably be able to fill in all the blanks. In the first act, I was surprised by how much I actually got into the apes and their storyline. When I noticed this, I began to worry that it would be an imbalanced story with more of the focus/sympathizing shifted towards the apes. However, in the second act, any and all worries of this were dismissed. The humans are equally as interesting as the apes and are just as worthy of being rooted for. The best way I can describe how I felt about the two sides in a sentence: in the first act I was rooting for the apes, in the second act I was rooting for the humans, and in the last act I was rooting for both.The acting in this movie is very well-done too. Something I noticed was that each of the different apes have different personalities and traits, rather than all of them having the same traits. The actors playing the humans are just as great and slip right into their roles. The acting with the apes and the humans are all excellent.The plot of the film and the way how plot points are executed is incredible. Things happened that legitimately shocked me. The plot went places that I never would guess it would. Not to mention, the action in this movie is just flat out AWESOME. Everything is there, from the edge of your seat fight scenes to the white-knuckling tension. In addition to all this, not only is Dawn of the Planet of the Apes directed and acted well, but it's also rather high on the emotional factor too. I haven't cried in any movie this year (including The Fault In Our Stars), but during Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, I'm not gonna lie, I teared up a bit.Prior to seeing Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, I thought that X-Men: Days of Future Past was the best movie of 2014 thus far. However, after seeing Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, I have to say that the two are tied for the title. Three years of build-up and anticipation DEFINITELY pays off. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets a 10/10 from me. Easily as good as (if not better than) its predecessor. Do yourself a favor and see it. It's definitely worth it.",

I could hardly recall the plot of the previous edition of the Planet of the Apes movie franchise (2011), but it all mattered nothing once this movie started.The mere display of Caesar portraying a powerful and ferocious character leading an army of apes gave me goosebumps. And from that instant, I was literally on the edge of my seat. Showcasing brilliant minds of their own, apes make you scream for more. The apes running on horses was the scene to watch. The apes territory made me wanting to be a part of it. It was like a trip into the jungle/wilderness. The 3D effects adding to the charm. Excellent cinematography by Michael Seresin.The battle between humans and apes envisages. Both want to act peacefully. But the situation they are in, you are made to believe that all humans are not alike. And apes can only 'ape' humans, they can't be Humans in actuality. Superb performance from the lead actor Jason Clarke in trying to bridge a gap between humans and apes, beautifully supported by his family. And Koba, the Bonobo who hates humans for his mistreatment, plays his part very well by being the main antagonist.The story is the main highlight of this edition. Full marks to Matt Reeves for scripting a beautiful picture. You are constantly involved in the movie. It is dark. Realistic. It makes you think. It makes you worried.

This movie isn't just the best Planet of the Apes it is a great film.I went into this filming thinking I was knowing how it was going to end, but it was still able to surprise me and give me an experience of a great story. We know that we are leading up to a Planet of the Apes world at one point, but it didn't end the way I thought it was going to. The story is just really well done.The performances also kept me engage. Andy Serkis is just spectacular as Caesar. He has this atmosphere about him. He is one of my favorite protagonists, because you get to feel for him as a person even though he is an ape and his character is like a human. He grew up as a human and that also causes some discussion. He deserves an Oscar nomination for best actor for this performance.Toby Kebbell is just scary as Koba and I was just utterly shocked by what was going on with his character. He was just incredible. Jason Clarke was also really good as Malcolm. His role is better acted and written that James Franco's, but is also given a lot of depth with the parallels drawn between him and Caesar. You also have Gary Oldman as Dreyfus who is a villain in the film. He was a character that had a lot more depth than I thought he was going to and his character takes turns that I didn't think were going to happen.I think the most brilliant thing about this film is how well the CGI is mixed in with actual people. You can tell that someone worked hard on this film and the apes actually feel real even though you know they aren't. It might be digital make up, but it is really good digital make up.The direction is also well done because their are so many interesting shots in this film that give it such a great atmosphere and create this really full world. It also makes it even more interesting. Matt Reeves did a great job and I personally enjoyed the beginning news reel clips because it takes the end of the first film and gives it even more dimension.Everyone felt like real people and that was helped by the excellent writing. I thought that the writing was outstanding and gives each characters clear motivations without bashing them in the head. Every line means something and nothing seems out of place of the story.This film is breathtaking. It is refreshing to see a story told not always in words, but in sign language allowing the words and physical presence of the characters affect us and not their speech. The acting is stupendous and creates characters that have clear motivation that makes sense and makes it story not about the humans trying to survive, but about the apes trying to survive. Excellent film making with amazing directing. I am giving this film a 3.75 out of 4.",

I found myself becoming attached to the characters and and feeling their every emotion as something joyous or tragic would occur. At times I would even find myself at the verge of tears, and I don't cry much. Now for the metaphor. I believe this movie was so believable because of the realistic situations apes and humans had to deal with. They were so afraid and foreign to each other that their fear led to war. This is why many wars in the past have occurred. From fear and differences. Why were the apes and humans afraid of one another? Because they wanted safety for their families and themselves, as does everyone in the world today. By the end of the movie, Caesar realizes that apes and humans aren't so different after all. He thought apes were better at first, but found that both apes and humans share a similar culture and similar values. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes communicates a beautiful and powerful message that makes this film very unique and unforgettable. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie if you haven't already. :)",

            "content": "(Disclaimer: Just so you're aware, I wrote this review immediately after I went to see Dawn for the first time, and am just editing it now. Due to my initial \"blows-ones-socks-off\" effect, I may exaggerate its quality ever so slightly, especially in the final paragraph.)I occasionally watch a movie that is so good, that I feel compelled to tell the whole world about it. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one such movie. Dawn's predecessor, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, resurrected the name of the Planet of the Apes franchise in the eyes of most critics and movie-enthusiasts. It was a thoroughly entertaining film with a story which was both credible and interesting, even if it didn't stimulate one's cerebral cortex to the full extent. But if Rise was strong, then Dawn is the titan Atlas on steroids.This new installment is directed by Matt Reeves and stars Andy Serkis, Gary Oldman and a wealth of semi-obscure actors who show special talent.Here is the movie's premise. Dawn takes place ten years after the events of Rise. The drug ALZ-113, which enhances the intelligence of apes but has a fatal effect on humans, has caused a contagious virus that has wiped out the majority of the world's human population. The intelligent apes, led by Caesar, now live in the redwood forest just north of San Francisco. A group of humans, genetically immune to the virus, is stationed in the nearby city, but its means of survival are quickly dwindling. The humans must regain electrical power to endure, and their only hope of this is to attain access to a hydroelectric dam outside the city. Unfortunately for them, the dam lies in the apes' territory, and, because of recent events, hostility could erupt from even the most paltry coaxing.I think what I like most about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is that it isn't afraid to take dark and unexpected turns to better the story. The movie is next to impossible to predict. Very few characters in the movie are black and white. The villains have justifiable motives, and the protagonists have shades of grey. The character relationships and development are some of the best I've ever seen in film. Gary Oldman is superb as ever, but he is eclipsed by Andy Serkis as Caesar. Andy conveys such a great sense of authority in his character, but also is a master at transmitting softer emotions. His performance was, without question, number one for me up until that point in 2014. Toby Kebbel, who plays a bonobo named Koba who has an acute loathing for humans, is also superb. I loved how the movie exhibited the culture that the apes have formed. The audience gets to see their way of life and their code of law as well as their moral code. A sense of family is also apparent. The cinematography is superb and the CGI has very few equals.However, one minor gripe I have with Dawn is that the human characters are occasionally lacking in grit and aren't always as interesting as they could be. Perhaps it is because they are downright overwhelmed by Caesar and his fellow apes.I implore you not look upon this movie as some doltish flick about talking apes that want to take over the world. It is more than that on every level, and it is imperative that you watch it. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is worth every penny at the box-office and the time you spend watching it may just be the most rewarding 131 minutes of your existence. Over and out.",

            "content": "I really wanted to re-rate all the films I've given 10 stars, because Dawn of The Planet of The Apes gave me a brand new insight on how blockbusters should have been. But it felt unfair to compare decent or exciting or thought-provoking films with this epic, so I only cut out half of them. First off, you'll only enjoy 3/4 of it if you went in expecting only dazzling visuals and non-stop action like Rise of The Planet of The Apes (though it's still a wonderful film), because the emotion and back-story set up required a vast portion of running time. For those entering the cinema hoping for amazing drama, superior acting and soul-warming scenes, please go straight ahead. A spectacular adventure awaits you.Andy Serkins became my one of my favorite actors after watching his performance in Dawn. The opening scene showing his determined stare caught me instantly, with his presence giving me goosebumps and teary eyes. His vocal is magnetizing and grand, a perfect on-screen leader that had me worshiping. Caesar is as majestic as an ape can ever be, yet so gentle and heart-warming with the family he dear so much. His performance touched my soul, whether as a wise and stern leader or a loving father. Koba is another role done right, suppressed hatred and anger expressed well by Toby Kebbell. Most of the human actors done well too, with Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman managing to give heartfelt and decent acting.The visuals never disappoint. The apes are as realistic as ever, eyes exceptionally well done in close-ups that manage to show all the raw emotions in the film. The forest and quarantine zones are also great to watch at, whether thriving with life or falling to pieces. Kudos to the cinematography crew, who managed to bring the film to life. The story is also awe-inspiring and haunting. The pace throughout the film is precisely handled, with a plot that raises tension steadily without feeling rushed and packed. For a 2-hour film, Dawn managed to balance action-packed scenes with character development, both parts stretching out with near golden ratio and sufficient screen time. Some complain that the ending \"didn't felt like an ending\", but I loved the last couple of minutes as much as the rest of the film. The finale is satisfyingly breathtaking and adrenaline-pumping, leading to the closing scenes that choked me to tears. All in all this is the movie that cannot be missed, being one of the best in the genre for 2014. Breathtaking, ground-breaking, awe- inspiring,soul-wrenching, visually spectacular, extraordinarily stunning, brutal and raw, grand and magnificent. Words cannot truly describe my love and appreciation for Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, for it is one of the rare films that is capable of touching the bottom of my heart, leaving me breathless and stunned after the credits rolled, reflecting on the greatness of probably my favorite film of all time.",

            "review_title": "A summer blockbuster with meaning?",
            "content": "The release of a Michael Bay Transformers installment, delivering computer generated explosions to theatre goers across the world, is always a cue for critics and self-proclaimed critics alike to bemoan the lack of real meaning in Hollywood's summer blockbusters. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves's entry in a series which is fertile ground for meaningful metaphor, aspires to meet that challenge.To be sure, the film is a surprisingly beautiful one. Weta Digital's work animating the apes around the motion capture framework of Andy Serkis and his fellow cast-members's performances is a true triumph in computer generated imagery. The direction and cinematography is equally well done, as numerous sequences throughout the movie do an expert job of visually painting the story on screen. Koba's ploy to distract human guards for instance is simply beautiful in its horror.Is Dawn of the Planet of the Apes then the definitive blockbuster? It appears to check all the requisite boxes, including the one Michael Bay all but pretends doesn't exist\u2014contains depth of message.On that last criterion, I'm not sure it actually does.I will not include a spoiler alert, because it's arguably no spoiler at all to say that war between ape and man-kind breaks out. Along with the deliberate parallel construction of both characters and character motivations between the two groups, the nicely packaged message the film contains clearly is of the folly of war and how inevitable our flaws make it be.It's a brilliant message on its own, one whose timing could not be more apt given recent events in the Middle East. As it is executed in the film though, the end result is the impression that in the pursuit of including a impactful message, the film itself paradoxically suffers.There is never any pretension, even right at t=0, that peace would be achievable. While this adds an element of tension to the film\u2014we are transfixed by the unfolding story much in the way we may be watching two runaway trains on the same track barreling towards each other\u2014the story begins to drag when this one element begins to wear thin.In service of this end result, the character motivations are often weakly defined and flat. Instead of character arcs, each and every character on both sides rise little above classic Hollywood archetypes. Caesar, the wise but conflicted leader. Koba, the wise leader's hurt and violent foil. Malcolm, the hopeful and idealistic peace broker. Dreyfus, the equally prejudicial human parallel to Koba.The simple construction of the characters leads to numerous irrational interactions between many of them throughout the story. There is a fine line between having irrationality and failure as a theme and a story which itself is nonsensical, and as a result of the lack of character depth and story intricacy, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to its detriment veers ever so slightly towards the latter.This is no fatal flaw to the film's blockbuster credentials, as many more a movie fail on far greater levels. Still, the overall message delivered in this blockbuster is not enough to earn Dawn of the Planet of the Apes certification as a big summer movie that transcends the genre as some may hope or even believe.",

            "content": "Wow. There have been several times that I loved the first film in a series, waited a few years for the sequel, disliked, and then forgot about it. This is not the case. Although I personal like Rise of The Planet of The Apes a bit better, this movie is close second. It's excellent. Not just as a summer movie. Not just as a sequel. But as a film. It is an incredible movie. Also what it does is so unique, it not only makes you care about both sides of a battle, but it gives a whole new outlook on the war that began it all in the Planet of The Apes trilogy.This movie really avoids a lot of clich\u00e9s. A few inevitable ones pop up, but it is really quite unique. The acting on the \"human\" side is decent. The characters are not incredibly developed, but they don't have to be. They have enough development and are not annoying. You care about their situation. Gary Oldman has a surprisingly small role, but a pretty good one. But the real star is obviously the apes. Andy Serkis and the team of motion capture actors are mesmerizing. The effects are great. The movie also has a lot to say about the human condition. I won't ruin that.The movie also had a lot of moments that really made me care and it was quite unpredictableI cannot think of another case of a series that was rebooted three times and on the third time got it right. TWICE!!!! I was worried when a friend told me the movie was clich\u00e9d and stupid...it is not so. Even if you are excited for this movie, it will still exceed expeditions. \"Apes Strong Together\"",

Great special effects again, and Andy Serkis as Caesar and Toby Kebbell as Koba are just brilliant. Gary Oldmans character is a bit vague, seems quite tame at first but completely changes later on.

(References from \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" are shown.) The civilization of humans are medium low and are struggling to survive. On the other side, the apes are doing pretty well. Their civilization are prospering pretty good.

Andy Serkis keeps pushing the limit on what a human face can do and he appears to be the one who uses it best. We're a total waste of faces guys :)We also have the emotional depth of multiple apes and not just one like in \"Rise\". The human side of the conflict is also very good with great performances from Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman.However, the story and plot are old and not original at all like it was with \"Rise\" and the technology, while it carries serious advancement, but I don't feel like it was used to its full potential, especially the 3D, which we could've totally done without.My video review for the movie in Arabic can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=sSt5M9Pxf6A",

In fact, this movie would have gotten the perfect score if some of the human elements that made either no sense or meant nothing to the plot were cut in the editing room. Let's just say this (SPOILER ALERT, kind of?), if your biological father has been dating someone for what could be as long as 10 years, and you don't know that she had a daughter who died from Simian flu, then you have some serious communication problems....and are probably a douche-bag....that scene really needed to be cut big time....The one other thing that bugged me was the lack of acknowledgment of the \"missing\" astronauts from the first film, which was obviously put in there to eventually tie in with the original film. Recently the director remarked about how this is a whole new world and they don't have to go in that direction. That's all well and good but you clearly alluded to this scenario happening in the first film so you can't just come out and say \"we don't have to go in that direction.\" For the one thing I truly hate is when there is a lack of continuity....But overall, this film is pretty much the only thing worth going to see at this present time. Saddens me to think that this, a great film with great effects masterfully told with actual heart and intelligence will make nowhere near the amount that Transformers, THE most banal, insulting franchises in any genre of all time (and I was a Transformers nerd back in the day) will.Can't blame the Chinese really, it is their first Hollywood blockbuster to some extent....but when it comes to the rest of you, what is your excuse?

Director Matt Reeves took meticulous care to create a brilliant and realistic film with detailed and visually spell binding shots.The story line picks up ten years after the first film with the virus outbreak which was triggered in the first film, killing of most of the human population. Ceasar,played brilliantly by Andy Serkis(somebody give him an award: there has to be one for brilliant motion capture) and his fellow homo simians find sanctuary in the woods near San Francisco and form their own little flourishing culture and society with school and caste order. The other cast are not ones that stays in your head and are often forgotten once you leave the cinema hall. The length was perfect. A little to much and they would have overshot it and a little too less would have left us asking for more . When it comes to the use of CGI, detail and animation displayed here almost fooled me to believe that i was watching real apes. Michael Giacchino's haunting musical score immerses you into the drama and conflict. The action of 'Dawn' is not your usual film but is a realistic portrayal with more darker tones.Some of the visual shots make you shout (spoilers!)\"Et tu brute\" and you can relate it with Julius Ceasar .

The story shows us human beings on the brink and desperate and the tension between the two species with politics and family plus war and survival at the very heart of it all and it is interwoven really well in this movie.Caesar really is the star of this movie and you get a real sense of all that is happening through the eyes of the apes.

And the CGI effects have vastly improved. My god, technology is incredible-there are scenes where I have a tough time figuring out whether it's real, or it's digital. There are two characters who easily stand out: Caesar, and Koba. If you don't remember, Caesar is the main ape from the last movie who shared that relationship with James Franco, and now he is the ruler of all the apes. And Koba, who was the badly scarred-up ape who was tested a lot from the previous movie, is now Caesar's trusted adversary. In this film, Caesar is all about peace between ape and human kind, but Koba despises all humans. This leads to the story playing out very interesting...plus, there is a plot twist that I did not see coming that really changed the movie. In all of this, I don't think I have a real big gripe...or a little one. I really thought about it for a while, and I can't think of anything I disliked at all.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a good movie, and fun to watch, but I knew what to expect, and I was right.The last time I said \"That was one of the best movies I've ever seen\" was 13 years ago when I saw Beautiful Mind. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of the best movies I've ever seen.This film is powerful. You go in knowing what has to happen, especially if this story line follows the same general story of Planet of the Apes, but how it gets there is extremely moving, and quite powerful.The film will engage you like few movies can. Unlike most typical fiction, the creator the story will usually clearly define for you who the protagonist and antagonist are. In Rise of the Planet of the Apes, those lines are not clearly drawn. This fact will engage you in the plight of the story for both, almost equally, and surprise you in the end.The movie is haunting, I think mostly because the premise of how they got to where they are is not so far outside the realm of possibility for us. While it's obviously doubtful apes will ever rise up against humans, the post human era haunts most people just a little bit, and this is done very well in this film.Finally, it's a beautifully done movie. The effects, CGI, cinematography, and the acting are nearly flawless. The landscape they have created in a post-human world are as creepy as they are beautiful. From the plant and animal life taking over a major metropolitan area over the years without human existence, to the homes the apes have built themselves high among the trees, there's always some point of beauty to every scene.I cannot recommend this film more. See it in the theater, and if you can, see it in 3D. There are not too many overt 3D scenes, but it adds a depth to the film that just makes it all that more enjoyable.",

It seems like 2014 does; so far we've had X-Men: Days of Future Past, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Edge of Tomorrow, and of course, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.With storytelling that can only be found in the most thought-provoking of science fiction films, Dawn takes the intriguing concept introduced in the 1963 book and pushes it ten levels forward. It's ironic how a premise that sounds silly can become one of the darkest, most serious films of the year. So we start the film with apes and the humans who survived the Simian Flu (introduced in the last film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes) living (relatively speaking) in peace, and we see Andy Serkis playing one of the most compelling, complex, and powerful characters in recent cinema history, Caesar, having a wife, a son (and a new one just being born), and leading the community of apes, which does in fact have peaceful lives, until the humans sort of get inside of their territory, where a lot of conflict begins.The performance capture is by far the best I've seen; not only Andy Serkis gives a great performance, but Toby Kebbell, who plays Koba (Caesar's second-in-command), is intimidating and scene-stealing, as one of the most memorable sci-fi villains I've seen. The rest of the apes are mostly silent, but Blue Eyes (Caesar's son) and Maurice (Bornean orangutan and Caesar's friend and adviser) do get moments to shine.The action scenes are as dazzling and exciting as 'apes on horses with machine guns' sounds, if not more; however, the action is basically a plus, for those who need to see action on the screen to be entertained. In fact, around 45 minutes in there was a short action scene and I realized there had not been any action scene since the opening 5 minutes, which wasn't a very long one, either. The second act is very action-packed, but it works, because the first one built up to it perfectly and it absolutely delivers. The third act has a great final confrontation between Caesar and Koba, whose rivalry has, again, been built up since the first act.It has a lot of themes that we saw in other movies earlier this year (particularly X-Men: DOFP and How to Train your Dragon 2), the most fascinating of which is, of course, the possibility of two races co- existing and how that can break the human spirit and corrupt. There is also a lot of 'does the end justify the means?' on this movie, and if you've seen it I don't even need to mention it. There's prejudice as well (also dealt with in the films previously mentioned). The social commentary is something I absolutely did not see coming; the film deals with this... empathy, I believe is the word, where Caesar, who has been with both humans and apes, is forced to decide ''Well, what's better for my species and what's better for the humans?'', and that's where I think it kind of hits with the country leaders and how they sometimes act out of desperation or without thinking on how it may affect the other side, because we see, and it's obvious that it's just the same in real life, that not all humans are bad, but contrasting that , not all apes are good. I believe this film will probably cause a lot of controversy, but it's in The Dark Knight sense of the word, where it opens the eyes of a lot of people to seeing stuff that they hadn't noticed before or simply ignored. I don't want to get even stronger in this of the social commentary, but I think it also deals with how sometimes the leaders do in fact take the choices right for everybody but there's that one guy who disagrees (and the way Koba is written you can see where he's coming from-again, just like in real life, hopefully- ) and does what he thinks is right. Every action has a consequence, even those that we may think are not important or relevant, they all affect us, our surroundings and the way we live.I have a reservation about the film and it's one that seems to be a constant with both this and Rise: The Human Element. We see what happens from the human perspective, yes, but the characters as a whole could be slightly more compelling and memorable. I was surprised by how much I remembered them after leaving the cinema, but they're not multi-layered real people-esque characters (ironically, the apes are), but they still work well since we also see where they're coming from. It's a very little problem, and it did not affect me while watching the movie, it didn't strike me until after doing so.This is a film that is sure to make you leave the theater thinking; the ending is a well-executed cliffhanger for sure, and as high as my expectations were, the movie did not disappoint. There's good characters with splendid performances particularly from the apes' side, a smart script, action that serves the narrative, the score is good (though not as memorable as the film as a whole), and overall I believe this is one of the better films of 2014. I highly recommend it. 9.75/10 (but since there's no .75 here I'll give it a 10).",

            "content": "VERDICT(+) Exquisite visuals. Perfect apes: believable; good looking; emotional; intelligent; big and mean, great for the action.(+) Right mood. Very palatable setting: wet, quiet forest. Filmed appropriately dark to set the tone for suspense and mystery. (+) Grade-A action. Borderline ferocious battle, apes vs humans. Unforgiving, bold fighters, especially on the ape side. Fierce, intense standoffs between would be daddy apes.(-) The humans, especially supporting characters (including the masterly Gary Oldman's) are undeveloped.8/10SYNOPSISCaesar is the alpha ape at the helm of his forest-dwelling tribe. Kabo opportunistically struggles against him for leadership. Caesar is widely respected, Kabo largely not. Caesar has demonstrated far-sightedness in steering his tribe forward by utilizing his most precious asset, his previous, long interaction with and resulting understanding of human beings. Caesar is a father and husband as well, factors which make him more likable.Tension commences when a handful of humans stumble too close to the ape home in the forest and an upset man's gunshot wound delivered to an ape sparks a battle mood. Caesar, however, placates his people, delivering only a threat to the humans, but restraining from revenge. One man, Malcom (acted well, as usual, by Jason Clarke), has faith in the apes and wants desperately for humanity's sake to access the water tower currently occupied by the apes as part of their larger dwelling area. Malcolm risks it all \u2013 he goes solo into Apeland with a plea for cooperation.Caesar accepts the plea and Malcolm's little band of workers begins water works. One bad apple among these humans carries some negative emotions and he repeatedly sparks mistrust among the apes, including Caesar's wrath, which, fortunately for this small band, is measured. Malcom manages to placate Caesar.Meanwhile, Kabo repeatedly foments anti-Caesar dissent by presenting Caesar's accommodating approach to human interests as (1) Caesar's preference for humans above apes and (2) dangerous intrusion into the apes' world by humans who must have ulterior, dark motives.Just when a Malcom-Caesar and therefore human-ape cooperative victory is achieved, Kabo shoots Caesar from a hidden place. It's made to look like a human job and Kabo successfully stirs up a war mood among all apes. He mobilizes them with all arms available toward an attack on the human base just outside the forest.An epic battle ensues. The action is top notch with my attention centered on the apes' boldness in undertaking the attack. From their initial attempt at breaking the outer wall to facing heavy arms fire from much higher above, the thumping rampage peaked when a horse- mounted, rifle-bearing Kabo dared to wrest control of the humans' sole artillery-mounted tank.",

'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' continues, and builds on, the story that started in 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. And does so very successfully. The story takes place 10 years after 'Rise' and the Apes have built a home for themselves near San Francisco. They are living happily together still led by Caesar and blissfully unaware that Humans are not as gone as they think...From a technical standpoint, 'Dawn' is an improvement on 'Rise' - and 'Rise' was pretty excellent in that regard - with better CGI, better use of motion capture and more ambitious set-pieces. The inevitable battle scene is spectacular without ever seeming out of scale to the rest of the film and the Apes, which are far greater in number than in 'Rise', are handled seamlessly. Most of the Ape characters are returning from 'Rise' including Rocket, Maurice, Cornelia, Koba and, of course, Caesar. The human characters are all new and it is the relative lack of development with them that is one of the film's few shortcomings. The narrative is simple, but stronger for it, covering a few themes and a short timescale before setting up the next film in the franchise.In short, 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is a worthy, and possibly superior, sequel to 'Rise'.

            "content": "Any film which makes you think about it after seeing it is a film worth the time. Dawn Of Planet Of The Apes is one of the best films in recent times to accomplish that simple but difficult task of making the human brain think and in that process to change. The film succeeds where the older installments (barring the 1968 Schaffner part) failed. It makes us feel for the apes as much as we feel for a human...perhaps more. To achieve this is no mere task and Matt Reeves pulled it off.The film opens 10 years after the previous installment. Much like Battle for the planet of the apes opened 12 years after Conquest. And Ceasar is the king of the apes as was established at the end of Rise. As the film goes darker, we go deeper into the human condition. The action never feels unnecessary and overdone. It is marvelously executed. The apes show more soul in this film than most of the humans. And the storyline is smooth and never drags with its 2 hours runtime. The editing and direction is precise technically and the special effects are brilliant. The real stars are the cgi effects. Never before have apes seemed so real that you will think that they used real apes to film the scenes. The score is dark and exciting. The acting is acceptable from most of the cast.The best part of the entire film is Andy Serkis whose motion capture acting is perfect. He showcases the journey of Ceasar in this film with confidence in the entire film and is the one character who makes everyone on and off the screen hush and listen and watch with anticipation every time he appears. The Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is arguably the best film of the summer as it has all the elements of a blockbuster as well as of a thinking man's film. It showed that there can be darkness in light but also a light in every darkness.",

            "content": "I love the original Planet of the Apes movies. When Rise of the Planet of the Apes came out a few years ago, my reaction was basically, \"Great, another crappy attempt to reboot the franchise\". I couldn't have been more wrong then, as that film was a very good prequel. But Dawn of the Planet of the Apes totally trumped it. First of all, for those who get excited for movies with cool action and great special effects, this one hit it out of the park. The apes were incredible, and the battle scenes were outstandingly done. It was exciting to watch and felt incredibly real. However, I'm not usually one to go for the big special effects movie. I typically get more excited for a deep plot and interesting characters. Well guess what, they hit that too. And the amazing thing was that the most fascinating characters in the movie were the apes who had little verbal dialogue. Sure, they spoke with some sign language but it was still fascinating to watch these creatures come to life before my eyes as real characters with real intellect and emotions. The apes develop and evolve intellectual throughout the film in such an amazing human way. All in all, a really well done film. I enjoyed every moment and will definitely watch it again when it comes out. I hope that they make another. The only thing I'm still searching for in these movies is that I am excited to see them bridge the gap between this series and the original films. Highly recommended, definitely the best movie I've seen this summer.",

            "content": "As with many other titles, even Dawn could not run from clich\u00e9 obstacles that every sequel of a successful movie faces upon its release. When first \"new generation Apes movie\" came out, it was a surprise blockbuster and it did very well in box office, so obviously lot of effort was put into making a sequel that would be as thrilling and dramatic as the first installment.The sequel did a good job overall, personally to me it had interesting atmosphere (grim, rainy forests, war-torn human city) and it was fun watching how both sides (humans x simians) interact with each other from the beginning towards the end - phasing from complete rejection to glimmer of possible mutual understanding and finally ending in all-against-all butchery where apes riding horses and wielding submachine guns thunder over humans.The star of the movie was of course Caesar, who I liked very much already in the first movie. Played brilliantly by Andy Serkis it is figure so powerful and deep that you will care for him the most apart from the other actors who did OK job. Caesar was really the highlight of the piece and I would watch the movie again mainly for the the deepness of the expression and emotions Mr. Serkis put into displaying the leader of the Apes.To conclude, Apes 2 is a movie worth watching, probably just once for most of us, but I definitely do not cry over money spent to see this film. In fact, Im looking forward to the final chapter of this series.",

            "review_title": "Perspective & Possibility: A Shakespearean Spectacle",
            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an ambitious, nuanced, commanding endeavor. Though I find more enjoyment in the rampant momentum of Rise, Dawn is admittedly the better film--far more realized in allegory and character, despite falling short of its predecessor on less-consequential facets. Matt Reeves is perhaps the best director we could have possibly received for this film, and his efforts pay off spectacularly.Reeves is not only a long time fan of Planet of the Apes, but he understands all its layers and nuances (as revealed via audio commentary). Overall, Dawn is more slowly- paced than Rise, yet no less mesmerising. The production design by James Chinlund thrives with history--all scenes but the skyscraper sequence were actually shot on a physical set or location, and the film breathes with natural lighting (including burning down the ape village set for real). There's a constant undercurrent of character-driven intensity from the apes in this film, and a level of technical innovation and ambition that's nigh-comparable to the likes of Avatar and The Lord of the Rings. We're talking shooting motion-capture in the mud and rain, sometimes shooting over a thousand takes, and monumental undertakings in editing. The craftsmanship here is unparalleled.Director of photography Michael Seresin seems like a perfect successor to develop Lesnie's window/cage motif from Rise, seeing as how \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" highlights his repertoire. Unfortunately, I didn't notice much in the way of symbolic sensibilities besides that of Caesar's face opening/closing the film. Nonetheless, the shots are often beautiful and thriving with scope. The effects by WETA are even more astonishing than before, and there's no competition for their accomplishments here.I have problems with select aspects of the direction though, such as elements of the combat sequences, but primarily, disparities within overall scope. Part of this film is trying to tell an epic, but another part of it is relaying a humble, transitionary story. That's a compelling idea in its own right, but sometimes the confines of the world got to me--with connective sequences from the ape village to the bridge to the human compound, making the world feel somewhat small despite the massive implications of the preceding pandemic. I'll also admit that though one-handed machine-gun-wielding apes-on-horseback are awesome, it's a stretch of reality. You can reasonably assume they reload off-camera, but still. . . . If anything drags in this movie, it's the battle sequences--as the real focal point of tension is the characters, and these sequences feel like a digression sometimes. Some more minor flaws include a handful of clich\u00e9s, such as the introductory montage and opening/closing on Caesar's face, though are effective (or even powerful) within their individual contexts.The initial screenplay was written by Rise's duo Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, later revised by Mark Bomback and Reeves himself when he entered the project. Though the plot's admittedly a clich\u00e9 (taking after classic westerns), there's still a lot to praise. Foremost, there's the Shakespearean tragedy: Koba and Caesar, the story about two brothers (as distinguished by Reeves), their clashing philosophies, and inevitable betrayal. If you look closely, you'll also find a meticulous illustration of duality: Caesar and Koba, Malcolm and Dreyfus, humans and apes. . . . war and peace. This film is a multifaceted study on perspective and delusions of infallibility, exhibiting an entire spectrum of viewpoints across a spectrum of affiliations, articulating shades of grey that would normally be presented as a false dichotomy. In this we get a series of reversals, such as humans and apes alike struggling to stay united, humans realizing that they are too animalistic, and apes realizing they are too human. All of this is churning inside the beautiful, fleeting moment in which peace is a possibility.This film also delves back into the franchise's signature sociopolitical commentary, with some light content on gun violence, racism, and international relations. It's still not quite as intricate as 1968's masterpiece, but it's worthy of the Planet of the Apes title.Rise developed a thriving history behind Caesar that Dawn builds off of excellently. Caesar is a character defined by an internal study of duality: belonging to two worlds, and hence belonging truly to neither, dooming him to a certain sense of isolation. The apes on screen thrive with depth in their dawning civilization, and though apes can't physiologically produce vocalized speech or tears, these stretches of reality are executed mostly tastefully. The human characters however present an interesting flaw, in which I sympathise with them, but I don't especially \"care\" about them. They work well in their depiction of an emotional reality, and within their role in the film's themes, but they simply aren't as individually complex and emotive as the apes (which was a near-impossible balance to strike in the first place, given the context).The human performance highlights are Oldman and Russell. Clarke is competent, despite a sometimes dry chemistry with the other actors. The only truly iffy ape performance for me was Thurston, who at times felt emotionally constipated--but besides that, the apes are great! Karin Konoval is delightful and has a touching scene with Kodi Smit-McPhee. Kebbel delivers a heartbreaking performance as Koba, exhibiting a perfectly messy fusion of hurt, anger, restraint, and obsession. Serkis is truthfully just as riveting without the CG, having seen behind-the-scenes footage. He's an incredible motion-capture actor because he's an incredible actor. That's all there is to it.I don't like Giacchino's score as much as Doyle's (and I really wish he made an effort for thematic continuity), but it's still better than your average film score. The orchestration feels a little thin at times, or like a score to an animated movie, but the darker segments are fantastic--especially where Giacchino delves into more avant- garde, Jerry Goldsmith-influenced sensibilities. This is easily one of the best Apes films, and is solidifying what's looking to be one hell-of-a trilogy.Score: 9/10",

Not just good, but great!As a whole, this movie is truly touching, from the start till the end. And what makes it so special is that its the heart-warming feeling surrounded between humans and animals. The interaction between the humans and the apes are truly bonded, by heart and by feels. The first 15-20 minutes of the film is amazingly heart-warming. It touches me in every moment. I wished that it'll stays but it didn't, the story slowly breaks your heart. Like everything you wished, comes to an end. But thankfully, it'll warms your heart once again.This movie is like a roller-coaster ride between heart-warming and heart-breaking. I almost cried at some part but it does make me smile a lot also. The feelings are real. This movie feels real.Story-wise, the construction is linear. Its thrilling and threatening.Acting-wise, all the actors aren't bad. In fact, humans are more like a cameo to the supporting character in the whole movie and mostly apes are the one that take credits.Cinematographic-wise, \"Hollywood angles\". Blockbusting. Nothing's that special. It's good. But there's one scene that I will remember it forever due to its uniqueness.Soundtrack-wise, most of the time is quite \"cliffhanging\". It plays and it turns away whenever the warmest part comes. Its like tears almost shed but it stuck at the frame of your eyes.Effect-wise, CGI had made me think that the apes are real. It's better than today's standard. Its better than the Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Truly Amazing. All you can expect will be there!Overall. I rated it 8 out of 10 for the following reasons. 1.One-liner could be better. 2. Directing could be better or more unique(potentially). 3. Music should be less \"cliffhanging\". 4.

Nevertheless, when Andy Serkis was cast in the first film, \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\" I became confident the film had a strong potential to breathe new life into the series. The first installment, contrary to everyone's thoughts before its release, turned out to be a great opener to the new series, as it was deeply emotional and character-driven, while Andy Serkis' motion capture performance as \"Caesar\" gave his his character a genuine human aspect that audiences sympathized with and cared about. The sequel, titled, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\", is just as much a surprise as the first installment. Let me start with the visual effects. They are, in a word, incredible. Motion Capture continues to improve over the years, and what you see in this film is without a doubt the best you've seen to date. WETA, the visual effects department co-founded by Peter Jackson and the winner of 5 Academy Awards (LOTR trilogy, King Kong, and Avatar) outdoes themselves in this film. The Apes look incredibly realistic, even more so than in the first film only 3 years ago. Thanks to motion capture, you get the emotional expression of the actor penetrate the CGI and touch the audience in a unique and incredibly intimate way. You FEEL the hardship and inner struggles of these well-drawn, unique characters. As mentioned earlier, Andy Serkis gives another Oscar-worthy performance as \"Caesar\", but Toby Kebbel, who plays the emotionally and physically scared ape, \"Koba\" gives him a run for his money. Despite his actions, the audience feels for this character and has a great understanding of the motivations behind what he does in the film. He is a truly menacing and terrifying antagonist and one of the best I've seen on the big screen in quite a while. Besides having well-written characters, the parallels and connections the screenplay weaves between the apes and humans is incredibly well-crafted. These are two very different species who really want the same thing for each other---peace, safety, and prosperity. Though they are different physically, by the end of the film the audience comes full circle and realizes just how similar the apes and humans really are. This gradual realization is done in a smart and engaging way, and Caesar's discovery of this is touching and relevant to the viewer. The film also goes deep into and explores the evolving society of the apes, the hierarchy that exists, education system, and inner struggles with Caesar, his family, and his relationship with Koba. It's not as allegorical as the original 1968 film, but nonetheless it examines the hardships of a new society that juxtapose the human side. Moving on to the technical areas, the direction by Matt Reeves (Let Me In, Cloverfield) is very smooth and smartly executed. This being my first Reeves film, I was very impressed. The cinematography of the film is beautiful---the apes colony being visually striking as well as the worn down, dilapidated San Francisco. Also, although being a 150 minute exercise, the film has very good pacing and has few dull moments (the only dull moments come with the human characters). The only weak spot in this film is the human characters. They pale in comparison to the apes and aren't as well drawn-out or unique. Furthermore, the writing between the characters isn't top notch by a long shot. Fortunately, they don't get as much screen time as the apes and it turns out to be a weakness that is overcome by the film's end. In conclusion, Matt Reeves' \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is a superior entry in the Apes franchise and is one of those extremely rare sequels that greatly improves upon its predecessor. It will certainly be a tough act to follow, but with Serkis already signed on for the next entry, and (hopefully) Reeves returning to direct, I'm already excited for what's in store.",

I didn't think that the film would top Rise of the Apes and was wondering how it would compare to this already great year of films, such as Captain America 2 and X Men: DOFP. Gladly, it was better than them both. It was great to see Caesar's growth from the first film and how much of a leader he has now become. He has to make tough decisions but is still a great leader. I would have liked to see a bit more of the effects of the virus from the first movie but after a while, it doesn't matter as we can imagine what it must have been like. The acting was stronger, it was great to see how the apes had survived and the unity they have with each other.

            "content": "Watching this movie made me uncomfortable. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a knot of palpable tension between humans and simians. Life and Peace are better than war and death, and some understand this better than others. Peace, like the lives of the humans and the apes in this movie, is balanced on a thinning string of hope and consequences understood by the de facto leader of the humans, Malcolm (Jason Clarke), and the leader of the apes, Caesar (Andy Serkis returning from Rise of the Planet of the Apes).The movie picks up ten years after Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Through news footage, we learn that a virus dubbed the \"Simian\" virus has ravaged the planet's human population, leaving only \"immune\" ragtag groups here and there. In San Francisco, where Dawn takes place, Malcolm and his small group of specialists are attempting to reactivate a hydroelectric dam, as the human survivors dwelling in the city's quarantined zone are running out of power. There's only one problem. The dam lies in ape territory. Caesar subsequently gives Malcolm's team access to the dam, while maintaining a vigilant watch over them. The apes, especially Koba, an experimented-on escapee of the \"smart-drug\" creating laboratory in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, are wary of humans, and the threat they pose with their weapons. The audience is wary, too, as there is a disquieting sense that the \"peace\" thread between humans and apes will snap any moment. When it does snap, thanks in part to Koba's actions, the result is a clash of species. Dawn is anticlimactic...just slow tension building. It goes where we suspect it would. Caesar and Malcolm attempt to maintain peace through mutually helping each other's team in critical moments, while many around them, on both sides, are actively pursuing war.When the inevitable breaks out, the conclusion leads to where the audience expects it to--a third movie to be released in 2016.",

            "content": "This is a film I greatly anticipated having thoroughly enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and with the addition of one of my favourite actors, Gary Oldman, I was almost bursting with anticipation once again. Well OK, maybe not bursting otherwise I'd have seen it at the cinema, but close.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) picks up 10 years after its predecessor in a world ravaged by the disease. Humans are few in numbers and the apes have all but forgotten about them. That is until they stumble upon each other and exchange blows. The film then follows the apes and humans' attempted accommodation of each other. Needless to say, this doesn't last and a battle for survival ensues which threatens to wipe out both sides.RotPotA (Im just going to abbreviate now because, lets face it, I can keep typing the titles) was a film that set new heights for the franchise as it was the first one not to use men in ape costumes. DotPotA took the already frightening reality of the apes to a whole new level. The special effects used to create the apes is astonishing, there is no part of their being, their movement or actions that looks false.The opening shot is a close-up of Caesar's (Andy Serkis) eyes which was chilling to say the least. Although my favourite scene is when Caesar, after a long pause, shout GO! at the humans. Now that was utterly chilling, I mean I genuinely had goose bumps and actually rewound it to watch it again. Everything about that scene was immense.The effects are not solely to credit for the realism of Caesar, a huge amount of respect must be paid to Andy Serkis aka the real Caesar, who really brought this ape to life. His movements and mannerisms encapsulated an ape and really helped transform this CGI ape into a real character.One of the things I liked about the film was the empathy I felt for both side, the humans and the apes. Both caught in a war not of their choosing but having to fight it none the less. We saw more of the apes' side of the story but that is to be expected, yet it did not paint the humans in a bad light so finding myself rooting for both sides was something I don't often find myself doing.Overall I enjoyed the film, it did what it could with the story it had. We all know what happens in the end (refer to the title Planet of the Apes) and that the humans will eventually lose. That being said, director Matt Reeves gave us an enjoyable ride with some great characters, great action scenes and even greater effects. So all in all, good film.",

            "content": "I wanted first of all to say that I absolutely loved this film.I waited impatiently, and hearing some critics about it, I thought I was going to be disappointed. However, this was not the case at all, which is why I would like to clarify some points.First, the criticism about weak dialogs are futile: the dialogs are not very developed, that's for sure, but after all, the entire film is about a community of apes just learning to speak and foremost to communicate, including gestures. Then you should not expect from them long speeches and rhetoric ! And about the humans, we must remember that their role is not central, they are not the heart of the analysis but instead they play more the role of a ratio (between man and animal, the reason and instinct), so that the weakness of their interactions is precisely encountered to highlight the progress of apes on men, such as newborns learning to speak for the first time. Thus, these critics seem to me unjustified. It is true that the script is not really worked in depth, however we do not get bored, and some twists are very enjoyable. It is unfair to talk about a lack of creativity in the script and about the \"hollywoodian\" side of it, because on the contrary the heart of the film lies in the aesthetic movement, feelings, ie in the implementation and perspective on every gesture of the apes, (as opposed to humans) every glance, every feeling, every outstretched hand. From this point of view, the film is wonderful, and thanks to the excellent harmony among the team of WETA, the special effects coordinators, specialists of mimicry and simian language, and the 15,000 people needed for the total production of the film. Some say they were annoyed or have found the film ridiculous. Of course, the film is built on a few conventional bases (the main plot, the twists and the final stand), however this is more than offset by the completion of the film, based on the analysis and research on the close relationship between ape and man, between reason and animality, mixed by the tumultuous relationship between Caesar and men, torn between love and distrust.In the end, the work is mastered, striking, and above all truthful about the heart of the film, that is the recognition of a species through the eyes of another.",

            "content": "I have to say that when I saw the poster for the film (Caesar on a horse with a machine gun) I thought that this was going to be a full-on action movie. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't.Don't get me wrong, it has its fair share of action, but most of this only really kicks off in and around the middle to the end (much like the first film). Before that, however, comes a thought-provoking yet tension building introduction.It begins with a dramatic scene showing the virus spread across all of the Earth, and the slow escalation to panic (mostly words, very little action and no gore). A nice way to start, picking up where the last movie left off (except changing the colour of the virus- I believe it was yellow at the end of the last movie. Just saying).What follows are some tense and well-constructed scenes portraying the relations between the thriving apes and the desperate humans, and also the similarities between the 2. The humans are trying to get to a hydroelectric dam to power their safehouse to enable them to send a radio signal out to other parts of the Earth to meet up with other survivors. The problem is that it is on the apes' land. There is some yo-yoing between relations and some cooperation between the species, displaying their similarities. The waves of tension are genius. I will not go that far into them as I don't want to spoil it, but to summarise: relations deteriorate and you think war is coming, things improve and you realise it isn't, again and again. Brilliant stuff.Alas, war commences (which isn't a spoiler because it was clear already from the poster and the over-informative trailers). It does not, however, begin in the way you'd expect (oooh mystery). Of course the action sequences are watered down as it is a 12-rated film, but that does not stop them from being exhilarating. Ironically the action demonstrated another similarity between the 2 races- greed. Both spent part of the movie arguing over whether or not to kill the other race, and they ultimately end up attempting to do so (but again, not for the reason you would think ).This action continues until near the end, where the film closes with a not-really-extremely-happy-yet-at-the-same-time-not-really- sad ending.The characters are pretty good. There is just the right amount of background story in the main characters- enough to fill us in but at the same time not too much as it's not that important to find out an extensive background- where they grew up etc is not all that important.The acting is superb. Malcolm, the James Franco-like main character, fearful over starting a war and reverent towards the apes, is acted superbly. The supporting cast play their parts well also. I'm a huge Gary Oldman fan (who isn't), and I have to say he played his part very well- the war-hardened, grief-stricken leader of the survivors.The visuals are stunning. The apes are detailed, the apes' surroundings are beautiful and the humans' wreckage, well, it is a very nice wreckage. The action sequences are shot very well also.Faults? Maybe. I'm not sure why the apes didn't need to reload their guns (and I didn't see any extra ammo). Very little else apart from that. A fantastic movie, more proof that sequels (and remakes) can be every bit as good (if not better) as originals. Good stuff.",

            "content": "A fantastic sequel to an already great reboot. The people behind these films have really done well to put new life into a dated series, while still holding high regard for their predecessors. Where the first film concentrates on the evolution of the apes and remained very intimate in tone, albeit building to something bigger by the end, 'Dawn..' takes an entirely different approach with an action packed but still very intelligent blockbuster. The effects are absolutely fantastic. There is a subtlety to the apes that works a treat. Not overdoing the human characteristics so as to become cartoon-like or cheesy, but also showing the significant changes in their behaviour as they gradually become more human. This is especially well done in Caesar and Koba. The visuals elsewhere are equally stunning with a demolished San Francisco done perfectly with a mix of CGI and effective set design. The first sequence, concerning a hunt in the woods is instantly riveting and you can't help at marvel at the fluidity of the action. This is also evident in some later sequences as the inevitable war breaks out (well..we all know how its gonna end). The human cast do well in their various roles with nothing too taxing expected of them. Slightly more significant roles from Gary Oldman and Jason Clarke are performed with conviction and you can genuinely get behind either of their goals (whichever one you may choose). Maximum praise should be given to Andy Serkis once again. His understanding and grasp of motion capture, and his ability to give such incredible performances, while in the guise of all manner of creatures, continues to impress and astound. He is able to give such raw emotional depth to Caesar as a character that he is almost human. Which I suppose is the point. On the other hand, his total immersion into the animal side of Caesar, with his movement and body language, reminds you that you are still watching a chimp. The line is balanced perfectly and Serkis is fully in command. His performance is believable and completely committed. Credit is also due to Toby Kebbell as the man behind Koba. I really enjoyed the entire experience of watching this film. It was dark and tense in parts, touching at times and the action was visceral and exciting. There are some beautiful shots throughout with real world effects and CGI so seamless that at times, you cannot actually tell them apart. Can't wait to see where they take this franchise...",

            "content": "What a thrilling tale, for those who've seen the first one, prepare to be blown away. It's 10 years later and mankind has for the most part been wiped out from a synthetic virus originally hailed as a cure for Alzheimer's. If you remember the virus was originally created by lib douche bag and possible homosexual James Franco in the original. The virus increases the intelligence of apes and simians but decimates any human it comes into contact with(airborne transmission, fluids,etc). A small colony of humans have survived in the decrepit and sin-filled ruins of lib/homo capital San Francisco, led by the proud and staunchly conservative Gary Oldman who plays a more convincing American than most liberals today do. We catch up with Caesar and find out that he's been busy, he and his merry band of apes, gorillas, and orangutans have created a peaceful society in the deceptively quiet forest. Their settlements are primitive, but the apes are content and there is a remarkable level of organization within the society. There are hunters, guards, soldiers, fishermen, builders, a teacher who instructs students in reading and writing, a royal family and even what appears to be a priestly class who possibly double as attendants and midwives for the lovely ape queen Cornelia. The apes are slow to change and adapt but only because they wisely understand that any sudden upheavals and uncontrolled variables could easily tear apart the fragile peace and society they've created here. Their conservative society is here to stay. Enter the humans, weak and desperate, they come across the now forgotten apes and almost instantly disrupt their way of life. The apes however, wisely confront this new threat with an offer of peace. Such genius, Caesar himself is set to join the ranks of fellow world conservative leaders like Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchhill, Benjamin Netanyahu, Margaret Thatcher and Bush Senior. The humans of course, filled with fear and hatred, conspire to destroy everything the self-sufficient apes have built, most likely so the apes are forced to rely on welfare and handouts to survive. The brave military conservative leader, Koba, quickly recognizes the humans ace in the hole, and their obvious advantage, the apes have agility, speed, strength and spears, but the humans have guns, and that's all there is to it. Koba quickly and efficiently learns how to exercise his God-given second amendment rights and arms the apes for war. He's forced to make a terrible choice and ends up almost killing Caesar. His \"death\" however galvanizes the apes and they preemptively strike against the humans who hate and fear them. Koba's bravery and initiative ensures the apes victory over the humans, who surely symbolize liberalism and its faults. End in the end though, Koba falls, but his actions, while brutal, served to ensure the survival and prosperity of the proud apes, and even Caesar recognizes that. The apes occupy the city even despite warnings of more humans arriving, but the movie ends on a positive note as the apes prepare to clean up San Francisco and the rest of the liberal rubbish.

It had that affect on me because I really loved the way the story picked up from the last one and the turns it took in this one. There where just great. So simple and unpredictable but logical and because of that they felt fresh and not copied out. It was just a joy to see. Matt Reeves really delivers one of the best movies of the year for me. He does a great job with every aspect of the movies in this apes installment. From unbelievable motion capture - CGI apes to action scenes, storytelling aspects, building the tension... the guy knows what he's doing.The movie from start to finish has that epic feel, and, for me, what is great is that it has that scenes which, even if the movie was lame, would still be very memorable. From this scenes what got to me the most were the apes talking scenes. Brilliantly done. Especially the scene with Caesar. The way he used words to create emotions without creating a sentence radiated power and wisdom, and were so epic. For that we have to congratulate to Andy Serkis. The guy is the best motion capture actor today. Really knows how to do it good. Two other characters I need to address. The first one is Koba. Whoever designed this guy gets applause from me. He looks so wicked, sick and capable of doing everything that he does in the movie. Of course performance of Toby Kebbell gave life to Koba so praises to him. And the second one is Dreyfus, or rather just Gary Oldman. How great of an actor he is. He needs one scene, just one scene that you could cut out from the movie, watch it and still get every bit of feeling, emotion, whats going on in it without him saying a word, and cry. Oh yeah, there were tears for this scene there is no doubt.Final act of the movie was all so great, but one part of it stuck with me more than others and it's because it reminded me of one scene from The dark knight rises. Going in the scene the emotions were the some, the surroundings were the same but the outcome was different. One you cheer for.I'm gonna watch this movie a lot more.",

            "content": "Much darker than \"Rise,\" \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" rises and falls on the large shoulders of Andy Serkis. He gives Caesar a quiet dignity and, if possible, almost makes him human in his emotions. He does not want war, even when those around him insist on it. Serkis conveys more with his eyes than many actors do with their words. From the anger or betrayal to the joy of holding his newborn son, Caesar is the strongest and best drawn out character in the film. Serkis is joined by other actors who also bring out the emotions under their computer generated fur. Kebbell is angry and bitter as Koba while Karin Konoval, as the gentle orangutan Maurice (a nice nod to the late Maurice Evans, who appeared in the original 1968 film), is kind and caring. On the human side, Clarke and Keri Russell do well as the leaders of the observation group, as does Kodi Smit-McPhee, as a young man who spends his time sketching his new simian friends. Oldman is a little over the top in his distrust of the furry fellows. Perhaps someone told him that Hollywood is actually a town run by apes. The time is now. While the genetically evolved apes from the first film, led by Caesar (Serkis, in what should be an Oscar winning performance) occupy the woods mankind, overwhelmed by the ravages of disease now lives in camps that were one time major cities. We find such a group of survivors in what used to be San Francisco. While on an exploration mission outside the city, a group of humans come across two young apes. A standoff occurs, broken when one of the group panics and fires his gun. The ape is only wounded but the shot of the gun brings out a shrewdness of apes (yes, dear readers, if you want to impress your friends tell them that a group of apes is referred to as a \"shrewdness), led by Caesar. Caesar still remembers the kindness he received from some humans and brokers a peace between the two factions. This does not sit well with Koba (Toby Kebbell), a fellow ape who longs to battle. He will soon get his wish. Visually the film is outstanding. The apes and their world are rendered well as is the inner workings of what is left of the city of San Francisco. As for the 3D\u0085once again it brought nothing to the film but a lot of blurry images in the foreground. I honestly think the process needs to be saved for animated films, where it seems to work the best.",

Certainly in my top 30 of all time.Dawn of the planet of the apes, unfortunately, won't be in my top 100 movies of all time. The CGI was done superbly, but that is the mainstream nowadays. I mean, for that matter I could like all of Marvel's monstrosities. It was nice to see Ceasar again, and how the rest of his primate friends developed to be smarter than your average Homo Sapiens. But it just didn't cut it for me. The entire feel of the first reboot of the franchise was left out. Obviously, this was due to the rewrite of the script. Thanks to, who's name shall not be filed, oh wait, he actually wanted credit for that?I wish I could describe to its entirety what went wrong with this one, but that's impossible considering the mistakes they made. I can however, tell generally where they went wrong. That means I have to describe what went so well with the first one. Which was emotion, the overall progress of the story, the development of the characters, twists, and undeniable clich\u00e9s which are human to its core. You admire them, you hate them. The characters became your friends, and your enemies, and at the end of the movie it left you with a raw feeling of happiness and sadness at the same time. It left you longing for more, and it told you that (in the sense of how good the next one ought to be) to those who wait, good will come. WRONG. Everything I just said about the preceding title \"Rise of the planet of the apes\" was EXCLUDED in \"Dawn of the planet of the apes\". In fact, I just watched the movie with a grin accompanied by a frown, not knowing what to make of it. I finished it purely because I so enjoyed the preceding title, and had this feeling of having to know what will happen next. Apes with guns, OK, it had to come to that. But seriously? Just a handful? Just a handful of people too? And of course, just Americans. What about the rest of the world? It wasn't just the USA that was struck. It was the entire world, right? No, but of course the only remaining live humans are from America, which not to forget, is ground zero. I also want to add, what about the rest of the apes that should have gotten their doze/infection, as the virus is airborne. Maybe the idea for the next movie? War for the planet of the apes? They should have given some fundamentals to what is going on, on planet Earth. This was just a sad excuse of a sequel. Not worth the time, or the money. Don't watch it alone (too boring). Don't watch it with your kids (too violent), don't expect too much.I'm feeling generous today, and I rate this movie a nice even 6.",

But every once i a while a movie comes along, so strong, that it manages to surpass even great expectations.I should properly say that i am not the biggest PotA Fan to begin with. I really like the original and was pleasantly surprised by Rise. But Dawn plays in a totally different league. Everything about this movie is to notch. From the screenplay, Direction, Acting, Score, Cinematography, Lighting, Editing and of course the Effects. But when you say the effects in this movie are great, it still feels like a major understatement. When it comes to the (e)motion capture effects, we are talking Avatar level! The effects are absolutely 100% Photorealistic. They are so good, that 10 minutes into the movie you stop being amazed by the effect and just recognize them as characters. I thing that is the ultimate goal any effect should try to achieve! The Actors, Humans and Apes, all do great jobs here. But special mention most go to Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell who play Ceaar and Koba. They both bring unbelievable presence, strength, honor and in Kobas case threat to there parts. The Film itself is paced very well and does not have a doll moment. Yet the director is confident enough to not rush to the scenes. He gives the characters and settings time to breath. The world they build is very atmospheric and believable. The film also has many memorable scenes many of them with little or no dialog. The actors often working with gestures and there eyes. Which is especially fascinating when you realize that every performance has to by made twice. Once by the Actor and once by the visual effects Artist. And make no mistake, Artists they are! The movie, though great in scope and spectacle has little in common with the average summer Blockbuster. It is not a fun Action adventure. There is serious emotion and drama to be found here. And even though there are a couple of great Action set-pieces, it is often the small quiet moment that managed to move me the most. There were several Moments and the Film when i had bleary eyes. And i don't tear up that easily! One of these Moments was the absolute great and in my opinion very brace Ending. Powerful, powerful Stuff!They are already working on the next Apes Movie which should come out in 2016. If they can contain that level of quality, i am really looking forward to where the story leads next. Until then, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes remains the best of it franchise and for now the best movie of the Summer.",

It chronicles the relationship between the human survivors and a group of genetically modified apes led by Caesar. Through the evolution of the narrative events occur that leave the human survivors and the apes on the brink of war. The cast includes Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, and the wonderful returning Andy Serkis as Caesar. The acting is in all regard good, but where it truly shines is in the scenes where Clarke's character is interacting with Caesar. The chemistry between the two leads is compelling, thrilling, and aw inspiring. Particularly due to Andy Serkin's phenomenal video capture work. Gary Oldman is also fantastic, (per usual) and no actor's presence seems to detract from the film. Director Matt Reeves is one of the undeniable factors that makes 'Dawn' so great. Reeves direction is smart, intuitive, and filled with dozens of engaging shots. Reeves hits the mark with almost every frame and this greatly affects the overall intensity and emotion of the film. The screenplay is also admirable for creating memorable dialogue even if some of it fells like exposition. 'Dawn' also exceeds in exhibiting interesting social commentary throughout. The film presents themes of racial tension in intellectual ways and this is greatly appreciated due to the much-needed depth it adds. These social messages help to create a great deal social relevancy propelling the film past just great Si-Fi. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes improves over its predecessor in almost every way. From the stellar direction to the social commentary, 'Dawn\" exceeds the summer blockbuster template to construct a film that is truly relevant while also being extremely entertaining.",

            "review_title": "Long Time Fan Critique",
            "content": "This reimagining of the POTA series is refreshing, bittersweet, and disappointing for long time fans. Forgive me if I am incorrect, but this Dawn rendition seems to fit most appropriately just after the third from the original early 70s series (Escape from POTA) and subsequently following \"Rise Of\". Although \"Dawn\" is a very good film relative to today's spirit of filmmaking, it deviates for the worse on many respects from the serene intellectual conservatism of the original's to a more militaristic and ostensible style of interaction. I honestly cannot blame directing as much as screen writing is at fault here. Virtually all action/sci-fi films in the 2010 era are high budget, fast paced, CGI intensive, and dialogue light.In \"Dawn\", there is little to no element of deception to make the film have replay value because of its lack of (capitalizing on) deep themes- not much is left to the imagination. No longer is fear mongering reserved exclusively for humans, as Koba consistently provokes apes to share a similar militaristic viewpoint. Dimensions of character development feel rushed as only the familiar jungle and CGI is what remains in the recent update. No longer do politics come into play when the moment of reckoning is realized, no character \"outwits\" or improvises the changing of destiny except for a scene or two.While this film is enjoyable, the budget -which is about 100x greater than the later Apes films of the 70s- does not deliver in a cost-benefit type of way. The simian civilization has negligible to no autonomy and Caesar is the brawn and brains of the entire group. Viewer sensitivity is lost because suspenseful scenes are way overdone, and the \"adorable factor\" is underwhelming because of that loss of intimacy. Dialogue is brief yet completely transparent. As much as I tried to appreciate each facet of this story, it sort of felt like the 70s POTA series being chased by a cavalry led by Michael Bay to conjure up an action packed yet semi-philosophical rendition of a very interesting concept.",

The camera work is superb throughout - you always get the full sense/tension of the story.I always feel that, along with camera work, the music is vital in setting a scene. This film excels in that department.Throughout this movie the focus is always on the feelings encountered by the humans/apes. We see the feelings of each character emerge in every scene. Something that I particularly applaud. I can always sense the inner feeling of each character on each scene.We get to feel that the apes are not simply apes.

As you need to know he background of the different characters in the movie. especially Caesar.They have done an amazing job of this movie. The special effects are second to none and the story line is amazing. Lets face it, a lot of these kind of movies are dragged out and the story line can effectively become very dull.

Oh, yes! Those weapon wielding, talking apes that have always been at war with our species through countless movies dating back from the late 60s. Over time, the hype started to fade as I watched the trailers broadcasted all over the media. At the back of my mind, I started to hesitate to purchasing a ticket.I bought a ticket for two, one for me and the other for my mother who is a fan as well. I would have brought more people, but they were busy watching Transformers. Popcorn? Check. Drinks? Check. Best seats? Check. Cellphones turned off? Double check. While the movie played, the theater was dead silent with only a few laughs here and there. Everyone's attention focused on the movie. It's rare that I shed a tear when it comes to anything, but the movie in certain scenes really will let the waterworks start. I won't spill out any spoilers, not only, because of the rules here, but it is better that you experience it all yourself.The soundtrack is engaging and memorable. I found myself taking in the various tracks along with the movies that I found each one fit perfectly. The soundtrack by the way can be found on YouTube, and it's worth listening to. In fact, as I write the review I have been playing the first track on repeat. The CGI is amazing to the point that I had to look closely to make sure they were not real apes. A lot of movies these days to me don't produce the realistic CGI to me, but this movie delivers. The special effects are wonderful. The storyline is great, but as I mentioned before I will not spill out the spoilers out of respect for those who have not seen it.It's important to note that the Charles Heston POTA and Tim Burton's version have nothing to do with Rise and Dawn. Rise and Dawn are reboots. If you want to know what happens between Rise and Dawn, check out the novel, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: Firestorm that has already been released a few months ago.That's my summary review of the movie.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes it one step further.Matt Reeves direction is a welcome fresh perspective and he mixes the emotional drama and edge of your seat action sequences very well.Andy Serkis as always is fantastic and makes his take on Caesar believable and you feel for his character. But the one who really steals the show is Toby Kebbell playing Koba, his character is at times really quite scary! The battle scenes are really great and take Planet of the Apes to a new high, but with all the action you don't lose the heart warming drama that made the previous instalment so successful, Caesar is really struggling to maintain a balance between the humans and apes. It's not just the apes though, Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman both put in sterling performances, and although the pace of this film is a lot faster than all previous apes films I find it works well.The CGI apes are again extremely realistic but the effects don't overcast the performances as is common in so main high profile big budget movies. If Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a remake of Conquest, then this is a remake of Battle that far exceeds the source material.

            "content": "When I saw the original Planet of the apes, I felt it made a strong statement on where we are as a civilized world. The film allowed us to look at ourselves from an outside perspective, and see our successions and mistakes from the point of view of an \"alien\" viewer. It doesn't degrade us or applaud us it just says here we are, what do you think.Now in the very well done prequel in 2011 we can stand back and unlike the other Plant of the Apes films we can view the films hero Caesar as our outside \"alien\" but with the added benefit of him living in a place that is \"alien\" to him and not to us. In Tim Burtons version and the original our protagonist was human in an unfamiliar world, but in an all to well familiar society. So this new ability allows us to sympathies with an ape rather then a human, and look at the modern day world from Caesars outside perspective.Since this film is a prequel we know it is moving slowly towards its predecessors, and we begin to notice it in Dawn of the Plant of the Apes (what a duzy of a title). The story begins a little after the last one ended. Most of the modern world (from what we can see) is gone, assuming because of the deadly virus that shows no affects on apes except for an extreme increase in intelligence. And as we see in most apocalyptic setting in Hollywood there are survivors, and they live in the ruins of San Francisco. On the other side of \"pond\", in the redwood is where Caesar has built a growing and thriving empire. It has many of the same characteristics of some of man's early empires, and the apes wield many familiar weapons. The conflict arises when the humans must fix a power dam to regenerate the city electricity, but the dam is located within the apes boarders. Caesar negotiates a deal to allow humans within the boarder to fix the dam, understanding the humans need it too live. Now we see that both society's feel fear and can view the risk to there livelihood and well being. It is at this time we begin to notice our similarities to the apes. In a time of great risk comes large decisions which is ensued by politics, greed, corruption and a lust for absolute power. This all blends with the panic and hysteria of the citizens to create a portrait how a general war begins.This is an extremely entertaining film which properly works through the characters ability to grip you with emotion and suspense, while keeping an underlying theme all the way through. It is a true blockbuster that knows how to properly mix an investment on characters, story and beautiful CGI that compliments the film greatly.",

It hits on the human condition on multiple angles, sociopolitical issues, and personal motivations such as fear, family, future for oneself's and/or others, protecting home, mistrust, and revenge.Caesar is no doubt the star of this show and Andy Serkis' performance as that ape matured into a weary leader of his people improved by many steps from 'Rise'. Koba was also excellent and stole the spotlight in a good way along with Caesar. The chemistry between the two was so compellingly tragic that it is easy to emotionally invest into them. The humans do put up a really good show, but I say that the apes are the more interesting characters here thanks to the improvement in the CGI.I strongly recommend watching this movie because it will be worth your money and time!",

Yes the prior one was decent but this movie is SOO Much better I'm not going to say much about the plot because that's a spoiler but this movie throws you straight into action from the 1st minute and doesn't let go.The imagery is astounding but just cause the imagery is great doesn't mean this movie doesn't have a plot. It does and it feels like a plot back when Hollywood didn't over rely on special effects to bring in box office receipts. IE extremely believe characters, real drama, a plot you can't figure out on how it's going to end but just keep you in suspense.Bravo! I look forward to seeing the next movie. Highly recommended!",

Its genius is not on the actions shown but on the messages hidden well beneath its storyline. Imagine World War Z or any other post-apocalyptic scenario (Walking Dead for that matter) where the Zombies are not all just eager to rip everyone apart and eat them and kill them but are as curious as humans as to truly figure out a way to coexist, share resources and strengths, to a common well-being: Symbiosis.The screenplay could have been taken place in an unknown populated village in India and also make the public benefit from exploring a new scenery. But perhaps it could have been too distracting to the audience, since as said previously, so many didn't quite follow the underlying story. I dare to say the director went for the easy-enough-for-a-10-years-old-to-follow script; and delivered it beautifully. Especially the way the reasons for wars are always all but what they are advertised for: they are generally driven by personal gain of power, accumulation of wealth or pure revenge. This middle chapter leaves so much room for the sequel to mature into an imaginable world where humans should or will have to cooperate with a different \"race\" to survive. Looking forward to watching the next one(s).",

The CGI made me forget that what I was watching wasn't real monkeys, and some of the parallels that are drawn between the humanity of the apes versus the inhumanity of the people was really thought provoking. That being said, aside from the above mentioned idea and a few tribal thrills you get from watching the apes evolve, the storyline seemed quite bland and unoriginal.Another thing I liked about this movie was the way they showed human problems in the context of a paleolithic style society of apes. I don't want to give away too much, but for those of you who enjoy a movie which is able to go deeper than surface value, this one might do it for you.I had huge expectations coming into this, which may account for my disappointment, because the movies not awful, but it's also not the sci-fi phenomenon I was hoping for. I'd love to have seen the human society as a whole have wrestled with the humanity of the apes a bit more than they did, and it seems to me like a few too many characters remained unchanged throughout the movie, but overall, it was a fun watch, and I'd recommend it to anyone with a few hours to burn. 7/10",

Even for the bad ape, Koba is not bad. He is just an unfortunate primate who went through hell in the drug laboratory.My friend once told me humans are the top predator in the eco food web. Nothing is above humans on Earth. That's why once in a while we will be struck by pandemic. Supposedly to control the population of humans. That's how the law of nature works.In fact, all the living creatures are the holders of DNA. As life evolves, biodiversity is formed, creating humans and other living creatures. Conflicts will arise as we compete for the same resources, not to mention when the war is between two highly intelligent species. This is what the film about, conflicts and the right to survive.This reboot/prequel is the latest entry in the planet of apes franchise. Still remember my first experience with the franchise started in 2001 when Mark Wahlberg takes the lead in \u300aPlanet of Apes\u300b. It's the film which opens my mind, taking me into the universe of science fiction. Its ending is astonishing in my childhood and is still vivid in mind.Now, 2014 continues the legacy of this franchise with DOTPOA. The movie is sentimental in its own way. There are tears, there are deep emotional feeling between humans and apes, and there are angry apes with spears too ^^One of the beauty of the film is there's no real or truly bad antagonist. Even the bad ape, Koba is not bad. He is just an unfortunate primate who went through hell in the drug laboratory. What he learned from human is only hatred. Both the species are just struggling for their lives, their rights to survive. No matter Caeser, the leader of apes or Malcolm, humans leader played by Jason Clarke aka discount version of Mark Ruffalo. To be fair, though, both leaders are always trying to find a peaceful way to coexist. Just the hatred and jealousy destroy the peace.\"I always thought apes are better than humans. Humans kill each other, devour among themselves, apes do not. But now. .. now I realise, we are just the same.\" -Caeser with a heartbroken tone.#dawnoftheplanetoftheapes",

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes also has a very gripping story, and very good acting, not just by the actors playing apes, but the actors playing humans as well.

            "content": "It took me a long time to finally get around to watching \"Rise.\" Much too long. I went to see the \"Apes\" double feature last night at the AMC Theatre and my mind was absolutely blown.I'll always remember flicking channels on TV and seeing the old Apes films pop up on the sci fi channel from time to time, and I just couldn't stand how awful they looked. They did not seem to age well to me, obviously they're much older films utilizing much older tech, but I could not get over the cheesiness. Thus, I went through my life ignoring the Apes. What a poor, poor choice on my end.Those of you that have seen \"Rise\" and are wondering if it could possibly get better in terms of production value and story, the answer is a gigantic, mega yes. Holy hell. \"Rise\" did a superb job at telling the origin story, Ceasar growing up, and had some very humanistic emotional moments, with a killer ending. But \"Dawn\" does what \"The Dark Knight\" did in terms of sequel construction. It delves straight into the world created in the first film and goes non-stop for two hours providing gritty realism, shocking violence and bittersweet feels throughout. They've upped the ante in terms of animation and it shows very strongly; we have full herds of goats, mammoth grizzly bears, and even horses all animated utilizing a strange and absorbing combo of mo-cap and key-framing. It's a thrill, and of course you'll be applauding Serkis again for portraying an animal so human you'll keep forgetting you aren't watching homo-sapiens. The human characters that ARE here, namely Malcom who is the protagonist that gains the connection of \"trust\" with Ceasar are effective enough, but at times the secondary characters quickly dissolve into the background. It's not a total sham though, because this film truly is all about the apes, and it's a damn good thing. There's not a lot of hope to be had for the human race in \"Dawn\" and I think that's what is most refreshing. I don't want to say much more, but what I will tell you about seeing the film is to \"GOOO.\" You'll get the quote within the first few minutes of sitting in your comfy theatre chair.9/10!",

Without giving away spoilers, the story can easily be seen as a metaphor for certain social and environmental issues.Jason Clarke plays a believable character and I loved Gary Oldman (but on the other hand: can't remember him ever letting down in a role). As I said, somehow the apes do not look real or believable to me, especially when they are not in close up or even riding a horse.

But, they ruined the experience for me by demonstrating how little they think of the viewers. I try to give dramatic license to science fiction films by overlooking the holes in the techno-babble they spew to support their story lines. But, in this case, it seemed that a major part of the premise of the story was that this hydroelectric dam up in the hills was crucial to getting their radio transmitter powered up. Seriously? They needed a hydroelectric dam to be restored to operating condition to make contact with the rest of the surviving human race? They were ready to go to war with the apes for enough power to run their transmitter, and they needed a whole power plant to do it?That is actually the premise put forth in this film - in almost as many words. I very nearly stopped watching when they trotted this nonsense out. But, I wanted to give the film makers an opportunity to redeem themselves. They failed. They further buried themselves by claiming that their nuclear power plants had \"run out\" long before their silly fossil fuels. And, rather than de-emphasize the absurd plot element by just quietly letting it pass (because there was no reason to make it that important), they come back later and remind us - by showing their amateur radio setup that could have been run off of car batteries, rather than a hydroelectric power plant.The characters were generally shallow and/or clich\u00e9. The idea that only ten years had transpired was made an absurdity by the set designs and the post-apocalyptic atmosphere.This film does shame to the original franchise.

First of all I admire the original 1968 Planet of the Apes very much and one of the reasons one of the reasons I went to see this movie was because people have claimed it to be better than the original. Unfortunately with all the praise this movie was getting it was disappointing to find that this movie was not good.I am the only person so far that doesn't like this movie. I don't know anyone who didn't like this movie. I will state my reasons for not liking this movie.The first thing I have to start with is the characters with the exception of the protagonist Caesar. I am guessing you are wondering why I am excluding Caesar from the negative aspects of the film but I will get to that later. Anyway, I think most of the characters in the film are either dull or clich\u00e9d. I will give some examples and you will understand(or not). One example is the antagonists. The character Koba in my opinion was a very clich\u00e9d villain and so was Gary Oldman's. How were they clich\u00e9d? Well, the problem is that the villain just hates and has really no other interesting motivation. Another example is some of the human characters which were just dull and that is all I can really say because there isn't much to them. The second problem I have with this movie is the plot. There isn't much to say about the plot because again like most of this movie there isn't much to it and it also feels very familiar. The other problem with the plot is that it doesn't ever seem to try to grab the viewer's attention. And the final problem with the plot was the horrific climax. The problem with the climax is that first its a complete shift in tone, second it is poorly executed and over the top in the worst way and third it is completely lacking in suspense. I think that now there isn't much left to complain about therefore I will resort to slightly complaining about the visuals. I think that the visuals are definitely something that the movie did right but at the climax they were the complete opposite. Even though I may not like this movie it does have one if not two redeeming qualities. One is of course Andy Serkis's Oscar worthy performance. The other redeeming quality is Andy Serkis's character, Caesar. I felt that Caesar was an interesting protagonist with well realized struggles that Andy Serkis helped portray. Overall Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a dull, clich\u00e9d, poorly written movie, even though it has an interesting protagonist and a phenomenal performance from Andy Serkis and that is why it gets a 2/4. I hope the next movie improves on this.",

            "content": "The rise of the planet of the apes three years ago was an unexpected discovery in the world of modern cinema and Hollywood in particular. It was a fantastic film that combined scientific validity with striking realism of what is happening, and at the same time deep drama and touching connection between the characters. The project writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver decided to go much further with the sequel, not only jumping ten years forward, but also changing the focus of the project from humans to monkeys.Matt Reeves, who took over as director of Planet of the Apes: Revolution instead of Rupert Wyatt, wanted to make a film about Caesar, whose tossing soul is torn between sympathy for the people and duty to his people, which he leads. One of the main reasons for the great success of this monkey was Andy Serkis, who naturally plays it. He not only makes you sympathize with his hero, but also understand him. In every movement, in every look, in every facial expression (I can't dare to call it a muzzle) of Caesar, one feels the soul behind it. Whether he is bossy, vulnerable, angry, anxious, regretful, or belligerent, he never loses his connection to the viewer. Serkis brings humanity to the hero's simian appearance, helping to associate him with us. This makes all the more sense, because Caesar's task is not an easy one - to establish peace between people and monkeys. And with Serkis, it's even more difficult - to melt the hearts of American academics of the cinematic arts and sciences with his game and finally get at least an Oscar nomination (God knows, this time they have no chance to ignore him).Caesar lives for Serkis and it's no surprise that he's got a lot of difficult emotional moments. However, one more monkey deserves special mention. We are talking about Toby Kebbell, who embodied Koba, one of Caesar's associates. Truly a bad, bile-spitting monkey, drooling in his speeches about the people who crippled her, thirsting for revenge and complete domination. She has such a look that you won't believe it, but Koba still manages to fool heads. Significantly, Kebbell is visible behind the visuals. All the madness and anger with which he revives his hero. His glass eyes, covered with a veil, frighten and fascinate. Andy Serkis needed someone he could build from, and the duel they have with Kebbell, whether it's talk or brutal monkey fights, is top notch acting in both. When Caesar or Koba is on the screen, it is already impossible to take your eyes off them, but when they stand opposite each other, the hall is literally filled with the electrified air of their rivalry.At the same time, all the other characters are relegated to secondary roles. Only Jason Clarke has the only significant party, and even then he serves in history as a more auxiliary lever that moves the action at the right moments. Gary Oldman has indecently little time. Although some will look at him without any pleasure because of statements in an interview with Playboy magazine. The heroine of Keri Russell does not change in any direction, even though she has one very bitter emotional moment. For Cody Smith-McPhee, for example, they did not find a worthy application at all. Kirk Acevedo is probably the only person in the movie who brought conflict into the first hour of the action. The role of the evil idiot was a success for him.However, not only secondary human characters were left behind by the writing talents of Jaffa and Silver, but also Mark Bomback, who had a hand in some scenes. Judy Greer, as Caesar's sick wife, does nothing but lie in bed throughout the film. Playing Maurice, Karin Konoval draws attention to her character, but this is more due to the forms of the character that she got. Maurice generally stands out quite strongly from any crowd.And so it turns out that in the presence of the two main monkeys, broken somewhere inside, absolutely all the other characters are brought into the film only to push the unnecessary epic action to the final confrontation. At the same time, the aforementioned writers did an excellent job in terms of building a world in which the monkeys live, and a world into which people were drawn into by a deadly virus. It is easy to believe in the circumstances created on the screen. Especially those who were lucky enough to see the documentary Life after people.Technological advances in the last three years since the release of Rise of the Planet of the Apes have added a lot to more than just the appearance of primates. The general plans of a littered San Francisco, or an overgrown Golden Gate Bridge, or an established ape community, look bleak but warningly real. Together with cinematographer Michael Serezin, Matt Reeves tried to saturate the picture with interesting shots, although sometimes his directorial choice leaves some bewilderment. It also cannot be said that Reeves has such a great directorial experience behind him. His most widely known film will be \"Monstro\", and even that was shot in the first person. He manages character relationship scenes much better than the action, which turned out to be rather poor and often too fast with frequent slow motion, however paradoxical it may sound.What really stood out was the film's sound design. Not so much the effects as the soundtrack. Michael Giacchino has done a masterful job of blending into his music the undertones already in the script, acting and direction of the film. This is really a film not about black and white, but about the colors in between. And individual melodies helped bring it into the final version of the picture.\"Planet of the Apes: Revolution\" - a film, in fact, that behind every leader there is always a fool who will spoil everything. And also about the fact that monkeys and I are insanely similar. And about how cruelty is inherited from those who radiate it to those who experience it in their own skin. The picture turned out to be rich in ideas, and from this it is interesting and perhaps even useful for viewing. However, the creators failed to create a proper event from the Revolution. The combination of poorly realized characters and a lack of that epic that all the trailers screamed about almost spoiled the complex touching drama about us and our little brothers.",

I honestly was not expecting something this good from a sequel to a reboot of a franchise I was never particularly keen on.I gave Rise a miss when it first came out, but decided to watch it the night before seeing this. I was glad I did. While I thought Rise was a very good film, I thought it had a few pacing issues and pretty average acting. However, I thought the CGI was incredible.Dawn takes place roughly ten years after the events of Rise. What's left of humanity is struggling to survive in small colonies in major global cities, whilst the super-smart apes led by Caesar are leading their own colonies - breeding and growing stronger.The first thing that really won me over with this film was how much easier it was to relate to the ape protagonists - especially Caesar. I often found myself struggling to care about the apes in Rise, however seeing them at such an evolved state - communicating, hunting and showing emotion - really gave me something to root for. Andy Serkis once again surpasses himself - both from an acting and special effects perspective.I will touch on the effects briefly. In short - this film has the best CGI I have ever seen in a film. I've seen a lot of films - a lot of blockbusters with a lot of big budget effects - none of which even come close to the visual experience you get here. Usually no matter how good CGI is, you can always tell when it's there. Watching this film, I had to stop and stare at the screen - wondering whether or not the apes were indeed CG or real apes.The plot itself is more or less what you'd expect from a good sequel - it develops the characters we already know well as well as introduces some much stronger characters we either didn't see much of in the first film or are entirely new. There were points where I couldn't help but notice a few similarities between other films - notably the Lion King and Lord of the Rings. The Lion King elements mostly deal with subjects such as betrayal and trust, whereas the grand scope of Lord of the Rings is relevant in the third act of the film. The battle between the apes and humans is nothing short of brutally tense and visually stunning - much like the Helms Deep siege in Lord of the Rings.This film is one of the great Hollywood rarities - a blockbuster with heart and soul. You might even cry. Unbelievable film. The only thing that stops me giving it a 10 is that it did have pacing issues like its predecessor.",

Easily tops the earlier movie with Franco. You can tell A TON of money, work, and time went into this film. This is a movie you HAVE to see in theaters, preferably 3D. Usually a movie that's all about the graphics has a sh*t story line, but this one was actually good! Reminded me a bit of Avatar in regards to quality. If you like post-apocalyptic movies, you'll love this. When I determine what a \"good\" movie actually is (in theaters), I think back to how many times during the film I \"reacted\". Sometimes its laughing out loud, jumping, a jaw drop..etc. In this film, I constantly looked over at my boyfriend with the \"omg\" face to see if he's reacting the same way, or if it's just me. We both felt the need to \"omg\" face each other throughout the movie. Insane shots - brilliant camera placement throughout as well. We both had to go to the bathroom with 30-45 minutes left and couldn't get out of the seats to do so for fear we'll miss another incredible screen shot. So we held it. No regrets. Get to a theater and see it. Finally we have a movie worth the rave.",

Genuinely where did they come from? And how are they all so intelligent?! But still too dumb to escape a bear by climbing a tree?!!

Dawn of the world of the Apes picks up wherever the primary half left. it's been ten years and humans square measure believed to be extinct. Apes square measure within the early stages of civilisation, and because the film can show - nearer to humans than anyone believed.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) They reach a fragile peace, but it proves short-lived, as both sides are brought to the brink of a war.In the middle of this land humans who urgently have to be compelled to faucet AN energy supply bang within the middle of the ape settlement. whereas Caesar (Andy Serkis) needs peace, his deputy Koba (Toby Kebbell) - WHO was tortured in an exceedingly research lab before he at liberty needs revenge.

The film uses motion capture technology that accurately interprets performance into animation. Full marks to director Matt Reeves for capturing the human emotions and expressions of his actors while they grunt and walk like simians. And nobody will it higher than the gifted Andy Serkis. because the patriarch WHO bit by bit involves realise that his beloved race shares constant follies as humans or his anger once his loyalty to his race is questioned - Serkis brings that rare quality to the character.

The ape's CGI just gets even better, more detailed and scarily realistic than the first movie. One of my favorite examples of this is the start of the movie, which is a super close-up and slow pan out of Caesar's (Andy Serkis) face. He is wearing God-of-War style war paint, and you can pick out the ridges and bumps amidst the paint. Music was great, captured the mood of the film very well. Story was also very good, full of conflict and showing how powerful these apes can be. Overall, 9/10, a movie you should DEFINITELY see.Characters: 10/10 CGI: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Story: 9/10",

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a breakdown of the war between prejudice vs. empathy and it approaches its subject with intelligence if not subtlety. The cast of \"apes,\" Serkis, Kebbell, et al, are fantastic. In conjunction with the CGI animators, the actors imbue Caesar, Kobo, and the others with such (for lack of a better word) humanity, that it's impossible to take your eyes off them. It's truly masterful what the sfx people and the mo-cap actors have accomplished. The \"human\" actors offer serviceable performances, but most are limited by a script that fails to give them a whole lot to work with. Kirk Acevedo is really standout inasmuch as how fully he develops a solid performance from the almost nothing but the one-dimensional a-hole he's given to play. The film never forgets, however, that this isn't the human's story. It's definitely Caesar's tale and his arc is well told and made me feel for him and his \"people.\" In the end, this is just a movie about smart apes... but it's a damn good one.",

Find out, watch the movie and I will be damned If at the end you are not rooting for the Apes. Andy Serkis has delivered one of his best acting performance and dare I say it, it is as good as his Gollum persona.The dialog delivery is beautiful and Koba is another well portrayed character. If I may take the liberty to say so myself, there was vibe of The Godfather in the movie. Leadership, unity,betrayal, humanity shown by animals this movie has it all. A must watch for everyone whether you have watched the first movie or not.The plot is amazing and very cleverly sewn into what seems to be just another cliffhanger. Technology of motion capture has been put to the best use and by god the Ape is shown as a humane being. If only real humans were this humane. In a parallel universe where both humans and Apes want the same and are willing to fight for it.

We were all satisfied with how Rise of the Planet of the Apes turned out as Wyatts directing style and Andy Serkis's performance mesmerized us and left us anxious for more and with the satisfaction knowing we would get more. However Wyatt did not continue with the series as he handed passed on the torch to Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) leaving him in the perfect spot to make an amazing sequel and possibly out due Rise. He did just that and came out with one of the summers best films. An awesome sequel that was compared to the Dark Knight and deserved that kind of recognition. He completely outdid the original. The action, effects, and writing was even better and like the previous one it was set up perfectly at the end for another sequel movie.The series previous installment left with the virus that would wipe out most of the human race beginning to spread and with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading the apes out into the woods to be free. Now it is ten years later and most of the human race is dead. However Caesar has made quite a life for himself with his own kind and just had his 2nd child with his wife Cornelia (Judy Greer). Everything is perfect until the threat of humans comes back but all they need is help restoring power to their city. Caesar knows that the correct way to keep the peace between the apes and the humans is to let them do their work so they won't have to bother them again. However Koba (Toby Kebbel) who still hates the humans after what they did to him in the Gensys lab. Caesar must help the humans knowing trouble may start if Koba doesn't listen. War is a definite possibility and both the humans and the apes are a threat to each other. Will everything go according to plan, will Koba be the one who starts a war, or will the humans have to attack the apes?Andy Serkis deserved an Oscar for his previous performance as Caesar, but he is now playing a much different and more mature version of him. Caesar is more human then ape in this one. He talks and moves like a human. He is fully developed and the apes around him are developing too. However he is middle aged now after ten years of being in the woods since he helped the apes break out in the previous installment. His age shows his wisdom as he always knows what the right thing is to do, and is clearly loved by the apes that he leads and looks after. He is the perfect leader in every sense of the word now. He is smart, strong, tough, and wise as can be.The apes are evolving too but Caesar and Koba are the only two who can talk at the start of this movie. But that is probably because they got the most of the juice that made the apes so smart in the previous one. However more apes started talking as the film went along and they can all do sign. The medicine is clearly being passed down genetically as the new generation is getting smarter too. Another detail that must be noticed that will be a big factor in the next movie. The apes are evolving and getting smarter but lessons have been learned by Caesar and he should be even more grown up come the next one. I question if Caesar's kids will fight for supremacy at some point in the series as he has a younger son who has just learned to talk and a new born son. Cornelia should also make a bigger impact as she was a much bigger part of the original series. The ending of Rise was set up perfectly for a sequel and so is this one.This will go down as another sequel to be better then the first and there aren't many. The flow of this series and the story line has been perfect so far as you can tell it will keep getting better and better. There is no reason why the next one shouldn't be as good as this one. It is exciting to see what will come next as the first two have been great. I also wonder if this prequel series will end at some point or will they end up completely redoing the whole series and make it part of this. But as for now Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar and the series is perfect. Definitely see this.",

It distracts you with subtitles, and the apes aren't the best at emoting.The human angle is middling and doesn't do much that's new, following a familiar post-apocalyptic survival scenario. You don't really get to know the characters too well, either, and there's no closure to the main trio's storyline.As for Ceasar himself, he gives the impression of someone who's hit his thumb with a hammer, looking quite dour and miffed throughout, even when he's happy.I'll give it a 6/10 because it's reasonably entertaining, if a little too heavy for its own good.",

No hesitation. 2.Another scene where Koba's attacked by a tank & the shooter stands out there waiting to get killed. He won't stand down the stupid rifle. The tank doesn't use the cannon at all. Get it at the wall & draw the apes back.3.Jason Clarke's character was a problem for me the most. Just lacks intelligence. Know full well that one of your guys hates the ape race & wants to start trouble, you don't bring him on your missions more than once. Then he can't convince Oldman to delay the tower bombing because he lies to him. He couldn't explain that the apes are different & mutiny caused the attack. At the end, he lets Caesar remain too easily in San Francisco to fight a rescue mission the apes would lose badly. I gave it an 8 anyway because the action was overall worth it. Again apes with guns are awesome. Great visual scenes. May favs, Koba with hes rifle up & Caesar taking over. Fights with Caesar & Koba outstanding.the rest of the story was solid. No criticism on the apes intelligence. They're apes. Genetically more intelligent but humans still more intelligent.",

You think it's going one way, but then flips a 180 and goes the other way \u2013 keeping you guessing each time around. A monumental piece of cinema that not only lives up to it's predecessor, but exceeds it in every way possible. Many have been saying that this movie is what The Empire Strikes Back is to Star Wars, well I will back that up and say this is exactly that and then some. It's hard to believe, I know, but I have no doubt you will walk out of the theater absolutely floored with what you were able to just watch. Because when you thought sequel blockbusters couldn't evolve anymore than they have, in rides Apes on Horses becoming the best of the franchise to date.Rating: 9.5/10+ Andy Serkis & Toby Kebbell | + Caesar as the lead character | + More Apes story than Humans | + Visual effects crushed Avatar | + Matt Reeves ability to balance drama & action | + Malcolm (Jason Clarke) & Caesar on screen together | + Apes on Horses | - Needed more Keri Russell | - Carver was to one dimensional",

In a world where nearly every film has elements of CGI, this like when Jurassic Park first came out and uses its CGI to such an extent it just moves the story along and it makes you believe in this world, and you care for these Apes. The story I believe is strong, the cast give great performances throughout. I can't wait for the next installment. Great Job",

It shows how hatred can bring war and war can bring destruction. The father and son story of Ceasar and his son was heart touching. Its probably the best ape movie ever. I already loved the first two parts of the movie. I would recommend it as a sensible family entertainment. For me it is the superhero Ceasar I wanted to watch. It doesn't show what happens to Ceasar and his Ape family. The scene which gave me goosebumps is when Koba said \"Ape don't kill apes\" just to survive and Ceasar killed him saying \"Ape don't kill apes, but you are not ape\".",

Kobba was the main antagonist in the film, and he's been my favorite character since Rise of Apes (2011), this sequel made him stand out more, by showing you his good side first, then his bad side, and the directors did an awesome job at doing that. The movie is really entertaining, and it's really worth the ticket price, even if it is on 3D/IMAX 3D. Best movie of the year! MAJOR SPOILERS!

But the movie could win some academy awards. Also for the special effects that are depicted in this film, the budget of $170 million is pretty good for what is put on the screen and is maybe one of the best movies of the year and the directing for this movie was great. But like I said, it can be a bit slow but it is definitely worth it because it just's adds up in the end to make a memorable ending. It also showed how the apes don't need a lot of things, compared to us humans and that if there was a thing to happen (like a virus) we would be in trouble because of what is (not really) needed for us to live Overall I would recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys going to the movies now and again. Plus this is one of those movies that to me is better than the original and shows that war doesn't create anything but disaster.",

            "content": "Where to begin? This film is absolutely gorgeous in it's clear picture and incredible animation on the Apes but yes the animation is absolutely incredible. I could go on saying how insane it is how life like the apes are. The motion capture is graced by the MO Cap master himself Mr. Andy Serkis if who doesn't receive an Oscar? I would be so sad. (even though he already should've). Who gives a masterful performance again as the Ape leader Caesar alongside many other great performances from not even real apes but they're incredible. We meet the apes in their forest home and all comes crashing down when they meet the first human character who panics in fear and shoots one of the apes. This is where the incredible messages and themes of the movie come from of trying to live in peace and not letting fear blind. Or hate as Koba who we know had a rough life from the first film was taught hate as said in the movie and Caesar was raised with kindness mostly thus they're conflicting ideals as Koba whom embraces hate wants revenge and violence and Caesar want's peace and safety. This is the parallel in human characters as well. As the human we learn want's the same as Caesar and Gary Oldman's character shares the same violent approach as Koba. The clashes between what looks to be that post apocalyptic civilization for the humans. The Apes almost in a caveman type beginning to society but much more advanced starting there own civilization. It shows how similar the humans and apes are in ideals and wants. I don't want to spoil what I think to be an incredible film. So I will not elaborate further but I feel if you watch you'll see the implications when both Ideals are used and the consequences of each. I congratulate: Matt Reeves in his masterful direction of this film, the writers for a great script, all actors who gave incredible performances, and every crew member who made this film what it is.",

As a surviving human community exhausts their last fuel supply they seek an alternative source of power in the form of a dam, the two sides meet and are forced into war by the actions of a few loose cannons. It does not choose to answer any questions the audience may have about the missing 10 years, such as 'what happened to the astronauts?' because the answer is obvious, likewise, it does not choose to engage in complex subplots and does not diverge from it's core narrative which allows for better characterisation.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is unique among blockbusters in that it has inner beauty. The apes are brought to life with awe-inspiring CGI, coupled with exceptional motion-capture and voice acting, the English language is clearly very difficult to reproduce with an ape's vocal chords, you can hear the stress and harshness of every word, signing is preferred by the apes which produces long absences in dialogue that contribute to the film's gritty and earthly tone. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does not compromise for action and visual effects; the film is superbly written and emotionally impacting. The movie acts more like a bridge for a sequel to document the evolution of a new \"Planet of the Apes\", but it successfully pulls you into their world and easily merits its own existence.",

            "content": "In 2011, fans and critics alike were surprised to see a prequel to one of the most famous films of all times become so successful. Thanks for it's great cast, interesting story and clever use of CGI it certainly made an impact on modern sci fi. So can it's sequel match it's success?The story picks up 10 years after the start of the infection, in which humans have been forced to live in a post-apocolypticesque lifestyle, while the mutated apes have taken over the nearby forest. With Ceaser (Andy Serkis) still as leader for the apes, we open to see them become hunters in the wild, while Ceaser himself has just had his second child. However leader of the human clan Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) wishes to destroy the forestland in order to reinstate the electricity that is running desperately low. However it's scientist Malcom (Jason Clarke) that tires to intervene, hoping for a more peaceful solution. So alongside his son Alexander (Kodi Smit- McPhee), girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russel), hot-headed Carver (Kirk Acevedo) and Carver (Jon Eyez), Malcom must try to negotiate with the apes before it's too late for them all. What worked well in the last movie was the astonishing interaction between the apes and the humans, thanks to the amazing CGI capture technology and thanks to the brilliant work by Andy Serkis. As this film is a lot bigger, with a lot more outdoor scenes, there may have been hesitation about how the director would work around these larger animated scenes without coming across tacky and cheap. But thankfully the actions scenes were pieced together brilliantly, with the animated parts felling just as tense and exciting as any live action movie would hope to be. Moreover the more dramatic moments of character building between Ceaser and later with his second in command Koba (Toby Kebbell), were very intimate, and it honestly did feel as if you had a real connection to these apes. It was wonderful to see and Andy Serkis certainly deserves some sort of recognition for the role he played. The movie works wonderfully well in aiding the audiences journey to becoming a sympathiser for another species.By comparison the only other really stand out in the non-ape cast was Gary Oldman, who was brilliantly suited for the ageing war veteran still intent on trying to save the world one bullet at a time. Even if at times his actions may have seemed erratic, this was mainly due to a rushed sense of the plot rather than Oldmans fault. The rest of the cast too did well to keep up with the ever changing pace of the film, with the only other good performance coming from relative newbie Kodi Smit-McPhee, so it'll be interesting to see where he'll end up. It's not that the rest of the cast isn't up for the job, they are, and they all portray conflicted human characters very realistic. It's just they were missing just that extra push that the mentioned had.The director Matt Reeves and cinematographer have collaborated to create some stunning shots. The single plan camera shot that takes place during the action scenes are amazing, and a real treat for blockbuster fans. The action scenes are brutal but still appropriate enough to appeal to it's mass audience.The score too does a brilliant job of complimented even the most tenderest scenes, which surprisingly are more often portrayed by the apes than the humans.It's intelligent and emotional, with some jaw-dropping effects. Exploring themes such as parenthood, this movie may be trying to reach beyond it's means, but wow we can certainly enjoy the ride of this movie which takes the audience way beyond predecessor.",

And apart from a rushed ending and the underdeveloped human characters Dawn of the Planet of the Apes didn't disappoint and is just as good. It looks amazing for starters, the cinematography and lighting are of great beauty and atmosphere and the scenery is equally striking. But the visual highlight, and most likely the best thing about the film, are the special effects for the apes, that they look so real and that it's hard to believe they were done by computer is testament to how good they look. The soundtrack is haunting and rousing with no dirge-like tempos and it doesn't feel overbearing either, even with sound with as much authenticity as here. The script also impresses, it's very intelligently done and has a lot of tension and heart. What impressed even more was how simple and nuanced some of it was, like when the apes speak they only need to say a few words and it still feels like it's saying a lot, a couple of times even a sideways glance brings more impact than you'd think. The story takes a bigger and somewhat bolder approach than Rise of the Planet of the Apes and this is an instance of it working very well, especially with the visceral action sequences which are very tense and look terrific and in the incredibly intense and emotional final act. It's compelling stuff where you feel compassion for and identify with every step of the way with Caesar and his family. Matt Reeves' direction doesn't make the mistake of being overblown or lethargic, there is at least a sense that he knows what he's doing. The acting is solid, Jason Clarke and Keri Russell are charming leads and Gary Oldman while criminally underused still gives a spirited performances. But other than the special effects the other highlight is the characterisation of the apes, which is just superb especially for Caesar(who is by far and way the most relatable and most compelling character in the entire film), Andy Serkis never fails to amaze me. All in all a really well done blockbuster, although the human characters do not register anywhere near as well as the special effects and the apes characterisations. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" is an excellent movie, but by taking up this franchise, Matt Reeves took it to another level. Caesar ended the last movie as an anti-hero, but now he's a leader who thinks rationally. Ten years have been passed and the apes built their community. Compared to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Caesar is Leonardo. He's still a character in constant evolution, and his relationship with the humans is what drives the plot. Also, another ape that has a deeper development is Koba (he was used as a guinea pig in plenty of labs and hates humans), and if Caesar is Leonardo, he is Raphael. The apes are even more protagonists than in the first film, but again, the human cast is not generic, has personality and helps to move the plot. We have two main human characters: Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), the leader of the human resistance, and Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the leader of the human team that has to work on the apes' area. I won't say anything else because I would enter in spoilers territory. The action sequences are even better than the ones from the first film. They're better filmed, tenser and even more touching (helped by the superb Michael Giacchino's soundtrack); the epilogue prepares the public for an epic final battle, it makes the audience look forward to the next film and promises that it'll be big. Imagine if it wasn't, it would be a big disappointment.",

            "content": "They had us in the first half, not going to lie. Though I was really happy with the direction this film immediately went for in creating a soft sort of post-apocalyptic world for humans and apes to get along in, I wasn't exactly sold on the approach that this film took. It was just under an hour of nobody trusting nobody, blunders being made and guns being waved and while it was certainly wrought with tension, it was the stressful, unpleasant sort of tension because both sides and all the stand out characters on both sides (except Carver, He was just an idiot) have such believable and pitiable motivations and social predicaments that the idea of conflict between them (something I knew was eventually going to come) seemed completely undesirable. With the plot moving so slowly at the beginning, it was slightly agonizing to experience. However, there was enough interesting character dynamics (Caesar and Malcom, Caesar's son's apprehensions, Koba's stirring hatred, Maurice with everyone but especially Malcom's son) and visually resplendent world building to keep the film going until Koba does the fateful deed. After that, the film blooms fully into it's singularly unique, compelling, tragic, chaotic and almost operatic identity. I think it was the only right decision the writers could have made to have the apes strike first. After the first film we have sort of been conditioned to see the humans as the enemies of the apes and what with the enormous arsenal and testy nerves of the human colony, it seemed that the oppression of the apes would soon come again. It was exactly the development the Caesar and the apes needed, a conflict, betrayal, a villain in their midst to drive home that the apes are not intrinsically better than the humans. The moment that Caesar realizes this, lying wounded in front of his son, brought low by the betrayal of his own kind and humbling himself by returning to the home he had moved on from is a powerful moment and what I think the entire film was leading up to. Caesar and Malcom both realizing the worth of the other's kind and acknowledging each other as friends. On a big picture scale, the apes trilogy is using it's second installment to level the playing field between apes and humans to set up the climax of the third act, but it does so in an explosive and poignant way. I think the flavor that this film has that most science fiction action films do not is a feeling of tragedy. Not tragedy in the sense of failure, but in the conflict and mistrust between and within the apes and humans that inevitably will lead to great strife. This film has action, drama and heart but each of these is given a vein of tragedy. Thankfully, it is the kind that is epic even in it's laments and drives some hard hitting questions home as the apes become smarter and stronger. Heck, not only do they talk a lot more, by the end they were speaking in metaphor while beating the snot out of each other. It may sound odd, but that kind of thing is what I think the apes movies are made for. Another significant advancement\u2026 have I mentioned that this movie is very good as a sequel? Paying homage, carrying themes over from the first installment while giving the narrative further believable direction and a wider focus? Well now I've mentioned it, and the greatest thing about it is the increased inclusion of the best character in the series: Maurice. Maurice already has the advantage of being an orangutan which is makes him cuddly and imposing at the same time, but he also gets the singular honor of being the good friend to the main characters and since not as much attention is given him, he is not tarnished by a lesson needing to be learned or a flaw to correct. He's just pure awesome. When he turns his piercing eyes toward Malcom's family and utters his one word in the film \"run\" I got chills. He's just a peaceful, understanding presence and he's the only one who gets along with both sides (something I wished could've happened for everyone) and when he had to, he grabbed that ape and showed him who's boss. I love that kind of character. I was genuinely concerned when he got shot but was relieved to see that he just shook it off like the bad-A he is. Such good stuff.",

Caesar clashes with fellow ape Koba over the way in which to approach the human race leading to a split amongst the colony, and resulting in civil dispute. Weta digital's visual work is nothing short of remarkable, and the communication between the apes is staggeringly realistic. Serkis is the star, as he his throughout the franchise (utter shame on Oscar for not recognising his work) and the way the physical performances of Serkis and co combine with the special effects to give you a world in which you truly believe everything is real, deserves the highest of praise.",

There was some deterioration for me that big critics didn't see, namely that the dialogue between the apes seemed intended to be rudimentary but was in reality just very poorly written. They didn't seem to gesticulate enough to convey the emotion the lines were meant to have and so the subtitles just didn't match up for me. I think they improved the CGI on the apes but did so at the cost of doing rather poorly on the herd of deer and the bear in the opening scenes. I loved the heel turn of Caesar's lieutenant, the overall plot and the film score, which was top notch. This entire series seems set to grow in critical acclaim as the years go by.",

This sci-fi movie also tackles some interesting themes, and it's got a lot of pretty heart-warming moments.

            "content": "Pros: The set up that Rise made for Dawn pays off so well in this movie. I think that this is the most underrated movie sequel of all time. This movie is better than the first because the stories are very different.  The first one is the creation of the ape's civilization and the second one is about Caesar allowing humans into his civilization but it starts a war.  In this movie, Caesar has a new family and he has a wife called Cornellia, A son that is grown-up called Blue eyes and another son that was born at the start of the movie being Cornelious. This movie also has the most interesting villain in the trilogy being Koba. I also like how they made an ape the villain instead of humans. Koba is such a compelling villain to the point where Caesar's son Blue eyes was questioning him. He believed letting these humans into their society was wrong because he was tortured by humans to the point where he even lost an eye. He eventually shot Caesar thinking he was dead but the family of humans he let into his civilization saved him. The action in this movie such as Koba invading human territory to try to kill off the last of them was entertaining and the action was great. He even puts Apes like Maurice and Luca in a cage because they were too loyal to Caesar. I like how when Koba was invading Blue eyes wasn't fighting because he realized that Koba was wrong.  It was pretty sad when Rocket's son Ash died because he was struggling to kill humans and he was still loyal to Caesar. That moment where Caesar returned was epic when Blue eyes came to help save Caesar. The emotion when Caesar was watching a video of him and Will when he was young was quite emotional especially when he was in the same house. When the final fight between Caesar and Koba happened it was a pretty good fight and that moment where Caesar defeated Koba and walked in to reclaim leadership was awesome. I think that the conflict between humans was pretty great because the family that visited Caesar wants apes to live while Dreyfus wanted apes extinct because the apes are spreading a plague that has made humans almost go extinct. The humans in this film are more interesting at least the important ones are and I do like Dreyfus and Malcolm and to me, Malcolm's family and Dreyfus are the only important humans.\nI have nothing negative to say about this movie and this movie got even better when War Planet of the Apes came out.\n\nCons: I only have two problems with this movie. I think that other than Dreyfus and Malcolm, the rest of the humans aren't interesting. The other problem is that there is a plot convenience when Caesar gets shot and he happens to heal really quickly to fight Koba.\n\nThose two flaws are very minor snd kind of nitpicks. I'm gonna give Dawn Planet of the Apes an (A)",

The scene showing Dreyfus crying with the photos of his family contrasting with Ceasar desperately hoping for his wife to recover from disease and the apes and humans pitted against each other, with Koba leading the charge, another amazingly detailed character, someone who unfortunately was lead astray by only focusing on the bad side of the humans growing heavy lack of trust for everyone around him, once Caesar's best friend, now mortal enemies.

This one expanded on it without giving us a full on war yet. The suspense is well handled by Matt Reeves throughout. There are plenty of scenes where things have potential to escalate and the atmosphere is tremendous. Serkis is once again fantastic. We feel even more for Caesar this go around as he now has a family and gets turned on by a friend. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s heart breaking. The movie builds and build to some special moments that are worth it at the end. Judy Greer (Cornelia) was also one of the stronger acted apes. Jason Clarke (Malcolm) and Keri Russell (Ellie) both gave very good performances as the compassionate and understanding humans. The world feels realistic and I love the various takes on fatherhood, similar to the first one.\n\nWeaknesses: Gary Oldman (Dreyfus) felt super underutilized. He\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s a great actor who could\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)ve been a strong addition to this franchise. Especially when we got shots of the character\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s kids being gone. But he doesn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t really do anything. Kirk Acevedo (Carver) was also way too generic. He played the typical jerk who ruins everything by being a dick and it never clicked. It felt like he was trying too hard. \n\nOverall: An improvement on the first film. They take what made that work and expand on it, while giving us a lot of suspense, plot twists, and emotions.",

This movie suffers the same problem as the previous movie. The male lead is not good enough to carry the movie. No offense to James Franco or Jason Clarke. Both of them are miscast. Oldman's character mopes around for two hours and doesn't really do much. What a waste of a great talent. None of the human characters are memorable. They're background noise. \n\nThe only interesting interaction is with the boy and Maurice, but it never goes any further than that. They missed an opportunity to have Maurice see the boy as a son. Maurice could have then told Caesar that he didn't think the humans were all bad. At the end, they could have had the boy die and it's affect on Maurice. \n\nMaurice is never developed beyond being Caesars friend. In fact, the spotlight is only given to a few apes. Even Caesar's wife is nothing more than Caesar's wife. It seems a lot of character development was cast aside for an action movie. If we got to know who these other apes were, we would actually care what happens to them. But like the humans, most of the apes are just background noise. \n\nKoba is shown mostly as a usurper, but he makes a good point. The humans are clearly testing their weapons and we see they have tanks and rocket launchers. Once they get power, they may want to attack the apes. They should have had Koba tell Caesar and have it play out exactly the same. But the way they did it looks like Koba wanted the throne. \n\nNot as good as \"Rise\". Makes a point to say that there are defects in all societies, but the message is overshadowed by all the action.",

It also probably  helps that the apes look very realistic. The human actors though are kind of generic who become for the most part unmemorable, but not necessarily bad.

The CGI effects help rather than hinder the performances of the \"apes.\" Andy Serkis (Caesar), Nick Thurston (Blue Eyes) and Toby Kebell (Koba) -- together with their animators -- pull off brilliant performances. The cast of human characters almost rival their ape counterparts, which includes the great Gary Oldman, but the sometimes phony performances of Jason Clarke and Kerri Russell hampers this somewhat.\n\nNonetheless, \"Dawn\" is an impressive follow-up to \"Rise\" and begins to establish a setting for the original \"Apes\" movie, starring Charlton Heston. The plot is full of unexpected twists and turns and consistently suspenseful. \n\nSPOILER ALERT: One complaint I initially had was the manner of Koba's death and how Caesar seems to give in to an elitist attitude that deems to judge an ape (as anthropomorphized human) no longer worthy of being called an \"ape\" (as anthropomorphized human.) Essentially, Caesar here falls into the same trap as his human counterparts, as well as Koba, that condenses that sentient life worth saving to a particular type of sentient life. For Koba, this is exclusively apes that serve his every whim. For many of the humans, this is exclusively themselves. Disappointingly, for Caesar, only that life that meets his standard of morality (which is indeed a  comparatively generous one) is worth saving. However, I am informed that Koba's breathing is heard toward the of the credits and that Caesar's character has not been morally resolved after his attempted execution of Koba. I have yet to see the sequel: a resolution to this moral conundrum may yet emerge.",

            "content": "When watching \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\", I couldn't help but compare its opening moments to that of \"Dances with Wolves\". When the film starts out, the audience is subjected to watching a series of nearly dialogue-free moments from the apes. Instead of the expected din of gunshots and explosions, we watch the primates display their use of sign language while spending time in the culture the culture of the apes while learning about the environment/community that the apes have set up and how it compares to the society of the humans. The comparison to \"Dances with Wolves\" is a bit inevitable for me, but I compare the two films in the best possible way. Just like with \"Dances with Wolves\", the audience is able to learn about the characters and the environment that they are placed in right off of the bat. So little action really happens in the first few scenes, and yet so many ideas and emotions are conveyed that I would much rather prefer this steady build up as opposed to action right off the bat; it's a more realistic, earnest approach to a movie such as this, and it's one that I don't feel as though we see enough of.\n     After the mesmerizing opening, this movie kicks itself into high gear-in a large part due to the impressive acting. Just like with \"The Dark Knight\", the characters are so well written with so much thought put into them that I tend to forget that I'm watching intelligent apes blow everything up. This is a rarity that works as both a sci-fi thriller and as a a resonant drama. These characters are so believable-and dare I say relate able that I would enjoy these characters whether they were apes or not; they work that well. Let's face it: you can tell you've made a good movie if even the antagonist's motives are understandable.\n     Another part of this movie that had me pleasantly surprised was its collection of realistic CGI. I know that this isn't a popular opinion, but I found the CGI to be incredible-especially by 2014 standards. As time goes on, the film industry finds itself growing more and more in the department of eye catching visuals, and \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" marks a large step forward for the special effects category. Not are most of the details beautifully realized, but the CGI itself is able to play itself into the story without becoming too much of a nuisance. The filmmakers seem to know this as well. Several times, the camera will pan across a battlefield depicting a skirmish or battle, and there were hardly any moments in these battles that I would depict as \"fake.\"\n     That's not to say that the CGI is the only thing carrying this film. (It isn't.) Andy Serkis returns as Caesar, and gives it his all as usual. Meanwhile, Jason Clark shines as Malcolm as both actors represent sides fighting for the title of dominant species. It's with performances like these in which I can't help but admire the amount of effort put into the acting; especially considering the fact that 75% of the actors were either reacting to nothing or playing the role of a primate. Even the words spoken by the actors sound something like how one would expect apes to talk if they could. But here's the thing: not all of the characters have equal emphasis placed on each of them. Gary Oldman is also in this movie, but what could have been a great character played by a great actor can't help but get lost in the midst of all of the other characters. And he's not the only one; with acting as great as this and characters as well thought out as this, it's a bit of a shame that they're kind of forgotten about towards the end. This doesn't ruin the film entirely, but it does come off as a bit of a disappointment. \n     On a lighter note however, this movie also displays an innovative build of tension. Some may not have enjoyed the \"slow first half,\" but the characters combined with the looming feeling of doom slowly-almost unbearably-build up to an entertaining and intense second half that is all I could've hoped for. Not only does this build up lead to an epic second half, but the second half itself also offers an (SPOILER) amazing shot of a tank shooting at the enemy in a 360 degree angle with the audience in the tank's perspective witnessing the effect of the weapon. (END OF SPOILER) \n     All in all, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is not only an epic sci-fi adventure, but also manages to be an effective drama in the process. I highly recommend that you watch this movie whenever you have time. (Preferably with your friends.)",

            "content": "You would think that the decline in quality of the original 5 \"Apes\" movies, each one lower-budget and worse quality than the one that preceded it, would give filmmakers pause, but since 2001 we have endured 3 awful s/prequel/remakes. \u00a0 And yet these films do well at the box office, and are generally well-reviewed.\n\nIf this were the \"Transformers\" series I would care that much, but the original \"Planet of the Apes\" is indeed brilliant.\u00a0Based on\u00a0Rod Serling's\u00a0adaptation of\u00a0\u00a0Pierre Boulle's novel\u00a0La Plan\u00e8te des singes\u00a0, it was released in 1968, and features zero CGI. \u00a0Instead it featured real\u00a0actors doing \"acting\" while wearing make-up and simian-looking prosthetics. \u00a0These devices were considered advanced at the time, but now appear rather primitive:\n\nStill how scary-looking is that? \u00a0Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, and Maurice Evans used their costumes to enhance their performances, to\u00a0give them an \"otherness\" that they employed, but also had to overcome in order to create full characters. This is the opposite of what Jack Nicholson said about his role as The Joker in 1989's \"Batman\", essentially to\u00a0\"let the costume do the work\".\n\nThe tension between artifice and reality is something\u00a0CGI erases. \u00a0While this makes for more realism, it also seems to infect movies with\u00a0a slackness when it comes to\u00a0developing stories and characters. \u00a0Critics praise CGI and forget that a realistic wink or tear does not a character make. This was the case\u00a0for the second\u00a0remake of King Kong, of which A.O. Scott said:\nThe sheer audacious novelty of the first \"King Kong\" is not something that can be replicated, but in throwing every available imaginative and technological resource into the effort, Mr. Jackson comes pretty close.\nNovelty and technology can't sustain a movie for 3 hours, characters and narrative can. \u00a0Inexplicably Roger Ebert\u00a0called Kong II\u00a0\"A stupendous cliffhanger, a glorious adventure, a shameless celebration of every single resource of the blockbuster, told in a film of visual beauty and surprising emotional impact.\" \u00a0 Roger Ebert is a wonderful human being, but I find his writing unmemorable. \u00a0A.O. Scott seems to specialize in plot summaries. \u00a0Plot summary + apologia that this is a \"spirited\" movie that isn't perfect = A.O. Scott review.\u00a0\n\nDespite my griping, I too wanted to see chimpanzees on horseback firing machine guns (I'm only human). \u00a0I found that it was just not as thrilling as what the original \"Apes\" movie did for me: imagine a world where humans are no longer the pre-eminent species, where it's payback time for the creatures we have abused for millenia. \u00a0 Jerry Goldsmith's eerie modernist score helped create this sense of unease - so different from the crash, boom, bang of near-constant violence in \"Dawn\", which has a strange calming effect on me because it seems to be in almost every movie now, and signifies that the good guy is going to win. \u00a0The other parts of the score could have been used in\u00a0a life insurance commercial.\n\nSpeaking of good guys, did Director Matt Reeves have to make ape-leader Caesar into an absolute saint? \u00a0Consider the strategy in the original \"Apes\" franchise. \u00a0Caesar is a killer, but you understand his rage as he sees his enslaved ape-brothers stun-gunned, and watches his kindly guardian, played by Ricardo Montalban, die in order to protect him. \u00a0 \u00a0I go to movies to see people who are worse than me, not better.\n\u00a0\nRecall the harrowing last scene in \"Planet of the Apes\" with Taylor and Nova\u00a0about to enter\u00a0into the Forbidden Zone after seeing the ruined Statue of Liberty:\n\nFinal verdict on\u00a0\"The Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\":\"You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!\"\n\u00a0\nPostscript: \u00a0 \"Planet of the Apes\" features one of my favorite opening scenes in movies, Charlton Heston, the spaceship captain is smoking a cigar on the bridge, recording into his log before he goes into suspended animation:\n\"Tell me, though, does man, that marvel of the universe, that glorious paradox who sent me to the stars, still make war against his brother...keep his neighbor's children starving?\"\n\nPost-postscript: Really getting tired of seeing Gary Oldman, one of my favorite actors, trotting out his American accent in these trumped-up, square-spectacled Commissioner-Gordon-type roles.",

The visual effects are outstanding and are used as a tool to tell a story instead of a story being created surrounding the visual effects. The acting, namely Andy Serkis is great.

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Well Scott, here comes another performance capture movie starring Andy Serkis. It truly looks like he s playing another Sirkis animal!\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Sirkis is chimply marvelous in this role. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: It s been ten years since Caesar (Andy Serkis), the genetically modified chimp from Rise of the Planet of the Apes escaped into the forests of San Francisco. A lot has happened. There was an outbreak of simian flu that decimated humanity leaving only a handful of humans who were genetically immune to the disease. Meanwhile, Caesar has freed hundreds of apes from human captivity and taught them to communicate by sign language. They ve created an entire culture separate from the humans. Then, one day, a human named Carver (Kirk Acevedo) in search of a hydroelectric dam happens upon a couple of apes and he shoots one of them.\n\nSCOTT: Caesar warns the humans never to venture into ape territory again. But the humans need to get the dam operational to regain electrical power. They send Malcolm (Jason Clarke), his wife Ellie (Keri Russell), and a few others, including Carver, to negotiate access to the dam. Caesar agrees, but only if the group gives up their guns. Carver hides a gun and threatens Caesar s infant son with it, causing an uproar that is only quelled by Ellie s willingness to provide medical treatment to Caesar s wife. Meanwhile, an ape named Koba (Toby Kebbell), who will not accept any peace with the humans, sabotages relations between the two groups by secretly setting fire to the ape settlement and attempting to assassinate Caesar.\n\nGREG: Scott, this was a much better film than 2011 s Rise of the Planet of the Apes. There were some real personalities here and some real conflict. We see two sets of characters at play - the humans and the apes. On the side of the humans we have Malcolm who wants peace with the apes. On the other side is Caesar who looks at the dam agreement as their one chance for peace with the humans. But both sides have their hawks as well. The humans have Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who is so mistrustful of the apes that he starts hoarding weapons. This, of course, inflames the ape Koba (Toby Kebbell) who has reason to distrust humans as he was the victim of experiments at the hands of human scientists. This creates a great conflict both between human and ape as well as between hawks and doves. Sadly, Keri Russell isn t given much to do here except  stand by her man.  And the female chimp (Caesar s wife) does little more than give birth and get sick. Apparently, the future is still male-dominated.\n\nSCOTT: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a complex film. Admittedly, it does have some of the telltale signs of a summer blockbuster - flying bullets, daredevil stunts, and plenty of explosions. But these superficial trappings of summer popcorn bely the true meaty core of this very measured and thoughtful movie. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes made me think, and it s been a long time since I ve had to really turn my brain on at the movies. First and foremost, this is a movie about the very real and very demanding challenges of resolving intergroup conflict. We learn that sometimes good leadership isn t enough. There must also be good followership in that a critical mass of people being led need to be on board with the vision of an effective leader. As you point out, Greg, we have peace-loving leadership on both sides but only a few bad apples can undermine all the good intentions.  \n\nGREG: The hero structure looks like (what we describe in our book Reel Heroes: Volume 1) a divergent duo. They start out as separate characters, opposed to working together. But with time, they form a bond. They work together toward a common goal. During this period they are buddy heroes. But in the end, they go their separate ways. Destiny has played its hand and humans and apes cannot be friends - war is their ultimate demise.\n\nSCOTT: Good call on the heroes in this movie being divergent heroes, Greg. I m beginning to believe that divergent hero stories are my favorite kind of stories because they provide two separate hero tales for the price of one. Often, the two separate hero journeys become intertwined in surprising ways. Last year s Philomena comes to mind, for example. In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar and Malcolm are wise and well-intentioned, yet they are brought down by forces beyond their control that rage all around them. The joy of the movie is watching how our two heroes act on their virtuous characteristics, and how they respond to the treachery of their sidekicks. One of my beefs with this movie centers on the character of Carver. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes begins with Carver needlessly shooting one of the apes. He s a racist hothead who should never have been chosen to go on the expedition in the first place, and yet, inexplicably, he s chosen again to accompany Malcolm on the trip to repair the dam. Surely there are more even-keeled and reasonable alternatives to Carver. Yes, we need Carver s misbehavior to help add dramatic tension, but it stretched the bounds of believability for me.  \n\nGREG: I have to agree with you on that. I was really impressed with the quality of the CGI in this film. There s a point where Caesar and Malcolm touch foreheads and you cannot see any dividing line between them. Caesar s hair becomes matted down by Malcolm s head. It s simple amazing. And the full articulation of the facial features is wonderful. This is an order of magnitude better than the original Gollum character that Sirkis created for Lord of the Rings. The villains in this story are driven by their fear - the heroes are driven by their vision. It s a compelling difference to watch. As you point out, Carver is the bigot who cannot see past the limitations of stereotypes he s been taught. Koba, the hawkish ape, has been harmed so badly by humans that he cannot see past his pain. And Dreyfus is intent on saving what s left of humanity. He doesn t have the space to work toward a peaceable trust. This was an interesting collection of villains, with just enough depth to make them interesting.\n\nSCOTT: What I appreciate most about the heroes and villains in this movie is the fact that they exist on both sides of the dispute. There are ape heroes and ape villains. And there are human heroes and human villains. This film could have taken the easy route and made one side all good and the other side all bad, but it decided that nuance and realism were more important than the usual oversimplification we see at the movies. I also appreciate the complex motives that drive the villainous behavior. Besides the usual racist ethnocentrism, there is fear that drives both sides to aggress against the other. There is also the bitter memory of past oppression, which fuels Koba s hatred of humanity. And finally there is pure ignorance. The humans underestimate ape intelligence, and the apes underestimate human goodness. Again, this film really nails the genesis of intergroup conflict.\n\nGREG: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an intelligent and intelligently crafted science fiction thriller that examines the heart of war. At 130 minutes long, it tested my attention in places. However, it is the best of the Apes franchise and I give it a hearty 4 out of 5 Reels. The heroes in this story are interesting and deeply drawn. The emotive power of Sirkis  Caesar was simply amazing and helped to tell the full story. The duo/divergent heroes is a pattern we ve seen before, but played especially well here. I give Malcolm and Caesar 4 out of 5 Heroes. Finally, the villains were not as strong as the heroes. Carver plays the typical purely bad guy. Koba is at least given a decent backstory to motivate his hatred. Dreyfus as the leader of the humans will do whatever he can to ensure the survival of his people, but is too blind to see the larger picture. I wish the villains were as detailed as the heroes, so I give them only 3 out of 5 Villains. Movie:  Villains:  Heroes: \n\nSCOTT: Greg, we re on the same page on two of the three ratings. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a refreshing reprieve from the usual summer mindless popcorn fare that infects movie theaters. This film is a thought-provoking look at human conflict, how it begins, how hard it is to avoid, and how difficult it is to stop once it has started. Yes, this movie reeks of patriarchy, and once again the limited role of women in a Hollywood film is disappointing. Still, I enjoyed this movie very much and give it 4 out of 5 Reels. Our two divergent heroes are a joy to watch, not just because they time and again show wisdom and compassion, but because their journeys are arduous and realistic. Are they transformed by their journeys? Yes, and in profound ways. Caesar has certainly learned the true value of family and friends, and he pays a dear price for holding naive views of ape goodness and human trustworthiness. Like you, I ll give our pair of heroes 4 out of 5 Heroes. We disagree about the villains, Greg. Most movies devote little time to fleshing out the details of villains  motives and backstory. With Koba, we see the origins of evil; the past torturing of Koba may not justify his actions but it makes them understandable. The human leader, Dreyfus, also has a history and set of motivations that leave us understanding his aggressive behavior but not condoning it. The villains here are complex and fascinating. I m happy to give them a full 5 out of 5 Villains.  Movie:  Villains:  Heroes:",

Andy Serkis is back as Caesar, the leader of the apes, and he's better than ever. He is, hands down, the most talented motion-capture actor; in Apes, he and the production team are beginning to blur the line between motion-capture and reality. The film is now three years old and it contains what is still some of the best CGI I've ever seen. What makes this series so engrossing is watching the development of Caesar and his society go from what appear to be simple zoo animals to being almost exactly like the humans they are forced to coincide with; intelligent yet destructive.

It makes the first one almost look fun. The simple beginning becomes so much in the next two installments, and despite being seriously tone-shifting, this movie was great.\n       Like I said in my review of the first one, these films are not cheesy. They're drama movies, especially the 2nd and 3rd installments, and while some like it create nothing but pure cinematic cheese, this movie is believable and realistic. That's largely thanks to Andy Serkis' motion capture suit performance that captures the right stature of an ape, and the impressive CGI. Despite taking a different narrative focus than the first film, Caeser's character shines.\n       Like I mentioned earlier, this sequel is different in a lot of ways: it's longer, more dramatic, and has a different narrative focus. All these things are great. It feels like a true drama film, with interesting characters and ones we care about and feel for. Despite not having the understanding for the apes the first one did, the apes were still great in the movie. Another thing the last one and this one did well is that they could have been painfully long and they weren't. By the end, we aren't bored, we're interested and want to see more. And the narrative focus is different. While the first film felt like it was about the apes, this felt like it was about the apes and the humans co-existing and getting past obstacles uniting them. While at the beggining I wasn't feeling this movie and wasn't liking it as much as the original, by the end I was satisfied.\n       Overall, this sequel is extremely different from the first, but is equally great. It has great CGI and the usual good motion capture performance from Andy Serkis, as well as dramatic and great storytelling. It has a lot to enjoy and is definitely worth seeing.",

While I admit it has a few minor setbacks, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an improvement over its already good predecessor. The special effects are amazing, in fact even better than in Rise. Never has a CGI ape looked so good. it mostly feels like actual apes were cast. Andy Serkis's motion-capture performance is amazing, even better than in the first film. The human actors are pretty good too. Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and Kodi-Smit McPhee seem committed in what they're doing whilst Gary Oldman pulls off another stellar performance. After all, you know what the polar opposite of that one nitpicky YouTuber says: \"Gary Oldman is always a win\". Toby Kebbell is a great villain, as he wants apes to be dominant because he accuses Caesar of loving humans and not giving a damn about the apes themselves. Drama comes first and action second. It allows more time for character development as Caesar wants to be a great leader whilst, like Clarke's character, he also wants to be a good father. I usually prefer a little more action but the build-up is pretty exciting and its ending foreshadows events to come. I hear War is very good, I hope so. Michael Giacchino's score is great as well. Emotional resonance is strong within this movie especially during a cameo via a camera from James Franco. It reminds people of the better moments during their past. Nostalgia, man, nostalgia. Utilizing cutting-edge technology with a great screenplay, DotPotA improves upon its predecessor without succumbing to the curse of the law of diminishing returns.",

This movie has a great plot, special effects, and good characters. These three things really hold the movie together. The plot is great and really builds up to connect this movie with War for the planet of the apes. The special effects are amazing. The apes look and feel real. This is really where the characters play in. The characters tie in with the special effects. The apes are great characters. Not only do the special effects make them look real, but the ape's character makes it feel real. Talking apes wielding guns may seem silly but this movie can make it feel a little bit serious and feel more realistic. Overall this is a great apes movie, with a great plot, special effects, and great characters, this movie represents what a movie should be. A+",

As a result it's equally engaging, and the fact it plays off the first film means we're invested in the story as it cuts to the chase more quickly. From there things waste no time, and the film powers through with just the right amount of breathing room for key emotional moments and incredible action sequences that amaze as much as they hit you. In fact it really is a very impressive spectacle this time around, and looking up at the screen in admiration of Matt Reeves' work doesn't remotely mean you're out of the picture as the characters are all well-developed and the action furthers the story rather than detracts from it.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Where some of the delicacy is lost, the script winds up somewhat flawed - particularly when it comes to discussing the ever-present themes.\nVERDICT: 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is an impressive and engaging beast of a film that continues the franchise extremely well despite its occasional flaw.",

The film once again, as with the first film, shows neither side as the true enemy. You feel for the struggled of both sides with humans struggling to survive while being stricken with fear facing ape foes that are far superior to them, while the apes on the other side are shown with families and the desire to simply be left alone to their own society. Of course, peace cannot last for long in this universe. This is a story about betrayal, it is a story about Caesar becoming what he needs to be to lead the apes to victory and peace, it is a story about understand and the certain humans who know the truth and their struggle to convince the others. It's an emotional film with moments that, if invested enough into the apes, can bring on some tears. While the ending can bring on some chills.",

They reach a fragile peace, but it proves short-lived, as both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species.\n\nWith \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" being a surprise in its own right, who would've thought that its sequel would not only be bigger, but improve significantly, while also creating one giant universe where apes can talk. Let's be real, the plot is ridiculous in hindsight, but this movie is as serious as can be. \n\nOne thing this franchise does extremely well and even more noticeably in this film is its use of CGI. Even if you don't like these films, one things that is unarguable is the CGI. Their motion capture and technology used in this film is breathtaking. In fact, it's a huge milestone in the movie industry. It looks amazing, realistic, and not for a second did I believe that these apes weren't real. \n\nThe story goes on a much larger, more grand scale, but it doesn't lose sight of what it wants to be, and it gives you more without going over the top. The story is amazing, interesting, and well written. It feels like there's no one clear solution, and it's basically survival for your species. The movie gives you this feeling of isolation and wilderness. The world is cut off, losing technology, and becoming into a post apocalyptic world. They really show the beginning of that here, while also allowing you to feel empathy for both sides. \n\nThe acting and voice acting performances are also phenomenal. Jason Clarke plays the lead human protagonist, and he is a very strong lead. He's the perfect bridge between the human and ape characters, bringing plenty of humanity to the table. It's easy to root for his character, while simultaneously wanting to support either sides. Whichever side you're on, his character wants to help and do what's right. However, the real star of the franchise is Andy Serkis, who has acted as one of the most memorable characters in recent film history.  Caesar is one of the most terrifying, relatable, and human like creatures we've had in recent history. His voice acting and motion capture is perfect down to the dot, and he makes this character his own.\n\nIn the end, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is one of the best films of 2014, and has made for a more than successful franchise. I cannot wait for the third installment.",

            "content": "'DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' was directed by Matt Reeves and stars Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke and Toby Kebbell. Over a decade after the simian flu wiped out most of the worlds humans, Caesar(Andy Serkis) and his band of apes have grown immensely and become much more intelligent. Meanwhile, Malcom(Jason Clarke) and a band of human survivors ask Caesar for help to help humans survive. This creates a rift between both the apes, the humans and the relationships between both.\n\n? Very few sequels improve upon the stepping stones left behind by their predecessor. Only rare occasions like with 'The Dark Knight', 'Terminator 2' and 'Fast Five' do we get sequels that are infinitely better than their already brilliant originals. 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is one of these uncommon occasions. Sure it has its flaws(some of which do carry over from 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes') but it also fixes many and doubles the amount of drama and action that was there before. Pretty much everything is either improved or stays the same when compared to its predecessor. Nothing retraces its steps quality wise and that is very pleasing in today's movie climate.\n\nFor example, the story in the original was very well written and I congratulated the writers for that. Building of the success of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', they could have just slapped a story together to string the events along but they don't and I genuinely admire that. They still put effort into the story and give it meaning and impact. The themes of betrayal and being a father carry over to here which was nice but I would have liked to see something new and different. The ending here, which I won't spoil, is also really good and perfectly sets up 'War For the Planet of the Apes'. Overall, they could have just made a weak story and ending just to hurry up the action but they don't and they genuinely try to deliver a pleasing narrative.\n\nNext, there is the acting. I've said it once, I'll say it again, Andy Serkis deserved some love from the Oscars for his mesmerising portrayal as Caesar and I honestly feel its disrespectful they haven't given him one yet. Toby Kebbell was also great as Koba and he has a clear arc from point A - B. All the non-human characters in the film were excellently acted and wrote and were the standouts of the film. That said, most of the human characters were very weak and their acting wasn't too special either. Jason Clarke, for starters, was very weak as Malcolm and showed no joy, sadness or anger at any point in the film. I feel like Gary Oldman at least tried as Dreyfus but that was no match for how poorly written the humans were. I will say that's the main flaw of most of the humans. Most of them were competently acted and whatnot but none of them had any interesting motives or personalities and were all forgettable. None of them were particularly likable and they were all replaceable, both as characters and actors. That said, both the villains were alright and, although one of them had a pretty weak arc for me, both of them were pretty threatening.\n\nTechnically, this movie is flawless. The cinematography is gorgeous, the visual effects and mind blowing and even the costume/set design was brilliant. Matt Reeves is proving he's a world class director on a technical level and I am always amazed with the visually stunning work he pushes out.\n\nNow for the action... It's absolutely awesome! I thought it would be pretty hard to top the action in its predecessor but I was very wrong. I won't go into detail, because you really should see it for yourself, but I must describe ONE tiny segment of action that will have to make you see it. An ape... riding a horse... carrying an assault rifle... while jumping through flames. If that doesn't get you interested in this movie then I don't know what will. Aside from the action, this movie is also pretty damn spectacular on an emotional and dramatic level. This movie pulled at my heartstrings multiple times and must be commended for that. Colour me impressed. One thing I will say was pretty flawed about the movie was some of the dialogue which was unbelievably clich\u00e9 and could be predicted from a mile away. I must of said what a character was gonna say before they said it like 20 or 30 times in the movie because it was pretty damn clich\u00e9.\n\nIn Conclusion, this movie is dramatic, emotion, action packed, a visual treat and is well worth your time and money.\n\n8/10",

I really enjoyed the tension built up as the opposing ape and human societies are bought to the brink of war by acts of aggression on both sides. Indeed, it is unusual and refreshing to have opposing sides in a confrontation depicted as having populations who aren't just either all good or all bad. Real life if more nuanced than that and I like it when movies depict this. This bodes well for the future of this series and I am genuinely looking forward to the next instalment which I hope continues in this manner.

            "content": "In 2011, the Planet of the Apes series was rebooted with great success, resulting in one of the best films in the series. Three years on and a sequel \"Dawn\" has managed to continue this trend effortlessly, resulting in another brilliant summer blockbuster.\n\nDOTPOTA picks up a few years after Rise with the human race all but wiped out as a result of the deadly simian flu. In the years since the virus began to spread, Caesar's clan of apes has gone from strength to strength, having built a home in Muir Woods near San Francisco whilst the humans struggle in the city ruins. In the midst of the growing discontent, newcomer Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and his family (Keri Russel and Kodi Smit-McPhee) lead a team into the forests in a desperate bid to calm the tensions. Where the first film focused on build-up, Dawn goes to great lengths to employ tension, greatly raising the stakes in the process. It only takes one misstep from the humans or one error from the apes to ignite the fires of war and this is constantly emphasised through several close calls across the film's narrative. Yet despite the increased emphasis on action and a struggle for power, the film never forgets the emotion that made the first film so memorable; the highlight of these comes in a particularly heartfelt scene which ties Dawn with its predecessor beautifully. Mix in new themes such as the importance of family and mankind's reliance on technology and you have a plot just as engaging as the original film.\n\nThe new characters may possess quite a bit of screen-time but really it is Caesar (Andy Serkis) who is the star of the show; as the leader of the apes, he struggles to keep the peace amongst the humans and his own kind as well as being constantly at odds with the violent Koba (Toby Kebbel). On top of this Caesar is also bound to his family, which leads to even more emotion being conveyed. In fact the apes as a whole are given plentiful amounts of development this time around; it's a real treat to see how they interact and communicate through sign language throughout the film. The human characters are also well done; main man Malcolm may not have too much of a back story but Clarke nonetheless does a good job of picking up from James Franco; Malcolm also has a family at stake and it's this trait which provides another strong bond between him and Caesar. Gary Oldman is also great as Dreyfus; a kind of pseudo-antagonist and the de-facto leader of the humans. He wants to eliminate the apes from the picture but at the same time he only wants to save his own kind and rebuild the world, providing an interesting moral dilemma to his character. The only real drawback to the casting is similar to the last film; some of the human characters could have been much more memorable if they had more screen-time to develop and contribute to the overall plot.\n\nDawn maintains the reboot's brilliant use of motion capture with even more apes on screen at once and significantly more expression being shown. You can feel the emotions of the apes when trouble comes their way. A greater atmosphere is built over the proceedings with the often harsh weather and the overgrown ruins of San Francisco, perfectly complimenting the disaster that has swept over the planet. This goes hand-in-hand with the editing which is once again stellar, providing a clear view of both the emotion on the faces and the action in the setting. The music used in the film is often slow and sombre, giving off a sense of sadness that permeates the endless struggles of the characters, but it also finds time to emphasise the beauty of the more intimate moments, proving that although tension exists between man and ape, cooperation and harmony can rise again. If you were impressed with first film's technical presentation, Dawn won't disappoint one bit.\n\nEvery bit as good as its predecessor, DOTPOTA is one of the best films of the summer, pushing the story forward whilst going into much more depth on the ape characters. You'd be doing yourself a great disservice by missing it.",

It's a good story, told well, and it easily avoids becoming a joke (which is always a possibility when your premise involves apes taking over the world). However, it never strays outside of the safe (and somewhat boring, in my view) confines of the action film genre. \n\nIt's a great cinema-movie with its explosions and cool CGI, but it lacked the punch that classics like, say the original Planet of the Apes, have. There's definitely some social commentary going on here but it's hard to hear over all the shouting sometimes. \n\nUnfortunately, there's just something a bit too generic about this film where, um, most of the cast are people pretending to be apes. Who'd a thunk it?",

While Andy Serkis shines as Caesar, and Jason Clarke is very good as Malcolm, the movie doesn't give you just that. Gary Oldman is great as Dreyfus, and the actor who plays Koba is nothing short of spectacular. This movie is much more than a simple sci-fi tale; the movie delves into topics that many other films are afraid to talk about such as, \"what does it mean to be human?\", as well as carrying political and racial undertones. Overall, this movie is far more than meets the eye, with a great cast, exiting action, interesting themes, and the best movie villain in recent memory, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is my favorite film of 2014, and is a movie that I will love and think about for years to come.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of the most unusual big-budget Hollywood action movies I've ever seen. For one, it opens with a virtually silent 20-minute sequence-one that catches us up with characters from the film's predecessor, Rise of the Planet of the Apes. There's also next to no action until the 90-minute mark. Up to that point, it's all character-building drama with a bend toward suspense.\n\nIt's also rather small in scope. As superhero movies continue to dominate the box office charts, you rarely find a summer movie that isn't about men trying to save the world. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes posits that humanity just might be relegated to a small quarantined area in San Francisco. Its leaders are simply trying to keep the community safe-not unlike their ape counterparts hidden deep in the woods outside the city. The small scale doesn't mean Dawn isn't without tension, however. On the contrary, director Matt Reeves does a rather incredible job connecting the dots between peaceful coexistence and inevitable conflict between these communities, and he does so by relying on themes that resonate and characters that live and breathe.\n\nCaesar (Andy Serkis, incredible) is still in charge of his tribe of apes nearly a decade after he secured their freedom in Rise. In the intervening years, he married, had a son, and taught some of his fellow apes-including the very combat-minded Koba (Toby Kebbell)-to speak. As the film opens, Caesar's second son is born, and when he's asked by another ape if he thinks there are any humans left out there, he asserts that they aren't so bad. But the weariness on his face is undeniable: for the sake of his family and friends, he sure as hell hopes there aren't any humans out there.\n\nAnd right on cue, one shows up and shoots (doesn't kill) a young ape. His name is Carver (Kirk Acevedo), and he isn't alone. On a trek to find and repair a dam that could restore power to their community, he's accompanied by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), his wife Ellie (Keri Russell), and his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee), among a few others. Caesar is benevolent and tells them to leave and never come back, but Koba thinks he's being short-sighted. Yes, letting them go prevents a war between the tribes right now, but when the humans get what they want, they'll be a lot stronger and more dangerous.\n\nUltimately, the film is about xenophobia and how irrational fear or hatred of \"the other\" can lead to dire consequences. The San Francisco of this world is full of good men, good apes, bad men, bad apes, and a lot of fearful followers on both sides who are easily corrupted. Watching the shaky trust that develops as the good ones in each camp feel the other side out is both inspiring and a little disheartening. You want them to work things out, but a variety of factors-the worry and weariness they wear on their sleeves, the persuasive power of the rotten apples in their respective groups, and the film's status as a prequel-all speak toward a less-than-happy ending.\n\nThe film is also damn well-made. Reeves isn't a director who's showcased a consistent visual style yet, but if he ends up settling more on the side Dawn of the Planet of the Apes than Cloverfield or Let Me In, he'll have a long, very fruitful career. Of course, the special effects are spectacular. They were in Rise, and they're arguably more impressive three years later. But the gorgeous tracking shots, the smartly staged action, the mise en scene-it's all quite brilliant.\n\nThe human characters aren't what the film will be remembered for, but they almost certainly mark the biggest area of improvement when you compare this film to Rise. Jason Clarke and Keri Russell are solid (the latter could have a little more to do). Gary Oldman gives a classic great-actor-in-a-blockbuster-movie performance. The strength instead lies in the way the characters are written. Their motivations are always evolving, and their actions usually make some sense-a rare thing in a movie like this.\n\nThe series doesn't seem particularly concerned about catching up to the original Apes film anytime soon, and for good reason. What seemed like a throwaway cash grab for Fox back in 2011 has blossomed into one of the most thoughtful effects-driven franchises of all time. This film will be hard to top, but I can't wait to find out what these filmmakers have in store for us next.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/",

Taking off after the events of its predecessor, the world is now plunged into turmoil, with a deadly virus wiping out much of humanity and giving the ape population some pretty impressive advances in evolution. When a small community of human survivors have to work together with the ape army, to ensure human survival, soon both sides start to double cross each other, in a fight for leadership and survival. Dawn finally feels like were back in that magical science fiction territory, with a stunning looking post apocalyptic world, full of foliage, rust and some impressive forestry. Here we now have a solid cast of actors, Gary Oldman, Kodi Smitt Mcphee, Jason Clarke and Keri Russel are joined by Andy Serkis, Toby Kebell and Judy Greer, which makes the proceedings all the more magnetic. Rise done a great job building the digital characters, but seriously stumbled in terms of acting stature for the most part, and the cast do lend a huge amount of talent to some pretty run of the mill characters, at least in the human category. Which turns out working just fine as we will spend most of our time with our digital and furry counterparts, who have not only had a face lift but now have the entire focus. Reeves manages to make a sprawling and fun blockbuster, with some brilliant artistic design and inventive cinematography. The movie also has its fair share of flaws, the script is yet again weak around the dialogue areas, some actors are criminally under utilized and the final act does become a bit of a CGI feeding frenzy, however Dawn must be applauded for its ability to entertain, grip and be technically jaw dropping. It's hardly ground braking and it does lack the depth of other fantasy franchises, however Dawn will solidly entertain you for all of its run time, getting you excited for whats to come.",

Sadly, after Planet of the Apes, story line suffered greatly taking back seat to mere action and obligation to contract. What sets Dawn apart from the rest of the films in the series is the depth of story line carried via the relationship between Caesar and Malcom. The importance of this relationship as driving point of the entire film is made evident in the closing embrace between the two as heads touch in deepest sincerity as friendship is consummated.  As the original alludes to but Dawn brings home in droves, it's not man or ape that is bad or good but individual choice and the development of character that weighs heaviest in creating that which is honorable and trustworthy. As Malcolm's family connects with Caesar's, one can see the good in good. It is not that apekind is good or mankind evil but rather that each sentient being has a choice to be good or evil to use conscious will to determine the path one will take. Where is it that one wishes to focus? On trust and hope or fear and paranoia. Dawn is a great treaties on how humans or all sentient beings must make this most important choice. But it also touches on the point that even good must beware of the power of evil, for it is evil that usually derives from frailty and fear, and we must not feed into it that we must control it with compassion and honor, Dawn tells us all is not lost, but preservation of all that is good takes great control and discipline and service to the greater good not the self and certainly not the weakness of fear and paranoia. And this is what Caesar refers to after Koba has called him weak, for Caesar chides \"Koba weaker.\" Kudos to Reeves and the writers putting a bit of a twist on the tried and true to make something borrowed, new. Good stuff all around.",

            "content": "Andy Serkis gets top billing in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and not without good reason. It's possible that without his performance the movie might have been just another forgettable, big-budget Hollywood special effects prequel, but he makes the movie come alive in a way that from now on, he should no longer be dismissed as just \"that CG guy.\" After playing Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, and the big ape in King Kong he has cemented himself as the king of The Uncanny Valley.\n\nSerkis' performance brings unexpected levels of emotion and conflict out of a character created out of computer generated imagery. Caesar is an ape of very few words, but his face speaks volumes. It's an effect so beautifully done that after a while you stop trying to see the visual effect and start feeling for the character.\n\nThe performance builds on what Serkis created three years ago in 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes. When we met Caesar then, he was a lab monkey burning with distrust for the Homo sapiens who had caged him up in a science lab and fed him a drug to give him human intelligence. Now, 10 years later, he has grown more mature and more brooding and more thoughtful.\n\nThe story picks up 10 years after the previous film, the virus called \"Simian Flu\" has decimated most of the world's human population. Man has withered down to the bare bones, while the ape society has flourished in the Muir Woods outside of San Francisco. We see Caesar as the leader of the now tribal apes who have developed a primitive society not too far removed from those at the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nThere is a dividing line, however. While the apes have evolved, there is a tense but festering hatred between the ape world and the human world. Both are on tenterhooks with each other. Man lives in the ruins of the cities while ape makes his home in the woods. The drama kicks off when the humans (who live in what is left of San Francisco) discover that their supplies are depleting and the only way to keep from running out is to start up the nearby hydroelectric dam - which unfortunately is deep inside ape territory.\n\nMisunderstanding begets misunderstanding. Man goofs up, and the ape's mistrust grows until - horror of horrors - they discover that man has a stockpile of guns. That only scratches the surface. There's a lot of plot in this movie, a lot of story threads to work out but the story isn't the most interesting element. The best thing about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the level of tension that director Matt Reeves is able to maintain. The earlier scenes are the best as we can clearly feel the lines drawn between the two sides and also the conflict in Caesar's soul as he questions his moral values. He finds himself at odds with his second-in-command, a nasty ape named Koba who is prepped for a violent conflict. The apes all seem like individuals, and despite the fact that most of them look alike, you can tell them apart.\n\nThose are the good points. This is a problematic film in many ways. It's too long; the message is repeated over and over; the dialogue is perfunctory, and the narrative moves uneasily back and forth between ominous dread and emotional leanings. It's an uneasy mixture that leads to an ending that is bittersweet when it should be knocking our socks off. The great tradition of The Planet of the Apes movies going all the way back to the 1968 original is that they always end with a punch in a gut. This one closes on a note that tries to be emotional and the result is painfully awkward. Director Reeves wants to have it both ways with the emotional and the suspenseful but he has trouble juggling both at the same time. The movie is a jumbled mix of elements that work meshed with elements that do not. It's a good movie that leaves you wishing for something a little more surefooted.",

And that's where the problems for me for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes begins.  New director, new cast, and the darker focus all just makes it seem so unrelated.  I have been a huge proponent in the past of the gritty film genre, but here the setting is so bleak, you wonder why it even was billed as a summer blockbuster.  I can't quite figure out still if Malcolm is the best or worst part of the movie.  He and his family are really the viewer, they don't do much (since it is Caesar's movie) but the emotional relationship with Caesar is what shines.  I feel it has a lot of ups and downs.  Like clearly if Oldman's plan to blow up a tower to eliminate all apes were to work, why did like 90% of them survive, and he clearly knew that if the military were to come after.  I'll watch part 3, but I hope next time it isn't dreck to watch and the film remembers there is still some fun even if it wants to be moody.",

Because we've seen the original film series we know that the apes will prevail and eventually the humans will be reduced to servitude but this is an intelligent reinterpretation of the original theme and the story telling and action are impressive. I'm not sure exactly how the performances from the apes was achieved, obviously partly CGI and real acting but the result is that the \"apes\" turn in more impressive performances than the humans.

As is the case in the aforementioned 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes,' the film takes place in San Francisco, and things kick off when a band of human survivors stumble upon a thriving colony of apes, led by none other than Caesar (Andy Serkis). The crux of the matter is, the human who've taken refuge in San Francisco want to reconfigure an old hydroelectric dam in order to restore power to the ruined city. As one might expect, this is easier said than done.\n\nThere are a great deal of things to like about 'Dawn.' For one, the animation of the apes is top-notch, as they almost appear as lifelike as the humans they star alongside. Additionally, the language invented for the apes is intricate and intelligently designed, and the constant subtitles are not off-putting in the least. On the human side of things, Jason Clarke delivers the standout performance of the film as Malcom, the fearless leader of the refugees who must keep his comrades under control when emotions run high. Gary Oldman does not disappoint, either, but Keri Russell resurfaces in a role that is not all that memorable.\n\nWhile 'Dawn' is not an amazing cinematic experience, it does offer up enough high-energy scenes and keeps audiences entertained with a series of close calls and misinformation that swirls thanks to opportunists on both sides. Aside from the CGI and acting, the soundtrack that supports 'Dawn' is very fitting, and gives the film an extra boost. At 130 minutes, the runtime is not a major issue, but there are a few scenes that seem to drag on a bit.\n\n'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is one of the more understated sci-fi summer blockbusters of the past few years, but it's definitely worth a watch for the CGI and action alone.",

            "content": "Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes\nPublished July 31, 2014 | By The Blue Took\n- By Bryan Stumpf\n\n \n\n\"His glassy essence, like an angry ape, Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven, As makes the angels weep.\"\n\nMeasure for Measure, Shakespeare\n\n \n\n\"I'm very ape and very nice.\"\n\nVery Ape, Nirvana\n\n \n\nWas I out of my damn dirty mind? Reviewing a talking apes movie for The Slaughtered Bird, the great movie web-site dedicated to all things horror?\nYet ten minutes in, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes proves itself a murky dark chapter in the Planet of the Apes saga, with moments more horrifying than anything I've seen in 2014 horror so far. Fully loaded with rain-soaked matted fur and apes with semi-automatics, it's clear director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) and writers Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver were gunning for a second installment \u00e0 la Empire Strikes Back for the Apes prequel trilogy.\n\nDawn opens ten years after the simian-flu from Rise of the Planet of the Apes has decimated most of the planet's human population. Rise's super-intelligent apes have established a peaceful, sustainable civilization, deep in the Muir redwoods, north of San dotpotatFrancisco, governed by alpha ape Caesar (Andy Serkis). Then, the inevitable altercation with humans, as a scouting team ventures into the woods, seeking access to a broken down dam.\n\nThe humans, led by Malcolm - played by unlikely yet likeable leading man Jason Clarke (Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty) - explain to the apes, if they can rebuild the dam, the few hundred survivors in the city can be supplied with life-sustaining power. The shaky negotiation of human and ape territorial rights leads to alliances and betrayals within both animal groups. While Malcolm empathizes with the apes, many of the humans, including the bullhorn-toting ex-cop Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), blame the primates for the millions dead due to flu-infection. And while Caesar cautiously decides to work with the humans, his chief lieutenant Koba (Toby Kebbell) gestures to the jagged scars over his face from torturous lab testing and cites \"human work.\"\n\nDawn's writers allow the characters to evolve in satisfyingly complicated ways. Your sympathies will be tested. Both humans and apes commit horrific crimes, each group seeking to etch out the new moralities in a post-pandemic nation. Further muddying the waters are huge stashes of heavy artillery, the machinery of the old world, providing a 2nd amendment-steeped allegory to the nation-building.\n\nHint: you'll be reminded of the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey, when apes discover dominance through weaponry, while picking through discarded bones.\nJ.J. Abrams disciple Reeves secures dominance as a director with deeply resonant scenes of apes standing atop rusting San Francisco cable cars and angry ape Koba perched, looming above a tattered Old Glory. With cinematographer Michael Seresin, Reeves choreographs impressive, sweeping action sequences - you won't forget the lengthy single shot with the camera firmly mounted to a renegade tank's turret. Reeves keeps the intensity pitched high, allowing for moments more shocking and disturbing than anything you'd find in typical summer movie fare. Yet with the hairy tapestry unfolding with such character-driven resonance, Dawn hews close to a nearly Shakespearean action movie.\n\ndotpota1With Serkis' second turn as Caesar, he cements his rep as the Lawrence Olivier of mo-cap acting. Caesar's every move and facial expression exudes richly detailed subtext, clearly demarcating a breadth of inner turmoil, from justified ferocity to quiet dignity to anguished near-surrender. It's time Serkis was nominated for an Oscar. Considering Kebbell's Koba stands toe-to-toe with Serkis' Caesar, matching and sometimes exceeding Serkis in mo-cap vibrancy, he too deserves award consideration.\n\nThe ape performances so overshadow the human performances, you pity Clarke and Oldman for their boringly human roles. And yet some blame belongs to the writers. Many of the human characters are more sketched than fully written. Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee, playing Malcolm's love interest and son, respectively, aren't given much to do other than look worriedly at Malcolm. And while the digital technology of the ape army will surely wow audiences, the technical mastery unfortunately makes the few CGI hiccups more noticeable - the effects supervisors could have spent a little more time on Caesar's baby and the CGI horses.\nYet the aping Serkis and Kebbell will dominate your two hours with Dawn. And it will come as no surprise that Reeves' team has been tapped for the next Planet of the Apes sequel.\n\nMost audiences will surely bow before Caesar, impressed by Serkis' haunting performance in Reeves' darkly intense narrative. To all movie-goers, I say brace thyself and hail Caesar!\n\nRead more reviews from Bryan Stumpf on theslaughteredbird.com\n\nFollow @bryan_stumpf on Twitter @StumpfFarm @AnnulmentFilm @CommuteScript @MercilessScript @WreckageScript & Facebook.com/MovieMalcontent /StumpfFarmProductions /SFP.GhostWalks /AnnulmentFilmwww.stumpfffarm.com",

I was so keen for this movie that I had to hold myself in or I would transform into an ape. So does the movie live up to my expectations? \nThis movie starts with a little predictable opening scene, broken news reports on how the world has entered a post-apocalyptic situation, an aftermath of the first movie. However when the movie really starts, you are thrown right into the action. From then on the story deviates from what you expect and tells you the story you didn't know you wanted, predictable it is not. The film seamlessly blends exciting action scenes (what is more exciting than an ape riding a horse with two machine guns, name one thing, I dare you) with the underlying moral themes similar to those found in the original and this movie's predecessor. Like a good sequel it expands the story, adds many new characters while developing the characters we already loved. It also increases the action and deepens the complexity of the narrative. The CGI and special effects are all of the highest quality, filming on real sets really has shone through and added to the spectacle of the film. Every ape looks fantastic. \nThere were many great actors cast as the main humans in the movie, I mean Gary Oldman alone makes anything impressive, but I am also a fan Jason Clarke. Not to mention that bald guy who looks like your typical dickhead in movies, Kodi Smit-Mcphee and Keri Russell. However, the real stars that steal the show are the apes. Toby Kebbell as Koba was absolutely fantastic, but the real outstanding performance, no surprise is Andy Serkis; Lord of motion capture. I honestly believe he could be anything he wants to be, because he surely exceeded as Caesar, just as excellent as Gollum if not better.\nSo did this movie live up to my expectations? It took my expectations and pounded them with its big ape fists. It was nothing I could have expected, an excellent sequel that transcends the previous film. The best part about it is that it's a planet of the Apes movie, apes are just awesome. Some small problems: I would've liked to see more of the world, I would've love to sit through a longer film, but that's just me, I would gladly watch hours of the planet of the apes and I have. I have no real problems with this movie and it is an instant favourite of mine. Very close to Phamtastic but alas no cigar.",

It makes me think that maybe many sequels problems is attempted to capture the magic of the first instead of being original. Everything in this feels totally believable which is a great complement to the special effects. I think my biggest problem with these movies is i love the original so much that even as good as this is cant as cleverly touch on so many interesting philosophical themes.",

The trailers looked intense and intriguing, and the reviews were great. I have decided that it was one of my most anticipated movies of this summer. And I think that my expectations were met.\n\nThe movie takes place many years after the events of the first movie. In it, humans and apes live separately, and are attempting to live in peace. However, friction between the two species is increasing, and war is drawing nearer. However, the humans are not as hostile as the trailers suggest that they are, and both sides could be sympathized with.\n\nThis film had amazing special effects, and an interesting story. The acting was very good. Andy Serkis, in a motion capture suit, delivers a great performance as Caesar the ape. Gary Oldman is very convincing as a leader trying to sustain the human race. Overall, this is a film that I would recommend to fans of the Planet of the Apes franchise.",

There is something magical bout this film that I've been looking for a very very long time. The dramatic musical pieces timed the film very well in terms of it's dramatic and epic proportions as the story progresses. I'm telling you this will eat your hearts out as it is a very heartfelt and heartwarming film I've seen in years.

As the film opens, we see how the genetically engineered virus created by Gen-sys has spread killing a majority of the human population. Caesar & the apes have evolved since Rise of the Planet of the Apes. They form communities, hunt together, and recognize one leader to guide them. When the humans led by Malcolm played by Jason Clarke go on an expedition to repair a hydro power plant because they are running out of Diesel fuel, Carver gets in a confrontation with two of the Apes & shoots one in a panic. When he returns chased by the apes, Caesar and the Apes tell Malcolm & his party to leave. \"Go\". When Malcolm returns he tells Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) about the talking Apes, and how they have to think about what they just discovered. Caesar shows up with all his Apes as a show of force to the Human survivors encampment and tells them there will be no war as long as they stay out of the Apes territory. Malcolm tells Dreyfus he must try and repair the Power Plant and wants to take a peaceful expedition to ask Caesars permission to repair the Power Plant. Unrest as Koda does not trust or like the humans causes conflict between the Apes and Humans. As the humans repair the power plant with the help of the Apes as Ellie helps heal Caesar's wife, Koda attacks the humans. When he returns he devises a plan to get rid of Caesar, and in the process starts the War against Ape and Man. A really great film that gives real depth to Caesar and the Apes, with amazing human expression & dramatic performances that helped the film get a nomination for Best Visual Effects. See it for the story, the effects are secondary & just help you believe that the Apes are real.",

This guy should be getting awards for his acting but he probably won't get the big awards because people still don't appreciate acting when CGI is involved. But it doesn't matter, because Caesar was amazing in this movie just like he was in the last movie. Toby Kebbell also does a great job in this movie. He plays Koba, a bonobo who hates humans a lot more than Caesar does. Their dynamic is what made the movie for me. This movie has everything from amazing action to political intrigue. One thing that the last movie did better was the portrayal of the human characters. In the last one, the humans were much more full fleshed and developed unlike in this one where they're simply present as a means to advance the movie. But, this was meant to be an ape movie and all the actors who play apes are marvelous in their respective roles.",

            "content": "Review for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes?\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story expands from 10 years after the incidents of Simian Flu. It's basically about the survival and getting back what humans lost and the up-rising of Apes. Apes are now more intelligent, tactical. I really loved the flaw of the story. Started with a adrenalin pumping sequence, then turned in to an emotional flaw then the intense and total epicness. The story had some minor issues and let the questions like what happened to the previous characters and some questionable incidents remaining. Yes, I saw how Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes ended where that Air craft pilot saw himself infected with the Simian Flu, but it would be great if they screen some more footage how the Simian Flu expanded around the globe. Based on ten year gap between the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 3 short movies which 20th Century Fox and Vice Media's Motherboard released. Some of the questionable things are touched by those short movies, but not enough for the general audience. Not gonna say more about the story due to spoilers. But I would strongly recommend to watch the 3 short movies which are at least touching the time gap between the end of 1st movie and this, before you go to the cinema. ( Links for the 3 short movies are below the end of the review ). Expect some awesome few twists in the movie too. \n\nACTING, CHARACTERS \n\nEver each actor who played  human characters did their job well. But I didn't see anything extra ordinary from the human characters except Gary Oldman, Keri Russell an Kirk Acevedo. Well it's obvious that they focused a lot about the perspective of Apes this time, which is a great thing. \n\nTalking about the Ape characters and the actors who played those characters, Andy Serkis stole every each scene he appeared in the movie as Caesar. He literally is the father of the motion capture CGI acting and it was an OSCAR winning performance. Andy again succeeded to portrait his character \" Caesar \" as a great, courageous, fearless, wise and inspirational leader just like in the prequel movie. And Koba is the 2nd most interesting character I found in the movie. At 1st, he looks like an arrogant, hot headed ape who hates humans more than anything. But he is more than meets the eye. He was a bad-ass character and Toby Kebbell ,the actor who played the character \" Koba \", did a marvelous performance by acting as a stupid ape and as a wise ape. Nick Thurston played the character named \" Blue Eyes \" Caesar's son, did an impressive performance. Apes had lot more character in this movie. We can feel like they have their own characteristics and attitude. And need to give the credit for Terry Notary who was the movement choreographer of the Apes. Director Matt Reeves handled the characters very well and it's something amazing to see from a director who is not a veteran. And so glad and faithful that the sequel which comes in 2016 of the franchise is in his hands.\n\nVISUAL EFFECTS, ACTION, 3D\n\nI can undoubtedly say, this is the best CGI I saw in a live action movie so far in my life. Apes were so realistic that we can't even imagine that, those apes are not actual apes, but played by humans. The expressions of the creatures are well captured and crafted. All credit goes to VFX Supervisor Joe Letteri and his crew in Weta Digital in the Visual effects company behind all this unimaginable creation. Cinematography of the movie is mind blowing. Action sequence very well choreographed and loved the camera angles which built the intense superbly. Use of 3D could be much more better,yet the depth was solid. Not essential to watch in 3D.\n\nIn a side note, the aspect ratio of the movie is 1.85 : 1. Which is short in width than an average asset ratio of a movie ( 2.35 : 1 ). That kinda bothered me at 1st because I wanted to experience the movie in a big scale. But after few minutes , That was forgivable because,we barely notice that with the excitement and the curious we get from the movie.\n\nSCORE\n\nMichael Giacchino's composing was one of the best thing I experienced in the movie. The score succeeded to ignite the intense, action, emotional and adrenalin pumping sequences through-out the movie.\n\nPROS (+) AND CONS (-)\n\n* Some unanswered questions (-)\n* Aspect ratio (-)\n* Visual effects and everything else (+)\n\nFINAL WORD\n\nThis movie is totally an ape movie which focused a lot about the perceptive of Apes yet it makes us realize, how humans become animals and animal become better than humans. And one of the greatest sequels ever made and I got almost everything I wanted to see in this sequel despite the questionable things I mentioned above. And make sure to watch the 3 short movies I mentioned about ( Links for the 3 short movies are below the end of the review ).\n\nDawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is a visually stunning, realistic CGI included, epic and inspirational movie that will remain in your most favorite movie sequels of all time. And so far, this is my most favorite live action movie of this year.\n\n* I also heard that the official prequel short novel by Gregory Keyes answered lot of unanswered things we notices in the movie. So If you want to be answered, do read that novel. It's available as an e-book too.\n\nMy rating 9.5/10\n\n* Spread of Simian Flu: Before the Dawn of the Apes (Year 1) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejrtt37XzOY\n\n* Struggling to Survive: Before the Dawn of the Apes (Year 5) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxcTS7AUngs\n\n* Story of the Gun: Before the Dawn of the Apes (Year 10) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYCl7_bDbZs",

A follow-up to the successful reboot of the world that apes ruled, DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES smashes the previous versions with genuine storytelling and great performances.\n\nThe first act proves to be an unusually enriching ride with an almost silent treatment focused on the ape world. Then come humans armed with fear and hope. The conflict of emotions starts to carve its mark with the warring factions aim to achieve ultimate survival. The values of trust and compassion are greatly unearthed as the plot thickens. WETA works its magic frame by frame with the visual wonders. The well-defined performances prove that Andy Serkis (Caesar) and the gang can deliver along with the digital artistry. I'm happy that Jason Clarke gets good projects. When I saw him in \"Zero Dark Thirty\", I knew that this guy is up for something grander.\n\nThere's more to this world in the future. Prepare to be amazed. 4.5/5 folks!",

Things are predictable and there are times when the plot details become tedious; however, as a whole, this picture comes together.\n\nIt can be said that this picture relies heavily on CG, and yes it does.  All can be forgiven if done the right way and this film does it the right way.  The motion capture and the presentation of the apes are spectacular in their own right; almost as if they are standing right there with the rest of the actors.\n\nThe human characters serve as a good contrast to the apes, which is much welcome.  Watching 2 hours of apes just wouldn't be the same.  Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, and Keri Russell have the major human characters to follow.\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes never brings the suspense or excitement, yet it is still a recommendable piece.",

            "content": "As an unashamed fan of the original Planet of the Apes films (which I once picked up for under a fiver), I am more than happy to enjoy this Sequel to the Reboot of the Remake of the Planet of the Apes. What's been delivered is another entertaining film; almost, but not quite the equal of its predecessor, with a decent story and characters, and special effects at the top of their game.\n\nThis is the eighth film in a franchise rich with possibilities, which has always reflected the concerns of society, from nuclear war, slavery and segregation in the 1960s and 70s, to the 21st Century concerns of animal testing, genetic engineering, global pandemics and our relationship with the environment, always with the chilling edge that comes from displacing humanity from its comfortable position as the planet's dominant species.\n\nAs a quasi-prequel to the first Planet of the Apes (1968), we get to see this process in action as we return to the titular planet (spoiler: it's Earth!) some years after the aforementioned pandemic which appeared as the end sequence of Rise, killing 90% of the human population. With no humans seen for some time, the thought in the now thriving society led by ape liberator Caesar is that the last survivors have perished, but a chance encounter on a hunting expedition reveals the truth.\n\nAn expedition of humans has ventured deep into ape territory with the intention of restarting a hydroelectric dam to restore power to the ruins of San Francisco. With a deep mistrust of humans at the very core of ape doctrine, the plan becomes a tense diplomatic mission as the humans and apes negotiate to avoid another brutal conflict and needless loss of life.\n\nCaesar is played by master of motion capture Andy Serkis and amazingly, the motion capture was largely filmed on location in the forests of Vancouver, the CGI seamlessly integrated with live action. As a character, Caesar is rare among apes in that he was raised by a human and can see the good in them.\n\nOur human hero is Malcolm (Jason Clarke), a survivalist and engineer, who is in charge of the expedition, but is not much of a leader. Neither is he a diplomat, but he is level headed enough to develop a relationship with Caesar, with whom they share a common goal which transcends the interspecies squabble - each has a family they would do anything to protect.\n\nThe real leader of the humans is back in San Francisco: the militaristic but pragmatic Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who has already lost his family (he swipes through their pictures on a prominently placed iPad - in shops now!) and has little desire to understand or relate to the apes.\n\nThe previous director Rupert Wyatt is replaced here by Matt Reeves, who gave us found footage monster movie Cloverfield, where the tantalising excitement of citywide destruction just off-screen was undermined by the idiotic decisions made by the protagonists. There are shades of this frustrating characterisation here with one member of Malcolm's team, Carver.\n\nHe is nothing more than a catalyst; right from the opening scene, where he shoots first and thinks later, wounding Caesar's son Blue Eyes in the process, everything about him screams \"I'm the arsehole who's constantly going to jeopardise this fragile diplomacy\" - which is barely saved from the brink of collapse more than once before the inevitable final showdown.\n\nKoba fills this role for the apes, but he is a stronger character and an established personal rival of Caesar, who tries to corrupt the younger apes, including Cesar's impressionable young son Blue Eyes.\n\nFor fans of the older films, there are plenty of nods to the continuity. Caesar's family, his wife Cornelia and son Blue Eyes, call to mind Roddy McDowell's ape scientist Cornelius, and the nickname 'Bright Eyes' given to Charlton Heston's astronaut Taylor in the original. This is not quite the same Caesar as in Conquest and Battle, both of which are mined again for thematic material, but like the reboot of Star Trek (2011), the time-travel elements of the story are flexible enough to allow multiple canonical continuities, the seeds of which were being sown as early as Escape, and ultimately enabled the hope for reconciliation at the end of Battle.\n\nWe also remember the dramatic \"No!\" - The first words spoken by an ape in both Conquest and Rise, when Caesar flexes his vocal chords to deliver an ultimatum to the humans, but the apes here tend to converse in sign language amongst themselves. Perhaps they see spoken language as a hallmark of humanity, but they prefer to save their English skills to dramatically intimidate humans, reminding them that they share a level of intelligence which apes may even have surpassed with their sense of community. While the apes have built a new society from the ground up, the surviving humans continue to scavenge in the ruins of their decaying civilisation, relying on old technology.\n\nThere's a great scene about halfway through the film. Power is restored to an old petrol station in the woods, and as it flickers into life a song plays from a stereo: The Weight by The Band, a song which is both religious allegory and an exploration of the music which flows from the American South. Its thematic relevance extends to include references to Judgement Day and the American civil rights movement.\n\nHearing recorded music and seeing artificial light, symbolic of humanity's legacy, offers a spot of hope, which is inevitably undercut by the melancholy of the world lost and the inevitability of an impending finale, which I'm going to talk about now, so stop reading to avoid spoilers. Hey, I've already told you that they managed to get the power back on so Gary Oldman can charge his iPad.\n\nThe audience wants a fight, we've paid to see apes with machine guns, and a fight is what we get, courtesy of the hot headed Koba and unrelenting Dreyfus. Lamentably although hell inevitably breaks loose, credibility is stretched. The previously pacifist apes are far too good at using the machine guns they have only recently stolen from the humans.\n\nWe know the apes have both intelligence and physical strength on their side, but it's hard to explain hold their own so well against the trained human guards. Ultimately, they overwhelm the humans with sheer numbers, when they might have concocted a strategic assault using some kind of unique and established ape advantage, such as their non verbal communication, or climbing ability.\n\nStill, all things considered, it's an entertaining film, but really not for those who don't subscribe to the sub-genre of 'ape films'.",

Second there are two plot holes so big you can drive Juipter through. Without spoiling the movie lets just say Military oh come on.

It's gripping from beginning to end. The special effects have improved 10 fold. Not once did I think something looked fake or not real. Performances are all on par with the past movies, powerful and engaging. This movie also had some of the best cinematography I've seen in awhile. The camera is smooth and steady as opposed to the frantic/shaky, can't see shit technique that unfortunately most action movies are now using. To cut it short, it's a Planet of The Apes film. It's dramatic and powerful. If \"Rise\" was \"Hope\" than \"Dawn\" is \"Empire.\" 9.8/10",

            "content": "I think it's official that I can't get into these movies. I will admit that the story was better in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes than it was in Rise, and the CGI is getting better. However, despite the improvements, I still don't feel engaged by the plot and the CGI animals still don't feel real. I'll get to my frustration with the story, but first let's talk about the special effects in this movie. There are several moments, like early in the movie when the apes are confronted by a bear, that I just feel like I'm watching a video game with really great graphics. The slower moments are the best, in fact any time they capture an ape that is posed in one position it looks amazingly authentic, but they haven't mastered the visual effect of the movement. And there are very few scenes where I actually believe the humans and the apes are part of the same world. I won't bother going into how odd it is when you think about naked apes running around which (in order to keep the PG-13 rating) have been given the Ken-doll crotch, because frankly I'm just fine with not watching 2 hours of monkey junk flopping around. However I will say that, and you can call me an ape-ist, but they all look the same to me. Aside from the orangutan and gorilla, I really struggled at times to differentiate one ape from another. They tried to fix that by giving scars and other quirks to some of the more prominent ape characters but I still struggled, perhaps in part because I was mildly distracted and disinterested in the story.\n\nSo now that I've worked my way back to that, let's get into my issues with the story. In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a majority of the humans have died, and the remainder are desperately fending for themselves. Meanwhile apes have begun to thrive and build their own elaborate society. What ends up happening when these 2 societies collide is that a few good-natured people on both sides (who intend to reach a mutually agreeable peace) are constantly being undermined by someone behaving like a classic mustache-twirling villain. They establish motives for the villainy, but I can't help being extremely frustrated as every good deed is met with more manufactured obstacles. The story of how war is created probably isn't all that far off from things that have gone on in the real world, but I tend to look to movies for more escapism and I don't feel like watching the frustrations of real-life politics played out for 2 hours. It's a surprisingly smart script and it certainly sets the stage for a continuing franchise that will thrive, it's just not one that I'm interested in. They do too good of a job at creating likable characters and unlikable characters on both sides of the battle, and so I just sit there and think \"what is the end result I should be hoping for in this movie?\" By the end I'm simply watching things happen and I've completely checked out emotionally. For fans of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I think Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is even better. For those who aren't fans of this series, you won't find some masterpiece here that changes your opinion.",

The final duel at the end of the film exceeded all expectations I had of this movie alone. It is awesome to see the apes in action and they do pose as a frightening threat. The best thing about this film is how further sets up the trilogy and its sequel even better and makes it feel almost impossible to wait three years to see it. Each movie does feel like just another piece of the puzzle and when the third film hits theaters in 2017, it will be beyond epic. It is going to be the movie we've been waiting for since seeing the trailers to Rise of the Planet of the Apes and nobody even realizes it.",

While the storyline and human actors fall far short of its predecessor (how can a few Australian no-names compare to James Franco and John Lithgow?), the film makes up for it with jaw-dropping visual effects.  In fact, this film might actually challenge \"Interstellar\" for the Best Visual Effects Oscar.  \"Dawn\" is performance-capture technique perfection, with the vividly real animal movements of the actors pairing perfectly with the detailed computer animation.  It is literally unbelievable - you would swear that these were real apes and, in a less competitive year, I truly believe that Andy Serkis would have been nominated for best actor.  The plot was a bit weak but serves as a good bridge between the ape escape at the end of \"Rise\" and the inevitable battle of the species (which we will hopefully see in the next film).  One of the biggest perspective-changing aspects of the film is the establishment that neither species are the good guys or bad guys.  By basing the conflict off of a misunderstanding, it is clear to see that they could coexist but have no choice in trying to eliminate the other.  The film sets a great tone with its opening.  I don't typically buy into the \"global news report opening sequence,\" but this one is a perfect recap of the previous story and puts the global spreading of the ALZ-113 virus into perspective.  In spite of the special effects and grand-scheme-concepts that this film adds to the series, the human acting is a mess.  Gary Oldman was completely underutilized.  He is the biggest name in this film and the writers even acknowledged that by giving him an incredible emotional moment, but then his character basically disappeared and didn't get another \"moment.\"  The same goes for Keri Russell, who isn't given a chance to use her acting chops, and the rest of the cast who just kind of exist to create a reasonable story.  I can't get over the fact that a ton of CGI apes have more personality than the live humans on-screen, but I mean that as a compliment to the apes more than an insult to the humans.  It feels like some of the script was hastily thrown together with repetitive scenes and a lack of intelligent dialogue.  When half of your movie is without dialogue due to ape interaction, you would think that the other half of the movie would be well-written.  Still, the incredible animation and apocalyptic San Francisco make those flaws hardly noticeable.  \"Dawn of the Plant of the Apes\" needs the rest of the series to make it a great movie, but its special effects would be worth watching even without a plot.",

Directed by Matt Reeves, (Cloverfield (2008) and Let Me In (2010)), this is a strong sequel which is more down and dirty than the first film, which shows where this new franchise will be going and how it might connect up with the original film series. It's been 10 years since the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and the ALZ-113 virus wiped out much of humanity, causing society to collapse. In San Francisco, a handful of survivors work together, but petrol is running out, and their only hope is to start up a hydroelectric dam, which will bring electricity to San Francisco, but the dam is in a community of apes, led by Caesar (Andy Serkis). A team of scientists, led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) goes to negotiate with Caesar to work on the dam, even though Caesar doesn't trust humans. Caesar's second in command Koba (Toby Kebbell), doesn't trust the humans, and plans a mutiny. It's a very good sequel, and there's some brilliant action sequences throughout, even the motion capture is brilliantly convincing, and you'd never thought you'd engage with apes, but you do, and the way they communicate is absolutely brilliant. It sets the stage for what's to come, even though we know who wins.",

The new ape world is oddy realistic which makes it all the more terrifying. The relationship between Caesar & Malcolm is one of the highlights.

            "content": "\"Dawn\" revisits the age-old tale of how we treat those that we \"think\" are different from us. \nIf Man was made in the image of God, then the Apes of \"Dawn\" emulate the Humans who have scarred and\nmaimed them in their (the humans) quest to develop a new drug. In fact, how the native Ape language came to be \nhand signs is revealed as being sourced from the Humans long ago. As \"Dawn\" unfolds we see a crazed example of balance in \nnature where every action has an equal an opposite reaction. An Ape family, which, in the beginning was\nperfectly balanced and strong suddenly enters a state of collapse (as if it is switching position with the\nleft-over humans who, heretofore, were the ones living in a state of chaos). Like a strange brand of contagion\none group that had been in dire straits now celebrates newfound hope and the Apes begin to fall into disarray\nas they begin a violent assault against the Humans that had wronged them 10 years earlier. In the end, \"Dawn\" \nrepresents a point in time where a race to coalesce good forces against evil will determine the fate of\nall major life on Earth. Matt Reeves does a reasonable job of directing \"Dawn\" and \nwhile this film is aesthetically pleasing and always hints at anti-Darwinism, \nit underscores the inherent violence that permeates the human race and anything\nthat humans touch. The land of the apes is a lush, beautiful place where daily tasks \nare meant only to provide survival of the family and sustenance for the home. This \nenvironment is contrasted early on by the impoverished \nsurroundings that the humans take up residence in. While the Simian population comes across\nas intelligent, cohesive, and vibrant, the struggling human population finds itself on the\nbrink of extinction, functions chaotically, and reacts rather than acting rationally. This film immediately grips the viewer. The dire straits of the remaining population is \nimmediately grasped. The Apes live in the heart of a land where humans are in search of \nresources that can save them, but murder has stepped in and created an immediate rift between\nthe two groups : so now the question is how the humans can take control without dying in the process, \nbecause the Apes do plan to kill them if they should ever trespass into their world again. Like a foolish teenager in a slasher horror flick, the humans are just too hard-headed to \nkeep away. Venturing into the forbidden zone again, the Apes discover their trespass and \nhilarity ensues (if you want to call it that). The pain of the Apes' past dealings with humans (and the human fear of the Apes) is palpable \nbut at the same time displays fright and amazement in single moment are apparent. The humans\nrealize that things don't always fit into a neat little box in life. After all, these Apes can \ntalk. It's clear to see why the Apes want nothing to do with the presumptuous attitude of many \nof these left-over humans; and while the hope of viewers is that the goodwill can overcome the \nomnipresent ignorance of these left-overs, it seems almost certain that it won't. \nFrom the start the humans are always first to threaten, first to kill, and were the root of the \nplague that has nearly destroyed all of humanity and disfigured or killed many Apes. As dissension, mistrust, and human loathing start to tear at the very fabric of the Ape community, \nCaesar's control of his world becomes threatened. Infighting follows as frustations boil over. Still, amidst the factions that are fighting there are small relationships based on friendship and\ncaring that start to bud between some of the humans and Apes, underscoring the reality that\neven in real life there are those who are good and those who are bad and that we have to be deliberate\nin order to differentiate between the two. Some humans and Apes befriend each other. Other Apes covertly return murder in kind to their human\nadversaries, and the question of which is truly the intelligent race is really never decided.\nIn the end we never really know who the savage is, who more brutal, or who is more inhumane . . . \nUs or them. It's a question that we already should know the answer to. This effort is as good as any other in the series of \"Ape\" remakes that I've seen. \nA good watch with thumbs up 8-)",

Dawn does not deserve a 90% rating!\nI was stuck for starters in the small fact that an enormous hoard of apes had been living in the forest for 10 years and nobody new about it!\nThe drug research company is still operating after producing a drug which set off the apes escaping from 'gaol' and living in the forest. This never reached the papers? Oldman's character never heard about a hundred apes living in the forest or the story of apes getting smart? AND, the apes were allowed to remain in the forest?\nThat aside, the story lets down the wonderful effects. Obviously not a concern as this is yet another franchise with half a dozen more films to follow.",

In acting, motion capture, cgi, story and themes, it just raises the bar from everything the first movie did, and does it better.  Andy Serkis is incredible, along with Toby Kebbell, both taking motion captured performances to the level where awards should be handed out for acting. The direction from Matt Reeves is terrific, especially the battle scene with the tank with the rotating top. He got the best out of both apes and humans, while capturing the scale of the city and forest habitats both to their utmost. All in all Dawn gives you everything you could ask for in a sequel, while furthers the story in a direction that set up an awesome third movie.\n4.5 Beards Out Of 5",

Meanwhile, the apes that escape the labs have formed their own home and community in the woods.  In the apocalyptic world, small pockets of human survive and need to use a damn to get electricity back in their facility, but they will have to gain the trust of the monkeys to accomplish their goals.\n\n\"Do they look like just apes to you?\"\n\nMatt Reeves, director of Cloverfield, Let Me In, The Paul Bearer, and episodes of the television series Felicity, delivers Dawn of Planet of the Apes.  The storyline for this picture was way better than I anticipated and is unpredictable and action packed.  The special effects were also perfect and this is the first one that compares to the original in terms of quality.  The acting is also very good and the cast includes Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, Kerri Russell, and Andy Serkis. \n\n\"Scars make you stronger.\"\n\nWe grabbed this from Redbox recently while looking for another film and were shocked at how entertaining this film was.  This is one of my favorite Planet of the Apes picture.  I thought this was done perfectly.

            "content": "Review:\nNow that I've finally watched this movie, I must admit, it is brilliant but it does take a bit of time to get going. The apes look amazing and there face expressions and mannerisms were excellent but after hearing all of the hype, I was slightly disappointed with the whole pace of the film. I loved what the director done with Caesar's character and the relationships with the various apes and humans was interesting and a joy to watch. I couldn't help but thinking that the movie might have been better if the director would have got some top class actors to work alongside the apes, but thats just my honest opinion. Anyway, the whole humans against apes concept was well put together and I couldn't wait for the Caesar vs. Koba showdown, which didn't disappoint. Its definitely a must watch for all movie goers and I can't wait for the next instalment which has been built up to me a major blockbuster like this one. Great!\n\nRound-Up:\nJason Clarke, who plays Caesar's human friend, has a unique style of acting which isn't for everyone's taste. He has a distant screen presence which can easily make you forget that he was in a film. He's starred in movies like The Great Gatsby, Lawless and White House Down but I doubt that anyone can remember him in those films. He's also got a role in the new Terminator Genisys movie so he's obviously a actor that's in popular demand at the moment. Personally, I would have cast Gary Oldman as the lead in this film because it could have done with some emotion and depth but judging by the movies takings, it didn't really matter who played the lead. Andy Serkis has become the puppet master when it comes to playing CGI characters. His amazing movements and mannerisms as Gollum and King Kong, really made those movies great and with the new Star Wars and Avengers in the pipeline, there's no turning back for this unique actor.\n\nBudget: $170million\nWorldwide Gross: $709million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama movies about an ape colony fighting against the humans to save there humanity. 7/10",

There's much events that can be predictable, much slow action sequences and the characters are mostly terrible.\n\nThe main issue I have with this movie is that there's no clear main character, the movie kept changing focus, and I guess that's the point but it feels stupid. There's also too much focus on the apes and too little on the humans, it's understandable but I want more focus on the humans. More on the characters: there's no chemistry between them and it feels dumb and awful. Another flaw is that I could predict almost every main plot detail in the movie, much more than in Rise of The Planet of The Apes. I also expected a greater soundtrack from Michael Giacchino, who gave us the awesome soundtrack in \"Star Trek\" (2009) and the TV-show \"Fringe\". The action is just as the soundtrack: less impressive and less unique. The movie does in fact have some great moments, it do raise even more ethical questions than the previous movie. It also does a great job when it comes to illustrate what no knowledge results into. The movie is also emotional powerful, and the CGI is spectacular. It's much clearer and detailed than in the previous movie. Not flawless though.\n\nThe opening scene is exiting and the first act is totally superior over the second and the third. They are predictable, slow and less entertaining. The ending however, could have played out much better. The previous movie was much about science; this however got a more basic tone about survival and coexistence. It's too boring for my taste.\n\nDawn of The Planet of The Apes gets a 6.8/10.",

In the meanwhile humankind has been decimated due to simian flu, the colony that barely survives in the city needs to get to the dam to produce energy; but the dam is in Caesar's land, when a group of men trespass they initiate a quarrel that threatens both species. \nThe plot and the set up is carefully planned, it would have been easy to fall for clich\u00e9s, instead we find a movie with a sensible story of trust and betrayal that strikes the right notes, in places it has echoes of plays of Shakespeare and at the end there is a good battle scene which is computer generated but that is believable enough to make us think in that possibility. A really good and entertaining film with good performances by humans and \"monkeys\".",

            "content": "God, making Caesar the center of this franchise was the best decision the filmmakers could've made. He's such a captivating presence throughout both movies, and this movie definitely does justice to the potential he showed in the first one. When Koba shot Caesar, I was so shocked, and I thought it was so ballsy of them to kill him off. When it was revealed he didn't actually die, I was slightly disappointed, but I was mostly glad, because the movie (and likely future installments) wouldn't be as interesting without him.\n\nOne of the most interesting parts of the movie is that for the first half and large portions of the second half, there isn't a specific good guy or bad guy. I mean, we're supposed to root for Caesar, but we're supposed to root for most of the human characters too (minus Carver). Koba is obviously the main villain, and the movie needs one, but in all the big battle scenes, you're torn about who to root for. Watching the humans kill the apes is painful, and it's equally painful to watch the apes killing humans. Everyone is innocent. All this senseless violence is thanks to one greedy, sociopathic ape (Koba), and he's the only truly evil character. But are all the other characters good guys, then, or is EVERYONE a little to blame? Gary Oldman's character, Dreyfus, certainly reacts rashly, and refuses to listen to Malcolm. Sure, Koba is mostly to blame. But so are the other apes for so blindly following him, and so are the humans for striking back without hesitating, fueled by preconceived notions that are seemingly being confirmed for them.\n\nAlso, the action and direction are just awesome. Though you can't really root for anyone in the all-out war in the second half, it's still fun to watch the great action sequences unfolding before your eyes. I particularly remember two great camera sequences: first, when Koba takes over a tank and the camera remains level on the tank as it spins and destroys everything it points at, and second, the tracking shot when Malcolm walks through a building, hiding to avoid the apes running around with weapons. The second one especially is extremely tense, the camera tight on Malcolm as he wanders through hallways where an ape could seemingly jump out at any time.\n\nThe earlier sequences, and the first half in general is a little boring, mostly because there isn't a ton of time to develop the severely thinly drawn human characters, but that's hard to avoid. Thankfully, even the earlier scenes are imbued with tension, because you just KNOW the ape-human relations are going to explode, but you don't know how it's going to happen. I kinda sympathize with the filmmakers, because it's a little hard to develop the characters beyond the specific purposes they serve without the movie being bloated. Jason Clarke is decent in the role, but he doesn't really have a personality, and Keri Russell's character is even worse off. There are a few tiny touches, like with Alexander's drawing and the nice little scene when Alexander and Ellie bond, but it's not enough to make them really compelling beyond being human archetypes to interact with the really interesting apes.\n\nBut those relatively boring scenes at least serve to make it more shocking when the violence really begins. It's clear that Koba is tricking the two men when he plays dumb and dances over to them, but it doesn't make it any less shocking when he suddenly grabs a gun, fools around for a second, then ruthlessly kills one man, stares the the other man in the eye for one spellbinding moment, then kills him, too. It's tense and disturbing, and though the movie isn't as constantly entertaining as a summer blockbuster like Edge of Tomorrow, it's emotional and thoughtful and exciting.",

They live in peace and raise their families. Until a small group of surviving humans, led by a man named Malcolm, stumble upon the ape's home in an effort to fix the nearby dam that will turn San Francisco's power back on. Can Malcolm and Caesar work together and keep the peace between their two groups, or will all out war erupt between them?\n\n2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes turned out to be a great surprise for me when I saw it in theaters. I went in assuming that they would mess up with the subject matter and it would result in a goofy movie. However they pulled if off and it turned out to be a fantastic movie with great acting from James Franco and Andy Serkis. This one wasn't ended up being not quite as good though and felt a little underwhelming. You should still see it though.\n\nEvery great thing you've heard about Andy Serkis' motion capture work is true. The man is phenomenal. Not once during the movie did I think, \"that's a man behind all those movements\". Of course the CGI helps, but if something doesn't move like it should, then all the CGI in the world won't help.\nOf course Serkis wasn't the only motion capture actor to work on this. Toby Kebbel, Nick Thurston, Karin Konoval, and Judy Greer (yes that Judy Greer) all delivered great work and disappeared into their ape characters.\nLest we forget, there were human characters in this movie too. Gary Oldman is seen little unfortunately, but he does have some good scenes and touching moment when we find out whether or not the dam did what it was supposed to.\nJason Clarke does a decent job replacing James Franco as the lead. His presence isn't as memorable though and neither is his character for most of the first half of the film. Which is a problem almost all the human characters have. You really end up caring more about the apes anyway, so the fact the humans are kind of forgettable doesn't ruin the movie. A more solid human lead could have still helped the movie a bit more.\nFringe and The Walking Dead's Kirk Acevedo shows up too and he played a pretty good jerk and ends up being the most memorable.\n\nTo me this movie didn't really feel like the \"Dawn\" of anything. Some stuff happens, it gets resolved, and in the end it feels like not much has changed.\nDon't get me wrong, I liked the movie. It just felt very much like filler to connect Rise to whatever the next one will be. 3D was pretty pointless as well so I would say pass on that.\nAlso I may have missed it, but when does Malcolm learn Caesar's name? Between when they first get chased off and when Malcolm returns, I swear none of the apes say call him by name so he had no way of knowing. Just something that bugged me a little. It still had some cool ape fight moments, top-notch CGI, and great ape characters. Some slightly more memorable human beings could have helped, but overall a decent follow-up. Fans of Rise will still want to see this one.\n\n7 Reels Out of 10\n\n \n\"If we go to war, we could lose all we've built. Home. Family. Future.\"",

On the other side of the woods, at the guarded tower of the ruined city lives the small population of humans who are genetically immune to the deadly ALZ-113 virus which wiped nearly 90% of the human population. The humans need access to a hydroelectric dam located at the ape's territory, which could provide long-term power to the city. So they visit Caesar's territory to seek help in their quest and the story continues from there. Fantastic visual effects, story, direction, acting and emotional depth that will make you want to cheer for both species, especially Caesar and his gang. Humans help the apes in several instances and the apes return the favor as well. Overall solid, good film in Blu-ray, not to be missed! Happy New Year everybody!!",

            "content": "If the brilliance of Rise was that Caesar felt like an alive being that could easily be related to, Dawn's brilliance is that it's able to repeat that with a multitude of monkeys. The best characters in this movie are CGI-Apes, all of which can be related to and understood thoroughly and easily. You become enveloped within the Apes' society and evolution, and you may even find yourself rooting for them at some points. The relationship between post-apocalyptic humanity and the increasingly-cunning and intimidatingly-powerful Apes is something wondrous to watch, and it ensures that any future installments of this franchise will certainly be worth viewing. Rise planted seeds of promise, and Dawn shows that those tasked with growing the Apes Franchise are doing a tremendous job and will more than likely continue to do so.",

            "content": "As I have said time and time before in my reviews I often either have huge expectations for a film or I have no opinion whatsoever and go with the flow. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was another film I had very big expectations for. Growing up I remember the films being played via VHS over and over again by family members and the TV series we used to watch as well, so my love for talking human acting apes started a very long time ago and after seeing the prequel back in 2011 I have very much been waiting to see how the apes actually take over mankind.\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes did not disappoint me one little bit, from its opening scene's and beginnings where we learn that the human race is dying out due to what is known as the \"simian flu.\" To the very last scenes I was on the edge of my seat, I was sucked so hard into this universe that I couldn't find one thing wrong with the film apart from a few slow scenes and a little CGI mishaps other than that I can honestly say I loved everything this movie gave.\nThe story takes off about 10yrs after the earlier prequel \"Rise of the planet of the apes\" as I stated earlier the human race is slowly being wiped out by a simian flu and now Caesar and the other apes he released from the science labs live in their own world in the middle of the forests. They have fire, they have school they even have written word but most beautiful of all is their use of sign language. It's amazing to see. Now I know it was all CGI at its finest but I could not help being sucked in t the gorgeousness and loving nature the apes had amongst themselves and the way they have grown. Down the way a bit a tribe of humans who are immune to the flu have formed an army to survive. What they need though is power and the only power source near them is in the middle of the Apes new homeland in the way of an old power dam. A pact of peace is proclaimed so that the humans can get the dam restored but of course there are always though who are against diplomatic solutions and do what they will to destroy any chance of peace being made on both sides.\nI'll say it one more time in case you haven't heard me but I absolutely loved the movie, if you let yourself get taken away in its beauty this film will definitely please. There are so many things going on in the background and of course we can all say the movie is actually some kind of great metaphor for the battle we are facing currently whether it be our environmental war or even wars between nations but if you can ignore all that this film stands out on its own as its own battle.\nNow in saying all that I actually went with my partner and whereas we usually agree on films we didn't on this, his first reaction was laughter and his second was the fact it was just so (as he put it) \"hokey\". He didn't enjoy the film at all in fact he found it laughable, he couldn't get over the apes behaving so human. What I found out afterwards though was that he never grew up with the apes as a child, he never seen the prequel so he had no expectations apart from my own which left him very let down.\nIf you know the Apes I believe you will love this next adventure and if you don't know them then you may not. Either way I think it's worth seeing. The session we went to was filled with kids under 15 dragged along by their parents I'm sure. I don't feel this is a film for the kids at all there is a lot of adult subject matter which I personally believe kids will find very disturbing.\nIt was so close to getting a perfect score from me just those few slow scenes and a little sloppy on some of the CGI in a couple of small scenes.\n4.5/5 BanShee Screams for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.\nX\n#dawnoftheplanetoftheapes",

While Ceasar  is willing to let the humans do their work and be on their way his second in command Koba wants revenge and all out extinction of the human race for the way apes were treated in the past.\n\nFirst things first this film looks amazing especially the apes and the characterisations of the apes, the use of sign language and some human speech is truly original. The humans who include Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell unfortunately have very little characterisation outwith surviving and doing right by the people in the city. Though Oldman does have one brilliantly handled scene amidst cliched leader scenes.\n\nSpecial mention goes to Andy Serkis who has created a truly original character to go along with his Gollum character from the Lord of the Rings, and it will be a shame if he is overlooked come awards season.\n\nDrawbacks of this film include some ropey CGI effects, the sub-plot of koba starting a war between two species is very much in the style of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country hence done before, though these are minor quibbles. \n\nOverall this is an entertaining film, very much an original take on the mythology with some drawbacks , though these drawbacks do not take away from the experience.",

It gives the illusion that apes really are like this and they succeeded making us believe that they apes are filming along side the cast. The mise-en-scene gives us a real feel of a post-apocalyptic California, but we can still recognise areas from the previous movie that are significant to Caesar, for example his home. \n\nThis is a must see film.

            "content": "A war begins to brew between man and ape in this sequel to the 2011 hit Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It's been ten years since the Simian Flu wiped out most of humanity, and somewhere deep in the woods outside of San Francisco, Caesar (voice and performance capture by Andy Serkis) and his primate companions have established a thriving village built on the principles of peace and community. Shortly after welcoming a baby brother into the family, Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) is walking through the forest with his friend Ash (Doc Shaw) when they cross paths with a human named Carver (Kirk Acevedo), who impulsively draws his gun and shoots Ash at the first sign of aggression. As it turns out, Carver is part of a human expedition led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), who, along with the rest of his crew, races to Carver's side just as Caesar and the rest of the apes answer Blue Eyes' desperate call for help. An enraged Caesar drives the humans away after realizing they are no longer a threat, and decides to dispatch a small crew to follow them rather than yield to the pleas of his aggressive advisor Koba (Toby Kebbell) to launch an all-out attack. Instead, he decides to show the apes' strength by amassing outside of the humans' makeshift community at the base of an unfinished tower, making it unmistakably clear that the two species should remain apart. Meanwhile, the point of the human excursion was to get a dormant dam running again in order to power their community, which will soon be thrust into darkness should they fail to take action. Convinced that he could strike a truce with Caesar that would allow the humans to repair the dam, which is located on the apes' land, Malcolm gets permission from human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) to set out on his mission. Incredibly, thanks to the help of his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell), his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee), and a few other key allies, Malcolm succeeds. Still, his truce with the apes is a fragile one, and just when it seems that the primates and humans have learned to coexist in peace, a shocking act of betrayal threatens to spark a war that will determine the dominant species.",

This time around, though, the movie is very different in both theme and setting. Rise was a techno-thriller commenting on society. This was more of a post-apocalyptic tribal film.\n\nThere is an opening montage that is a rehashed version of the closing credits for the previous film, and we are then confronted with the worlds ten years later. The apes now have a society, and Caesar is their leader. They soon encounter a group of human survivors, and there are many complex political machinations that ensue (reminiscent of the first Mission Impossible film).\n\nThe apes seem far more interesting than the humans here. While not exactly one-dimensional, the humans lack the interesting relationships established for the apes from the previous film. The shift in tone, while fresh, made the movie fit the mold of many human-survivalist movies, although I will give credit to the filmmakers for giving the apes the screen time they deserved.\n\nWhile still an entertaining movie, it falls short of Rise.",

Koba has an expanded role as the villain while some of the other apes get singled out for bigger roles with the motion capture.\n\nUnlike the first film where the humans really came off as the bad guys, the second time round we have more ambiguity as to who the heroes and villains really are.  It's almost as if you could watch an entire movie based purely on the apes style of living and rise from primitive culture to something humans might have survived in.  What's great is as the movie progresses, so does the apes understanding and evolution.\n\nWhile Gary Oldman and Keri Russell add the star power in subdued supporting roles, Jason Clarke stands out as the lead human actor with compassion, smarts and reasoning to at least be the guy you root to succeed.  \n\nThe story really does have a war-like mentality about it.  You can see the chances at peace failing as underhanded tactics and backstabbing are put into play by the apes.  Both sides, apes and humans, are lumped into the same category.

Almost everything about this film is an improvement from the first, which is saying a lot. The story is a great and logical continuation from the first, the acting/cast is amazing on all parts but particularly in our returning protagonist, Caesar, played by Andy Serkis, who in my opinion is an extremely underrated actor and deserves an Oscar. The effects are absolutely unbelievably incredible this time around. There was one point where the camera zoomed in to Caesar's eyes almost in an eyeball to eyeball perspective and if I hadn't already known it was CGI, I would have had difficulty believing it was. The emotion throughout is well placed and  extremely effective, especially in the area of the interactions of the apes within the film.

While war is a part of our nature, we must still believe that there can be peace and that we must look beyond ourselves to find it.

            "content": "Spoilers!!!\nThis movie has enough plot holes in it to drive a truck through. First off, there are a bunch of Apes by our dam! They don't kill us when we shoot one of them. They show up in force and say they don't want war but they'll fight if they have to. Why at that point would you persist with the dam idea? Everybody is dead, so there are probably other dams. Maybe a bunch of solar panels laying around? Other generators or fuel sources?\n\nNope. We have to go for the dam that has a bunch of dangerous apes around it. Also, if they already have fuel for cars and generators, why do they have to wait for the dam to work so they can start powering their radio transmitter. Power it off the Generators.\n\nSecond plot hole: They've survived for ten years. Wouldn't they have some kind of organization and administration in place to where they wouldn't all just start chaotically yelling and arguing to the point where their \"leader\" has to get a bull horn, and barely succeed in stopping a riot. Come on. These people have been living together and surviving for 10 years.\n\nThird big plot hole. Why bring the crazy jerk dude with you on a peace keeping mission to fix the dam? Did he suddenly develop a brain tumor and was a real nice guy before, but now they're just realizing he's a reactionary idiot who's going to start a war?\n\nFourth big plot hole. The bad ape walks into the middle of the camp with all of the apes there, and shoots Ceaser in plain sight, and... nobody notices. Ahem.\n\nFifth big plot hole. The human camp is gearing up to attack the apes, but when an ape shows up in their perimeter they don't kill him, and in fact let him get close enough to disarm and kill them.\n\nSixth big plot hole. Hey, let's put our armory with all the guns not behind these big safe reinforced walls, but outside of our defensive complex, so they apes can go their first, arm up, and then attack us.\n\nSeventh big plot hole. Ceaser has led them through thick and thin. When the apes realize he's alive and that the bad ape killed him, wouldn't any of them come to his defense?\n\nEighth big plot hole. The apes get guns and learn how to use them, and yet the guns seem to have 24 hrs. clips that just keep shooting for every shot. There is no real indication of them learning how to release a clip, load another, and then chamber a round before shooting again. Not only do you not see them ever reload, you never see them carry any ammo, through they fire on automatic continuously.\n\nOutside of the many plot holes, the characters are never really well developed. There are plenty of slow moving parts in this film where you could have really gotten to know the humans and apes. I have a fairly good memory. I just watched this film, and I can't remember any of the humans names.\n\nCompletely blown away RT has given this a 91 critic, 90 audience. To quote Zoolander: \"Is everyone taking crazy pills?\"",

            "content": "Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is one of 2014's best movies and also acts as a marginal improvement over its predecessor. This film takes place after the events of its predecessor where Caesar and his Apes are now living in a peaceful life away from civilization. When a band of humans arrive and Caesar gives them a chance to fix the things that the humans need distrust and tension soon starts to rise between Caesar and his second in command Ape Koba and soon the Apes will lead a war against the human race which will determine who belongs to earth either the humans or Apes. I remember watching the premiere of this film with my parents in the cinema and I seriously enjoyed it a lot even though I watched it for the second time at home on my DVD it still blew me away and seriously this is one of 2014's best blockbuster movies to date and also the best in the Planet of The Apes series since its predecessor. Ok let's get on with the review. When I said that there are so many things on why I consider this to be a true masterpiece its because this film has all of the things that every blockbuster buff wants. One of the film's stand ups or highlights is that the film not only acts as a marginal improvement over its predecessor but also acts as an expansion to its predecessor and we get to focus on the perspective of the apes instead of the humans. In Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes the film is focused on the humans while in this film we get to see more of the apes from their point of view throughout the film and it gives the film a very smart feel. The other good things about this film is that the movie's pacing is outstanding the first half and second half focus on drama while the third half goes into action territory until the intense climax and it never gets boring at all. The other highlights of this film is that the movie has loads of scenes that are extremely memorable and well achieved(The opening scene, Koba killing two humans, Koba shooting Caesar, Apes attacking the city, Koba riding a tank, Caesar vs Koba and the intense scene where Koba kills Ash). Also the cinematography is ace and the editing is gobsmacking plus the soundtrack composed by Michael Giacchino(Mission Impossible III)is perfect and it gives the movie a strong emotional feel that is touching and very dramatic at the same time. Also the screenplay by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback is amazing and I love how the film seriously surpass the original in many ways. The other highlights of the film is that the movie has loads of superb settings I love the woods where Caesar and the other apes stay along with the city that the apes destroyed. But the true main highlight of this film is the themes and tones along with the acting. I love how this movie keeps you interested from the beginning until the end and the themes about Humans and Apes are superb and it makes you think about whose side are you on and who will win I just adore it a lot. Also I love how how we get to hear Caesar talk more often compared to the first one and I love Koba's appearance as well and he gets to appear in every scene of the film. Now the acting is the second highlight of this. All of the casts did a very good job with their performances in the film. Gary Oldman did a superb job with his performance in the film as Dreyfuss. Jason Clarke did an outstanding job with his performance as the main character Malcolm while Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell did an outstanding job with their performances in the film as Caesar and Koba. Director Matt Reeves did an outstanding job with his work on this film and he seriously created a stunning film that has a lot of action and drama. Overall Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is a stunning and well achieve film from start to finish  and one of 2014;s best films ever made. This movie get a 10/10.",

            "content": "\"How much like them we are\"\n\n10 years after the events of 'Rise of Planet of Apes' got over, the events of 'Dawn of Planet of Apes' follow. We saw that some virus originates causing an epidemic called simian flu spread across the globe during the closing credits of the previous installment. The same events are show in the opening credits of this one. Most of the humans on the earth's surface are wiped out and few who are alive seem to be somehow immune to the virus. While the apes lead by Caesar have established a new home in the forest and growing in population day by day. The group of human survivors need a dam to be back in operation so that they get electricity but the problem is it lies close to the ape territory. And there the differences on both sides start to begin.\n\nCaesar played by Andy Serkis(motion-capture) is definitely my favorite character from both Rise and Dawn. His character is well written and Andy Serkis has done a marvelous job. Despite knowing nature of Humans he still is sure not every human is bad. While in the other camp of humans, people are panicking as the apes are smarter than ever and feel threatened. Gary Oldman isn't at his best but does his job. But its Jason Clarke as Malcolm who is more likable. The bond between Malcolm and Caesar that slowly and strongly develops is one of the strongest points in the film. Also other positive includes, the tension that builds up on each side on the slightest doubt against each other.The CGI and motion capture is also top notch. The post-apocalyptic environment is quite haunting and effects on apes are damn good. Its doesn't not look perfectly realistic but still one of the best works in recent times. \n\nThe weak point of the film is it gets quite predictable and towards the end turns into routine action flick filled explosions and more CGI. Also some plot advancements might not make much sense,but its bearable. The ultimate point of film in my opinion is that no one perfect on either side, which is the main cause of misunderstanding. Humans are always feel threatened when they see something far advanced while apes are afraid of humans destroying their species like they destroyed earth. One point where Caesar says \"I always think ape better than human. I see now, how much like them we are.\", kept me thinking about our nature for quite some time.\n\nDawn is way different movie compared to Rise. So if you liked the first one because it featured a playful pet-ape Caesar than don't expect same thing here. But still despite its flaws Dawn of the Planet of Apes is strong movie with good intellectual and emotional depth. Only if they did not make it feel like a blockbuster action flick in the second half it would have been pretty much better\n\nRATING: [3.5/5]",

However, there are notable flaws with the film particularly surrounding the script.\n\nAs was the case with its predecessor, there is the attempt to evoke emotion through the use of personifying monkeys and apes. As with the first film, there are points in the film (as there were in the first) in which I would find myself groaning out loud, with the director trying to play the 'look at the cute animal and become attached to them' card. Entwined with were some unoriginal underlying themes which felt mashed together to churn out the final product. Combine this with the dystopia in which the movie is set, and the film felt like it was the lion king meets lord of the flies meets 1984. Originality is by no means the hallmark of a good script. However, for me the script was just so obviously unoriginal and shallow, and in attempting to be profound and intellectual, it enhanced the script's weaknesses.\n\nDespite the lack of depth in the story, the CGI is outstanding. It is an easy watch, and not engaging in the mechanics of the script too much should provide for a couple of hours of entertainment.",

Visual effects are extraordinary, story smooth and flowing, direction mostly very good, acting of the humans was average, \"apes\" were amazing, and touchy feelings and emotional depth comes as a package. A lot of people agree with me, knowing that the movie grossed over $707 million worldwide.\n\nThere is no wonder that after the release of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, director Rupert Wyatt commented on possible sequels: \"I think we're ending with certain questions, which is quite exciting. To me, I can think of all sorts of sequels to this film, but this is just the beginning.\" I think that is a perfect idea, and screenwriter and producer Rick Jaffa also stated that Rise featured several clues as to future sequels: \"I hope that we're building a platform for future films. We're trying to plant a lot of the seeds for a lot of the things you are talking about in terms of the different apes and so forth.\" Really looking forward for it.\n\nIf you want to see  a very good science fiction movie, to be involved in the story, while not missing on emotional charge and action sequences, find some time to watch this!",

They have enough development and are not annoying. You care about their situation. Gary Oldman has a surprisingly small role, but a pretty good one. But the real star is obviously the apes. Andy Serkis and the team of motion capture actors are mesmerizing. The effects are great.\n\nThe movie also has a lot to say about the human condition.

            "content": "As a sci-fi fan this movie was one of those must-see movies for me. I have to say that I was not having the highest of expectations on it though and I also have to say that my expectations was more or less met. To me this is a mildly entertaining movie but it is certainly not a great movie.\n\nThe special effects with the apes are very good indeed. The apes look very much real and I was surprised at how much emotions that the special effects people managed to get into their facial expressions. The human actors also did a quite good job...within the limitations of the script of course.\n\nHowever, the previous movie felt reasonably new, fresh and original (although it was fairly predictable) while this movie just feels like a rehash of some fairly standard, thirteen on a dozen, post-apocalyptic story with some apes thrown in to make it stand out. I really do not understand why so many people seems to think so highly of this movie. It is the all too common catalogue of stupid behaviors and sadly enough the apes seems to have inherited plenty of stupid behaviors from the humans.\n\nIt starts of with the usual scared-trigger-happy-idiot-shoots someone. In this case an ape of course. How many times have that boring excuse for kick starting the story been used? Then it pretty much goes on. The only mildly intelligent people in the town seems to be the Malcolm and Dreyfus. The two morons wasting ammunition on firing at a old car and drinking Whisky as well as the original idiot who tried to hide a gun deserved to be shot.\n\nThe only somewhat intelligent part was when the captured apes turned over a bus and took a bunch of their adversaries with them. The movie was indeed very predictable. The only thing that elevated the movie above the level of downright boring was the fact that half of the characters were apes and, luckily as I wrote, those special effects were very well done.\n\nThe blurb from Twentieth Century Fox states that \"...both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species.\". Well yes I guess that you cannot say that this is a downright lie but it is definitely a bunch of hyperbole to sell the movie. Come on, we are talking about a very limited group of apes, badly decimated as well, against the rest of the surviving humanity, which obviously have some modern facilities left and a war that is more or less just assumed will happen.\n\nA mildly entertaining movie but certainly not a great movie.",

            "content": "Yes it seems to be official, Gary Oldman is apparently in everything!. Much like the ALZ-113 virus he gets into everything and...errr kills it? no wait, analogy misfire here.\n\nFollowing on from the first reboot of this classic franchise with this new cracking title we now see the results of simian flu as its wipes out most of humanity across the globe. Only pockets of people who are naturally immune to the disease are left to try and rebuild whatever they can from their former existence as the dominant species on Earth. In the mean time Caesar and his ape companions have evolved further living in a big Ewok village just outside San Francisco, they don't want war but will fight if they have too.\n\nRight first things first...holy piles of elephant dung this movie looks good! and when I say good I mean sumptuous. The first shot is a close up of Caesar's glaring eyes as his pack stalk prey on the hunt. To say this image is haunting is an understatement, you'd think it was an actual person! in fact I don't even know if it was CGI! (probably was). This first sequence sets up the rest of the movie clearly showing you the effects have been pumped up vastly (they're on steroids) and we are now easily on terms with Kubrick's space odyssey. That's not to say director Reeves doesn't know this...oh he knows and he takes full advantage with some very familiar sound bites that hark back to the beginning of man in that little space flick. You can hear the same type of choir usage in the opening sequences and in the end with heavy orchestral beats hammering it home just in case you're a bit mutton. Yes its not exactly original or very subtle but it certainly sounds epic and works well. As the apes swing through the thick mist swept trees and foliage bearing down on their kill you can't help but be mightily impressed. The whole thing looks and sounds like something that should be from Arthur C. Clarke's seminal sci-fi novels if adapted now...its almost too good looking for this silly franchise.\n\nThis is not the only epic shot or sequence within the movie, the emotions expressed by Caesar and various other ape characters is pretty darn amazing. People are saying Serkis should get an Oscar for his performance but admittedly I really don't know where he ends and the CGI blokes take over. The general movement of the mammals is very very good but lets be honest here, there are many dancers and performers that could probably do that. What really impresses is the CGI work on the fur, wet fur especially and everyday movements  and emotions in the ape faces. There are times when you think you're watching a real chimpanzee it looks so good, Koba especially looks very realistic with his mottled skin. The large orangutan is another highly realistic looking creation as are the gorillas. Some chimp characters are more obvious than others strangely, mainly the lead characters like Blue Eyes don't look as good, the female apes aren't as good either, Caesar on the other hand looks the most human (I guess that makes sense). Is it me or does Caesar actually look like a bearded Charlton Heston in this flick??!\n\nNot only do the apes look good the locations and sets look tremendous too! The ruined San Francisco looked...real! it genuinely looked like they trashed the place for the movie. Its within Frisco that most of the big action takes place too and again I can't deny it looks very grown up and very real. This is most definitely not your average summer blockbuster affair for the scroats oh no, this is a proper science fiction tale with gritty visuals. Is there anything more terrifying than seeing a bigass rampaging crazy chimpanzee upon a charging horse wielding a big assault rifle?? Let me rephrase that, is there anything more terrifying than seeing a crazy bigass chimpanzee upon a charging horse wielding a big assault rifle...and it knows how to shoot the thing quite accurately!!! Especially when the chimp in question is Koba who lets be honest...is a scary looking motherfucker. Oh...where did they get all the horses??\n\nOn one hand the battle sequences are viscerally exciting and pretty brutal with lots of grand slow motion shots of certain apes looking both macho and intimidating. On the other hand I couldn't help but feel uneasy at the entire thing, here I am watching all kinds of apes getting blown to shit and mown down by automatic gun fire as if it were 'Saving Private Ryan'...but with apes. Should I be enjoying this? I felt sorry for the apes and didn't really enjoy watching them die like humans...I know how that sounds but animals are different to us in movies, don't like to see them killed. I guess feeling sorry for the apes was the idea as most had been forced and tricked into a grisly war. \n\nIt did make me chuckle a little bit at the start though, the humans in Frisco could of easily wiped out all the apes in a matter of minutes seeing as they were all tooled up, game over. The apes only had spears at the time, plus the main lead human character could of spoken to Caesar right there and then instead of encouraging trouble by disobeying the apes line in the sand ultimatum. Why didn't they ask the apes about the dam right at the start when they had the face-off, perfect time, instead he goes off later into their village pissing them off even more. I also must ask how many apes there actually were! I know in the first movie many escaped from the zoo and test facility but Jesus there are apparently hundreds upon hundreds of them! Most get killed in the Frisco siege yet there are still tonnes of em', a literal army of apes, did seem a bit implausible even with ten years of breeding.\n\nLets not get ahead of ourselves though, this isn't a cheap action flick with cheap moments of gun totting cheese...OK there are one or two moments of convenient cheese, but not much. On the whole this movie delivers in depth levels of powerful human qualities such as leadership diplomacy acceptance wisdom authority loyalty and honour...with CGI monkeys. The gamut of emotions we see Caesar dealing with against the humans from anger and spite, to realisation of his own kind and finally acceptance that his apes are not better than humans after all is incredibly poignant. Of course on the flip side we see all the negative aspects of the human race played out via Koba.\n\nIt does all seem very much like a science fiction movie...which it is, but when you look into ape (chimp) behaviour its actually quite an eye opener to see that they can be quite vicious to one another. Some of the facial expressions you see displayed by Koba are very accurate which is pretty daunting. I will admit I didn't totally enjoy the very end as it seemed too much of a weak acceptance by the apes for pending war, I'm sure the remaining humans could easily speak up for them seeing as what happened was only confined to a small area. I did enjoy the fact there weren't any cliched baddie human characters for once but unfortunately Reeves seemingly couldn't resist an over the top setting for the final battle.\n\nEnd of the day this does feel a bit like yet more filler or padding for the real focus of the franchise which is all out war between humans and apes. I do kinda feel they could of gotten to that point already instead of stretching it over two movies. But truth be told this is a rip-roaring science fiction adventure that not only betters the original by a good country mile, it also manages to be one of the best science fiction movies to come along for some time (yes its even better than all this comicbook fluff).",

            "content": "It's been four years since \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" director Matt Reeves last cinematic outing, \"Let Me In\" - an English-language remake of Swedish director Tomas Alfredson's vampiric coming-of-age film. While there will always be film aficionados who insist the original take of a film presents its truest form, I felt Reeves' reboot wrought a more kinetic, more universal telling of the tale and that Reeves had created an instant classic of the horror genre. My respect for \"Let Me In\" was immense.\n\nOver the decades, Reeves has paid his dues in Hollywood and his career has veered from comedy (\"The Pallbearer,\" an early and soon-to-be infrequent outing by \"Friends\" star David Schwimmer) to helming one of the first features to bring the now largely defunct \"shaky-cam\" (thank goodness) effect to big screen - his clever, if Dramamine-required, alien-invasion film \"Cloverfield.\" Capable of delivering both drama with sensitivity and visceral shock, Reeves seemed an excellent choice for this latest installment of the \"Planet of the Apes\" saga.\n\nUnfortunately the material he's been given to work with isn't of the same quality as Alfredson's wholly original horror concept or enough of a pure action-fest like \"Cloverfield\" to let one overlook the general mundanity of \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'\" story. How possibly mundane can a planet of talking apes be? Aside from the fact that these simians have now been performing their grunt-speak to audiences for over fifty years (Maurice Evans' buttery, upper-class mannerisms notwithstanding - what planet was he from?), that novelty remains fairly fresh.\n\nBut it's \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'\" screenplay that comes across as flimsy as Linda Harrison-as-Nova's\" deliciously hung rags. If one were to take away the apes as players (which would be a waste as they are miraculously rendered CGI creations), stripped of tooth and fang, \"Apes\" would be left with an all-too-human and all-too-cliched story.\n\nThe film revolves around the \"stop the madness\" efforts of a good-hearted human survivor of the simian-virus apocalypse and the now imperially seated Ceasar of 2012's \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\" These two suffer fools, villains and rebellious children as they toil haplessly to bring peace to opposite ends of an inter-species battlefield. The CGI action is exciting, but the behind-the-scenes powerplays of their shared struggle - however novel on the Darwin spectrum - feels too familiarly packaged.\n\nThe screenplay, credited to Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Sliver, makes the writers sound less like science fiction visionaries than a preachy team behind a Vietnam-era anti-war film. There's a decidedly \"retro\" feel to the futuristic war film, with the camouflage-clad ghosts of Audie Murphy and Dennis Hopper lingering somewhere just out of sight.\n\nThe story trudges along dredging up far too many plot points from Shakespearean-aspired royal dramas; I'd recite the litany of cliches but I don't want to spoiler-ize anyone's fun. Gary Olman, who once shone in the sun as a lean, English mad dog, now seems comfortably settled into playing roles of the flustered heavy (and I still think he applies the same touch to his American accent.) He's ostensibly the leader of one of the last tribes of humans, but his nervous fidgeting makes it difficult to believe he would be put in charge of much more than a AA meeting.\n\nThe cast of largely unknown actors doesn't help either. Though capable, they never bring any real fire to the screen, although lead Jason Clarke works tirelessly at his angst. Unfortunately, the human cast is frequently emotionally upstaged by computer-generated apes, that in itself a scary accomplishment which may, indeed, portend the fall of mankind.  Or at least the Actor Guild of America. On the other hand, I never know exactly what praise to lavish on human-marionette, actor Andy Serkis. Certainly dancing around in leotards glued with styrofoam balls for the roving eye of a computer to map can't be easy, but the question is how deep does one's Stanislavsky have to run?\n\nBut the film's real problem is its script, and its by-the-numbers roll call of devices. Without the apes, I imagine the plethora of well-intentioned, but tired war movie cliches would have \"Apes\" garnering far less praise than it is receiving. And those hokey-ending lines gravely spoken by the defeated peace-makers ... Where have I heard them before? \"I thought we had a chance,\" says Clarke. \"So did I, my friend...so did I,\" intones the moribund chimp. It's almost a pity that all the battling that has come before falls into a pile with those oh-so heavy lines, which ring as outdated as a throw-away bit of hippy schtick from \"Easy Rider.\"\n\nOf course, the action fans may not notice these overwrought grarnishes, as they have been rewarded earlier to a fiery finale of two foes battling it out, swinging on an exploding skyscraper, as the inevitable flames lick at their feet, er, paws. While \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" will certainly please the action crowd with the most technologically advanced simian set pieces yet, it's ultimately a pretty routine and not terribly clever affair. Invoking the film's catchphrase, \"Ape not kill Ape,\" I would proffer, \"Ape not make Sequel.\" Though I'm sure \"the heavies\" will triumph again, man.",

There is a smooth balance of drama, emotional content and terrific action sequences. There exists a archetypical villain, a righteous leader, the conflicted son, a flourishing and prosperous society and then there are the humans who are nearing extinction. The premise is ripe for conflict and promises an exciting conclusion.\n\nThe movie has high ambitions and this is made clear early onwards when it begins with a terrific hunting sequence of the apes and the introduction of Caesar, the protagonist Ape from the previous film. He has remained the leader and now commands a legion of Apes as his followers with whose help he has built a flourishing Ape society who are remarkable learned to read and write within a span of ten years. The setup is incredible for a film and yet so simple in execution with no exaggeration so as to make this seemingly impossible scenario less believable but instead it is totally acceptable to our logic. \n\nThe conflict arises when it comes in contact with a group of surviving humans, whose first action is to shoot an ape in presumed self-defense. The actors give a convincing performance but they are consisting of the stereotypical variety for a survival flick: the skeptic, the optimist, the pragmatist and then there are the rest of the expendable cast who are not given any significance and rightly so. The human and the ape leads are the emotional centre of the film when they explore the feelings of community, future, peace and most conspicuously trust, which is simultaneously in loads between the two protagonists but lacking between the rest of their kind.\n\nThe film contains special effects like the opening sequence involving a hunting scene, the standoff between the humans and the apes near the colony entrance, the final climatic duel and explosions all in a grand destructive aesthetic to create awe. The most important aspect of the film perhaps is the motion capture and how Apish and Human the CGI Apes feel - we empathize with them whole-heartedly while anticipating their evolution into the flawed human-like being that is their inevitable destiny. \n\nFor a reboot of a classic sci-fi franchise, this exceeds anyone's expectations and delivers a consistent balance between emotional overtones, intelligent narrative and destructive potential that many summer blockbusters all in lack holistically. There is definitely scope for another one with the same exciting caliber.",

We meet a group out of San Francisco, led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), a good and noble individual, and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), another good man who just wants his people to be safe, but is perhaps a little more willing to let the ends justify the means.\n\nFrom the film's opening close-up on Caesar's eyes to the final frames of the story, the apes are front and center, and WETA Digital has pushed performance into a whole new realm with the work they do here. It's one thing to pull off one or two characters like this, but to lean as heavily as they do here on the digital team to bring to life dozens of characters, and to have them all register as fully as they do here, is a remarkable accomplishment. Add to that the idea that so much of this was shot outside, on real locations, and you end up with something that destroys any boundaries in terms of what can or can't be done at this point.\n\nThe script by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Mark Bomback is about what violence does to communities, so while it is indeed an action film at times, and there are some thrillingly staged sequences that director Matt Reeves has imagined, I found myself actively rooting against any action in the film simply because I cared about all the characters enough that I didn't want to see any of them, human or ape, end up in harm's way, and it's obvious from early in the film that things are not going to end well. Once a human community, led by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) comes into contact with Caesar's apes, tragedy seems inevitable, and it's awful to watch it unfold.",

So this Is a sequel and an eighth movie. I expected that it would feel a bit stretching, but it isn't. In fact, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes' main purpose Is to show another side of these super apes and to set up the story for the next film in the franchise. \n\nThis isn't just about fighting; in fact, fighting scenes, even though they are epic, take very little part of the film. There is romance within humans and apes families, sometimes, the apes can act funny. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time! Also it has a story line no one expects! \n\nThe original Planet of the Apes book is about humans that went to a planet ruled by apes. When they come back to Earth, the same thing happened to our planet. The reboots, (Dawn of The Planet of The Apes and Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are pretty much prequels. So, Caesar leaves civilization with his ape friends while the human race almost goes extinct due to a deadly virus. The remaining humans struggle for power. Will they be able to find a new source of power or will it be up to the apes and their leader to decide the humans' fate?  \n\nFor me, this is a fantastic addition to the series. They don't try too hard to make it too action-packed and cool looking. The apes look extremely realistic and I really like that. They include some scenes from Rise of the Planet of the Apes which helps to pull it all together nicely. The action and fighting even has some stuff from the original 1963 Planet of the Apes book! The director made it a perfect length and, in fact, this is the first time I've seen what I would call a \"trailer\" movie (a movie that looks like an hour-long trailer for the next one in the series) that is entertaining and includes a surprise ending. \n\nMy favorite scene is when we see a small group of humans working on the power station. When they wake up, the youngest is sitting with an ape that acts as a teacher to young apes and is very loyal to Caesar. The kid gives him a book and reads along with him. It shows how well they actually understand each other and how alike humans and apes are. It shows friendship and how two creatures of different species can be friends. \nThis film has some violence and intensity so I recommend it for ages 12 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars for fantastic graphics, a well planned story, excellent cinematography and stupendous acting. \n\nReviewed by Gerry O. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

In addition, it was really touching when seeing Ceaser take the camcorder and watch his own video in the past, the one when he was taught to speak and learn vocabulary. (Oh my my! Tears fell down immediately!) It's rather sad that Coba betrayed Ceaser and killed his own 'people (apes)'.

            "content": "After the surprise hit reboot of the \"Planet of the Apes\", it is needless to say that expectations were high for the sequel. Did it deliver? Yes.....on every level. Andy Serkis leads the crew as ape Caeser, who attempts to prevent all-out war between humans and apes, while human Malcolm, portrayed by Jason Clarke, does the same on the other side. The CGI in this movie is the highlight, making everything look incredibly realistic. Rather than using just pure effects from a computer, the director has opted to use motion-capture with his actors to make everything look all the more realistic. For the main ape role, Andy Serkis, the king of motion-capture (tell me Gollum was not amazing), is the perfect choice and makes the movement and actions of his animal character look unbelievably real. It's not just Serkis though and new addition to the cast Toby Kebbell, who plays angry ape Koba, who has had a bad experience with humans unlike Caeser, rivals Serkis in how realistic the actions can be made to look. The use of motion-capture really adds to the film. When you see Koba riding a horse and jumping through fire, it looks like a real ape riding a horse and jumping thrgh fire. The humans fare just as well, being portrayed as equally sympathetic characters rather than people who just wish to kill the apes, as parallels are drawn between the humans and apes. Jason Clarke's Malcolm acts as the Caeser of the humans, wishing only to protect his family from the horrors of war while Gary Oldman's Dreyfus parallels Koba, wishing to eliminate the other side ultimately to protect his people and believing that apes are just animals. The tone of the movie is very dark and gritty, showing the difficulties of living in a post-apocalyptic world. One of the best examples of this is when Dreyfus charges a battered iPad and sees a picture of his dead family. You really empathise with the character here and realise that he is not just a villain, creating a strong emotional moment. The soundtrack is also excellent, adding to the dark atmosphere and amplifying the emotional as well as action-packed moments. One of the most interesting things the movie opts to do is have no speaking for the first 20 minutes or so of the film, giving a really interesting insight into the culture of the apes and how they live. My only gripe with the movie is how much the ending sets up part three and does not tell a full story. Don't get me wrong, I am very excited for the next one but it sets it up so obviously at the same time. In the end, however, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is still an excellent film with an amazing cast (especially Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell for their incredible motion-capture work) and amazing effects and atmosphere and makes extremely excited to see what the next installment in the franchise will bring.",

Also, this movie was able to substantially improve Caesar's character development. Thanks to the amazing performance by Andy Serkis, I was submerged in the world of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.

That peaceful time is broken when Caesar's and Malcolm's groups collide in the woods and it leaves an ape wounded by a gun shot. Even though Caesar and Malcom both want to keep the peace, a rising tide of anger and mistrust between members in both clans (humans- Dreyfus(Gary Oldman) and Apes- Koba(Toby Kebbell)) result in all-out war. Just with the beginning part of the movie you can see a relationship form between Malcom and Caesar even though they may clash with each other they ultimately want the same thing and that is to protect, build up, and enlighten their communities peacefully.\nIn the website on Plugged In it says \"Caesar repeatedly stresses that the only way to find a fulfilling and happy future is to turn from conflict and focus on building a family and a loving home-something he strives to do with his own mate and two little ones. That sentiment is reinforced when Caesar finds an old video of his deceased human friend Will who embraces him as a young ape and welcomes him into his home.\"\nDawn of Planet of the Apes is a great movie action packed movie especially if you want to see an Ape riding horseback. Also the film doesn't really tells us but you kind of see how in this setting how apes and men are similar down to their cores. So, in my opinion Planet of the Apes is a movie that everyone should go watch.",

The simian virus (which was only touched on in Rise) has killed most people in the world, and Caeser now has a small army of genetically evolved apes.

            "content": "A treat for the eyes, a story to compel and a main actor to mesmerize, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes has everything necessary to be one of the most intelligent and emotionally challenging summer blockbuster for years. In a rare exemption of the fact that sequels are less thrilling than original movies, the second installment further builds up on the moral issues raised by its predecessor and adds up a much engaging action to the story.\n\nTen years after the killer virus almost erased humanity from planet Earth, small groups of survivals are trying to re-build the human society, while apes are slowly evolving and building their own civilization. When both societies confront distrust and tension escalate within the masses. With two main characters from both species trying to build bridges between humans and apes, the story is a smart and challenging entertainment whose emotional complexity is stunning (given the fact that it is considered a summer blockbuster). \n\nHuge part of the emotional value of Matt Reeves' delivery is provided by the character of Ceaser, brilliantly played by Andy Serkis.  A leader, a husband and a father of civilization, he is no different than some great men part of the human history. Andy Serkis' ability to mesmerize with his facial performances, with his morally look of the eyes and his overall central presence on the screen are no surprise to those who remember him from Lord of The Rings. This time, however, he has to depict a leader, a leader that has a vision going beyond the understanding of ordinary people and apes. His terrific performance makes him almost human and compensates for the fact that his counter partner Jason Clarke is no match for James Franco's performances in the first movie.\n\nIn conclusion, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is a must see summer blockbuster. Not for its visual effects and action sequences, but for its story, emotional load and unforgettable performance by Andy Serkis. After this delivery and the first movie the bar for the third one coming in 2016 is raised almost to an impossible to reach level. We have to wait and to hope that it would be matched.",

            "content": "I didn't care much for \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\"  At the time when I saw it, I was definitely much snobbier about my movie taste but after revisiting it, I still could not quite bring myself to enjoy it all that much, but had a greater appreciation for it.  Origin stories aren't always the thing for me.  Sometimes I actually prefer a sequel, we already know all the characters, and the protagonist is already the fully formed character, we don't need to spend the first hour watching them become who they really are.\n \nIn \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" Caesar is already a highly intelligent ape, we don't need to spend the first half of the movie watching him become that, we can get right into the action.  I always have trouble with the premise of \"Planet of the Apes,\" I know there's lots of smart apes, but there's way more smart humans with weapons... just shoot the apes!  That's why the final scene of \"Rise\" doesn't work for me; watching apes take down a human army is absolutely insane to me... JUST SHOOT THEM, don't let them get near you, shoot them before they get there.  Done.  Movie over.  So because of all that, I did not expect to buy into whatever the plot of this new installment was, but I was delighted that instead of a world domination or takeover movie, they went with the classic \"Pilgrims & Indians\" plotline from movies like \"Pocahontas\" and \"Avatar.\"  The humans want peace with the Apes, so they send over some people to make peace and everything is working out just fine but due to some misunderstandings, the hot-headed generals decide to ignite war.  Classic plotline; it never gets old, people will always be drawn into a story like this because it teases you with peace and then frustrates you with the inevitable war that will happen near the end that could be avoided if there was better communication.\n \nI remember when \"Rise\" came out and everyone was screaming for Andy Serkis to get an Oscar nomination for his motion capture performance as Caesar, the leader of the apes and scoffed at the thought, but now I can't help but agree that if the pool of Best Actor candidates isn't so great this year, why not throw him in?  I'll tell you why not, the Academy would never tarnish their snobby name by nominating an animated monkey from a summer blockbuster for Best Actor (prove me wrong, Academy).  Caesar is infinitely more interesting and complex as a character now that he is grown up and acts as a cautious but never vengeful leader of the apes.  Sometimes his gruff slow-talk can get to you but that is honestly the only complaint I have about his performance.  He is commanding, respectable and when he stands on two legs with his chest puffed out, you know you would do whatever he asked of you unless you want your head torn clean off.\n \nThe humans are actually the characters that aren't given much to do.  Jason Clarke gets to be the main peacekeeper and delivers the best work possible but in a role like this, his potential is limited.  I believe we will see a great role akin to what he did in \"Zero Dark Thirty\" someday soon, because he has the chops, no doubt.  Keri Russell is great actress, so it's too bad that she really doesn't get to do anything more than just be the unit's pretty doctor and Clarke's love interest.\n \nI was worried about the Gary Oldman character going into this movie.  I know Oldman loves playing the villain, and wants to get back to doing that after playing good guys in the \"Dark Knight\" and \"Harry Potter\" films, but my worries were calmed upon meeting his character.  He is not the hot-headed general that just wants to kill the apes because he can, like Stephen Lang in \"Avatar,\" but rather a worried human leader who is backed into a corner when Apes come knocking on his door.  We probably get the most depth from Oldman's character, we learn about the pain brought upon him by the Apes' virus, how he lost his wife and children; there's a great moment where is able to look at old photos of them on an iPad when power is finally restored to the humans' refuge and he breaks down in tears.\n \nFor a big summer action movie, this works as a bit of a slow burn.  There really isn't a big action setpiece until the final act but there is so much tension throughout, that I did not really mind.  I was on the edge of my seat watching the political structure of the apes' society be tampered with.  And kudos to the animation designers on this movie, because the creature design is so distinct.  You never get confused about which ape you are looking at on the screen because they are all just unique enough to tell apart.\n \n\"Dawn\" really was the most surprisingly good movie of the year for me, at least so far.  The story is pretty worn and clich\u00e9 but it still worked fine and there are two characters that I haven't mentioned that also fall into that frustrating clich\u00e9 category as well but this movie really works and did a great job at expanding the world of this franchise.  I don't know if the next installment can top this one.  It really was a tight blockbuster.p",

Not a single character ever had a weapon jam or run out of ammo. No reloading whatsoever. I'm willing to buy the super-intelligent ape element of the story, but the way Hollywood presents guns in 9 movies out of 10 is downright idiotic.",

But in 2011, Rupert Wyatt made a film called Rise of The Planet of The Apes. I loved the film it was really well done , with a very hard hitting story about retaliation and freedom. Now in 2014 we've gotten the sequel , Dawn of The Planet of the Apes. Now with having new director Matt Reeves , I didn't know what to think because I loved the first film and what Rupert did with the apes. But when the movie came out of course I had to see it. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes out does Rise of The Planet Of The Apes by a long shot. Instead of telling a story of retaliation and freedom. This is more of the battle for survival. 10 years after of the events of Rise of the Apes. Most of the human race has been wiped out , and the apes have made there own civilization and are living in peace. Until one day a human named Malcom  (Jason Clarke) gets in the way of the apes and just wants there people to be in peace with the apes. This film , like I said is really well done. Andy Serkis gives one of the best visual performances i've seen ever since Gollum from Lord of the Rings , and he was Gollum. Caeser is one of the most well developed and one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in the movie. Daw of the Apes did what transformers should've done. It makes the apes the main characters , not the humans , you come here to see the apes and what there doing. Theres not a lot of action in this film but when the action goes down. It really goes down. (APES RIDING ON HORSES). The human cast is really good as well. Jason Clarke gives a great performance , as does Gary Oldman. But the real scene stealer is an ape named Koba , played by Toby Kebell. He was the villain of the movie , but he was a lot more than that. Just like Caeser he has his reason of why he hates humans. I am really glad to say that this is one of the best films i've seen this year. It's either this or X-men.",

Current events parallels abound--the war on terror, of course, and also Ferguson--but this is pretty timeless stuff (or at least 20th-century-and-beyond timeless). Distrust, othering, admirable but dangerous allegiances to tribes and families and races, need for resources, access to arms. Ideals are compromised by the compromising situation. It's powerful, potent, even profound stuff, and it's masterfully executed. An extraordinary script, moody direction, beautiful, appropriately overcast photography, a score from Michael Giachinno that feels like distant thunder rolling in. Seeing this level of moviemaking is rare. Seeing this kind of operatic ambition in a summer blockbuster is rarer. This is a movie that is deliberate and grand, explosive and atmospheric, political and personal, over-the-top and contemplative. It's an action movie that relies on character and ideas, that has the audacity to make its audience read subtitles while apes sign to each other. It's another amazing installment in what may be my favorite franchise--a compelling genre movie that is smarter and more socially conscious than probably almost anything we'll see during awards season.",

            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Review\n\tDawn of the Planet of the Apes is a sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes. This takes place years after Rise and by now Caesar and the rest of the apes have established a civilization. Humans are almost gone and the few humans left want access to a dam so that they can continue to have power. However, there are tensions between both the humans and the apes especially with Koba as he wants an all out war between the two species. \nPros: \n\tThis movie is visually stunning. The apes look like real apes and not just cgi. \n\tThe movie is well directed. There are scenes where there is really nothing going on but the person watching the movie can feel the intensity and it almost seems like you are in the movie. \n\tThe movie is not predictable like most movies. \n\tThe acting is great. \n\tOne does not have to watch Rise to understand this movie. Meaning that this movie can stand-alone. \n\tThe movie has a deeper message than just what you see. I see many historical references and I also see the concept of racism exist in this film. \nCons: \n\tIt takes a huge time jump from Rise and it would have been nice if it connected better with Rise and offered a bit more explanation of what happened after Rise especially with a few characters. This however does not lower my score at all as it feels very minor when I watched it. \nConclusion\n\tDawn of the Planet of the Apes is an extremely great movie, which was well acted, well directed, and well written. It is a must watch for all movie fans. I highly recommend watching this in theaters as the intensity just jumps, however I can see this also being a great experience on Blu-Ray as well. \nRating:\n5/5: Phenomenal",

            "content": "When 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' arrived in theaters three years ago, it was met with great critical and commercial success.  It was smart, had clever direction at the hands of relative newcomer Rupert Wyatt, and was exciting enough to appeal to the summer movie crowd.  A sequel was inevitable - as Hollywood just can't help but go the route of the sequel anymore.  However, when Wyatt decided not to return to the director's chair, attention turned to Matt Reeves (Let Me In), an up and coming director with some nerd credibility.  Anticipation built, and the first previews started showing up promising action galore.  But would this just be more of the same from the first one, rehashing themes with new characters?  Or would this be an epic follow-up on the level of some of the great sequels of our time?  \n\nTen years after the viral outbreak, Caesar (Andy Serkis, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey') has taken his serum-enhanced followers into the forests of northern California, where they have built a peaceful society.  When a remnant of humans shows up in their territory, calamity soon follows.  However, a human named Malcolm (Jason Clarke, 'White House Down') convinces Caesar to give them a chance to restore power to the survivors via a hydroelectric dam in the apes' territory.  Anxious to trust humans despite his kinds' mistreatment at their hands a decade earlier, Caesar allows it.  However, while power is being restored, a zealous ape named Koba (Toby Kebbell, 'The East') has plans of his own.  Soon a showdown between the apes and humans seems inevitable, even though Caesar and Malcolm both work to avoid it.   \n\nLet's just get this out in the open - there are some major plot holes with this flick.  The spoiler-free ones include the apes' ability to utilize firearms with precision with absolutely no background training (which fortunately didn't turn into an anti-gun tirade) and the ability to repair a hydroelectric dam that has been dormant for a decade in mere hours.  That's really the tip of the iceberg.  One could pontificate on the development of ape society, but it would be a circular argument that focuses too heavily on the serum from the first film and evolution of society.  Now, these aren't the odious plot holes that permeate flicks like 'Green Lantern' or even 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', but it's kind of disappointing given the amount of goodwill exhibited with the first flick (even though it had a few minor plot holes as well).  Plus, the marketing of the movie was kind of deceiving.  It presents this film as action packed, but this film is a slow burn and when the action finally heats up, it almost seems a little too late.  Necessary, but a bit frustrating.  \n\nWhile the first movie featured few memorable performances aside from James Franco, this film seemed to step up a little in that category.  Clarke, Keri Russell (August Rush), and Kodi Smitt-McPhee (ParaNorman) make for a fine human side to the story, but the multifaceted Gary Oldman (Lawless) is all but wasted here.  The real draw once again is the performance capture roles.  Serkis once again proves that a performance can be truly wonderful, even when an actor is never seen in the flesh on screen.  He commands the screen as Caesar once again, and Kebbell is decidedly vile as Koba.  Their movements were clearly well-studied, and the wizards at Weta Digital have once again made the apes so incredibly lifelike that their work deserves due credit.  Also, it's nice to see the care that has been taken with the cinematography in this film.  Cinematographer Michael Seresin (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) avoids the use of the shaky camera technique and really gives the film a great feel.  And composer Michael Giacchino (Star Trek Into Darkness) has crafted a score that is quite apposite in this film.  \n\nCritics and those who were able to see it early compared this film to 'The Empire Strikes Back'.  They were sorely mistaken.  While this film certainly has emotionality to it and really utilizes the slow burn effect, it never really feels like it has anything compelling to offer.  It never really ups the stakes, and almost feels more like merely a setup for part three.  Maybe having the third part will complete this part much the way 'The Bourne Ultimatum' completed the storyline of 'The Bourne Supremacy'.  But despite Reeves' confident direction, this film feels more like an achievement in special effects than an achievement in storytelling.  It's nice that they didn't take this in a truly clich\u00e9 direction the way many had feared, making Caesar a revolutionary type.  But it never seems to elevate him to more than a commanding presence with a heart for peace.  It'll be interesting to see where the series goes from here, but hopefully it's in a more crowd-pleasing direction.",

It is just a spectacle of brilliant SFX and motion capture, without any of the story or soul that made Rise such a delight. Disappointed that they would let the original director leave and bring this guy in for the 3rd in the series. I guess like the 1968 trilogy, Apes is doomed to have the first film standalone from substandard sequels. Criminal waste of Gary Oldman didn't help.... That said, the film received an ovation at the theatre I was in, so it probably struck a chord somewhere. Just didn't plumb the potential of the story they started in Rise...!",

This film was almost on the same level, except that it perhaps went slightly over the top in certain areas where action overwhelmed the proceedings a bit too excessively. Other than those specific moments I think that, if you can accept the science behind the apes' intelligence, you will highly enjoy the film at the cinema and, moreover, will probably want to watch it again when it comes out on DVD/Netflix/Amazon Instant.",

But after reading the views myself it is the second highest rated movie of the year, and after watching it, it deserves that title. But if you are over fifteen you would really enjoy this extraordinary, brilliant blockbuster which will grip you from start to finish. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is amazing CGI as well as brilliant acting and scenes so emotional you may even cry. Amazing.",

As a surviving human community exhausts their last fuel supply they seek an alternative source of power in the form of a dam, the two sides meet and are forced into war by the actions of a few loose cannons. It does not choose to answer any questions the audience may have about the missing 10 years, such as 'what happened to the astronauts?' because the answer is obvious, likewise, it does not choose to engage in complex subplots and does not diverge from it's core narrative which allows for better characterization.\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes is unique among blockbusters in that it has inner beauty. The apes are brought to life with awe-inspiring CGI, coupled with exceptional motion-capture and voice acting, the English language is clearly very difficult to reproduce with an ape's vocal chords, you can hear the stress and harshness of every word, signing is preferred by the apes which produces long absences in dialogue that contribute to the film's gritty and earthly tone. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does not compromise for action and visual effects; the film is superbly written and emotionally impacting. The movie acts more like a bridge for a sequel to document the evolution of a new \"Planet of the Apes\", but it successfully pulls you into their world and easily merits its own existence.",

            "content": "Boy, Andy Serkis has certainly carved out an interesting career for himself hasn't he? If you ask the general movie goer (who sees mostly big budget blockbuster films) and you ask them who Serkis is, they might actually know, but not use his actual name but rather just Gollum. Gollum being the role that brought Serkis fame throughout all of the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit films.\n\nNow the interesting thing about Serkis is that most of his motion capture roles are universally praised by both critics and fans alike. Many will even say that some of them are Oscar worthy even. However, the Oscar nomination never comes and we are left to recognize Serkis' talent on our own (which at the end of the day is probably more important). As you can probably tell by these first two paragraphs, I am a big fan of Mr. Serkis and he has delivered yet again in his second go as the mighty Ape leader, Caesar in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nThe film begins and ends with us staring into the cold and threatening eyes of Caesar, neither time can we differentiate those eyes from that of an ape or human. Serkis' use of his eyes are what makes his portrayal of Caesar as good as it is. He is able to express so much emotion through them and say exactly what his computerized ape-like body is thinking and we feel that. We are able to see the anger and frustration that Apes have with humans based on past experiences. We are also able to see Caesars' nagging sense that not all humans are bad also based on his past experiences being raised by a \"good man\" and the inner conflict he is wrestling with throughout the film over how to balance his loyalty and trust between both apes and humans.\n\nWhat are we to take from this film? Are we as humans not as developed and advanced as we think we are? We witness two intelligent species that claim the other is flawed and really a sub-species compared to themselves, but we watch as both sides make the same mistakes that will eventually lead to the potential downfall of either one. Perhaps we have not developed as a species much since we evolved from apes all of those years ago but the film also shows that we have that capability for progress. It also shows how capable we are for complete self-destruction based on our tendency to turn on each other in time of chaos. When conflict arises, we too often turn on one another so that we can survive instead of working with one another collectively to solve a problem. Now you think I'm gonna try solve that crisis? Please....I've got Breaking Bad to re-watch on the 'Flix.",

Thankfully, everyone involved was fully aware of that and delivered another smart blockbuster with a lot of vital commentary on the futility of war and violent conflicts. The film doesn't want you to pick a side too easily as hostility between the last remaining humans on Earth and the intelligent apes arise. There are decent and bad characters on both sides. This makes for an interesting ride, as the conflict spins more and more into chaos and there is little anyone can do against it, after a point of no return. Once again, the CGI is incredible, thanks to great motion capture acting and the accompanying special effects. Thankfully, the human actors are en par, especially Gary Oldman only takes two short scenes to make a strong point for being one of the best of his generation. The gloomy atmosphere, the great cinematography, it all adds up to an intelligent and pretty damn entertaining continuation of the story. If there is one complaint it would have to be that the ending is merely a cliffhanger for what's next in part three. But at least we all have something to look forward to.",

Taking place directly after Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the film sees the United States wiped out by the plague seen in the first film. The apes have formed their own colony in a forest, while only a few humans are still alive. A group of humans in California are attempting to bring power back to their community, which causes a few humans to unexpectedly encounter the apes.\n\nThis film is on the same level as the first: a well-developed film, though it is also a little better. Andy Serkis, the king of motion capture, returns as Caesar, who has now formed a colony of apes, where he acts as their leader. Serkis, as well as the other actors depicting apes, is fantastic. You actually believe that you are watching an actual ape. Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and Gary Oldman wonderfully support the film. Oldman's character is an interesting one, since he's neither a hero or a villain. He's simply fighting for something that he believes in, while he's trying to protect those he cares about: the surviving humans.\n\nMatt Reeves, who takes over from Rupert Wyatt, brings a different scope to the film, making it grittier and darker, which perfectly adds to the film's tone.\n\nThe film slowly weaves into the original Planet of the Apes, while it proves that summer films can still rely on interesting characters and a great story, not just stupid characters, repetitive computer generated effects and dumb story. Job well done.",

An uneasy truce is upended by Caesar's second in command, the scheming Kobo, who wants revenge for his perceived mistreatment and sets about tricking the humans into a violent conflict. The CGI is simply phenomenal and certain shots have a photo realistic quality unseen in many other films and with the legendary Andy Serkis (Caesar) and the impressive Toby Kebbell (Koba) at their performance capture best, the film balances a fine line of spectacular set pieces, proficient plotting and sombre storytelling. The humans play second fiddle but Jason Clarke is great as the \"good man\" Malcolm, whilst Gary Oldman is his usual gifted self as a paranoid and emotional military leader. From the private to the primate, \"Apes\" continues the hefty issues raised by its predecessor and the audience will continue to enjoy the profound topics that affect the planet. 8/10 Midlands Movies Mike",

Absolutely believable. This evolutionary leap makes the original look like a puppet show. There is brilliance in simplicity: how the apes communicate to each other through rudimentary sign language and their thought process.\nThe plot had Shakespearean themes: family conflict, loyalty, betrayal. All leading up to a climatic conclusion. I felt more sympathy for the apes than the humans. That's true cinematic magic. It raises the question of who's the real animal.\nDarwin was right when he said we are decedents from apes. Humans share 98% DNA with our hairy ancestors. I wished the film made a definitive proclamation of this scientific fact, but I suppose Hollywood didn't want to ruffle any feathers with its religious audience. The film is science fiction, after all.\nMonkey see. Monkey like.",

An emotionally heavy and truly moving film, Dawn is an absolute marvel of modern science fiction, building upon the strong and unmovable foundations Rise of the Planet of the Apes had left earlier. With a plethora of solid characters from both ends of the tale, an explosive sequence of events and a rather poetic script, Dawn raises the bar for the Planet of the Apes franchise and other big-budget philosophical productions of it's caliber. Dawn really is something that deserves appreciation; few films in our day can only dream of achieving what Dawn has. A film that truly touches it's audience with heartfelt passion and remorse for humanity, Dawn is the kind of film that films as an art form and the film industry needs in general.\r Both Rise and Dawn are thought provoking; films that challenge our perception of our very own species through another. However, Dawn triumphs more spectacularly in a way few films before it had done so; through unsolicited and unforced emotion and depth that makes Dawn a true modern science fiction classic, something that the original creators of Planet of the Apes would be very proud of.",

Smart and impeccably well crafted, this installment's first half is a little weak at times, but the second half is unmatched in recent times from war films. Honestly, this and its first installment have to be some of the best war films of this decade and up there for this century as a whole. Director Matt Reeves picks up where Rupert Wyatt left off with a beautifully poetic and stunningly crafted film about Caesar and the apes. Mirroring foreign politics on the brink of war in real life, all of those same problems and confusions are represented here with a deeply human and moving film the result. Neither side is good, neither side is bad. Instead, it is one big shade of gray with plenty of confusion on both sides. The cinematography and score are once more incredible. The special effects are fantastic and the fight choreography incredibly impressive. Many modern day blockbusters lack weight and an air of importance and \"epicness\". This one has it all in spades with a truly incredible film that packs a true emotional punch due to the trauma that can come from misunderstandings.

What\u2019s been delivered is another entertaining film; almost, but not quite the equal of its predecessor, with a decent story and characters, and special effects at the top of their game.\r An expedition of humans has ventured deep into ape territory with the intention of restarting a hydroelectric dam to restore power to the ruins of San Francisco. With a deep mistrust of humans at the very core of ape doctrine, the plan becomes a tense diplomatic mission as the humans and apes negotiate to avoid another brutal conflict and needless loss of life.\r Caesar is played by master of motion capture Andy Serkis and amazingly, the motion capture was largely filmed on location in the forests of Vancouver, the CGI seamlessly integrated with live action. As a character, Caesar is rare among apes in that he was raised by a human and can see the good in them.\r Our human hero is Malcolm (Jason Clarke), a survivalist and engineer, who is in charge of the expedition, but is not much of a leader. Neither is he a diplomat, but he is level headed enough to develop a relationship with Caesar, with whom they share a common goal which transcends the interspecies squabble \u2013 each has a family they would do anything to protect.\r The real leader of the humans is back in San Francisco: the militaristic but pragmatic Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who has already lost his family (he swipes through their pictures on a prominently placed iPad \u2013 in shops now!) and has little desire to understand or relate to the apes.\r The previous director Rupert Wyatt is replaced here by Matt Reeves, who gave us found footage monster movie Cloverfield, where the tantalising excitement of citywide destruction just off-screen was undermined by the idiotic decisions made by the protagonists. There are shades of this frustrating characterisation here with one member of Malcolm\u2019s team, Carver.\r He is nothing more than a catalyst; right from the opening scene, where he shoots first and thinks later, wounding Caesar\u2019s son Blue Eyes in the process, everything about him screams \u201cI\u2019m the **** who\u2019s constantly going to jeopardise this fragile diplomacy\u201d \u2013 which is barely saved from the brink of collapse more than once before the inevitable final showdown.\r Koba fills this role for the apes, but he is a stronger character and an established personal rival of Caesar, who tries to corrupt the younger apes, including Cesar\u2019s impressionable young son Blue Eyes.\r We also remember the dramatic \u201cNo!\u201d \u2013 The first words spoken by an ape in both Conquest and Rise, when Caesar flexes his vocal chords to deliver an ultimatum to the humans, but the apes here tend to converse in sign language amongst themselves. Perhaps they see spoken language as a hallmark of humanity, but they prefer to save their English skills to dramatically intimidate humans, reminding them that they share a level of intelligence which apes may even have surpassed with their sense of community. While the apes have built a new society from the ground up, the surviving humans continue to scavenge in the ruins of their decaying civilisation, relying on old technology.\r There\u2019s a great scene about halfway through the film. Power is restored to an old petrol station in the woods, and as it flickers into life a song plays from a stereo: The Weight by The Band, a song which is both religious allegory and an exploration of the music which flows from the American South. Its thematic relevance extends to include references to Judgement Day and the American civil rights movement.\r Hearing recorded music and seeing artificial light, symbolic of humanity\u2019s legacy, offers a spot of hope, which is inevitably undercut by the melancholy of the world lost and the inevitability of an impending finale, which I\u2019m going to talk about now, so stop reading to avoid spoilers. Hey, I\u2019ve already told you that they managed to get the power back on so Gary Oldman can charge his iPad.\r The audience wants a fight, we\u2019ve paid to see apes with machine guns, and a fight is what we get, courtesy of the hot headed Koba and unrelenting Dreyfus. Lamentably although hell inevitably breaks loose, credibility is stretched. The previously pacifist apes are far too good at using the machine guns they have only recently stolen from the humans.\r We know the apes have both intelligence and physical strength on their side, but it\u2019s hard to explain hold their own so well against the trained human guards. Ultimately, they overwhelm the humans with sheer numbers, when they might have concocted a strategic assault using some kind of unique and established ape advantage, such as their non verbal communication, or climbing ability.",

The thematic foundations that were laid in \"Rise\" are built upon here and then some. What that film started to explore - human nature and animal instinct and how frighteningly closely those two things intersect - is looked at more in-depth and given a heightened sense of urgency in Dawn of the Planet of the Ape's post-apocalyptic context.

This is a franchise still alive, kicking and thumping its chest.",

It chronicles the relationship between the human survivors and a group of genetically modified apes led by Caesar. Through the evolution of the narrative events occur that leave the human survivors and the apes on the brink of war.\r The cast includes Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, and the wonderful returning Andy Serkis as Caesar. The acting is in all regard good, but where it truly shines is in the scenes where Clarke's character is interacting with Caesar. The chemistry between the two leads is compelling, thrilling, and aw inspiring. Particularly due to Andy Serkin's phenomenal video capture work. Gary Oldman is also fantastic, (per usual) and no actor's presence seems to detract from the film.\r Director Matt Reeves is one of the undeniable factors that makes 'Dawn' so great. Reeves direction is smart, intuitive, and filled with dozens of engaging shots. Reeves hits the mark with almost every frame and this greatly affects the overall intensity and emotion of the film. The screenplay is also admirable for creating memorable dialogue even if some of it fells like exposition.\r 'Dawn' also exceeds in exhibiting interesting social commentary throughout. The film presents themes of racial tension in intellectual ways and this is greatly appreciated due to the much-needed depth it adds. These social messages help to create a great deal social relevancy propelling the film past just great Si-Fi.\r Dawn of the Planet of the Apes improves over its predecessor in almost every way.

Caesar(played by Andy Serkis) returns as the ape leader in an even better performance than the original with the support of his returning ape friends Maurice and Koba. Caesar now has a family, including his rebellious son Blue Eyes, his wife, and newborn son. Caesar\u2019s companion, Will Rodman(played by James Franco) has died, which introduces the new cast. Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, Gary Oldman, and many more amazing new characters that are trying to survive in the rundown city of San Francisco. The Apes are growing in numbers and strength, while the majority of humans are either dead from the simian flu or each other. Caesar is now in charge of the apes and only wants what\u2019s best for his kind, but Koba, Caesar\u2019s right hand man, has other ideas. When the humans and apes try to work together Koba ruins every chance for peace through violence. A war between apes and humans is inevitable and nothing can stop what is to come, not even Caesar.\rThis movie hits in all the right places. The visuals are astounding. The contrast from the lush green forests and the dilapidated San Francisco makes for a great setting, and the way it\u2019s filmed cannot be understated. The way in which the intense battle sequences are filmed, set this movie apart from every other action blockbuster. In one sequence the camera is rotated an entire 360 degrees revealing the destruction of humans and apes at war, which makes for the most dramatic scene in the entire movie. The CGI integration is seamless, especially when so many apes appear at once alongside humans. The loss of James Franco doesn\u2019t even phase this cast, every character has a purpose and it shows on-screen. The beautiful script is heard not only with the human cast, but the apes too. They speak less, but do when necessary, and it is breathtaking just as it was in the first film.\rDawn of the Planet of the Apes surpasses it\u2019s predecessor, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, in every way. The characters, the cinematography, and plot are all impressively intriguing. This is the best blockbuster of the year, and great fun for the entire family. The only downfall is that this movie isn\u2019t an IMAX 3D Experience.",

James Franco and millions of other people are dead, victims of a lethal virus and the usual apocalypse-causing disease of hubris. After a period of violence and chaos, the survivors have cobbled together a reasonably stable society in the ruins of San Francisco, with Gary Oldman in charge.\r But this is not \u201cDusk of the Planet of the Humans.\u201d The spectacle of yet another desperate population, huddled together in the wake of catastrophe to await the next zombie, alien, robot or monster attack, would be unlikely to inspire much excitement. The real interest lies across the battered Golden Gate Bridge, in Marin County, where our evolutionary cousins, under the benevolent guidance of an upright-walking chimpanzee named Caesar, have built their own civilization. In contrast to the bedraggled human colony, the ape encampment is a thriving city-state with distinctive wooden architecture, domesticated horses, a sophisticated (mostly signed) language and an educational system overseen by Maurice, the gentle, copper-furred orangutan who gave the first movie an extra fillip of soul.\r The sylvan, simian Athens in the Muir Woods is a remarkable achievement and an important part of what makes \u201cDawn of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d directed by Matt Reeves from a script by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback, the best of this summer\u2019s large-scale, big-studio franchise movies. Granted, this isn\u2019t a very high bar to clear: \u201cbetter than \u2018Transformers 4\u2019 \u201d barely counts as praise, even with an exclamation mark. But unlike that toy-smashing extravaganza \u2014 and unlike 2014\u2019s visitations from the \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d \u201cX-Men\u201d and \u201cGodzilla\u201d money trains \u2014 \u201cDawn\u201d is more than a bunch of occasionally thrilling action sequences, emotional gut punches and throwaway jokes arranged in predictable sequence. It is technically impressive and viscerally exciting, for sure, but it also gives you a lot to think, and even to care, about.\r Starting with the apes themselves. In the final credits, Andy Serkis receives top billing for his performance as Caesar, a role that continues to redefine screen acting in the digital age. His facial expressions and body language are so evocatively and precisely rendered that it is impossible to say where his art ends and the exquisite artifice of Weta Digital, the special-effects company, begins. The same is true of the other main ape performers: Karin Konoval (Maurice); Nick Thurston (Caesar\u2019s son Blue Eyes); Judy Greer (Caesar\u2019s wife, Cornelia); and especially Toby Kebbell as Koba, Caesar\u2019s lieutenant and eventual nemesis.\r Koba, a survivor of scientific experiments, bears the physical and moral scars of human cruelty. When the apes encounter a scouting party from the city (led by Jason Clarke and Keri Russell), Koba is quick to sound the alarm. The humans, about to run out of fuel, want to restore an abandoned hydroelectric station in ape territory, and they ask Caesar for help. Koba warns that people are a violent, duplicitous, predatory species that should be fought if it can\u2019t be avoided.\r Caesar, who saw the generous, tender side of humanity when he was hanging out with Mr. Franco and Freida Pinto, is willing to give our kind the benefit of the doubt. There is plenty of evidence \u2014 both in the movie and beyond it \u2014 to support Koba\u2019s view, but the film comes down squarely, and maybe a little too squishily, on the side of tolerance and cooperation. The ape and human societies are parallel primitive patriarchies (women nurture and worry, while men lead and fight, a disappointing but hardly surprising failure of imagination on the filmmakers\u2019 part), and they are threatened by symmetrical schisms. As Koba opposes Caesar, so does Malcolm (Mr. Clarke\u2019s character) find himself increasingly at odds with Dreyfus (Mr. Oldman), who sees the apes as a mortal threat to be confronted with maximum brutality.\r And while \u201cRise\u201d found room for exuberance in the shadow of catastrophe \u2014 partly because it seemed so justifiably excited by its own ingenuity \u2014 \u201cDawn,\u201d its title notwithstanding, paints a darker, scarier picture of the future. It also has a grave, brooding beauty, intensified by Michael Giacchino\u2019s wild and subtle score and by the deep, verdant shadows of Michael Seresin\u2019s cinematography. Mr. Reeves has a fine sense of visual detail and also of the eloquence of nonverbal exchanges between characters, digitally enhanced and otherwise. (Ms. Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee, as her adolescent son, do especially graceful work in limited roles.) The film is full of small, memorable moments and crowded with distinctive personalities on both sides of the ape-human divide.",

Now humans are a minority, a race facing extinction (what an irony!) that apes seem to be able to seriously threaten. The contact between them reminded me of the difficult and dangerous understanding between different communities when distrust prevails. We can imagine something similar in moments of our past, like the first contact between European navigators and indigenous peoples of the Americas, for example. Distrust, fear, displays of power to intimidation... the film shows these in a very interesting way, with the apes being very similar to us, in behavior and way of think. Unfortunately, the whole film is quite pretentious and full of self-importance: both sides have an exaggerated awareness of the relevance of events to their own community. This is the most boring point of the movie. The actors do a good job, but non-human characters get more interest and dominate the scene. Technically, the film doesn't deserve major criticism.

It's a gorgeous-looking movie and nearly everything about it works.It takes a while for the story to really get going, just as it was with Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the previous film. But once the action starts, the cinematography really starts to shine. The action sequences are some of the best I've seen in a long time. The vibrant colors bring out incredible detail and the camera follows everything perfectly. Once again, Andy Serkis is magnificent as Caesar. Really, all of the motion capture imagery is just beyond stunning. There's so much behind the facial expressions and mannerisms of the apes: brotherhood, pain, etc. It's incredible how much emotion is evoked in the actors' performances when they hardly even speak!The script does a wonderful job at developing the apes as characters, but Dawn suffers from the same problem that Rise had: clich\u00e9d and underdeveloped human characters. Gary Oldman makes the most of his smaller supporting role, but the rest of the human characters behave in ways that are quite illogical that make it difficult to really care about them or understand them. Some of the human characters don't even do enough to justify their large presence in the film.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes mostly overcomes what flaws it has with an intelligent story, engaging political drama, and beautiful, smooth direction.

You get so used to the apes, that you forget that they are created with special effects. That is the mark of truly fantastic work and you can't help but be impressed. In films like this, it is easy for the human actors to fall to the wayside, but that does not happen here .. at least not with the leads. Jason Clarke's Malcolm believably connects with Caesar and forms a bond that I feared would not be achievable. It's a shame that Serkis won't get award consideration due to being a motion capture actor. He deserves it. The battles were intense and the film does a great job causing you to wonder if your favorite characters will live or die. Lastly, the film is very poignant and provides excellent social commentary without cramming it down your throat. A worthy successor, which is hard to come by these days.\r The Bad: I gotta admit it ... scenes of monkeys, riding horses, wielding machine guns, and leaping through fire were among the more ridiculous scenes that I have ever seen. They were during some very serious moments, and I couldn't help but laugh at them. Some of the supporting cast was pretty cliche and forgettable. They also weren't well characterized and I didn't even see what happened to a few of them.",

Thankfully, everyone involved was fully aware of that and delivered another smart blockbuster with a lot of vital commentary on the futility of war and violent conflicts. The film doesn't want you to pick a side too easily as hostility between the last remaining humans on Earth and the intelligent apes arise. There are decent and bad characters on both sides. This makes for an interesting ride, as the conflict spins more and more into chaos and there is little anyone can do against it, after a point of no return. Once again, the CGI is incredible, thanks to great motion capture acting and the accompanying special effects. Thankfully, the human actors are en par, especially Gary Oldman only takes two short scenes to make a strong point for being one of the best of his generation. The gloomy atmosphere, the great cinematography, it all adds up to an intelligent and pretty damn entertaining continuation of the story. If there is one complaint it would have to be that the ending is merely a cliffhanger for what's next in part three. But at least we all have something to look forward to.",

It\u2019s a little too long and generates more cloying sentimentality than genuine emotion. Still it has enough action in a sturdy enough plot to keep the audience quiet. This was the first time CGI really annoyed me (has it reached its limits?) since the swarming apes, always shot from above, looked like swarming ants with identical ape decals pasted over them. On the other hand, digital makeup has improved enormously, or Andy Serkis is simply a genius at acting under these conditions. In the end, I couldn\u2019t decide if the pessimistic philosophy that war is inevitable and neither humans nor movie apes will improve (exemplified by the selfish \u201capes\u201d who must go out for popcorn refills in the middle of a movie in a packed theater) or whether this philosophy was just a cynical excuse for another sequel.",

Much of the novel factor of Planet of the Ape franchise is how believably humane the apes can be, it's also a measure bar as comparing the movies of this franchise in order serves as prove of technology advancement. Andy Serkis has perfected a masterful interpretation of the ape-human mime hybrid. It's not an overstatement that the apes fare better and more convincing than the human counterpart.\r Visual is splendid and aesthetically pleasing. It's not as extravagant as other blockbusters in recent time, but the art direction offers a unique appeal. Different than most grayish dire post-apocalypse setting, the movie turns to a more organic setting, a lustful return-to-nature background while some of civilization remains still stand tattered. Glossy urban areas have now coated with rustic flavor while the apes territory is leaning towards early civilization settlement. One is deteriorating while the other contrastingly and gradually improves.\r The movie has one of the best uses of motion capture lately. Apes moves with fluid almost humanized motion even though some of the hunchback traits still persist. It's interesting to see such varied range of emotion that can be conveyed by the apes' while most of them only communicate with body language. Action sequences are well done; a couple of scenes are shot in very interesting point of view or continuous shot. It's a little heavier on action than the prequel.\r However, the humans aren't nearly as intriguing. Jason Clarke as Malcolm, the engineer and leader figure does a decent job, but he's eclipsed by Andy Serkis' Caesar. He's not really an engaging lead role as James Franco was, and it's a bit underwhelming when the movie tries to compare the two together. Gary Oldman as Dreyfus works with what he has. Being a man with practically a thousand faces, he can pull off any role, but here his character is rather unexceptional.\r The plot is a bit overused though; those who have seen Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas or Avatar will find little surprise. Granted, there's only so much this \"two civilizations\" premise could go and the movie does go for more mature outlook, but a lot of the scenes foreshadow any twist the movie could've had, even more so for those knowledgeable of the franchise. In the end Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does any movie strive to, it immerses the audience and makes them invest in the character's struggle. With the pace it's going the apes are here to stay.",

The visuals were FANTASTIC, the characters were well realized, especially the apes, and the story is for the most part unpredictable and takes some not so heavy twists and turns that still present a strong effect on the movie itself. There are really no plain and simple, black and white characters. As for the main characters (Caesar, Koba, Malcom and his family, even Dreyfus) present such three dimensional characters. Even for the supporting characters, they don't fully present three dimensional characters, but more of representations of different themes of characters that were used to see in movies. For example, you have a character that despises Apes for everything that's happened to the world when really he's afraid of this new world. Essentially, all the characters serve a purposeful role, three dimensional or not. In the end, it's a beautifully dark and exciting installment filled with beautiful cinematography, set pieces and fascinating characters (mainly Caesar and Koba).

The plot created by Matt Reeves and co. is action packed, smart, emotional, and, in general, beautiful (for the lack of a better word). However, the apes were the stars of the show. Caesar, Maurice, Blue Eyes, and especially Koba were all great and each took on significant roles in the film. Lastly, the CGI.

With the few exceptions of Transformers, Divergent, and AMWTDITW, this year has been quite a success. To me it a more successful year than last year.\r This movie takes place years after the Rise of the Planet of the Apes and is ten times better. Of course the \"end of the world fanboy\" in me was getting all hyped up for this movie and it didn't disappoint. Everything in the movie was pretty good, expect for the CGI at parts, but luckily CGI doesn't make a movie bad or good. Thoug at some parts the CGI was one of the best I've ever seen. The story is what got me hooked though. It really tells the tale of the struggles of a virus that almost wipes out the human race. The movie starts of slow, but it's mainly building up tension that builds joe between three groups. One ceaser is (spoiler) shot by Koba, all help breaks loose. The story is not totally comeplex and is quite a rehash, but they execute it perfectly. The acting is also fantastic by the lead human and it really shows the terrifying natur of the apes. Overall the movie is defiently worth seeing in theaters. 9.3",

But I didn't find the story as interesting as in 'Rise...' because now the main developments have played out in the earlier film (where it was super interesting to see how apes could plausibly become super-intelligent and escape captivity), and the story left to 'Dawn...' is how things escalate from there. Which is pretty easy to imagine. Some humans and some intelligent apes have a conflict and it escalates. No matter how much action and drama you push along with such a story, it's limited in its potential. I had fun interpreting it as a metaphor for the Iraq oil invasion though.

I found amazing CGI and amazing new storyline.\" THAT's WHAT WE NEED FROM SEQUEL QUALITY!!!!\r As I said before, if you guys think this movie lack of something, it must be the thrilling of human being chased by the monkeys, right? My favorite part was the building hide and seek, but as I said before, too short scene. If there still flu victims who still struggle to be alive, I bet this movie could get 10 points from me. But, those my wild-mind plot got paid by Gary Oldman heart-breaking crying scene. :'\"((((\r GIVE GARY OLDMAN AN OSCAR!!!!",

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not only a fantastic movie filled with great action and emotion. It's also responsible for giving us a powerful sci-fi character to go side by side with the greatest in history like Darth Vader and Spock. That character is Caesar, who was already great in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, however in this movie we see his new phase in the evolution. We get to see what is in my opinion the most compelling character in a sci-fi int he past decade develop himself as a leader.\r On top of that, we also get Koba, another fantastic ape that you're bound to keep in your mind for years to come.\r Finally, I was super happy and surprise with how solid the human side of the story is. The movie never forgets that is about the apes, but it still manages to give us an interesting and well developed human story on the side.\r Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is FANTASTIC.",

So I looked up theSaw it last night...\r I loved 'Rise' but despite its great reviews, I left 'Dawn' feeling a little hollow.\r While this movie is set in the same world as 'Rise', I personally did not see much of that movie in this one. So I looked up the credits, and to my surprise, noticed the writing and production are being handled by the same people in both movies... with the exception of Mark Bomback, who has been added as both writer and producer.\r The most prestigious names in Mark Bomback's writing resume are Live Free Or Die Hard (2007), and the Total Recall (2012) reboot. As for his producing resume, I'll spare you (it's worse).\r 6 different production companies were involved with 'Rise'. Only one \u2013 Chernin Entertainment \u2013 is listed for 'Dawn'. While one would expect the latter to tell a more focused and enjoyable film, it's actually 'Rise' that felt more fleshed-out and cohesive. That first movie was an unexpected hit. It pleasantly surprised everyone by being a cut above the generic fare that Hollywood has been giving us since the 90's ended. The writing, the directing, the photography... it felt like a lot of very talented people got together and really, really tried for that one. I did not get the same sense here.\r Could the addition of writer and Executive Producer Mark Bomback have negatively impacted the end product that much? I'm not sure. I wasn't there. And it's not like 'Dawn' is a *bad* movie. There's a lot about it I enjoyed (beginning with Caesar's facial expressions) but as with movies like Maleficent, Oblivion, Noah, Immortals, 300 Rise of an Empire, etc. there's nothing technically wrong with this movie. I enjoyed them all on different levels. But there's nothing there I'm likely to purchase a physical copy of anytime soon.\r It seems Hollywood never intended to launch a new Apes trilogy. They had a wonderful idea to create a prequel, and it worked. We could have very easily transitioned from 'Rise' to either of Heston's or Wahlberg's Planet Of The Apes movies. But it became a commercial hit, so we have to squeeze 2 new chapters in there before the Apes truly take over.\r That's how this felt. Milk this cow dry for another 2 chapters, and then what? We'll have caught up to the timeline where the Apes rule the world. Will they leave well enough alone? Of course not. They'll probably film an entirely new trilogy set in that world, effectively rebooting the entire thing.\r Though I wouldn't call 'Dawn' a bad movie, I fear we are currently witnessing the Transformers-ification of the Planet Of The Apes franchise. So enjoy this one while you can, because something tells me these will become increasingly soulless with every chapter.\r Just like a certain other franchise.",
