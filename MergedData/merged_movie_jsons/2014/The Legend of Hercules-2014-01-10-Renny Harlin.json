            "content": "Step aside, Kevin Sorbo, we have a new man for the role of Hercules and his name is Kellan Lutz. If you have no idea who Mr Lutz is, check out his appearances in the Twilight instalments.Anyway back to The Legend of Hercules. As the title suggests, this is an origin story that sets up the demigod character. Despised by his father King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) since the day he was born, Hercules - the son of Zeus and Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) - is sent to war after failing to elope with his true love, Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss). King Amphitryon favors his elder son, Iphicles (Liam Garrigan); unfortunately he is not warrior material let alone lead a kingdom and winning the heart of Princess Hebe. As fate would have it, Hercules survived the war and returns to reclaim his love and kingdom from the wrath of King Amphitryon. The poster reads From the director of Cliffhanger and Die Hard 2 - it's unfortunate they forgot to add in the fact that both were movies from more than twenty years ago, and Renny Harlin's directing career has long been sunk by a certain Cutthroat Island. Let's face it; The Legend of Hercules isn't going to resurrect Harlin's status in Hollywood anytime soon. While similarly themed movies such as 300, Immortals and Clash of the Titans are known more for their visual aesthetics than storytelling, The Legend of Hercules failed miserably on both accounts. Filmed entirely in Eastern Europe because of cheaper costs and taxes, Harlin's movie mimics the feel and look of its predecessors while pretending to strip down to the grittiness of that era. However every single set piece looks like a cheap knock-off, right down to the CG extensions - case in point, one seriously fake looking puppeteer lion looks even worse than that in cable series Spartacus and Rome.Written by at least four credited writers (one of them from the terrible Conan the Barbarian remake and Harlin himself), it is such a shame that the supposedly mythology-inspired story instead resembles Ridley Scott's Gladiator more than anything - if you recall, Maximus, was also betrayed and sold to slavery but made a comeback for revenge. We didn't realize that the legendary Greek hero Hercules actually ventures on the same path until now.Unimaginative plotting aside, the movie suffers from incredible clunky, modernized dialogue peppered with a variety of British and American accents and awful delivery from the actors. With the exception of McKee and Adkins (surprisingly turning in a solid performance), most of the cast members - especially Lutz - needs to sign up for advanced acting classes. Minus off all the disemboweling, limb and head severing and bloodshed you normally would have expect from such a theme (an obvious attempt to lure in younger audiences), The Legend of Hercules quickly dissolves into a predictable yawn fest.It's a tad disappointing that a movie about a demigod with incredible strength fares without emotion and plays like generally a mere paint-by- number adventure. Comparing to the 1997 animated feature by Disney, this one is hardly worth the time.",

            "content": "Not the worst of anything to do with the Hercules legend, there are a few obscure low budget animated adaptations (not feature length) that are marginally worse. When it comes to feature length films, it would be very difficult to think of a worse depiction of Hercules than 'The Legend of Hercules'.The sole saving grace is Liam McIntyre. He is the only actor who tries and the only one to feel right for his character and within the tone of the story. However the rest of the acting was just diabolical. Kellan Lutz has to be one of the most charisma-free and can't-act-his-way-out-a-paper-bag actors working today, he brings none of the heroism and conflict of this great charismatic hero and spends all his screen time looking blank and wooden and uttering his admittedly terrible lines with the flattest and most awkward line delivery imaginable.Can't say anything better about the ladies either, who also show their acting limitations, especially the portrayal of Hebe who is in dire need of an acting coach. The obligatory villain acting is so pantomimic and overdone that one's surprised at how there was any scenery left from all the chewing, and it is so cartoonish that it veers on at times unintentionally comical rather than menacing.Blame cannot be entirely laid at their door though. 'The Legend of Hercules' is very incompetently directed by a director that in the film's worst parts even makes Uwe Ball look good. Even worse is the script, which is extremely flabby and heavy in banality and melodrama. The characters are genre stereotypes basically and have the development of a thin piece of cardboard. The story, what there is of it (for the running time this is often wafer-thin and threadbare storytelling) rushes from one scene and plot point to another, and jumps around constantly that following what's going on is not always easy. But because the writing and characterisation has so little to them and that thrills, emotional engagement and such are next to none the film feels interminably dull and lifeless often.Some bad fantasy-action-adventure films have the credit of looking good. That cannot be said at all for 'The Legend of Hercules' that looks like direct to video fodder from SyFy or The Asylum. The photography is unfocused and editing choppy, with an irritating over-reliance of slow motion and impregnated pauses that come over often as gimmicky, excessive and unnecessary. The sets and costumes look recycled, and to say that the special effects are dodgy is not just an understatement but actually pretty insulting, some of the worst effects of any film seen in recent years.What little there is of the action is at best uninspired choreographically, an eyesore visually and in terms of peril they're somewhat tame. The music score is lifeless and forgettable, very generic genre scoring actually. The 50s and 60s Hercules films may have been cheap and cheesy, but at least they knew what their goals were, who they were aiming at and what tone to take. 'The Legend of Hercules' fails at all three of those things, often it was difficult to work out what it was trying to be or what tone it was aiming for as it tries to be light-hearted fun and also take it seriously and fails abysmally at both.To summarise, very bad film. How it made it to theatres/cinemas and not straight to DVD is honestly a complete enigma to me, and this is coming from a very subjective person when expressing opinions. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying I am a huge fantasy fan. I can usually enjoy any swords and sorcery type film and find something good about it. Now let me say Wow this movie was bad. I mean I thought this kind of clumsy, lowest common denominator filmmaking died in the 80's. It is bad when I asked the organizer to give me a refund on a free prescreening.Where to begin? I don't expect much in this type of movie in terms of plot or characterization. In action \"porn\" like this, the plot is usually just barely coherent enough to move from one action sequence to the next and the characters are as black and white as a chessboard. This movie somehow delivers LESS than that.It is staggering to me that with a mythology as rich and engaging to draw from, they choose a tired rehashing of Gladiator as the main focus of the film. No doubt holding the more interesting material back for future sequels. The laughable love story is unengaging, poorly scripted and given far too much screen time.What really disappoints is the action sequences. Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this. It wastes a good deal of time with a clumsy mix of fighting scenes in which Hercules is repeatedly captured and/or defeated. WTF? It is only towards the end that an attempt is made to show Hercules as he should be seen, but I had tuned out long before then. Oddly enough, the blood and gore in this film is kept to a minimum, probably to keep it at PG-13 in hopes of duping the largest possible audience to drop money on it. It would have really benefited from a Conan-esque level of violence to give the movie more weight and better directed action sequences. The dramatic pause in the middle of the action (made famous in the movie 300) is in every single action sequence. I really don't know what I recommend from this film. Everything in the movie has been done better in other films. I hope this film tanks but I doubt it. It will make a profit and encourage more of the same I'm sure.",

And I gotta say, after seeing this movie, I'm really looking forward to the Brett Ratner version, and that's saying something. Where do I begin? The acting is hilariously awful (Kellan Lutz and the villains especially). The romance is laughable. The fight scenes are a total rip off of 300 and Gladiator, with obnoxious slow-mo being used every 10 seconds. And for a movie with a budget of $70 million, it looks cheap.The Legend of Hercules has some of the worst production values I've ever seen in a film. The costumes look noticeably cheap, The props are low rent, The green screen effects are amateurish. The 3D conversion is even worse. And the CGI looks worse than an Asylum movie.Final Verdict: Unless you're watching for a cheap laugh, you should avoid this stinker like the plague.",

            "review_title": "An Early Contender For Worst Movie Of The Year!",
            "content": "The Legend of Hercules is a film directed by Renny Harlin, and stars Kellan Lutz, Scott Adkins and Gaia Weiss, and revolves around the character of Hercules, son of Zeus, who was born solely to end the life of the King of his people, and unite the lands in peace, or something like that. I didn't pay too much attention, to be honest! This movie is horrible. It's clich\u00e9d to pieces, poorly directed, horribly acted and disastrously written. All the dialogue feels so god damned forced, and makes it incredibly difficult to latch onto any of the characters. Whenever they speak... It's like someone saw Spartacus or Game of Thrones and went \"Well, now I certainly know how people of that era spoke!\" and wrote a screenplay, full of fancy words and shallow speeches. You don't feel like a single word here is sincere; from Hercules speaking to his clich\u00e9d, forbidden love Hebe (Yeah, that's right; his forbidden love's name is Princess Hebe), and from the King to his son... It's all atrocious! The screenwriter also saw the speeches in Braveheart and LOTR: Return of The King and went \"Well, we obviously need a battle speech!\" and wrote a bunch of big speeches that were emotionless, and couldn't have been more forced. I'll move on, cause I could go on about the dialogue for days! The acting... It's too much! The main actor, Kellan Lutz, came from Twilight... So you knew from the beginning you were in for a bad ride. He's completely emotionless, stale and you not for one second care for his character. His forbidden love, played by Gaia Weiss, is equally horrible! The only reason she was cast, obviously, is because she's pretty damned hot! Scott Adkins, though, leads the way in crappy performances! His entire performance revolves around him yelling every single word. He could be speaking to his wife in private, and still find the need to yell every word to her. It was dreadful to watch! The only decent performance was delivered by Liam McIntyre, who plays Hercules's friend and comrade. He could actually deliver the lines with a bit of power, emotion! Despite his decent performance though, the rest of the cast deserves Razzie's. I'm calling it people; every single actor and actress here will get nominated at the Golden Raspberries this year! That is not good!The action is horrendous. Remember 300; that badass film about Spartan's kicking a bunch of Persian's asses? And remember how it used to go into awesome slow motion every once in a while during the fighting, when a sword was plunged deep into a body, or someone hit another over the head? Well, they do it here! And is it good? Hell no! They overuse it to pieces, and by the end of the film, you can't help but cringe every time it occurs. The action in general feels weak. There is never a moment in this film in which you worry for Hercules. You always know that he's going to beat his opponents, and that makes for fights that have you bored and uninterested! When the great hero Hercules lacks peril in his fight scenes, you have a problem. The CGI here is again, horrible! All the green screen looks like it could have fit right into a 1980's action flick. For a film coming out in 2014, that's not a good sign! All the CGI aspects of this film look incredibly fake, and mixed in with the terrible live sets, it makes for a difficult experience. I'm so thankful I did not see this in 3D, I certainly wouldn't have been able to stand it all. And the extra admission price... completely criminal!Overall, The Legend of Hercules is a pile of crap. Just please don't watch this! This film should be nominated for Razzie's, and make a minimal amount at the box office. It's one of the worst movies of all time, and certainly going to be on my top 10 worst of 2014. I need to watch 300 now, to feel good about this genre again. 1.1/10Find more film reviews at www.entjunkie.blogspot.com",

Kellan Lutz is bad as Hercules (Hopefully Dwayne Johnson will do better in the next Hercules movie). Every line is said horribly. Did i mention the dialogue is BAD.The script is horrible. It has nothing to do with the original mythology. It tries to be like 300 and Gladiator but fails horribly. The romance is so cheesy with the worst romance dialogue i have ever heard.Are the action scenes good?....No....Far from good. It always uses slow motion just like 300 (which was used better) but it was obnoxious and gets old and annoying. The visual effects and green screen is horrible and this movie has a budget of over 70 million dollars!!! What?! Movies with lower budgets look more convincing then this. Overall rating 1/10 One of the worst movies i have seen all year and we're still in January!!! Hopefully the Brett Ratner version is better and obviously it will be. You can't get lower than this.",

            "content": "This movie lost me even before I was dragged into the theater. The trailers made it look like a movie made mostly for the sake of violence and for showcasing the sweaty, hairless, shirtless bodies of the male actors; there is plenty if the latter, but shockingly less than expected of the former so if you're interested in bloody and graphic violence skip it, there's nothing that graphic to speak of. The story of Hercules's impossible tasks, is abandoned (and only makes a cameo in a scene where he kills a lion) and instead it's been replaced with a meathead's view of Ridley Scott's, Gladiator. The story and characters are as shallow as kiddie pools, the editing never slows down the pace which is tiring after the first twenty minutes, the same establishing shots are used in the very first shot of every scene, the music also doesn't know how to tone down, as that the climax of each scene is accompanied with large, \"rousing\" crescendo, the writing is awful and gives you no look into the mind of the characters (at least I hope they had more going on in their heads than what was expressed), there is no acting to speak of, and the visual effects look like they're from a Sci-Fi Channel movie. To add to my disappointment, I also discovered that IMDb doesn't have a \"0 star\" rating, what the hell?",

It got worse. If you are just looking for an entertaining film, this is a major disappointment, to say the least. Obvious special effects, slow motion for every other move in every fight scene, and terrible, I mean tragic, dialog. If you are a fan of Greek mythology, it's downright offensive.

Kellan Lutz can't carry a movie on his own, then again, no one could've carried this movie.From the opening dialogue \"I accept your challenge, prepare to die!\" you know you've got a long movie ahead of you. Oh and the fight scenes...not sure if they were trying to be \"The Matrix\" or \"300\" with all of the slow motion it used, but it didn't work. The fight scenes would've been better had it been shown full speed.Then there's the love triangle and the 3 actors involved were all equally terrible. In one scene after Hercules returns and the girl sees him for the first time after she thought he was dead, they lay in the woods and it's just awkward.The CGI may be the worst of the 21st Century. It's like they didn't even try to make it look real. It felt like one of those SciFy B horror movies you watch...I take it back, it was worse than that. And at a running time of only about 90 or so minutes, it felt like 3 hours and the fight scenes were the only bearable part of this movie. But even those get repetitive with all of the slow motion like I mentioned before.I can only hope that the next Hercules movie being released later this year will be better, and I'm not too worried that it will easily surpass this horrendous piece of work. I have no doubt this will be on my list of worst movies in the year of 2014.",

A low-budget PG-13 adaptation of 300-style movies made in Bulgaria, this movie is in line with the expectations on what Renny Harlin is capable of.While not being a disaster on a whole, it's a disaster in parts. The special effects, while being descent 3D images at times, are badly connected with live shots. There are many moments when perspective of such sequences is distorted in really obvious (and unintentionally funny) ways. There are numerous anachronisms. Characters use costumes and jewelry that could not be available in ancient Greece. Screenplay, while not being completely absurd, has some rather awkward dialog lines and unexplainable plot moments.Unfortunately, the movie is not a Hercules legend but rather a shallow love story and family drama. There's even a bathing scene in a romantic- looking pond with flowers under a waterfall (the water in the pond is so dirty though that one can only feel pity for the actors). There are no heroic deeds of Hercules depicted in this movie.One last blow for Hercules is PG-13 rating. There's no blood at all. When swords pierce bodies, they re-appear absolutely clean. When one of the characters was struck in the neck, the next shot showed his neck without a sign of a would or even a drop of blood. One of the few things the movie managed to deliver were some dynamic battle sequences; but PG- 13 made them look fake. In the age of 300 and Spartacus TV show, this is not something you want to waste your time on.Unless you wish to add to a surprising $8 mln box office success after its first weekend, which will probably make this movie more profitable than most other current releases.",

For a movie 10 times better, the guy in the rocking chair decides the movie will be a blend of the 10 scripts.He puts 70 million dollars on the table.The movie is now shot and it's kind of very bad, just how it was supposed to be. It doesn't matter anyway because people just have to go to the cinema once, it's alright if they don't like it and don't come a second time! HA!Worried, some guy calls the money-guy in the rocking chair.\"-Hey, I've been thinking, we should use a famous name from the mythology in the title! It will bring more people!-Asklepios?-Eeeehhh, well to be honest I was thinking Hercules...-Oh, alright then.\"And so The Legend Of Hercules was born. This movie is not a story, it's money invested and hope for a return. If you make a bad movie but you hit some landmarks: Hercules, mythology, gladiators, somewhat-famous actors, then you'll probably make money.You have to understand the true, deep nature of this movie. The Legend of Hercules is a cry for help, a poetry, a game-changer. The actual purpose of this movie is to impact the global industry, to make producers realize that, no, bad movies actually DON'T WORK, and they are not easy money.A simple, honest, gladiator movie with no fake big name like Hercules, with no fake romance, with just a guy fighting and living in the roman empire would have made more money. It is time to leave the path of using the same recipe over and over again. This is the one and only message this movie conveys, successfully.I hope you'll appreciate The Legend of Hercules as fully as I did.",

            "content": "Honestly, I don't know what Hercules myth, they were going for, but this movie wasn't Hercules, in any sense of the world. Where were the Twelve Labors? Where's evil Hera? She's supposed to try to make Hercules life, a little hell with raging madness! I know the Heracles tale is one of the most adapted heroes for films, but this had to be one of the worst Hercules ever. It got nothing right with the source material. Directed by Renny Harlin, the movie couldn't even figure out, what to call its title, as it was formerly known as Hercules: The Legend Begins and Hercules 3D. Don't bother, reading up on the myths of Heracles, as this movie redirected you to a new story, where the evil King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) has just invaded the land of Argos. Feeling in shame of war, Amphitryon's wife, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKenna) ask Hera to get Zeus to rape her so that she would have a God-child that would over-thrown the evil King. First off, Hera whom supposed to be the Goddess of virtue women and marriage allow this to happen? Hera was known for her jealous and vengeful nature against Zeus's lovers and offspring. How on Mount Olympia did she allow this to happen? Anyways, after Zeus had his way with the Queen, a child was born and grew up to become Hercules (Kellan Lutz). Oops, my bad, He-Man. No, that isn't right, I meant Alcides. Kellan Lutz is so one-dimensional dull that it was painful to see him in this role. The man doesn't look like a damn like the Heracles in mythology. Where is the Nemean lion coat? They really misused that lion. Why is it, smiling? Anyways, Alcides is having a great life being in love with his incest sister, Hebe (Gaia Weiss) who somehow lose her God-like powers of youth. When she's force to marry, Alcides's brother, Iphicles (Liam Garrigan), with Alcidies's disagreement. Amphitryon is forced to sell Alcidies into slavery as a gladiator. Now, Alcides must find a way back to his homeland, and defeat this evil father. Yes, the movie is not only ripping off the slow motion unrealistic fighting styles clich\u00e9s from 2006's 300, but also the whole plot of 2000's Gladiator. The movie doesn't even seem to know the difference between the Romans and the Greeks. There is little prove of that there were Gladiator type fights for entertainment in Ancient Greece. The 3D work is pretty bad. There were scenes, where my eyes hurt after watching it. One good example is the lake scene where little white dandelion pieces were flowing everywhere. The action scenes were alright, but I just can't take a movie that has a silly scene with Hercules waving a lightning bolt bullwhip, seriously. It felt so formula, like it was model after the God of Wars video games. The CGI background were pretty horrible. You can tell in some scenes that it was filmed in green screen. The movie has little to no sense of time. The queen and the king don't really aged in the film. They look like they haven't aged in the last 22 years. The production seem limited, it really did look like they re-used extras and props from Star's Network TV Series Spartacus: Blood and Sand. The movie lacks with the PG-13 rated as Hercules was always meant to be a pretty hardcore violence film. Overall: For all the modern Sword and Sandals films, it's probably one of the movies, I wouldn't check out, until last. It's one of those movies, you really can't stand seriously. It's so bad, it's might be good, depending on what you deem as fun. For me, the Legend of Hercules is a punishment straight from Hades. For a movie about Hercules; I have to say, there are other films that might be better than this. Go see 2014's Hercules with Dwayne Johnson. If not go find Kevin Sorbo's Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995\u20131999) television show. Even Disney 1997's Hercules that had little to do with the main story was better than this. Still, this movie is a lot better than 1959's Hercules Unchained, 1983's Hercules and others. Why can't Hollywood ever take a story that works and make it compelling without dumbing it down, getting it mostly wrong and totally missing the point? I'm still waiting for a good Hercules movie. In my opinion, this movie wasn't the one, I was looking for.",

Oh and one other thing, towards the end Hercules become He Man, Master of the Universe, complete with sword of power. Fortunately for Rene Harlin, he can't be accused of pilfering everything, for in this version Hercules/He-man kills Thundercat, also known as the Nemean lion, right at the beginning of the movie, which is a shame, because as a result he has to go everywhere by foot, or use a horse. The horse doesn't even have wings.As for the labours of Hercules, well there's another movie coming up with Dwayne Johnson, maybe they ended up thereVoted up to repair the low score",

Instead of concentrating on his special strength and the tasks, it turned into a Spartacus like fighting movie. At least it wasn't sickening violence - just too much fighting. The love triangle with the brother feels forced. So is the liberation of Argos. Hercules isn't supposed to lead some army to free a city. I understand if they didn't want to just rehash all the mythology stories but this ill fitting incongruous story is bad.The female romantic lead wasn't pretty enough for the role. That made it feel B grade. Kellan himself can't act as well as Chris Hemsworth but he's okay for the role in terms of looking the part - it's not Shakespeare after all. His big speech at the end is awkward. Acting shouldn't be the thing in this type of movie but they could have done with a few bigger names in supporting roles to add some weight.If you lower your expectations a lot and don't think of the mythology at all to you might have a slightly diverting time watching an action movie set in ancient times. The grand CGI backdrops are moderately watchable. At least it doesn't pretend to be a great movie - so it wasn't as annoying as Wrath of the Titans with it's even more idiotic story.",

First off we all know the story of Hercules so there really isn't a chance of spoiling it. Some guy finds out he's the son of Zeus and uses his power of strength to save people. I get that. But the graphics in this movie, which are mediocre at best, are the only thing going for this film. I was so displeased that I chose to leave after an hour of watching and went home to get some sleep instead. I felt like I was staying up late at night watching movies that come on the SciFi channel that have a really cheap budget except this one had a bigger budget and a really bad script. Not to mention the chemistry between the actors was so awkward. I think soap opera members could do a better job. All and all I would give this movie a rating of 2. Not worth paying to go see or even driving to the theater to see a free screening.

            "content": "Finnish director Renny Harlin continues to disgrace himself with this ultra-cheesy version of the Greek story which is frankly an embarrassment and stain on the career of all involved. THE LEGEND OF HERCULES is one of three similarly-themed films that came out around the same time; one is a B-movie with Sean Astin and the other a Hollywood blockbuster with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The other two will need to be pretty bad to equal the poor quality of this one.THE LEGEND OF HERCULES feels and looks like a cheap cash-in copy of 300 for the most part. Scott Adkins, who plays the stock villain in the film, is even dressed up to look like King Leonidas in his early scenes. The hero is played by Kellan Lutz, who played in support in THE EXPENDABLES 3 but has no discernible talent for his leading role here. In fact, he's dreadful. He may have a huge, Schwarzenegger-style physique, but he makes Schwarzenegger's acting style look like Laurence Olivier's by comparison.It doesn't help that the below-par script was written by Sean Hood among others; Hood similarly fumbled the recent CONAN THE BARBARIAN remake, although that was better than this. There's little story and instead plenty of CGI-enhanced action including war scenes and fights with dodgy-looking lions. Some of the fight scenes aren't too bad, but they're overly stylised and feature silly scenes of characters doing superhuman jumps through the air and messing around instead of finishing off their opponents quickly.All that was left for me to do was to sit back and count the appearances by actors from no less than four TV shows. Gaia Weiss, from VIKINGS, is the love interest, and Roxanne McKee (GAME OF THRONES) plays Hercules's mum, although of course she's far too young for the part. Kenneth Cranham (ROME) shows up as a slave trader. Best of all is Liam McIntyre (SPARTACUS) playing Hercules's friend and ally. I was amused to see that McIntyre is given an ugly fringe haircut so that he doesn't distract from Lutz's appearance. Anyone who has watched and enjoyed SPARTACUS will know McIntyre would have been far better in the lead role.",

This does not go well for Hercules and his ally Sotiris. Will the hero find his way out?The set design was much worse than the camera work was good. The use of slow motion was ridiculous.

A lot of the story takes place in gladiatorial games, except that those were Roman, not Greek. I thought that was common knowledge? Anyway, the CGI in this film is simply terrible, especially with the lion. It's really easy to notice that this was made in 3D. Everything so awkwardly tries to jump out at the audience.It's a pain to watch this on TV. While not as bad as \"Jaws 3D\" it's still rather noteworthy. I thought that was Chris Hemsworth in the lead role, but I knew he's too good of an actor for something this terrible. I guess there's a few good lines in there and that's it. Where in the legends does it say that Hercules wields an electrocuting whip? It's just so stupid. Having seen \"Troy\", I thought this would at least be a long epic story, but I'm certainly glad it wasn't!

Later in life, the boy takes on the name Hercules. But other than these nominal details, it seems the rest of this \"origins\" movie was not derived from the ancient myths at all. Case in point, mythology tell us how angry the goddess Hera was with Hercules because he was a product of Zeus' infidelity, even driving Hercules mad to kill his own children. However in this film, we get an Annunciation-like scenario where Hera appears to Alcmene and tells her that Zeus will visit the queen to plant his divine seed in her. It was even Hera who gave Alcmene the name Hercules.The lady love of Hercules in this film, the Princess Hebe from Crete and her entire story line with the love triangle with Hercules' half-brother Iphicles, is an original conception by the four scriptwriters, of which director Renny Harlin was one of them. Watching \"The Legend of Hercules\" is like watching a compendium of all the sword-and-sandal films I have seen. The most dominant elements were from \"300\". This film in fact looked like a sequel of \"300\" because of the similar style of computer graphics used for the sweeping scenery, the crowds, the fights. We also pick up similarities with \"Troy\" especially with regards to the battle scenes. The jumping attack move made classic by Brad Pitt's Achilles was multiplied so many times over in frequency and variation. We will also get reminded of deadly accurate archery skills of Orlando Bloom's Prince Paris.About halfway into the film, we will remember \"Ben Hur\" as Hercules becomes a slave and was made to row an ocean-going sailing vessel in rough waters. Then it becomes \"Spartacus\" as Hercules becomes an arena fighter for people's entertainment and gambling.Later on, we will be reminded of \"Samson and Delilah\" when Hercules was being whipped while chained to two pillars. At that moment there will be a scene of mocking and divine communication reminiscent of the crucifixion scene from any film about Jesus like \"The Passion of the Christ\".It was rather disappointing that we do not get to see familiar Hercules stories such as the \"12 Labors\", except from a short scene where he slew an ugly CG animal they called the Nemean Lion. Anyhow, having a B-list cast with only Kellan Lutz of \"Twilight\" fame as the most familiar name as the titular hero, I guess we really should not expect too much from \"The Legend of Hercules.\"",

For all the flak that \"The Legend of Hercules\" has received since it's release, the movie is actually more than enjoyable and keeps us entertained right through its 90-minute run-time. Admitted, the story might take some liberties and depart a tad from the source material, but these cinematic licenses aren't that glaring that they can't be overlooked, especially in the hands of a competent filmmaker like Mr. Harlin, who knows how to carve out a fluid action blockbuster.Like most of Harlin's previous movies, he begins by concentrating on unfolding a simple plot, which later transcends into one thrilling action sequence after another. He presents his characters in an uncomplicated linear manner, ideally suited from an action film of this nature. The script deals with the origin story of the the mythical Greek hero. Betrayed by his stepfather, the King (Adkins), and exiled and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love, Hercules must use his formidable powers of which he knows nothing of, to fight his way back and regain his honor, pride, love, and fulfil his destiny. The combined performances from Keelan Lutz, Gaia Weiss, Scott Adkins, Liam Garrigan, Liam McIntyre, and Roxanne McKee are decent enough to blend with the proceeding on hand. As expected, the cinematography and visual effects are top-notch. However, the editing does feel to abruptly jump between a few scenes and could have done with a bit more finesse.With a coherent plot, fluent characterizations, and astute direction from the ever-reliable, Renny Harlin, \"The Legend Of Hercules\" serves up a concise adrenaline-pumping action bonanza, befitting the tale of a celebrated folk-hero such as Hercules.",

Newt would be near to dying at the hands of a scrupulous villain and the funny Centaur Newt would let out that screech of his in that irritating voice \"Herc, come quick, come quick, there's danger ahead\" I had not thought about this version of Hercules until I watched the 2014 version of The Legend of Hercules. What they have in common is that irritating and repetitive music that when danger is near you know you will hear that repeated sound which is intended to represent fear versus the hero Hercules. After more than 50 years on the shelf The Legend of Hercules was able to get back under my skin.When I think about the late Steve Reeves whose many stints as the mighty Hercules back in the last 1950's I actually enjoyed these versions of the Hercules films. Now spring forward 55 years later and I am truly disappointed that with the producers spending 70 million dollars on The Legend of Hercules that it reminded me of how irritating the 1960's Hercules cartoons were. Why you may ask I felt this way is because there is no redeeming features in this version just an endless stream of putrid CGI fights between Hercules and his many adversaries.In this version of Hercules, Kellan Lutz was suckered in to playing the lead role. Well Kellan, it doesn't matter how much they paid you to take this role on, but in my opinion you would have been better off falling on your own sword within the first five minutes of your first fight scene, rather than appear in the endless stream of poorly designed CGI fight scenes that certainly would not interest any age group be it the 8-13, 14-19, 20-29, or over age 30. You can also forget appealing to an all male or all female audience. This film was just the pits.I gave it a flattering 2 out of 10 simply because any producer who wishes to spend 70 million dollars on this crap should get some credit for keeping a lot of people in the film industry employed so that they can learn a few hard lessons from the many things that went wrong with the story telling and visual effects with The Legend Of Hercules.",

Kellan Lutz certainly looks the part and does pull off the physical action hero part, but when the acting part comes up, he slightly falls short, all though he does try to pull off a good performance, he just can't seem to pull it together, I hope his acting will get better in time.Fight scenes where not that bad, trying to be 300 meets Spartacus, but not quite getting there. The effects are alright but not spectacular. The bad guys are pretty memorable. But the love story part of the movie just does not move as much has it should.

            "content": "Are audiences really so invested in the story of Hercules that they needed two big-budget action films in the year 2014 to showcase just how amazing and incredible of a person he was? Do audiences really care about the mythology surrounding his persona, and when I say \"audiences,\" I mean enough of the population, genuinely invested in his story, venturing out to the theater in big enough numbers to make a film based around him number one at the box office? Are people also so desperately intrigued by the mythology behind Xerxes and The Peloponnesian War that two 300 films were necessary? I ask these questions hellbent for answers because, the way I see it, people want to see the \"swords and sandals\" violence their impulses are screaming for, which is why Renny Harlin's The Legend of Hercules exists. This is a dull, dreary slog through the worst tendencies and oversimplifications of the genre, proving as redundant and mindless as the two 300 films but without even momentary entertainment, unlike those films. At least both of those films had a solid performance or two at their core.The film stars Kellan Lutz in an immediately bizarre casting choice. Lutz appeared as a minor character in every Twilight film, and somehow, that gave a producer the idea that Lutz had mustered up the charisma and potential to masquerade as one of the most famous, mythological Gods in history. I hope Lutz can eventually show his human characteristics because, when playing a God, he simply doesn't have the personality or complexity to make such a role work, but is also give dialog that can only be described as infantile to work with.Lutz plays the titular Greek hero, the son of Zeus, who exists as a half-man, half-God, bearing extraordinary strength. Left abandoned and helpless by his King of a stepfather and sold into slavery, Hercules tries to use his powers to fight back to his kingdom, engaging in plenty of battles and gladiator death matches in order to overthrow the King who cruelly mistreated and left him and bring peace to his fallen, divided land.Returning to the point of the film's dialog, it's amazing it took four writers to construct a screenplay almost entirely made up of loud, obnoxious screaming and monotonous fight sequences. Numerous battle scenes use the overutilized tactics of slow-motion, that have the only benefit of slowing down the film's action - even if for a few seconds - just so we can distinguish just what is happening before we return to being puzzled and disconnected all the more. Other than that, the tactic grows tiresome and only works to slow down an already slow movie. The dialog, when is actually considered and put to use, is nothing more than simple sentences structured to hopefully provide the film with some depth, when in reality, it feels like it's using pre-assembled lines from the unwritten book of \"swords and sandals\" clich\u00e9s that has all the situational drama already in the sentence and all one needs to do is write in the characters' names.The saving grace here from all the redundant activity is the teal cinematography, done nicely by Sam McCurdy, who works to create a consistent hue to the film that adds at least a competent visual scheme to the otherwise indifferent everything by Harlin. Even the special effects feel like second/third-rate green-screen work by video production designers' interns while they were out to lunch, discussing more ambitious, or at least more acceptable products, to tackle in the middle of making this one. The Legend of Hercules feels like a failed Asylum product; not a mainstream film by the likes of Hollywood.Starring: Kellan Lutz. Directed by: Renny Harlin.",

Firstly, Hercules is a myth, a fiction; he is not a historical figure, so questions of accuracy in the events are not of importance. Secondly, Kellan Lutz doesn't have the stunning good looks, alluring tuft of hair and the power beard of Steve Reeves or Reg Park or even Lou Ferrigno, so are we stereotyping Hercules here ? Thirdly, there are complaints of cheap CGI - I didn't find evidence of that except in one sequence near the end where Hercules breaks pillars he was chained to and wields the broken pieces of masonry which seem made of thermocol. Kellan Lutz doesn't continuously display Flashy superhuman strength of Hercules or a muscular physique unnecessarily - in fact both these attributes are superbly understated and implied in the movie. Some of the fight sequences reminded some of Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator' - so should the fights have been like Chinese martial arts ? Are we sure there would then be nobody crying out: boy, the fight sequences are lifted straight off a Hong Kong import! . . . Guys, come on, let's give Lutz's Herc a chance !",

You will not believe how stupid this all looks, it will blow your mind.

But he does a gladiator type thing gets kidnapped and bands an army who will fight beside him to stop the king and his brother. There was another Hercules movie that came out after this one and while I don't like it and consider it to be kind of bad, I honestly think that was a better adaption of the legend of Hercules then this. All this film seems to be is some sort of Greek film with a famous character with one poor action scene after another that consist of slow mo when you know for a fact it isn't needed. Along with all the other horrendous movies that have come out this year it like the actors are sleep walking or are a loaf of bread.

Basically in Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) succumbs to lust for Zeus, king of the gods, she bears a son that is prophesied to overthrow tyranny and restore peace. The son, Hercules (Kellan Lutz), has grown up as a prince, with no knowledge of his true identity or his destiny, his only desire is the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete (Gaia Weiss), who has been promised to his older brother Prince Iphicles (Spartacus' Liam Garrigan). Hercules does learn of his greater purpose and must decide between fleeing with his true love, or fulfilling his destiny and becoming the true hero of his time, he chooses the latter and endures gladiatorial arena death matches and harrowing battles, but in the end he does defeat King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) and takes back his rightful kingdom. Also starring Liam McIntyre as Sotiris, Johnathon Schaech as Tarak, Rade \u008aerbed\u009eija as Chiron, Luke Newberry as Agamemnon and Kenneth Cranham as Lucius. Lutz may have the body for the leading role, but he is rather drab, and Garrigan and Adkins are okay as the villains, one of my beefs with this adaptation is that there is not enough mythological stuff, almost none of the Greek monsters and creatures we've come to expect, the special effects are fine and the fight scenes alright, it is mostly let down by predictable script, it verges on pantomime, and overall it is a boring action fantasy.

Go figure\u0085.No, THE LEGEND OF HERCULES is not a great movie; it is a diversion. Does it stick closely to the myth of Hercules? Who knows? A myth after all is a myth and we've swallowed a lot of versions of this story before (remember Steve Reeves, etc?). But now it is in competition with Marvel comic heroes and space odysseys and a lot of other mindless time wasters that make it to the big screen because of the return of 3D. They succeed for the trill of dodging the special effects that make you scream.Short summary form the PR: 'The origin story of the mythical Greek hero. Betrayed by his stepfather, the King, and exiled and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love, Hercules must use his formidable powers to fight his way back to his rightful kingdom. In Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., a queen succumbs to the lust of Zeus to bear a son promised to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the king and restore peace to a land in hardship. But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time. The story behind one of the greatest myths is revealed in this action-packed epic - a tale of love, sacrifice and the strength of the human spirit.' Make a lot of dramatic sense? No, not really.The main attraction of the film is the quite often barely clothed vision of megahunk Kellan Lutz as Hercules. His acting is up to the minor standards of the script, but it is his body that the audience pays to see. Toss in Liam McIntyre (television's second Spartacus), Johnathon Schaech, pretty Gaia Weiss, Rade Serbedzija, Scott Adkins \u2013 all television favorites \u2013 and the cast carries off this rather ponderous plot rather well. The CGI effects and the arrested and slow motion photography add to the circus and there you have the reason for making the movie \u2013 to see a lot of Kellan Lutz and a lot of blood and gore that seems to be the diet of preference for moviegoers. Watch it for fun and relax on the flaws. It is entertainment after all.",

In here, about each time they pronounced his name, they underline the fact that it meant \"Heracles, grace of Hera\" but called him by his Roman name anyway. It added a superfluous layer of fake of the movie, IMO.Moving on; The title is ironic anyway because the legend of Heracles gets severely mangled here: Oh, we've got the Nemean lion, but no mention of the snakes send after his crib, or the twelve labours, or any other chapter in the life of this godly hero plagued with many too human traits. No, what we've got here is a likable farm hand boy and a run-of-the-mill love triangle story so mundane that elaborating about it would be useless. He shows little strength of either will or muscle, being easily overpowered about half a dozen times in the movie.The whole movie is sanitized to the point that there is no blood nor flesh nor any of these nasty things that takes place in the world we live in. To make this gruel more appealing, it was filmed \u00e0 la Gladiator (from which it also takes its basic script) and 300, for the battle sequences and general photography (complete with an abuse of Matrix-like stop motion, for *every* move). There is action and romance all of the time, and yet indifference ensues. There's a fine line between cleanliness and insipidity.The actors, rushed and lacking direction, vary from acceptable (Kenneth Cranham) to mediocre (pretty much everybody else). The sets, stunts and fights do look good, but lack originality. The soundtrack is, well, unnoticeable.Short version: 3/10. Pretty much because I am outraged that Heracles, the basis for what we know today as the \"super-heroes\" culture, is being reduced here to a romantic teenage gladiator.

This film is just one more that does precisely that, using characters of the myth of Hercules to create a new story. So I'll start by object the title. This isn't \"The Legend of Hercules\", it's just a story where Hercules enters without us understanding why. Script is so basic and primary that it looks like one of those lousy, melodramatic novels, sold in supermarkets for a few coins. I would even say that screenplay is just an excuse for a ton of action and pure hard pounding which seems inspired by movies like \"300\" or \"Rambo\".Although I have managed to like or digest some of his films, Renny Harlin is far from being a truly skilled director. In this case, he totally lost his notion of ridicule, and this movie will probably haunt him to death. The cast is extraordinarily bad. Kellan Lutz is a lousy protagonist. It may have muscles, but it also has the same dramatic expressiveness as a Guinea Pig. He has no charisma, no presence and cannot express emotions, just strength. I've seen hosts of TV cooking shows with more dramatic skills than this actor, who should look for another profession. Good luck with that, Lutz! Gaia Weiss is attractive but she doesn't seem to know what she's doing there, and is never fully committed to the movie. Somebody give a map to this girl, she's lost and confused! Scott Adkins gave life to a cardboard villain, histrionic and pathetic, worthy of the worst possible death. Roxanne McKee is too young for the role she played. Liam McIntyre seems to be the best actor in this disastrous cast.Visually, the film abuses CGI and sound effects to increase the impact of scenes, especially fights and action. However, the quality of the final work is rather mediocre. Bad cinematography, blurred, with colors between gray and brown, doesn't help either. Combats are utterly unrealistic, some blows and jumps are absurd and that effect of pausing or slowing down the film for a few moments in the midst of a jump or blow is so clich\u00e9 that it gave me cravings for vomit. Costumes and sets are equally ashamed. The soundtrack is boring and ordinary.In short: this film is a caricature, a cartoon where characters from the Greek legend of Hercules were chewed, dismantled and thrown into a kind of idiotic video game, lifeless and without emotion, for an hour and a half of pointless fights.",

If not better because it felt like the pacing was done better in this movie with how much they tried to fit into the short time of the flick imho. It felt like we got to see a short piece of the early start for Hercules definitely not his entire story and the pacing at least felt OK for what was done in the time it was shown. The CG was decent and didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth of being over done like a lot of other shows based on similar mythology. The fight scenes did get a touch 300'ish but not nearly as overuse of the slow mo fighting as 300 does. All in all i don't think the super low ratings are warranted i think a fair 8/10 is what it should be at. The movie was a nice flick a little break of reality with fighting , mythology/lore , and some romance story mixed in. it definitely felt less rushed then clash of the titans etc and i liked the movie better then those over all. I don't know about the rest of you but i'm getting sick of movies that get slammed by these perfectionists expecting lord of the rings type productions on a short fun action flick like this. there really wasn't anything horrible about it at all yea yea it wasn't perfect but that's why it doesn't get a 10/10 but you don't have to go all emo and give it a 4/10 for being less then ideal. i gave it a 9/10 because people are being overly critical but it really deserves about a 7.5 or 8/10 somewhere in there imho not the greatest or the worst just a decent flick something to watch.",

I was well aware of the negative reviews before watching the movie, but now, after watching it I am compelled to write my own opinion as I cannot agree with the majority in here. Review: The movie develops beautifully. In the start of it, you are introduced to the characters and the universe of the movie. Not going to give any spoilers, so I will leave this at that level. I think now again about movies as Troy or the first 300. If I am to compare this movie to anything, i would describe it as a more artistic (good dialogue, nice and round story, good after the movie feeling); less battles and gore version of the first 300 movie. As the story unfolds, I find the battles much more interesting than in other movies and involving fistfights, sword battles, nice (awesome movie start) all out battles. The characters are developed more that usual for this kind of movies. I do agree that Kellan Lutz is not Collin Ferrel as far as historic speeches go as Hercules is trying to be portrayed as a demigod not a political figure. The accent here is on physicality. Other characters though, have clever lines and are well developed and presented to the viewer. There are 2 points in the movie, each one about 30 seconds (one minute in total) that seems ridiculous for the modern viewer but that are true to the Greek legend of Hercules. Overall, I find this movie much, much better than recent historical movies, a bit below Alexander. I will not say names on what movies is above, seems unfair to me, but I can provide you with the thing that I consider this the best ancient history movie since (?) the first 300. Go watch it, not always the majority of the reviews tell the whole story. You might like it, I did!",

            "content": "Well, I guess I was stupid enough to expect better from a movie where the lead was picked based on how good he looks with his shirt off. That's on me. What we have here is a sub-moronic ripoff of everything from 300 to the Spartacus TV show with a healthy dose of comical Jesus parallels thrown in. The slow-mo action scenes and completely fake CGI backgrounds are nothing you haven't seen a dozen times in the last decade. Sometimes in better films, sometimes in worse. The acting is strictly amateur-hour with Kellan Lutz from the Twilight movies effectively ending any chance he ever had at being a successful leading man with his lack of screen presence and charm. His romantic scenes with Gaia Weiss will have everyone but little girls under 12 rolling their eyes. The lightning sword scene was supposed to be the movie's big \"wow\" moment but it gave me snicker fits due to its sheer ridiculousness. There's another stale scene that you've seen a version of in so many movies where a character has a knife held to their chest so they shove the knife through themselves to kill the person behind them. Well the knife in this case was about six inches long yet it was able to go through one person's shoulder and still penetrate the other person deep enough to kill them. Just one of many examples of the level of care that went into making this turkey.",

I wasn't sure if I even wanted to watch this movie anymore but I said to my self, ahhh what the heck, why not, I've seen worse, so how bad can it be?After just 20 minutes, I was already in a OMG state! I was like OMG why would people be so mean and rate this so low when it's so great!?!??I saw some people saying that this movie \"copied\" the spartan formations from the movie 300. What a bunch of ignorants! How can someone say that?Spartans were Greeks! Hercules was also a Greek, the action of this movie is about Greece!!!! So now, all movies about Greece copied each other or something? No! They are just movies about Greece, its history and its army formations.Here's my details review an how I individually rate everything in the movie: Story - 10 Stars Acting - 10 Stars Dialogues - 10 Stars Action - 10 Stars Costumes - 10 Stars Audio - 10 Stars Graphic Effects - 7 Stars Greek Mythology Accuracy - ?? Stars? I don't know the original myth about Hercules but I don't care either... I just liked this movie, PERIOD!The only downside of this movie were the effects which looked kind of cheap, which is strange for $70 mil budget.... it should have had more realistic effects. But anyway, effects aren't everything in a movie... yes they do matter but not as much as influencing my final decision and conclusion of weather I liked the movie or not.",

            "content": "The Legend of Hercules is meant for pure entertainment. Those who come looking for top quality from a film like this (like The Gladiator) will obviously be disappointed. I found myself enjoying the movie a lot because I had low expectations. For one, I was surprised by how visually stunning the movie was. The sets, locations, and gorgeous costumes were pure eye candy. The texture of the movie never looked \"soap opera-ish\" despite it not having a huge budget. Every drop of money is well spent on the beautiful set design and gorgeous visual affects. The cinematography is beautifully crafted to the point where if you pause at a random moment, it will be visually stunning no matter what. The editing is top notch; the movie is well paced and the action scenes flow flawlessly. And the score (background music) is the cherry on top to this action flick. There are some scenes here and there that look bad (mostly CGI stuff) and the slow-mo can be sometimes overwhelming, but it does not take away the spectacle of the film. I was rather impressed with Kellan Lutz's acting chops. In my opinion, he pulled the accent off quite well. There are some characters that are fully developed, and some that aren't. The character that stood out to me the most was Sotiris (played by Liam McIntyre.) Sotiris is not a fool; he knows when something doesn't feel right and expresses his logic to Hercules. McIntyre does a wonderful job at hitting all of his beats and steals every scene that he's in. The script also does a fine job at giving the characters enough time to express how they feel upon every situation. It helps us understand their characters and develop sympathy towards them. There is also a subtle hint of honesty in the dialogue between characters and it is rather refreshing to watch. Roxanne McKee as the Queen is sometimes a hit and miss for me. There are some scenes that she is strong in, and other scenes where I find myself rolling my eyes at her acting ability. And Gaia Weiss as Hercule's love is soooo bad. I don't think I found one scene that I liked watching her in. There is no denying the beauty of the cinematography, editing, and production design. The one huge flaw is the story itself. I can understand why some didn't like the film because of that but I don't understand the low rating of this movie. A 5/10 would be considered an \"OK\" movie, and this movie is more than OK. Honestly, I think people are too harsh on this movie and gave it a 1/10 carelessly and don't vote properly. People need to just sit back, relax, and enjoy this good action flick and take it as it is. UPDATE: Okay, the scene with (SPOILER) the lightning whip ruined the movie...so I moved my rating from 6/10 to 5/10.",

The story was plain straight simple and the art design of the film was goodThe 1 and maybe only complain I had with the film would have to be Hercules himself. Cullen Lutz portrays him well but he didn't really look like Hercules to me since he was not buff enough and too pretty boy looked for the character. Hercules in my opinion should have a bit of this brute looks within him. I think a man of lets say Brock Lesnar's size would have made a better HerculesAnother thing is that Hercules has the strength of the gods which makes him superhuman but in this film, I felt like I was watching Perseus more than Hercules since he didn't portray his godly strength up until the last minute and that was only of a minute of two. It would have been better if they showed him lifting up a pillar or throwing a huge rock at his enemiesOverall however apart from Hercule's character personality, everything else in the movie was OK for me",

            "content": "\"The Legend of Hercules\" has nothing to do with the legend of Hercules as we know it from Greek mythology.I remember that I went to the local library as a little boy and returned home with a enormous picture book about the 12 labors of Hercules.This picture book was so huge, when I was reading it, nobody could see me anymore.And in this picture book I read about Hercules slaying a lion of Nemea and the nine-headed serpent Hydra,catching a Erymanthian boar,cleaning the stables of Augeas by means of a river,retrieving the flesh-eating horses of Diomedes and abducting the hell hound Cerberus from the underworld.In those days these heroic feats appealed to me. And they still do.But you won't notice much of that in this Greek tragedy (in other words it's a sad affair).Ultimately it's just a pathetic hodgepodge of themes from various movies.A little bit of \"Pompeii\" which was also about a forbidden love between a princess and a slave who was forced to be a gladiator in Pompeii.The fight scenes were a weak duplicate of \"300: Rise of an Empire\" and \"300\".Especially because of the use of slow motion effects.A comparison with \"Gladiator\" is also easily made.And then the end is a lot like a children's matin\u00e9e on Saturday afternoon with cartoons of mythological superheroes such as \"He-Man\"which are shown on TV indefinitely.This movie is bland,uninspired and surely not legendary. The only impressive item in this movie was the chest of Kellan Lutz, who played Hercules. Perhaps it can impress teenage girls who marvel while looking at these muscular males.I was less impressed than looking at a crispy fried tiny chicken on my plate during lunch.In 1200 BC King Amphitryon invades the kingdom of Argos.It comes to a fight between him and his rival King Galenus.After defeating Galenus the kingdom Argos becomes part of Amphitryon his empire.He tells his wife Alcmene that this victory was for her.However,Alcmene is outraged by the thirst for power that her husband displays.That night she asks Hera,wife of Zeus,for help.Hera finally appears and predicts that she will give birth to Hercules,son of Zeus.Zeus (His father calls him Alcides) is born and after 20 years he has grown into a handsome muscular young man who is in love with the lovely Hebe.They hear the news that Hebe will be engaged to Iphicles,the older brother of Hercules.The two lovebirds try to flee.However,they are caught and Hercules is sent by his father on a expedition to Egypt,hoping he won't return alive.Ultimately it appears to be a trap and the regiment is being ambushed. Hercules and the faithful Sotiris are the only two who remain.They are sold as slaves to fight as gladiators.Hercules is doing everything now to return to Tires to stop his older brother and his beloved Hebe to get married.In terms of originality, this story won't win a price quickly. The SE's used aren't that impressive either. The fight with a lion in the beginning of the movie looks promising for a few seconds, but the animated lion has the same appearance as the computerized images of \"Jumanji\" in 1985. So, not really an improvement. The gladiator fights captivated me a bit. Yet it was a huge disappointment at the end. The fight that Hercules had to engage with 6 never defeated gladiators, was something I looked forward to. But it was just as if Zeus himself came along and interfered, because at that moment a storm came up here. And the first thunderbolt distracted me for a moment so I needed to rewind the whole thing because the great heroic fight was already over. And I just want to mention for those who can't endure blood : don't worry, because there is not even a single drop of it in this film. I think they ran out of fake blood after filming \"300: Rise of an Empire\".And then there were still a few things I had to chuckle about or that annoyed me. I think Amphitryon has some problems with his eyes or was blinded by anger. The night Zeus comes to visit Alcmene to conceive Hercules (which is associated with a considerable amount of wind. It reminded me of \"The Entity\"), he caught his wife in this supernatural act. And even though it is a large empty bedroom, where it's impossible to sneak out unseen, Amphitryon gives orders anyway to search for the unknown person. If you rely on the interpretation of Alcmene, this conception was quite an experience : \"Zeus came into my bed and blasted me with his seed to spawn a son to end your reign.\" The moment Hercules and Hebe meet back at the lake, I got a deja vu feeling about those flying fluffy things. It was also something that annoyed me during \"300: Rise of an Empire\". And the final battle with the lightning sword which smacked down hundreds of soldiers and the subsequent battle that Hercules fought with his father, was a bit exaggerated. It seemed like a Jean-Claude Vandamme scenario, where the hero first gets beaten up terribly before he claims victory.The performances are also fairly limited and meaningless. Kellan Lutz looks frightfully muscled and Scott Adkins is a rather sad looking king instead of a fearsome ruler. Maybe it's the overdose of sandals movies I saw lately, so I wasn't impressed with this \"Hercules\" remake. The only wow feeling I got was during the opening scene where the camera pops out of the water, swings over a battlefield with oncoming soldiers and then sways between the defending archers. A brilliant moment. But this level was not maintained throughout the film. The rest is an accumulation of stale and insipid situations. Hopefully \"Hercules\" with Dwayne Johnson, which comes out in the course of this year, will be far better.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",

            "content": "There has been a plethora of films to grace the screen since the inception of motion pictures. Many of which have been either great, horrible, or some place in between. I am someone who has been watching films for a very long time; for as long I can remember, in fact. I have been attending movie theaters since I was merely a toddler. And since I was a toddler, there have always been those movies that have enjoyed paying to see in the theater, or dreading the fact that I had just wasted hard-earned cash to view such an abominable piece of trash.When I heard that they had been developing a new Hercules movie under the direction by master Finnish filmmaker Renny Harlin, I knew this had been a golden opportunity that I could not afford to miss out on. Upon viewing the film that is 'The Legend of Hercules', I can boldly state that my precious seven dollars have not gone to waste. This film, this groundbreaking phenomenal piece of art, is what movie-going is entirely about. From the scale, the acting, the visuals, the action, the music, it is all simply nothing short of artwork projected on the big screen. When I arrived at my local movie theater on a not-too-busy Thursday afternoon, I second-guessed my initial objective to watch Hercules. I was aware that Peter Berg's magnum Opus, Lone Survivor, was presently an available alternative had I been committed to abandon the Kellan Lutz film. After a meticulous twenty seconds of debating which film to pay for, I (obviously) opted to stick with my original intention and was confident that The Legend of Hercules was my pick. After waiting behind some two obnoxious old bags, I confronted the cashier and announced that I had wished to view Renny Harlin's new film. I whipped out my leather wallet, pulled out a twenty-dollar-bill, handed it to the cashier, she then responded, \"Thirteen dollars will be your change.\" I then replied, \"Excellent.\" Then I grabbed my thirteen bucks in change, stuffed it in my wallet, and progressed to the front door. After I opened the front door, I swaggered on into the building. There the person who does the heavy duty occupation of ripping your valuable ticket, then telling you to either walk \"Right\", or \"Left\" to the particular theater where your movie is being played was. Upon then, I was theater-bound, until I felt an ominous sensation within my bladder \u2013 I had to take a whiz. So I journeyed to the men's room where I whipped out my sausage to deposit some of my lemonade into a toilet; thence it would enter the sewer line.I had been optimistic that I would no longer need to use the restroom for a good hour and a half. I walked into my theater, being somewhat embarrassed that I was all alone. Attending a movie alone can feel awkward if you are accustomed to having company in your presence, and knowing that at times large groups of annoying friends and/or families are commonly attending these beautiful events. So when I came around the corner of the seating area(s), it had come to magnificent surprise that I had been the first individual to make my way to see this new Hercules picture. I had arrived about ten minutes in advance, so I was sure I would not be the only one seeing this excellent film at 1:00 pm. About seven minutes later (give or take), finally a new viewer had entered the theater, an elderly gentleman who did not look the least bit excited to be there. So previews had eventually started, and I was clenching my fists in utter excitement just anticipating the reality that I was going to be viewing a new motion picture epic. I can not remember the order of the previews, but I swear that sometimes these trailers are just dragged out too long. And there are just way too many trailers to show these days! There are like five or six previews that had been shown, of course that may not be very many. To my recollection, I can recall I time back in 2003 or 2004, when I had to sit through some twenty previews! To be quite frank, the reason these previews felt like an eternity, was because I had felt a recurring sensation strike my bladder \u2013 I had to whiz once more! It was only last year when I went to see a boring stinker film called Riddick that I had to take the biggest whiz anyone could imagine. If you have ever owned an old house-trained dog, that you kept inside all day, and close to midnight you finally let it outside just to go release some of its inner lemonade, you would know what I mean. When Riddick finally came to a much-awaited conclusion, I sprang out of my seat, ran down the stairs to the men's room, then I released what I must confidently consider to be a waterfall. But I digress.In short, this is a very fun movie. You will likely enjoy it if you are a fun person. If you do not enjoy it, then you are not a fun person. You are pretty lame, as a matter of fact. Sure there are pretty mediocre moments, ones in which you might catch yourself laughing hysterically at, but movies like these are meant to be enjoyed that way. Go and have a see for yourself, because although this is being hated on right now, it will be viewed as a cult classic in years to come. When watching The Legend of Hercules, you will smile, you will laugh, you will cry. You may even do all three at once.",

Their task was to select a mythical hero (Kellan Lutz) and develop a movie around him. They did, they selected the son of Zues a true myth. However, since the story has been set in stone from the ancient stories. Historians have documented all of this hero's' exploits and now modern directors must try and make it relevant for modern audiences and interesting enough to satisfy their craving for action. Thus, their need for Literary license. For this, they took the original story and tried their best not to lose the audience with changes. Indeed, one cannot do that and please everyone, but the greatest numbers in the audience. Hercules was born to a mortal woman and who's father was Zues, kings of the Gods. Thus as a half man, half god he must endure the trials which include, the possibility of death. Indeed he is able to fall in love and develop hatred for his brother who is ambitious and wants to be the next King. King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) and his son Sotiris (Liam McIntyre) plot to have Hercules sent on a fool's errand where hopefully he will be killed or imprisoned. Rade Serbedzija who plays Chiron his teacher, tries to warn him but fails. As a result, the hero is enslaved and forced into an Egyptian arena. By the time he is aware, the hero returns to learn that his love Hebe (Gaia Weiss) is to be married to his brother. From start to finish this movie is action oriented and adventure minded. Depicted Military scenes follow the type found in '300' and 'Gladiator' and the audience is wowed by their outcome. Thus Artistic Linence is granted for the myth follows to a inspiring climax and I for one accept it. Great Movie follows and I predict it will be a Classic. ****",

But Amphitryon sends him away and arranges to have him killed, leaving the path clear for his wicked older half-brother Iphicles to marry his love Princess Hebe.This film, badged as American, but stuffed full of Australian voices for many of the principals and Bulgarian names throughout the credits (and locations), flirts mildly with the actual legend of Hercules before deciding to abandon myth and go straight for a remake of Gladiator, executed in a cross between the styles of 300 and the Spartacus TV series, only with no blood or decapitations (loads of sudden slo-mo, though. Simply loads of it).Kellan Lutz does a creditable job of looking like a third Hemsworth brother, all oiled pecs and stubble. I recognised Liam McIntire (Spartacus), otherwise the only familiar face was Kenneth Cranham as Oliver Reed. Sorry, I mean the same part which Oliver Reed played in Gladiator. The two blokes playing baddies gnash their evil but flawless teeth impressively (and necessarily, given the amount of scenery they chew), and the women are uniformly hopeless. The Yugoslavian actor playing mentor Chiron is incomprehensible. The scenery is nice, and there is a moderate amount of production budget in evidence in terms of sets and costumes. The occasional CGI is mostly effective, and there is a particularly pleasing CGI overhead tracking shot which opens the films, which gave me hopes which were never fulfilled.This film is not the disaster it has been painted, but it certainly isn't good. Big mistake number one was the obvious indecisiveness as to whether to go myth or combat, followed by big mistake number two, which was to rehash Gladiator in softcore 300 mode. Big mistake number three, if you need another, was in putting so many poor actors on screen.I did not see the 3D version - we didn't actually get that one at our cinema.",

The character is NOT Hercules, the story is NOT the story of Hercules, the representation of the 'ancient world' has NOTHING to do with ancient Greece of 1200 BC.Its simply the story of a \"Konan like\" character living in an undefined historical period , who could be called Konanis Papadopoulos (if the director insist to present him as Greek) but no way Hercules.Curious thing is that while the real mythological story of Hercules is a very interesting story with all the elements that a viewer would love to watch (monsters, violence, suspense, interesting character, story twists) NOBODY in the history of cinema tried to make a movie really based on it.

The movie already climaxes in the second act and the last half hour is as boring as watching a tree grow.I like Kellan Lutz, but what I don't like is that when the romance storyline is being set up Renny has let him look a tiny bit too awkward in a couple of shots. Or if that was planned, for character dept's sake, I think Renny is overestimating his public. But, but, but, what matters the most is, does it bring the emotions? Yes it does. And very much so. The two first acts are masterfully orchestrated. Man! Reminder. Who's into Hercules? Is it the most steadily dating guys or they who are still looking for their personalities to mature? Correct. Guys who are into Hercules don't like watching other guys lick their princesses, so hide the worst licking in the trailer, or it'll alienate your biggest audience.

I wish he would have gotten more screen time, but the movie wasn't about him, so I understand.I was very surprised at a couple of other very good looking fight scenes (without Scott) in the movie as well.All in all, if you're here for Scott Adkins, any of the other actors, or a mildly entertaining 5/10 movie, give this one a try.",

The leading character certainly had the physic of Hercules but, he didn't have any screen charisma at all. The storyline wasn't that bad and the fighting scenes were impressive, but it the characters really let the film down. I honesty think that it came out to near the release of Hercules starring a The Rock, which will obviously get the audiences running to the cinema. Anyway, it's not bad if you just want to see some fight scenes without much depth but, if you expecting the true story of Hercules then you will be let down. Average!Round-Up: With such a big budget, the director should have invested in some decent actors. The guy who plays the lead, Kellan Lutz, also starred in the Twilight franchise and he played the lead in that awful movie Arena with Samuel L. Jackson. I don't think that anyone will remember any of his previous roles and I doubt that this film will make his career blossom. You might recognise the girl who plays his mum, Roxanne McKee, who was in Hollyoaks and Eastenders.

Kellan Lutz was pretty useless in this, I think he was just there to show of his muscles and chest, not sure if it was just his acting skills or the shitty script but was deserving of a Razzie nomination!Don't even waste your time with this.

It was straight out of 1950's 3D with stuff being thrown at the screen for no reason just to take advantage of the effect. It actually worked quite well in the very first scene as the camera charges in to battle with arrows whizzing at the screen. From there, it gets to be comical. The writing, dialogue and plot itself is also laughably bad. That actor that played Hercules could be great as Chris Hemsworth's stunt double if he chooses that route one day. At least they made sure to give him Spartacus as his side kick. Hercules power level was baffling all throughout. He was actually quite a wuss early then after a blatant sacrilegious parallel to Jesus moment he becomes superpowered after believing in his father. Then, moments later he's getting his ass kicked by a 50+ year old man. The needlessly over-the-top villainous king did age well from the beginning of the film where he forced invisible Zeus in to a five second fling with his wife/queen. This movie is b-movie bad but I didn't really enjoy it in that manner. Somehow, I didn't hate it either and I can't figure out why not. It's just so very bad with not one stand out action moment throughout.",

Unlike A-Rod, Lance Armstrong, and Lindsay Vonn, Kellan HAS NOT BEEN TESTED. Yet, he's more of a role model (and perhaps a provoker of gender identity confusion) than any of those athletes.

Renny Harlin directed this with a big box office in mind. Aided by an obvious huge budget behind the Hollywood Machine, Harlin tries to provide massive scale battle scenes with battle armor, helmets, swords, and lots of testosterone accept he avoids allowing bloodshed and brutality. Kellan Lutz is cast mainly because he knows a good workout regimen and was fortunately part of the immensely popular Twilight series as Hercules, son of god Zeus and human mother devoted to the gods. His stepfather is an aggressive, hot-headed, intense tyrant, overconfident and often full of rage, with a half-brother that is spineless, jealous, and blinded by the prestige of being the son of a king. Hercules is in love with the beautiful princess, Hebe (Gaia Weiss), but she is to be married off to Iphicles (Liam Garrigan). Hercules and Hebe try to flee from King Amphitryon's (Scott Adkins) kingdom but too many soldiers on horseback made that difficult. Soon Hercules is sent off on a doomsday mission with Captain Sotiris (Liam McIntyre) and small accompaniment of soldiers to face an entrapment in a cavern, surrounded by more men and talented archers. Sold into slavery with Sotiris, Hercules must fight in underground cage matches and woo the man in charge of them, hoping he can get freedom for him and Sotiris by convincing their owner to be sent to combat in the Arena against the greatest of warriors. It all culminates in multiple handicap battles and eventually Hercules facing down his stepfather and half-brother with a revolution underway as soldiers and peasants have grown tired of Amphitryon's tyrannical rule. Before you know it, Iphicles will use Hercules' love for Hebe against him as he battles mano-a-mano with Amphitryon. You get the lovey-dovey Hercules and Hebe make-out scenes quite similar to what you'd see in Twilight between Bella and Edward, in a waterfall lake with flowers and green. It's all yuck, but the audience intended might eat this up. You get plenty of Zeus-influenced powers provided to Hercules as he whips around boulders ripped from pillars holding him in chains and electric bolts that send soldiers reeling. I'm hoping the new Hercules film with the Rock makes this film a fading memory. Sadly, Harlin reduced to this trifle is a shame because I think he can make a fun B-movie with the best of them...trying to PG this kind of fare in the R-rated era of swords, sandals, and sex damages Hercules substantially.",

            "content": "You shouldn't worry about \"The Legend of Hercules\" spawning a sequel. \"Cutthroat Island\" director Renny Harlin and \"Cube\u00b2: Hypercube\" scenarist Sean Hood along with \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" television writer Daniel Giat have concocted one of the worst adaptations about the origins of the son of Zeus. The Italians revived Hercules back in the 1960s with splendid results, and a number of muscle-bound bodybuilders breathed life into the mythical champion. The Hercules movies thrived in the late 1950s and early 1960s in the shadow of Religious movies like \"Ben-Hur.\" After the heyday of the Italian peplums, Hercules sank back into obscurity. Briefly, the son of Zeus would be revived in the flesh of Lou Ferrigno, but even the Italians couldn't make lightning strike twice. As the first of the two Hercules movies released in 2014, the $70-million \"The Legend of Hercules\" is serviceable, but largely forgettable. You can tell in most scenes that Harlin and company rely on green screens. The artistry in set design, production design, and matte painting is good, but it is so obvious that visual special effects have been used that it undercuts the authenticity of the action.Hercules is an orphan in this outing, and our muscular hero doesn't realize initially that he is the son of Zeus. Hercules' stepfather, the King of Amphitryon (Scott Adkins of \"The Expendables 2\"), is predictably furious when he catches his wife, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee of \"Vendetta\"), having sex with nobody in her bed and then she gives birth miraculously to the infant Hercules. Not surprisingly, Amphitryon doesn't have much use for Hercules and calls Alcides. The straightforward screenplay draws on \"Gladiator\" in that the King sends Hercules away to be captured and sold into slavery. Eventually, Hercules and his old army friend, Sotiris (Liam McIntyre of \"Niflheim: Blood & Bullets\"), manage to get home. Amphitryon claps Hercules into chains and orders his dastardly son, Iphicles (television actor Liam Garrigan), to slay Chiron (Rade Serbedzija of \"The Saint\") and he executes his father's demand. Hercules begs Zeus to grant him strength and tears cement blocks at the end of his chains out of the masonry. Eventually, Hercules must tangle with his stepfather. Hercules wields a magical sword in the finale that eliminates his opponents until he can face off with Amphitryon.The relatively low-budget harms the film because Hercules doesn't demonstrate his strength in the usual larger-than-life ways. The battle with the lion is routine. The scene where Lutz shines occurs in a gigantic cave when he seizes an archer in his grip. Not only does Hercules physically restrain the archer, but also he uses the man's bow and arrows to kill combatants charging him! Acting wise, Scott Adkins steals the movie with his gusto, while Liam Garrigan is convincingly treacherous. Johnathon Schaech is villainous enough as Tarak who takes Hercules into custody after he wipes out his army. Kellan Lutz has the physical look, but he cannot compete with with Steve Reeves or Reg Park. The only saving grace of \"The Legend of Hercules\" is that Harlin lets us in on variety camera tricks and the problems with using Arabian horses in movies on the audio commentary track of the Blu-ray/DVD presentation. For the record, \"The Legend of Hercules\" was lensed in 3-D rather than converted in post-production. \"The Legend of Hercules\" doesn't wear out its welcome at 98 minutes, but it doesn't tower like the Dwayne Johnson version.",

But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time.Sounds good, trailers make it look good, but unfortunately it's not good. The Legend Of Hercules had all the promise of being such a fantastic mythology film, but it truly failed to deliver, especially considering it's budget. The film is exactly like 300 & Gladiator...300 mainly because of the slow motion usage (which was good for the most part but way overused), and Gladiator because of the exact same story line.Not only that, the characters are just like those from 300 & Gladiator as well. There's too many to list, but the main ones are Scott Adkins (King Amphitryon) tries to be like Gerard Butler (King Leonidas); Liam Garrigan (Iphicles) is very similar to Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus); and Kellan Lutz (Hercules) is like Russell Crowe (Maximus).That is where the similarity ends, however, because the acting is truly awful (especially from the three mentioned above), and the story is really poorly put together. Adkins is so over-the-top it's unreal, plus he's ALWAYS SHOUTING which gets annoying. As with Garrigan, well, let's just say that you can tell he's a TV actor. The performances are just not believable at all from any of them.The only plus side is the stunning visuals, CGI (except the lion), cinematography, and decent action scenes and if it weren't for these, this film would have been a 1-star rating all the way for me. Such a let down and if you choose not to see it then don't worry because you're not missing much.",

            "content": "The Legend of Hercules is a misnomer; the film butchers the mythology of Hercules to an unrecognizable pulp.Any film about Greek or Roman mythology is going to be difficult. The mythology can be ambiguous and include several historical figures' fates, all with their own rich and diverse back-stories, which can be perplexing. Somehow, the script must take on this complicated task, simplify it and yet retain the tale's integrity.There are many things that are at fault in The Legend of Hercules, first of which is the story. King Amphitryon is a loathsome tyrant whom Queen Alcmene despises and wishes to overthrow somehow. Born and conceived to be the savior of Ancient Greece by his mother Queen Alcmene with Zeus, Hercules is a prince. Hercules' older brother Iphicles resents Hercules for his strength, leadership and mother's love. Hercules' paramour Hebe, the Princess of Crete, is to marry his brother Iphicles as a union of their lands. Hercules and Hebe dare to pursue their love in spite of the arrangement and a clash of sovereignty gets underway.At face value this is what happened in the film. This is also only the first twenty minutes of the film, your guess is as good as mine for the rest. Besides the mythological origin story of Hercules there is little mythology anywhere else. Hera is reduced to a melancholic prophetess witch. And Hercules is instead in the middle of a political upheaval for power.Secondly, the characters are pretty abysmal. The story has no development of any relationships and you sense no history between the characters. Hercules is reduced to a stoic barbarian. Kellan Lutz's impression of Hercules can be summarized as a muscular man who speaks loudly, lacks any emotion, always runs into battle scenes snarling, and scrunches his eyebrows.Third key feature causing the inevitable demise of this film is the action scenes! This is an action movie, and they are horrible. Any chance to marvel at the abilities of the actors and stuntmen is ruined by Renny Harlin's decision to always have the action sequence in slow-motion, in every single scene, every single time! Harlin also overly stylizes the film, ripping off movies like 300.The Legend of Hercules wanted to be an epic film packed with intense battles and a simple story of love and one man's purpose. It was instead a big disappointment and waste of time.More film reviews can be found at our website.",

I enjoyed that there was a strong romantic element in the story. I was also highly impressed by many of the backdrops (settings/scenery) and found them to be quite artistic in conception.

He is an actor who's future career I shall definitely be following with eager anticipation. Other supporting actors' and actresses' contributions were all well up to the same high standard as the main leads.(As at least one other reviewer has said) I'm glad I didn't let the many negative reviews I'd read (on IMDb.com) put me off seeing this film.

This $70 million production stars Kellan Lutz in the title role and costars Scott Adkins, Gaia Weiss, Roxanne McKee, Liam Garrigan, Liam McIntyre and Johnathon Schaech. It was written by Harlin, Sean Hood, Daniel Giat and Giulio Steve. The movie was a bomb at the box office (making just over $44 million worldwide) and I can see why. It's extremely dry and mostly boring; with a few decent action scenes throughout though. The story begins in 1200 B.C. ancient Greece when Queen Alcmene (McKee) makes love to the God Zeus; in order to give birth to a demigod that's promised to overthrow the evil rule of her husband, King Amphitryon (Adkins). The baby is named Alcides by his father (who despises him, knowing he's not his son) and Hercules by his mother (in secret). Herules (Lutz) grows up to be a strong and kind prince who does not know his true origins. He loves Hebe (Weiss) but she's betrothed to his older brother, Iphicles (Garrigan), and Hercules is sent off to do battle in Egypt (prior to their wedding). Once there Hercules and the other soldiers, led by Captain Sotiris (McIntyre), are ambushed and Hercules is believed to have been killed (back home). He then must do battle as a gladiator type slave (in several arena fights) before earning his freedom and finding his way back to Greece. Once home Hercules must decide whether to follow his destiny or not.For a $70 million film it looks pretty ugly; the effects aren't that great and the performances are pretty weak. I do like Scott Adkins and he makes a great villain but Lutz and most of the rest of the cast are horrible. Lutz does look the part but he doesn't possess one-tenth of the charisma and character that The Rock does (I'm really looking forward to seeing that version of this story). Harlin used to be a decent action flick director (back when he did movies like 'DIE HARD 2' and 'CLIFFHANGER') but lately he definitely appears to be just a hack. None of the characters are likable in this film and the action scenes aren't at all exciting or fun to watch. The film is mostly just a bore; it's not horrible but it is pretty dull.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9aLxA71Z4k",

There is such a rich and bountiful history behind the demi-god, so many tales that would easily make great movies, but instead we get this.From the director of action classics such as Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger, comes this steaming pile of crap straight from the butthole of a $70 million project.What even was this movie? The Hercules done by Brett Ratner was coming out later that year (which turned out to be far better than this), so why was this one necessary?Acting - I don't think you can call any of this acting, just people reciting lines with either shouty voices or normal voices. Okay... - Kellen Lutz is not Hercules. Dwayne the Rock Johnson was more believable as Hercules. - Scott Adkins was wasted (not that he's a great actor). If you've seen his movies, you know what he's good for...sweet fist fight action sequences. He has one in this but it's poorly done. - The bad guys were just acting like over-the-top douche bags with no layered performances.Story - The romance plot line took up way too much time. It wasn't believable, or touching, in fact, it was quite dead and emotionless and I felt nothing for the to lovebirds. - There is 1 labor performed in this film, the Nemean Lion. It was rushed and lackluster, poorly executed. - It feels too much like Ben-Hur, Spartacus and Gladiator, 10/10 films. But they had layered characters, superb writing, an emotional story line and brilliant acting and this has none of those things. It doesn't feel original and it isn't even done well so you can't forgive it for being unoriginal.Action - (Cinematography and Editing) - It's PG-13 so there's no meatiness to the fights - There's no blood or real visceral violence of any kind - Looks like a bunch of people rolling around swinging wildly, mixed in with some WWE performances - Clone of 300, or Immortals. Same style, but poorly executed. - No point to slow motion because there's nothing impressive happening and there's no blood flying across the screen. - Cuts away when anything cool might happen - It just feels boring to watch - This is the most decent thing about the movie though, soooooooo...Costumes and Set Design - Costumes just look cheap - Sets look cheap - Backgrounds sometimes look like paintings - When they don't look like paintings they look like terrible animation - Terrible animation complimented by wonky green screen blending - Why did so much have to be CGI if it was garbage? Why not create a miniature model of the city and film that rather than create an obviously fake, video-game looking world?Writing - Dialogue is cringey, cheesy, corny, terrible....take your pick. - Nothing feels tense. - Characters might as well be 2D cut- outs. There's no layering to any of them. They're either good or bad. None are tormented or have problems.

He infused some life into the scripts he was given when he played Spartacus, in a mini-series.

Twists are terrible if they can be called twists. Acting and special effects are even worse, I really don't like it when you pick actors by their modeling skills instead of their acting skills.I am not even going to waste any more of my time on this movie, so here it goes, I, with all my heart, suggest you to skip this movie.

I love action and those battles with slow motions and spartan military formations made me really happy. It was really captivating. I don't remember much about Hercules, but it was probably as related to that story as Inglorious Bastards was related to history. That's OK, though, I didn't want to see Hercules clean stables, anyway. I agree is not the best action movie (I'll give it an 8 for action), but what is with those \"1\" ratings? I guess is the same reason that got me to give it a \"10\" - the Son of God parallel. This might be the spoiler: There is a scene there where Hercules is whipped and a mean Greek asks him, paraphrasing \"You, self-proclaimed Son of Zeus, what savior are you for those people when you can't even save yourself?\" That was genius, in my opinion, and the timing with Son of God just made it so delicious! So I do invite you to see it! It's a great way to put legends in perspective and enjoy... spartan fights!",

So I asked some of my students if they had seen it, and the few who did told me I'm better off missing it, since the Disney film is probably more accurate that this dud. Thanks for the reviews and I will definitely save my money and this film will never be shown in my class. In fact, there hasn't been a decent film about Hercules ever. He is shown in Jason and the Argonauts, the most recent version, but even that film is Hollywood's take as Hercules never even got on the Argo in the real myth. Do you think Rock's version this summer will do Herc justice?",

            "content": "The Legend of Hercules, formerly known as Hercules: The Legend Begins and Hercules 3D is an upcoming action movie, set to release on 10th January 2014. Directed by Renny Harlin and co-written by Daniel Giat, Giulio Steve and Sean Hood, this film star Kellan Lutz, Gaia Weiss, Scott Adkins, Liam Garrigan and Roxanne McKee. It is delightful for any full time writer to write a review on this film.The film stars Kellan Lutz as the mythical hero Hercules and depicts the story of this brave Grecian warrior. This is a story of love, lust and bravery where a beautiful Grecian queen succumbs to the advances of Zeus, god of sky and thunder, to bear his demigod son Hercules. He is half-man and half god, blessed with super human strength, whose fate is to overthrow a repressive and tyrant ruler who is also his step-father. He has taken birth to bring peace to a land which suffers only hardship. But unfortunately, Prince Hercules knows nothing of his real identity or his predetermined destiny which is to depose of his step father \u2013 the king. In his growing up years, Hercules is shown as an ordinary boy with footloose ways and desperately seeking the love of a fair maiden named Hebe. Hebe is the Princess of Crete and engaged to be married to Hercules's own brother. In spite of knowing that his brother is set to marry her, he pursues her. This angers the king who was looking for an excuse to banish him from his kingdom. Hercules is betrayed by his stepfather who exiles him and sells him to slavery to punish him for his forbidden love. It is when he is in exile that Hercules learns the truth about himself-about his powers and about his purpose and the lover boy changes into a warrior man. It is a time to choose whether to flee with Hebe or stay and use his immense powers to fulfill his mission of fighting his way back to his rightful kingdom by overthrowing the king and become the true hero of his time.The Legend of Hercules is the latest offering from the makers of Olympus Has Fallen. This film is a visual treat for the viewers. It has stunning locale and breathtaking gladiator scenes where death matches have been played. The film's trailer was released on October 13, 2013. The film has the potential to make its viewers feel positively content with it and transfer them into an ancient Greece where Hercules embarked on a legendary odyssey to reclaim his right. Could have been better but can be watched due to lack of other good films at the BO this weekend.",

It's directed by Renny Harlin-12 Rounds, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Die Hard 2-and it was filmed in Bulgaria. It starts with Scott conquering a kingdom and claiming it for himself-he is not a very nice person. His wife gives birth to Hercules, but seeing as how she is mad at Scott for his general egotistical attitude, she makes a pact with the king of the gods, Zeus, to be the biological dad of Hercules. Kellan plays Hercules at the age of about 20 and since this is a new, aimed-at- the-young-teens-origin, there also has to be a love story. Gaia plays the love of his life and there is even one scene where she is telling someone how much she loves Kellan and she says things like, 'If his face was scared up, I would still love him. If his voice could not talk, I would still love him, etc, etc'. Man, that is teen-aged Twilight style loving, if you ask me. Since Kellan is still young, he does not have his full Hercules strength yet, but he definitely knows how to leap high in the air and how to fight in slow-motion-there is a lot of those two things going on; it kind of reminded me of 300. Never fear, he does get some of his fabled strength and some fancy new lightening-styled powers, later in the movie. Liam plays a captain of the guards that befriends Kellan and becomes his handy side-kick in his leaping and slow-motion battles. This is not the first Hercules movie-I kind of prefer the Steve Reeves version, myself-nor, I'm sure, will this be the last. It's rated \"PG-13\" for the violence and sexual content-no nudity here- and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes. I would probably buy this on DVD but most people I know would rather rent it.",

In this day and age, Millennium Films is the new Cannon, and when I learned they made their own Hercules movie, I knew sooner or later I had to see it. What made it more interesting was that this movie was made with a lot more money than the Cannon Hercules movies. Maybe, just maybe, they could make a genuinely good Hercules movie.Sadly, that didn't happen. And the movie also happens to not be bad in a hilarious way - just bad. I could go on for some time talking about the bad stuff in this movie. There are the cheesy computer generated special effects, the choppy editing, the very simplistic story, the poor direction... the list just goes on and on. But what bothered me the most about this movie was that it really wasn't a Hercules movie. 99% of what the \"Hercules\" in this movie does could be attributed to a mere mortal who happened to be very good in combat. There's almost NOTHING of super strength or other god-like powers here! And the way the story is plotted comes across more like a rip-off of movies like \"Gladiator\" or \"300\". There's almost nothing about gods or epic quests here. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it were revealed that the screenplay was originally written as a \"Gladiator\" or \"300\" clone, and when it got into the hands of Millennium Films, they tinkered with it slightly to pass it off as a Hercules movie. But in the end, the Lou Ferrigno movies, as cheap and unintentionally hilarious as they are, are much closer to the spirit of Hercules than this movie.",

Hercules has the hots for a girl, psychopath step father disapproves, brother is a coward and a bitch and wants her, so he kills them and gets the girl.

Liam Mcntyre as Sotiris the General brought real emotion to the film 10/10 performance. Scott Adkins did a decent job as the evil King 7/10. Even the character Chiron played by Rade Serbedzija 8/10. The sets for Argos and Tyran were believable, and the villages. The fight scenes were good for pg 13. But everything else was a letdown and rushed. Every time the Movie took a step forwards, after it would take 2 steps back. The costumes looked like halloween costumes, Kellen lutz and the rest of the cast are terrible at bringing any emotion to the movie. I don't blame them, Kellen tried as Hercules. The setting and terminology they used was so historically bad I wanted to cry. The Director brought the movie down with terrible CGI, and camera movement. The script was bad also. Renny tried to make a Peplum film but fell short. Granted He did give it a try and tipped his hat to Steve Reeves as the real Hercules. What annoys me most is that the budget for this is 70 MILLION DOLLARS!! THE EXACT SAME AS 300. It looked like it was shot for 8 Million. Where was the rest of the money spent? I don't know but I can say this safely that if your in the right mindset, you might kind of enjoy this movie. but wait for Brett Ratners version",

I would say it was better than a 1 out of 10 though, people were a bit harsh with giving it a one, it's really not that bad. Overall I thought it was decent, not the worst but decent. I recommend anyone to go check it out for Yourself and see what you think.",

            "content": "Sometimes a movie that bombs turns out to be a perfectly adequate or even sometimes terrific movie. So I went into The Legend of Hercules hoping to discover audiences were wrong. They weren't. Every bad review is pretty much dead on. I can't even figure out what the film makers were trying to do with this mess. With the rampant success of Game of Thrones and films like 300, this should be an easy film to make at least interesting enough to bring in the crowd. I spent this entire film looking for some sort of sign that this was Hercules. As far as I can tell (and I've done my share of studying Ancient Greek history) there is no sign of anything that makes the famous Greek hero what he is. They say there are no original ideas left in Hollywood but this blatantly rips off 300's style and cinematography implying that it doesn't need to do any more than that. Every scene is wrought with melodramatic dialogue delivered poorly at best. Every fight scene uses ridiculous looking slow motion techniques to make it look even more dramatic and the music in the background is far more exciting than what you're actually watching. The dialogue is ridiculously hokey and is attempting to channel some sort of Shakespeare but falls on its face being delivered so terribly.Kellan Lutz might have a career in Hollywood ahead of him as a leading man but this film will do absolutely nothing to prove he can do it. Lutz hardly says anything and when he does it sounds forced and silly. It seems as though he doesn't even try and they do absolutely nothing to show that his character is Hercules. This film could have been called anything because it has nothing to do with Hercules and Lutz has zero screen chemistry. He's barely noticeable. Not to be outdone our main heroine is played by Gaia Weiss who is excruciating on screen. I have rarely seen such little chemistry between two romantic leads as Lutz and Weiss. I couldn't have cared less about their romance and that's unfortunate. Ironically, a performance that wasn't outright terrible was Scott Adkins. He looked the part of the King and wasn't bad when delivering the terrible dialogue. He had his share of campy moments and he wasn't great, don't misunderstand me, but he was better than terrible. The best actual performance in the film is by Liam McIntyre as Hercules' right hand man Sotiris. He has some genuinely good scenes and actually appears to be trying. It can't be easy given the rest of the cast and movie. Liam Garrigan is practically a joke and looks ridiculous as our \"villain.\" I could talk about others in the film but really they are all bad.Renny Harlin has done some decent films. He's never really had an \"amazing\" movie, the closest is maybe Die Hard 2 but he should still be ashamed of this mess. Granted the script is so bad (which apparently he co-wrote with three others) so this squarely lies on his shoulders. The movie is so bad that even the action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are so underwhelming. Each one is the same as the next and the slow motion bogs down everything. The blatant use of 3D technology (I watched in 2D) makes this seem even more campy. I am certain even Asylum films could have made a better so called \"Hercules\" movie than this. At times (especially near the end scenes) they seem to be trying to channel some sort of \"Jesus\" type story with Hercules but there is nothing here that even implies this is the Hercules of Greek legends. If I had to watch Lutz leap through the air in slow motion one more time I was going to be sick. I am genuinely surprised that I couldn't find much of anything redemptive here in this movie. It is such a hard genre to get wrong. Reviewers made horrible fun of \"Pompeii\" which was also very campy but I can promise you it was twice the movie this was. I hold out high hopes now for the next Hercules movie starring Dwayne Johnson because it wouldn't take much for them to make a better movie than this. This one is a dud. Thank goodness for them they had a 70 Million dollar budget to at least make it look professional. 4/10",

            "content": "\"The Legend of Hercules\" is a film directed by Renny Harlin of \"Cutthroat Island\" infamy, starring an actor whose biggest appearance was in the god-awful \"Twilight\" film series, with Spartacus aka Liam McIntyre as his friend(way to be original). It is the single-worst movie I've ever paid money to see; I've never missed Kevin Sorbo so much. Hell, even Eddie Murphy was a better Hercules than Kellan Lutz.The acting, except for Scott Adkins, McIntyre, and Rada Serbedzija, is terrible, but that's mostly due to the direction and the bad screenplay. The story is a mish-mash of 300's slow-motion, Gladiator's story with some Spartacus thrown in, and The Princess Bride's love triangle.The effects are awful, and the cinematography/editing are so bad. There are obvious uses of green-screen and reusing footage. During the climax, they reused one shot from about twenty minutes in, but changed it to night and added some torches. Then, they showed Hercules and his army AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BRIDGE!! Especially the final scene.And let's just say there's a huge cop-out at the ending. Basically, the brother, who's mostly Commodus, holds the love interest at knife-point to keep Hercules from killing Amphytrion; the love interest \"stabs\" herself and him (which is obviously under the arm). Hercules holds her in his arms, showing her wound on her chest near her heart. Then, the scene goes white and shows her and Hercules with a baby, alive and well. WTF!? EXPLAIN, MOVIE, EXPLAIN!!!! A friend and I saw this movie, and the theater only had about 10-12 people in it. We were in there cracking jokes, from Gladiator to Avatar: The Last Airbender. During the scene where Hercules and his friend fight the other two guys in the arena, my friend shouts, \"Go back to the Fire Nation.\" I respond, \"The Boulder is going to bury the competition!!\" Basically, this is the worst movie of 2014 so far. If you want to laugh for the unintentioned reasons, go see it. It's a terrible terrible movie.",

Everything in this movie looks cheep, dumb, recycled many times, rushed and rip offed from everything else. The only cons of this mess is some nice fight sequences obviously performed by stunts, and some nice looking locations where this picture was shoot. And that is it. In defense of this flick i can say that it's not possible to tell such a story on running time 1h30min, it's just looks so uncompleted, so rushed and on the same time so uninspiring and rushed, that these 90 min. will seem much longer while you will be watching \"The Legend of Hercules\" Overall, 4/10 for \"The Legend of Hercules\" - nothing legendary in here, except for a legendary director making a mess of a movie.",

Some similarities do exist. Son of Zeus, a Chiron in his life. Thats about it.But I wont hold it against this movie. It never claims mythological accuracy , and how accurate should we be when its a myth anyways ?The fact is that it is a shallow movie. Not very coherent. And I loved the idea of a blond Hercules with a spray on tan, don't we all ? I don't want to spend much of your time , so I will go ahead and say it. This is Gladiator , the way it should have never been done. Soulless , the action seems forced and graceless , the characters are paper thin. Sotiris (Liam McIntyre) and queen Alcmene(Roxanne McKee) the notable exceptions , and the only two that breathed a bit of life into this movie. But there's only so much you can do. A bit disappointed. There are so many ways you can go when you write a mythological character. Go for drama with well thought out action , or go for the effects extravaganza and a flamboyant hero. This is, well, its nothing. Hercules is a tormented hero, not wanted by his stepfather ,hunted by his true fathers wife (Hera). There's a reason people loved and propagated this story through the ages. It's a good story. Instead we have to suffer through every boring clich\u00e9 ? If you change a story , at least make it better. Good change we can forgive , its entertainment we seek . Some action , some cheap effects , but I was constantly tempted to skip ahead , and Im not a guy that does that regularly . Once I got wind of what this is , I suffered through it just to be able to warn people not to waste their time.

The battle scene of Hercules in Egypt with this army was quite entertaining to watch. I think they got the costumes and Greek history right so some stars for that. But the acting.....horrible...horrible especially the lady who played that queen Hebe - I am quite sure she is a porn star trying to make it in Hollywood but see needs a bit more schooling. Great breasts and butt don't make a great actress just a great porn star. I am quite sure the guy who played Hercules is an actor in Spartacus???

That changed when I read few of the reviews on this movie. I really don't understand how some people can bash this movie so hard, it's with great restraint that I refrain from name-calling because it would only diminish rest of the review.For all those who complain this is the worst movie ever and give it only one star i would like to tell you to get over yourself. I watched movies like Machete which have a rating of 6,7 right now. Talk about bad movie. I remember feeling like throwing up in my mouth figuratively speaking because as I mentioned earlier I don't really mind gore or obscene scenes but the move was so tasteless and boring and totally without any point. I still gave it a 2 star just for having famous actors in it and maybe it had one or two lines hidden in there that was slightly funny. These are my counterarguments to some of the issues brought up by those that left bad reviews.Inaccurate story? The story does not follow the usual path of the original Hercules myth. But that is what it is. A MYTH. Hercules is not real. Even if it was about something that actually had happen (like Jesus or whatever), it is a movie not a documentary so they can choose how to adapt it however they damn want! Then there is talk about equipment and clothes that aren't Greek. Seriously those kind of inaccuracies is in like every movie that portrays the past. Beside if you aren't familiar with the fashions of greeks from the ancient times you won't notice it, and even if you are familiar, it's hard to believe it's that bothersome. Special effects I admit that the lion was awful and ridiculous but the rest wasn't bad. Action I really liked the action scenes. I have not seen the movie \"300\" that so many reviewers says have been copied here, but c'mon to do something totally original today is almost impossible, of course it's doable to do that and get a good movie but but then we would only have like 3 to 5 movies a year to watch, maybe even less. (I know the statistics of the former phrase is off, the point is that it would be very few). I think the haters are just disappointed it wasn't more gore. There's even a few that claims that Hercules story is only about the gore. Don't get me wrong here I'm not against gore, I really, with big emphasis, don't mind me some well placed gore but I don't mind the lack of it in this movie. Acting I might be a bit biased when it comes to Kellan Lutz. In my POV he's a total heartthrob. I don't really have a grip on his acting yet partially to the rolls he have chosen but it's at least well above a five star out of ten. I think it will be more when he learns which rolls fits him and when he have more experience and diverse resume. I just want to make myself clear. Yes, I am a Lutz fan BUT I'm not a Twilight fan. Don't put me in the same group as them and thereby discard me as a little girl with a crush on cheesy. The other actors was also very good. I don't get why there is so much bitching about bad actors and bad acting. I mean I'm usually pretty easily annoyed with bad acting and nothing raised my eyebrow here. Overall To be honest I would probably have rated a 7 or 8 (or without Kellan; 6-7) if it wasn't for this already incredibly skewed rating. I gave it a ten in hope to repair little of the damage it didn't deserve. The movie was definitely enjoyable. I like the new take on Hercules where he is more human and normal man. I like fantasy, here it was toned down a lot but sometimes less is more. The pace was a bit fast but i guess it had to be for having time for everything. I would liked for the movie to be a little longer so that they would have time to deepen the characters.I hope this is readable and since the clock is 4am when I'm writing this, I just needed to get this of my chest so i can leave it behind me and go to bed.

I cannot stress how truly awful this movie is. They took that budget and, somehow, managed to make one seriously bad TV movie. This is the type of movie you find by pure accident while tuning an Ekco TMB 272 valve TV at some cheap motel during a heat-wave on the outskirts of that place where the navy conducted that time warp Philadelphia Experiment, and you are inexplicably waiting on a dilapidated Fageol Safety Coach, with no air conditioning and Bakelite seats, to take you to some dirt-track airstrip where they still charter Sopwith Camels \u2013 and if you're feeling particularly bold \u2013 Zeppelins or Dirigibles. Alright, that maybe a slight exaggeration, but I'd watch a film with that storyline long before I'd ever watch the rest of this green toe fungus. I do not need to repeat what others have said, but this movie should come with a health warning, I watched most of this movie and it cured my insomnia, but it gave me rickets and perhaps, although the test results are still pending, a new strain of bacterial eyeball infection that has confounded medical science. This movie is like the twisted Hills-Have-Eyes love-child of 300, Gladiator, Troy, Monty Python, Breaking Wind Part 1, and Prince of Space. This movie has had to be some sort of tax dodge benefit system for the crew who made it; otherwise, the cold hard cash that went into this was fake play money because stylistically this movie was bad, the acting was horrible, the weird sets bizarrely lacking as if it was filmed in someone's back garden, with curious lighting and cinematography, and last but not least, desperate dialogue and delivery \u2013 a masterpiece of unpleasantness.

The biggest problem I had with this movie though is that to keep the PG-13 rating they had to sacrifice some things...like blood. When you see a 5 minute fight scene that looks really brutal and you see the person die dramatically then you see the body and it looks like nothing happened at all the effectiveness of the scene is lost.

In my opinion the acting was poor with the exception of two people who ironically have the same first name, Liam Garrigan and Liam McIntyre, and Kellan Lutz was certainly not fit to play the role of the main character. He may have had brawn but the extent of his acting was a few seconds of puppy dog eyes at the camera and it wasn't impressive. The fight scenes weren't awful but they were mediocre and a bit boring at times. Many people have likened the style of the fights to that of Gladiator and it did have that feel to but Gladiator was much much better. My biggest problem with the show was the lion.

The way scenes are supposed to seamlessly blend from one to another is one of those things you only really notice when it's not there, and here the editor has probably never even heard about it.The actors are also subpar. Kellan Lutz as Hercules is convincing in the physical sense - even though facially he looks more like a thug than a Greek demigod - but he and the rest of the cast have next to no screen presence, Scott Adkins notwithstanding.The CGI is also terrible, though that's probably the budget.The thing the movie gets somewhat right is the action. There are some really nice fight sequences, reminding me of 300 at its best. Sure the limited special effects mean that they lack that final awe factor, but they're still suitably impressive. Also, the story, while kind of basic and clumsily told, could be a lot worse and doesn't really contain any major faults.As a whole The Legend of Hercules is a big disappointing mess. There's some charm to it, and if you're a fan of Renny Harlin's personal style, then this might be worth a watch. The rest of you should look elsewhere.",

Many times looking at my husband and giggling over the silliness I just witnessed. This was my grading break down. Take it for what it is.1. Action: A- Choreographed well I think. Probably the best parts of the movie. 2. Costumes: A They did very well here though not sure on accuracy especially since the idea of when/if he existed is debatable. 3. Graphics: F-A Some things were just lame (rolling eyes or hanging head lame) and yet they did a lot of 300 moves that turned out nice and saved them.4. Acting: C Problem here is that I think acting depends greatly on the director as much as their skills.5. Script: F- Do I really need to say anything else? The grade should say enough. Awkward, corny, and pointless at best. Add poor delivery and it was a disaster. 6. Story: C- I'll be nice. As one other said, the 'gladiator' idea was kind of overused. Thankfully they didn't call them gladiators. If you know ancient Greek history, you will pick out a lot of inaccuracies. At best, it's a rental. Good thing I get a discount on the my tickets.

Renny Harlin's offering looks good when borrowing the visual cues from Troy, 300, Gladiator and Alexander to name a few. However, much of the acting, setups, staging, script along with the special effects are not as balanced or on a par with some of the recent historic and fantasy TV show offerings, which out grit The Legend of Hercules. The majority of actors are left to chew on the dialogue, that said Liam McIntyre is notable and comes though unscathed along with some of the sets and locations. The costumes are nicely designed and the score by Tuomas Kantelinen is effective. Nevertheless, the handful of writers including Harlin throw in large scale (The Mummy-like) battles, slow motion fights, arena showdowns, lies and betrayal, love and loss. However, the uneven tone shifts often and emulates too many others of its genre, and struggles find it's own identity, shoehorning a love story hampers the already rocky flick. This incarnation doesn't become as engaging as it needs or wants to be which is a shame given the subject matter.It borrows from the best and there's nothing wrong with that, it just doesn't have enough execution nor conviction leaving it with a 2002 television feel rather than a filmatic quality which Harlin has delivered in the past. Even as a fantasy and low budget film fan it surprisingly radiates B-movie but it is so clich\u00e9d and uneven one can't help feel disappointed rather than entertained.",

After seeing this movie, it's difficult to realize that Harlin actually directed films like 'Cliffhanger' and 'Die Hard 2', because whatever directing chops he had in the action genre were not available anywhere here. This PG-13 film tries to be '300' throughout its 90 minute run-time, but due to the terrible script, awful acting, poorly choreographed fight scenes, and laughable special effects, makes it seem more like a made-for-TV-movie on the Lifetime channel.I mean, if you're going to have over 1,000 people die in your movie, you're gonna need at least one drop of blood. However, that's not the case with this flick as we don't see any blood, let alone anyone getting stabbed or shot with an arrow, as the camera always seems to cut away at the last moment as it goes back and forth from slow-motion to normal speed.Nobody's favorite vampire brother Kellan Lutz, plays Hercules and is as dry as they come. He has no charisma, charm, or wit about him. Sure he can yell at the sky and he has a chiseled body, but that's as far as it goes. We catch Hercules in his 20th year of life as he is frolicking with his love interest in the water. Meanwhile, back at home, his older brother is a mean, jealous sibling who will one day take over his evil tyrant father's throne and marry his brother's girl.But before that can happen, Hercules must find out that he really is the son of the God of Gods, and therefor unstoppable.This doesn't bode will for good movie making, because there is never a moment where we the audience feel like Hercules is in any real danger. Even when we see him sold into slavery and forced to fight six warriors at the same time in the vein of 'Gladiator'. And what would a Hercules movie be, if he didn't find a giant lion with his bare hands and win?This is a huge let-down for everyone involved, as not one aspect of this film was executed well with the exception of the first two minutes where we see a long track shot of Spartans charging a kingdom. From there, it nosedives and never recovers. Just say \"NO\" to 'The Legend of Hercules' and \"YES\" to anything else.",

The 3D conversion was rather good as well - I could almost have believed it was shot in 3D. I was not expecting this. I figured with a smaller budget, they'd skimp on the 3D, right? Not only was the movie entertaining and fun to watch with lots of great fight scenes in a 300, Immortals and Spartacus inspired way, but the 3D was strong all the way. From the opening scene where arrows are flying out of the screen in a shot made for 3D as we hover past a giant army at war, to the end credits, nearly every shot offered strong 3D layering in The Legend of Hercules with some great pop outs and particle effects (spears, arrows, rain, smoke, flower puffs over the pond, etc).",

Although the characters (particularly the women) were combined and juggled, and much was left out, the film captured Achilles' great conflict. He leaves home to pursue his immortality and ends up discovering his humanity. This certainly puts it far above the leering gym rat testosterone festival movies like this version of Hercules. Homer's Iliad, largely the basis for the movie Troy, is generally better film material if you're concerned with story arc rather than special effects, and they were. But The Labors of Hercules, if they actually use the mythological story, is better suited to special effects muscle films even if the film makers don't do all twelve. The thing is, the writers and director have to get it right. Homer and other ancient authors don't belabor their points, and they are writing for people of another age, with very different values. It will be interesting to see if The Rock version of Hercules preserves any of the classic -- the story of Hercules' desire to become a full demigod, and complete a meaningful penance for his earlier murder of his wife and children. To do this as a whole is, I think, more suited for a limited TV series if it is to capture each unique chapter without straying too far from the theme of guilt and redemption. If they do it as a movie, I can only hope the writers will put in the reading and study up front,as the writers of Troy obviously did.",

It also continues the trend of January being the cinematic rubbish bin where some of the worst films of the year are released. January 2014, although it's been a strong year for films, was no different. TLOH is an origins story of Hercules, which is one of my favourite Greek Myths. However, this is not Hercules. The Greek Gods play almost no part, Hercules kills the Nemean lion even though he's not doing his labours yet and Chiron isn't a centaur so this is even more insulting to Greek mythology than the 2 dreadful Clash Of The Titans duds. To be fair to this film, it's not one of those things which is so awful it's painful to watch. It's very distant, bland and unengaging and it passes too quickly to do too much damage. Still, the film is so boring and uninterested in its audience its like watching a tortoise go from one end of a long room to the other while watching from a distance through a large pane of glass. It's that dull.The acting is absolutely atrocious, with Kellan Lutz making Taylor Lautner look compelling, while the storyline is the most routine, stereotypical and dramatically listless thing I've had the misfortune to see for a long time. Die Hard 2 and Deep Blue Sea are good movies and judging by the shocks in the latter you'd think Renny Harlin was a decent director but here, although some of the shots are interesting, it's just loads of painfully tedious fight scenes. There are only so many times I can watch Hercules jump through the air in slow motion before I start to nod off. The film even dares to be similar to Gladiator. It's easily the worst film of 2014 so far. It's not interesting at all, and in terms of visuals and audience engagement can be compared to a broken, glitchy and mind numbingly stupid kids video game. I, Frankenstein was awful too, but at least that was slightly more watchable. You may think the Dwayne Johnson one looks awful but at least it'll be better than this.1/10",

Normally I don't read up the reviews of a film I go to see for the first time. Now I must admit, I had a sneak preview on IMDb. Link will be provided below as per usual. But from what I could understand in the movie of where I got the plot fully is as follows. Hercules is born as a god like the way Jesus was. as in I think a demi- god like Percy Jackson(Son of Poseidon) to a Queen. The King thinks the Queen had an affair and as naturally is mad. He forces his son Iphicles(Excuse the spelling) and Hebes to wed. However there' s a slight problem, and that problem is my sexy hunk Hercules. Hercules is in love with Hebes. \"Even if he is a memory to me, I still love him\". I went to the film, as it was described as \"Twilight heartthrob... Kellen\". By George did that live to its description. He is some heartthrob alrite. So Hercules found out that the King killed his mother ie the Queen. Initially throughout the film, he wasn't acceptance of his Godship not even acknowledging his father was a God(Zeus). So when he had heard of the murder of his mother and now his mentor(the Auld fella - Chiron I think) Hercules goes on a rampage. Overall a wonderful film to a great history lesson.

And the saddest part\u2014even sadder than the fact that the \"dumb\" vampire from \"Twilight\" was cast to play the hero for no other reason than he had a good build and acting wasn't a requirement\u2014is the fact that the Disney animated version of Hercules has more intense action and better fight scenes.The fight scenes were viciously watered down to the point that they barely qualify as fight scenes and look more like they were filming a description of what action is suppose to look like from a lifelong pacifist who secretly hates Hercules. In fact, the action sequences were just as dull and unimaginative as the story and as lifeless as Kellan Lutz's performance as the Greek mythological hero. The only real shining element of the film is the fact it serves as a reminder that a Hercules movie that stars The Rock is coming out and just having that man in the film already makes that film infinitely superior in every way.

Plot: 4/10 Not sure how accurate this was to the original mythology., but I grew up with the Disney version. The story itself seemed chopped and fast paced. To quickly it went from one thing to another. The entire film takes place in the span of a few days, so you are getting this rushed feeling the entire time you are watching it. Even the final battle was anticlimactic, and so was the romance, like romeo and Juliet. The movie was very predictable in my own opinion and even my 11 yr old brother was calling out what would happen next. Visuals: 4/10 I would have marked it lower, but there honestly was some very good cinematography. There were some scenes that were very beautiful. But for the most part, the majority of the film was cheap cgi and obvious green screen (or whatever color screen they use now). Scenes like the waterfall scene at the very beginning where hercules takes a dive looks like someone photographed him in that position then threw the photo down the waterfall. Honestly I was hoping for something visually striking like 47 Ronin, but was very sadly mistaken.Sex/Nudity: 2/10 *Spoiler* One \"sex\" scene at the very beginning were zeus (who is invisible) has sex with the queen in her tent. Though it just looks like she is self pleasing herself under the cover. There is no nudity in the film.Profanity: 1/10 I had subtitles on, I don't recall any profanity. Maybe the use of damn and other swear words, but no F*cks or any other hardcore language.Violence: 6/10 Not much blood, at least compared with 300. The fighting scenes are kind of cool. Some off it seems like a rip off of other fight scenes like Leonidas' last stand in 300. The cgi ruined some of the fight scenes since it was so blatantly obvious it was fake. All in all, hardly any blood and no guts.This movie was rather a disappointment and i wont go out of my way to watch it again.",

Shallow and pointless, just like today's youth, it lack substance, but has plenty of pretty faces.

Hercules is shown to be extremely strong when fighting an indestructible lion and later struggles with ordinary people, such an approach somewhat disorients the viewers, which is certain that there is no constant definition of his strength.

It's not the worst movie ever, I mean, it has some qualities. Kind of. But at a 70 million dollar budget, it's atrocious.It feels like an early Uwe Boll-movie.Not all the acting is super bad, but most of it is. It's uninspired and flat. The CGI is, especially in some places, very, very bad. Like, cheap-adventure-TV-series-bad. Sinbad or something. The costumes look really fake, so does the weapons, all the props really. The action, now here is where it is almost a little cool, they have used some slo-mo effects, to mimic the perfect action of 300, but it is so poorly done! It's like the slo-mo is just totally randomly thrown in. Shame. Scott Atkins, which is an incredible martial artist, is wasted completely.The best thing about this movie, is the story it self, which is a classic tale.When people say this or that movie is bad, they should see this one, to see what a truly bad movie looks like.Renny Harlin knows how to make entertaining movies, I really wonder what happened with this!",

The baddies were slimy, bad and soon dis-likeable, as they should be.\nNoticed some odd things but the story flowed for me, just a few jumps here and there.\nThe Greeks held athletic games, but not gladiatorial death fights. They show cased the red plumed corinthian helmet in this movie, but Greek soldiers wore a a great range of mostly bronze helmets, so it would have been nice to see more.\nHercules/Al came from Thebes, an important town in ancient Greece, It has no Port and is far inland. By the way his real name was Heracles, the Romans used the name Hercules.\nBut no matter. I really liked the Hercules character. He was approachable, vulnerable, loyal, committed, compassionate, romantic, strong and tender. The real Hercules was probably memorable but volatile, moody, selfish prankster who had little conscience about killing, but a valuable asset on your side in battle, like most psychopaths.\nI dialogue was at times cheesy or predictable, other times was realistic for what was happening. The most predictable was the cry of \" we fight for FREEDOM fellow Greeks, let us take back the kingdom that was taken from us by this tyrant\".\nI was thinking in the last scene where Hercs and Hebe are in bed holding their baby boy, \"now that he is King, he'll be looking after the sewage system, appointing supreme court judges, revoking the previous kings treaties, opening markets and and the attending court, plus loving his Hebe and going to war in spring.\" Yes he will be free and very very busy not becoming a tyrant like his stepdad.",

And compared to this film, Steve Reeves, the greatest Hercules of all was Oscar worthy... Only the two Liams and Adkins were memorable in their roles. The unconvincing and jerky CGI in the action sequences was very annoying and if it isn't skillful enough to be undetectable it should be reserved for cartoons only. The older films that used real actors and sets are far more realistic, naturally. I wish 300 had never been made, it was bloated and idiotic and has apparently had the undesirable effect of making shoddy, unrealistic epics acceptable.

Everybody's sick of 3D so that's why they dropped the first one. Then they must have seen a rough cut of the film an realized it was never going to be a franchise so they settled for the last one. In the first 10 minutes it becomes clear that they're ripping of '300'. Tons of slomotion fights and the same sephia like color palette. After Mr. H gets sold into slavery it goes straight to a 'Gladiator' ripoff including a Proximo clone. I'm sure they ripped off other films if forgot to mention but it should be clear that originality wasn't a high priority here. Lead actor Lutz goes around topless for 95% of the film so they can show off his pumped up abs and shaved legs (Renny demanded that, hairy legs don't work too well in 3D - seriously). Short of a Braun commercial this was the filmmakers best attempt of getting women into the cinema seats. Those women sure won't be paying attention to the cookie-cutter dialogue, even when delivered with a British accent. In short: Lutz is no Russel Crowe but a cardboard (3D) protagonist. Strangely enough there is no female nudity, only male - so this MUST be a chick flick. The only plus in this pile of three dimensional rubbish is the visuals and the production value. The VFX are nicely done. The costumes, helmets, swords, sandals and sets are quite great to look at considering it was all done for a lowly 70m$. But that's not enough to make a memorable film. If you've seen it once you won't ever feel the urge to see it again. The Rock stars in another Hercules film which has quite an impressive trailer, so let's hope they can give it the depth to make it a success.",

However, the execution leaves much to be desired.The sets are beautiful, but unfortunately we don't get to see a lot of it. Many of the scenes are set at night or in dark halls which means a lot of detail is lost. I suppose the producers thought the action would be the focus, but alas, it fails to excite on so many levels. Yes, there are lots of fighting, but the fighting is marred by excessive use of \"bullet-time\". Someone should tell them bullet-time is good for bullets, and even then, only some bullets. Every time a scene gets exciting or someone is about to get a good smack somewhere, the action slows down. Maybe it's supposed to help you appreciate the kill-blow or choreography, but all it did for me was slow my heart-rate when it should be sped up.The CG effects are mediocre and instead of helping you immerse yourself in the story, it distracts you by letting you wonder what went wrong. The famous Nemean Lion looks like a normal lion - where's the fun it that? And shouldn't an immortal like Hercules have been scripted better action and stunt acts? Even mortal men in movies about mortals have better action and stunt sequences.The dialogue style may be appropriate for a Greek mythological film, but after a while, it sounds contrived. There's no imagination in it - you don't feel for the characters. Instead you get tired of all the macho posturing after some time.The movie does not totally fail though. It still manages to plod along fairly, and some of the story elements are worth watching. But all in all, don't watch this (there are better movies about mythological heroes) unless you're a fan of a shirtless Kellen Lutz or there is nothing better to watch (are you sure there isn't??).",

In other words it was quite awful.

Now for the FX. For every fight scene there was a slow motion cut for every other sword swing or punch/kick thrown. To put it simply the fight scenes were like an old man trying to pee with a very bad prostate infection, you get a little, then it stops, then more, then stops again.

It is an epic story of Hercules to growing up from ordinary human to a demi god. It is a story of good and evil, bad stepfather, bad king and betraying brother and it is a love story between Hercules and princess of Crete. I like the way that Renny Harlin can bring a solid story out of the mediocre script. I also like Renny's way to use camera an keep it move all the time. It makes a movie looks more cinematographic and deeper. Too many movies today are too hectic, like music videos and this kind of tranquil filming is more relaxing. It is offence that this movie didn't get theatrical release here in Finland and I was forced to watch it from TV. 3D looks great in the movie and I can only imagine how it would looked in big screen. Choreography of the fighting scenes looks good and speedy. But not so good that there is something bad too. Low age limit of the movie makes all fighting scenes almost bloodless and that eats credibility from fighting scenes. This decision must come from production company more than from director and it is a shame. Maybe they just wanted to get lower age limit to this movie and I'm quite sure that Renny has nothing to do with this decision. Renny also has a ability to get something out even the worst actors. I'm sorry Mr. Lutz, but I think that you are more model than actor. Scott Adkins is convincing as bad king and stepfather, but Liam Garrigan as Iphicles is not very good. There has been a lot of talking about movies CGI and how bad they are, but for me it looks good enough at least when to watch it from TV. The Legend of Hercules works as a family movie quite well, but it's bloodless may exile more adult audience.",

I understand that movies cannot be a mirror to reality or myth or books, but when I look at the now quiet long history of movie making and the transforming of history some well documented even of the USA or recent events (like the Western) it has been often an outside movie maker that has told the reality of the story, never a US movie maker!

            "content": "Hollywood turns to Greek mythology for inspiration and comes up with The Legend of Hercules, directed by Renny Harlin and starring Kellan Lutz as the eponymous demigod. As imagined by Harlin and three other credited screenwriters, Hercules is conceived by the king of the gods to deliver his people from the tyranny of the evil King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins). But though Hercules grows up with superhuman strength and skill, only his mother knows he is the son of Zeus. Ironically, Hercules doesn't believe in the gods, and considers his mother's beliefs a waste of time. He prefers to invest his time in the very earthly charms of Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss). But when Hercules sees his beloved ordered to marry Amphitryon's eldest son, the young man rebels, earning himself an exile where the King intends for him to die and be forgotten. Can Hercules reconcile himself to the fact that he is the son of a god and fulfill the heroic destiny his mother imagined for him?The plot isn't half bad, and even if it isn't exactly in line with Greek mythology as recorded it could still be a fine story. But while The Legend of Hercules isn't a failure, it is merely a mixed success of sorts. One of the biggest problems is Hercules himself--or rather, Kellan Lutz. Lutz isn't a good fit for the role at all. He lacks the presence required to play a demigod successfully and frankly is too feminine for a part that requires literally superhuman machismo. And while the general storyline is fine, the script suffers in detail. The dialog is often cheesy and too many plot points are awkwardly realized, as though they were not only written hurriedly but acted and directed on the fly. The script flirts with a certain gravitas near the end, but then throws an opportunity to finish with a real punch away in favor of a more conventional--but far weaker--ending that is virtually inexplicable.On the positive side, some of the rest of the cast is excellent, especially Scott Adkins as Amphitryon. Adkins has been slowly building a formidable reputation among action performers the last several years, and he brings an on screen power to his role as the wicked but mighty King Amphitryon that Lutz simply never matches. It would have been wiser to let Adkins have the starring role as opposed to the younger, more effeminate Lutz. Likewise, Gaia Weiss virtually ignites the screen every time she enters a scene. She's not only almost painfully beautiful, but plays the part of the lovelorn princess with a rare grace and charisma. Production values are fairly good. The ancient setting of mythical Greece is well developed, and the special effects are pretty convincing. There are a lot of violent action scenes, and while blood is kept to a minimum to stay under the PG-13 umbrella there is still plenty of graphic, bone-crunching mayhem. The final battle between Herclues and Amphitryon is quite thrilling, albeit undercut by the aforementioned belly flop that takes the easy way out.To top it off, there is some attempt to explore religious themes in a meaningful way, including several Biblical analogies. The film actually comes across as a pro-faith vehicle and could even be interpreted as at least partly being a Christian allegory, though sometimes only clumsily so.In the end, The Legend of Hercules is entertaining enough for fans of action, science fiction and fantasy, but it's hardly \"legendary\" in any real sense. It's basically a Scy-Fy Original with a bigger budget. That's fine as far as it goes, but while you may have fun watching this movie, you probably won't remember much about it a few hours later.",

No, I am not a hater but that's how it is! :) For the most part, this movie is not to be taken seriously. It's soooooooo loosely based on the name of Hercules. It's a Hercules movie for Hercules sake. It's literally on the same par as Arnold and Sally Field's Hercules in New York.I kept wondering if they rented the costumes from the same company that did 300. Most of the stuff the actors wore didn't even fit (not that they were wearing much). The most prominent one was the helmet.The acting was non existent. It's a great training exercise and get paid. Not a bad deal honestly. A lot of people go to school for that kind of experience. I'd think most of the money was spent on the CGI of the movie, that took probably 90+ percent of the scenes.I like Kellan Luts for being Kellan Luts. You just don't expect much from him. He's eye candy and that's all that matters. He's more watchable than the vampire guys, or the wolves in the vampire movies. Poor guy just needs a big break and he'll be on top of everything.

            "content": "There are some films that are made just for fun, made for creating a pleasant hour and a half in a cinema, and I believe everyone should keep that in mind before deciding what to watch. After seeing the trailer, everyone can pretty much get the idea of what to expect with The Legend of Hercules. I read some very bad reviews before watching, and thanks to that, I can say I was even pleasantly surprised with the film. Of course, the plot is rather simple and predictable, the characters are portrayed black and white, but does that really matter when you buy a ticket for a 3D blockbuster? I believe it doesn't. What matters in such case are the fast-moving plot and the energy it brings. I can say that I really enjoyed it from the very first scene, in which soldiers prepare to attack the fortress of Argos, where I got the short feeling of actual being in the battle. I loved all the special effects, and they are the reason for my high mark. If I hadn't watched it in 3D technique, maybe I wouldn't have liked the film that much, but 3D effects certainly did their job. The magic of the film would probably be lost without them. I just need to make a comment on another issue - illogicality in portraying ancient Greek history that many people discussed here. In my opinion, this is less important. If the director had wanted to teach us history more accurately, he would've probably made a documentary. In conclusion, this is the film for all those who'd like to forget about the outside world for 90 minutes and enjoy the action and illusion history can bring.",

Instead, this story is derivative of all those 60s sword and sandal stories from Italy in which the wronged son of the king has to return to his home and wrest the throne from his evil king/father.The acting is all over the place, as are the accents. Kellan Lutz can't quite cut it as the title character. Other than the muscles he just doesn't come across as Hercules, he is too pretty and his performance lacks believability, though the thin scripting doesn't help. Some of the supporting cast do better, though, again, the script gives them little to work with.The fight scenes go from reasonably exciting to ludicrously laughable. The countless slo-mo leaps through the air, complete with angry shouting, only serve to remind the viewer of the far superior movie 300. The CGI effects are only fair and do not help matters, particularly when Herc is whipping the chains around attached to the pillar blocks and in the final confrontation with the lightning whip effects.I've seen a lot worse, but this is only worth watching if there is nothing else you're even moderately interested in seeing.",

            "content": "I found this movie to be a refreshing change from the typical Hollywood left wing fare we are force fed year after year. The storyline bore almost no resemblance to the mythology of Hercules, but was nonetheless a heroic story of Men being allowed to be men without all the angst and self recrimination prevalent in almost every movie Hollywood produces.One of the highlights of the film is the fact that Hercules embraced his godhood and his father Zeus. He admitted that he did not understand who he really was and when told his father was Zeus, he did not immediately accept it, but eventually came to appreciate what that meant.He is able to accept and use his godhood when needed, but he also embraced his manhood when he fought the final battle as a man with the evil king. It also made for a more action packed movie instead of what it would have been had he struck down the king with a bolt of lightening from above.The only concession to the progressive left was the lone female fighting in the arena, something that would NEVER happen in Greek society, Xena Warrior Princess notwithstanding. Even with that, they did not portray her as this unrealistic superwoman who nearly defeats Hercules. I did fund it interesting that she was the only warrior who was not killed.The bad guys were evil through and through from start to finish, and the good guys were heroic and self sacrificing. There is no moralizing, or preaching, it is a pure action film and should be judged as such.I am not surprised by the number of low ratings given by people who have been raised on movies that portray men as weak, angst ridden, cartoonlike characters, who are subservient to strong women who guide them back to the path of progressive righteousness.If you long for the days when men were portrayed as heroic and strong, both physically and morally, then this is the perfect movie for you.",

You have a myth that you can either try to copy it or change it completely but have a good result and a movie fun to watch... This movie does do either!\nIn the myth Hera wants to kill Heracles (sends snakes when he was a baby) here, his birth is her own idea! His father was a fugitive! not a king and he loved Hercules.His brother had a good relationship with him, so good that he followed him in many of his campaigns until he died in one of them. Ivi was a minor goddess of youth, doughter of Zeus and Hera. Nemea's (Nemea is a Territory! he had to GO there) Lion was one of his 12 Labours around Greece and not just a random Lion near his home!. Greeks buried their dead not burn them. \"Sotiris\" (from Sotiria->Salvation) and other names used on this movie are modern Christian names!!! Not ancient Greek names. There were not such underground fights before Romans and Sicily was Greek back then. Romans were not even a thing when Hercules was supposedly around (we are talking about thousants of years apart) so watching \"gladiators\" in a movie about Hercules is SO rediculous. Talos was not the king of Crete!! Talos was a bronze \"Robot\" (an automaton) guarding Crete from side to side. Chiron was a centaur not an old man and he was Achilles tutor/teacher not Hercule's. Even his mother is younger than him in that movie (reminds me the same stupidity in \"Alexander\"). And this is for the first 60 minutes as i am watching this, i dont even want to imagine what will happen in the last 30 minutes. As i said, even though i am Greek i dont have a problem if you change the myth... after all they are just myths, but if you do so, do it so that the result is better than the original myth or at least as good or there is no point to write something so much worse!!! The movie Hercules with Dwayne Johnson (same year) did so much better job! There the myth was MUCH more accurate but with a twist that was very much acceptable, so its not that they messed up historic timelines like in Xena, at least Hercules and Zena from the 90's were fun. The problem here is that the result is so BAD and not fun at all..",

            "content": "'The legend of Hercules' is a re-imagining of the story of the titular Greek mythological character, Hercules. In this version of the story the stepfather of Hercules is a warlord who for reasons left ambiguous needs to be stopped so much that his wife preys to the goddess Hera for a way to stop his reign of terror. The result of said prayer was of course for Hera's husband to impregnate the warlord's queen. Twenty years later the demigod son falls in love with a princess from another kingdom that was prearranged into a marriage with Hercules' half brother. He is sold into slavery because of this and must fight his way back for her and to save Greece from his step-father.This film doesn't stick very closely to the source material as it tells its story. In fact it even at times seems to go out of its way to include more and more clich\u00e9s in some sort of attempt to spice up the drama but ultimately falls flat to deliver an interesting story by doing so. This story takes several moments from other Greek mythological heroes that are not credited to Hercules, and credits them to Hercules! There are times when the script is so all over the place that it feels like you're watching random scenes from different movies. The acting in this movie is somewhere between sub-par and terrible, with the only acceptation being Roxanne McKee who actually managed to deliver in her role as Hercules' mother and made her the single interesting character in the film. Two particularly bad performances were from Kellan Lutz, who played the lead titular character, and Scott Adkins, who played the tyrannical step-father. Scott Adkin's take on the antagonist he is portraying is to utter every single line of his dialogue with either shouting or growling, which makes his character come across as laughably cartoony as best. The lead actor of this film, Kellan Lutz, is wooden, dull, and fails on every single dimension to bring any kind of presence to the epic character he is playing. The special effects for this film were on occasion fun and held up exceptionally well compared to some independent Youtube videos. However, at a budget of seventy million dollars the CGI was unacceptably cheap looking and blatantly intended for 3D effects, with the occasional effect taken straight from the five-year-old's play book of sword-under-the-arm technology (which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't the armpit on the camera's side). The far too short fight sequences utilized a special effect taken straight from 300 where the camera slightly zooms in and goes to slow motion just before an attack connects. This effect worked in 300 because to choreography was centred around that aspect, whereas here it's haphazardly thrown in and seems very out of place and overused.The soundtrack to this film is by far its most redeeming quality. The tracks were kept simple but effective with this ambiance of an epic tale unfolding in front of you. The composer to these songs was very clearly inspired by the source material of the film and created one of the best sword and sandal film scores I've ever heard.Ultimately, my opinion comes down to this: Buy or listen to the soundtrack, skip the film. Kellan Lutz has shown me that he would be far more qualified to play the lead in an underwear commercial than he would be in another major motion picture. I watched this film twice, the first time I admit I was amused by it because of the banter between myself and those I witnessed it with. Because of this I thought the movie was merely mediocre. The second time however I did so alone and was able to truly experience what it had to offer. It sounds great, but it also looks bad, it's acted poorly, It's uninteresting, uninspired, boring, clich\u00e9, and hard to sit through.",

The director's choice to constantly have items flying through the air (raindrops, flower petals, etc.) is also distracting (I saw the film in 2D; these effects are perhaps a clumsy attempt to justify the 3D format it was also released in), and the near constant use of slow motion is terribly annoying.

It seems the movie business is the only field where you cannot get a refund for purchasing something you find faulty. I will speak to my lawyers tonight and see if its possible to sue someone or all people involved in the making of this movie. First i would sue the scriptwriters for the unbelievably cringe worthy love dialogue which i think was taken from a\" auto random love dialogue generator webpage\". then i would sue the editors for placing the slow motion fight scenes ripped off by 300 and then overused every 10 seconds for insignificant fight scenes. then i would sue for copywrite infringement because it seems they used the famous 300 line in spirit to \"take everything from them\" meaning they took everything from 300 and everything from gladiator and left nothing for originality.This movie had nothing to do with Hercules in mythology other than the name. This was the most pathetic plot I've ever come across. Sometimes i watch movies like this and wonder how they got the budget to make it.",

There wasn't anything 'legendary' about this version of the story of Hercules. It's actually pretty forgettable. Like many others have said, the cgi is pretty hokey, when they were on the ship in the 'sea', I was hoping, expecting a sea monster to pop up but alas, no just fake waves, you could tell they were in the studio. When they landed in Egypt, I was hoping, expecting a giant scorpion or something to pop up, alas no, just boring, not scary or intimidating men in plastic costumes. The laughable boring plot. The times they actually showed something supernatural, they could have saved their money, it looked like a grade school science project. They ignored the good parts of the story of Hercules, watered down and completely messed up the story of Hercules. They should have decided to make a movie about gladiators with no magic/God's or special powers or went all out on special effects/monsters. Instead we get a half boring gladiator/crappy magical movie. I could go on and on but that's my 2 cents.",

The lead actor playing Hercules wasn't an amazing actor but from experience the muscle men in many films are not as well endowed in acting skills as they are in musculature...his lover, the princess wasn't any great shakes either so they made a fine couple.

Well actually I do not think there was any mythological accuracies, except that Herc kills the Nimeanan Lion, but not even in the right way. Historically it is even worse, the only historical aspect that is right is that their buildings were not all white marble they were actually painted mostly red, this is accurate with the time period. The soldiers' armor on the other hand seems to be a cross of Golden Age Spartan and Roman Empire armor, placed on soldiers that were supposed to have lived prior to or in the Bronze Age. A majority of the men were riding horses into battle, something the Greeks would not be doing, or at least not all the men on horses, because stirrups were about 1500 years in the making, rendering horses ineffective. I could go on for days on the inaccuracies and horrible movie making, but I will spare the trouble.

I saw very little of the Hercules legend in this movie that was correct. But who is to say for sure how Hercules really lived his life. Everyone always focuses on his powers and gifts from his Greek father who is a god and expects him to go around slaughtering the town, beating up all the baddies, and advancing his prowess and legends. Maybe there was more to Hercules. Dare I say he had the feelings and emotions of a mortal man, that he had a true love and was consumed by his feelings for her. That he would be a good man who would do what was right and stand up for justice, and just maybe in those times of need he drew upon something that was more than he realized he had. Does there need to be magic and awe in every line, in every paragraph.I know nothing of this director and I don't try to be a witty reviewer or big philosophical critic of movies. I do know that in this version of Hercules, I saw a real hero who was just a man, yet more, and I could more readily believe that this version of Hercules existed than the mythical legend most of society believes in.For those of you who haven't seen it, you have to go into it with an open mind. The point of this movie really has nothing to do with any of the Herculean legends we all know. If your looking for that, I guarantee you that you will hate this movie.",

Like the matrix, you have to see it to believe it. Kevin Lutz as Hercules can't act to save his life. Scott Adkins (famous as Van Damme's co-star in most of Van Damme's movies in the past 6-8 years) is absolutely out of place as the King Amphitryon. The 'story' revolves around how Hercules come to be, his outcast & gladiatorial life and return to eventually claim the throne. That's it. There is absolutely nothing to care for in this dud of a movie.If you hate your life or want to know how to make a bad movie with $40 million, this will tickle your fancy.Renny Harlin already holds the distinction for the most expensive box office flop of all time - Cutthroat Island (1995) cost $98 million and recovered a paltry $10 million.

But this is a fine example of how sometimes the standard can drop a bit. Kellan Lutz comes right out of the Twilight series and into yet another bad career choice. He is a pretty bad actor in this, not terrible or at the low level of Tommy Wiseau or anyone similar. Undeniably bad though, just like the whole cast. Scott Adkins is by far the worst as arguably the most clich\u00e9d and painful to watch movie villain of all time King Amphitryon. Every single sentence he says is overly dramatic and in a deep raspy voice. You have got to give the cast a tiny bit of credit though, because some of the dialogue they are working with is incredibly cheesy. There are one or two genuinely cool lines dotted about the predictable plot, but not enough to redeem the bad ones. Just by looking at the trailer you could tell this was going to be a wannabe 300, just like Immortals, full of dumb brainless slow motion shots which didn't even work in 300 for gods sake. Every punch thrown or kick kicked is clumsy and gives the fight sequences that movie ruining thing: a crash bang wallop feel. You might be wondering what that means. I'm basically saying the action scenes have no intelligence or talent in them whatsoever. The worst thing about this whole goddamn punch fest of a movie though is undoubtedly the sex scenes. One of the first things you see in the movie is a woman being impregnated by Zeus (who is of course not actually there) and it is executed so badly and performed so terribly you won't even believe your eyes. Or regrettably your ears, if you know what I mean.The Legend of Hercules is shoddily written and acted, only a fool would enjoy this almost instantly forgettable but not boring money maker.

This was good movie and I wouldn't have felt cheated had I paid the full price of admission.I have to give the disclaimer that if you enter the theater looking for epic battles against intimidating odds or an epic boss fight, you'd be wise to look elsewhere. While the film makes an attempt at presenting 'baddies' the greatest sense of apprehension you feel is that characters will be lost to each other, not necessarily taken by some fate of a cruel ancient world. While the above may seem merely semantic, this is a finer nuance of the film viewers would do well to keep in mind as they watch.The Legend of Hercules was a movie that attempted to be a romantic action-adventure. I stress romantic first because my impression of the movie is the directors focused more on the romantic relationships of its characters rather than building up the tyranny of the king, his would be predecessor or any other subsequent foe. For adrenaline junkies, this would be a buzz kill. For me, I figure they expected the Hercules film starring the Rock to encompass that sort of storyline and attempted to be distinct.I left the theater satisfied by the direction and acting in this film. I remain confused as to why there was so much negativity about the film. I figure people were disappointed because they THOUGHT the film should have been a showcase of action and adventure when those things were merely secondary to the quest for love. As a parting note, I must say Weiss is STUNNING. One look at her and you'll realize the logic behind crafting the film around a tireless desire to be at her side rather than wondering the globe in search of endless quests to test one's mettle.",

Kellan Lutz is likable in the lead role but he's about as Greek as Gold's Gym. Overall, it's a bit of a mash-up of other films, most obviously Gladiator. In particular, the character of Hercules' evil half-brother apes the performance of Joaquin Phoenix, and Kenneth Cranham (Shine On Harvey Moon - that dates me) must have been told to channel Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner. I liked some of the minor characters, especially a priestess possessed by a god (Mariah Gale as Tiresias presumably, I started getting lost with the Greek names) and sometimes the CGI works to good effect. More often than not though, the crowd scenes look like a poorly-rendered video game and the romantic trysts, excerpts from The Blue Lagoon (a 1980 erotic film). I found it frequently lost credibility, usually because of the mixture of accents (East End London, Australian...) and lush forest scenes filmed in Bulgaria. It looked and sounded like Robin of Sherwood and Street Fighter, rather than an epic tale of Greco-Roman mythology.",

It was not the worst movie I have watched but I did find many faults.There did not seem to be a flow in the movie and scenes were not long enough for the most part. Then there were the scenes that were too long. The fight scenes were quite disappointing, especially where Hercules fights 6 who have never lost a fight before to gain freedom for himself and Sotiris. If you blinked you would have missed watching Hercules killing the 5 men and pinning down the woman. That is how quickly this scene was over.The final fight between King Amphitryon and Hercules was brilliant and almost worth watching all of the movie before it.I do feel that this movie does rate between 4 or 5 stars and that might be a bit too much. It is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.Renny Harlin directed this movie and I looked at some of his past movies and he seems to make pretty much the same quality of movies as this one. I am truly stumped as to why he was given a 70 million dollar budgeted movie. The acting was quite poor for most of the actors but not all can be blamed on the actors when the writing was poor as well.

            "content": "This movie was one of the largest piles of craps in the year of 2014. Let's start with the most glaring of these mistakes.The lack of characterization and development makes this movie bland a boring. We're given a large number of stock characters as the main characters, told to care about their plots and that's about it. The Jealous tyrant, the envious older sibling, the soldier/family man, the old mentor, and the list goes on. Other than the brother, we are offered no characterization beyond this, and the brother offers minimal characterization at most. At multiple times, he looks as though he regrets his actions but it is never expanded on and then forgotten.No suspense. Never once was the abilities of the main character called into question. Never once did he go into a fight with the audience on the edge of their seats wondering how he will survive this fight or if he had the guts to take on his newest opponent. Hercules goes into every fight either completely dominating his opponent or getting captured. Never once in the entire movie was he given a fight that reduced him to running on fumes, winning only at the last second by a miracle burst of adrenaline. True, he is a demigod and thus the normal rules don't apply to him but what fun is a character the never gets tired, never allows injuries to affect him, or never calls into question his own strength.The third and final thing I will put is the god-awful script. Ignoring the lack of characterization, let's look at other things. The forced dialogue where it exists makes it hard to focus on the movie and the action scene were boring, at best. The romance was horribly drawn out and forced, giving no real sense of connection between Hercules and whoever it was he romanced (see completely forgettable). Besides being told repeatedly they are in love, we are given nothing these two bond over. The movie is also filled with so many clich\u00e9s my hand would cramp up before I finished writing them all.",

Added amphitheaters, when gladiators didn't even exist. 6. Added helmets that resembled Murmillo gladiators 7. Didn't do research on Gladiators types (Secutores, Bestarii, Hoplomachi, etc) 8. No legitimacy in formations 9. Allies from HOA? (Horn of Africa). HOA was tribal up until the spread of Islam, only Berbers were of any significance here, I should rate this 1 but it's got some landmarks, so I can't.Well, that's pretty much it.

I would give this one an 8/10.21 & Over is an insult to comedy, or movies period. The simple fact that it was rated higher on average than Hercules tells me to look elsewhere for reviews of movies I haven't seen. Obviously, the Hoi Polloi of reviewers on this site wouldn't know what a good movie was if it slapped them across the face.A good comedy would be something like The Hangover, or 21 Jump Street, maybe Superbad. Or if you want to think while you are watching comedies, try one of those older Clerks/Clerks2/Mallrats/Jay and Silent Bob Movies. If you have any kind of sense of humor or intellect, those movies should make you laugh. 21 & Over should be burned.Hercules was pretty good.

And it would be ok to me, had it been just a decent action movie. I can't believe someone payed to film this garbage. I can't even begin to describe how bad EVERYTHING was.

I seriously haven't seen a film this bad since I saw Disaster Movie. Maybe this should have been called The Disaster of Hercules.Renny Harlin should take some directing lessons from Ridley Scott and Peter Jackson because he cannot shoot an epic film. The movie could have easily been made into a television series and I think if it were, Harlin would have payed more attention to detail and the storyline because he would've had more time to shoot each scene in depth. Also maybe would've thought twice before hiring Kellan Lutz as Hercules.",

The acting is wooden and the cast a load of nobody z listers (if that)-Hercules himself looks like he's spent more time waxing his chest and whitening his teeth than he has on his acting career, the plot doesn't flow and is utterly un-engaging, the props and costumes look cheap, it screams 'low budget' and the special effects and cgi had my partner and I laughing.

It would be to much to ask for them to do a historical research cause Hercules mini skirt would not give much for imagination. And can they run a bit faster cause they were pretty slow in everything, running, fighting... And the age difference, Hercules seems like he was the same age as his mother and father and the brother looked older then all of them together.

            "content": "The myth of Hercules is one with many versions even in ancient Greece since many cannot seem to agree exactly what this hero did and like to add their tales. Movies and TV series have also thrown their own versions in and made this legend a very full pot of which one can choose many story lines and run them. With so many choices for the Greek hero, it is very hard to believe that the best the producers could come up with was a \"Gladiator-Hercules\".This movie was a bad imitation of 300 and the \"Titans\" movies, full with the slow motion action fight scenes and the ridiculous gymnastic leaps that no self-respecting soldier would ever attempt since he would probably end up skewered before he even landed.The historical and mythological aspects were completely inaccurate and full of anachronisms since the \"Colosseum style, Gladiator fights\" was something that became a habit during the Roman Republic, more than a millennium after Hercules' time. The clothing and armour were also more Roman than Ancient Greek, and bad imitations at that too. And despite all that, the worst of all may have been the dialogs that seemed more Shakespearean than anything that has to do with ancient Greece.Still this could have worked anyway if the story and the acting was anything worth watching but that wasn't the case. The story was overly rushed at some points and too slow at others and way too romance-focused for it to work in the Fantasy/Action genre. Kellan Lutz, while very good eye-candy, has very poor acting abilities and would have been much better suited for an underwear model than an actor, I'm not usually overly critical of acting(because what do I know?) but playing a mostly tragic character and smirking the whole time just doesn't work. McIntyre and Weiss while marginally better, still failed to impress. The one good surprise came with McKee who gave a very good performance and if she had more screen time could have well made the movie watchable.The battle scenes and visual effects were equally laughable and badly done.The end result is a mess of a movie that I watched half on fast- forward. Luckily the Ratner version of Hercules was much better done.",

I was drawn into the plot from the very beginning, although I would have preferred a little more mythology in the movie, but then again it focused on Hercules at a younger age. I really enjoyed the whole movie and am not sure why it has so many poor reviews. It has great actors and has a plot beyond the blood and fighting (which is all the other version has). Definitely worth watching! If you weren't thrilled with the other version, give this one a try. The chemistry between the two leading actors is great and I thought Kellen was a perfect Hercules. I almost did not recognize him (from Twilight) in this movie. He is a great leading actor and this movie has not been given the credit it deserves. The set and scenery was actually believable for the most part, especially compared to other movies which are mostly CGI. The other 2014 Hercules is basically a '300'ish adaptation, if that's you're thing then watch that one, but if you want a movie with real characters beyond the fighting and a plot, then this movie is the clear winner!",

This movie makes a mockery of the story of Hercules that we all know so well. It brings to life NOTHING familiar from the mythological tale.Whats disappointing is that they made the movie so cheesy. The acting was sloppy, the dialogs overdone and music, well, cheesier still. Throughout the movie I waited eagerly for Hercules to hit his stride and finally embrace his Zeus-ness.

The movies editor obviously had no idea what he was doing, it seems that the producer was presented with horrible options and chose the absolute worst choices out of many, and the director probably just showed up on set to receive credit in a movie that (much to my dismay) went to theaters for a while. The special effects (which wouldn't be fit for even the 'land of the lost' series) were terrible. The scene with the nemean lion made you want to walk out and demand a refund if you had not already done so after the first two scenes.

They are so inaccurate and give people the wrong perception of history, then again, The Legend of Hercules was directed by Renny Harlin, and he wouldn't put his name on any old thing. After praying to Zeus for guidance, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) is picked to carry the son of God. The King however knows that Hercules (Kellan Lutz) isn't his and commits an act of betrayal that separates Hercules from the woman he loves. When I think of the mighty Hercules, Kellan Lutz isn't the first name that comes to mind, but he does a pretty solid job with the role. The rest of the cast also performed equally well, and for once the cast wasn't the problem. A film like this has a story to tell and that story can't be told in an hour and half. I enjoyed the narrative, but the best parts of the film were so rushed, that I felt slighted. The whole Egyptian angle should have been a major theme, but it only lasts about ten minutes, and before you know it, Herc is fighting for his life is arenas around the world, scenes that were also rushed. The film is very straight forward and far too predictable for a story like this. There are Kings and Gods, legends from thousands of years ago, but no twists or turns? No surprises thrown in for dramatic effect at least? Overall, the film is somewhat entertaining and as I said the cast was good, but The Legend of Hercules flies by at the speed of light, which makes the film difficult to really get behind.",

You will not believe how stupid this all looks, it will blow your mind.\nThe movie has no plot what so ever but it kind of feels like this we see Hercules with another name which you won't remember or care for, his brother takes credit for killing the lion that Hercules kills is going to marry the princess but she doesn't want to marry him cause she loves Hercules, Hercules is presumed dead. But he does a gladiator type thing gets kidnapped and bands an army who will fight beside him to stop the king and his brother.\nThere was another Hercules movie that came out after this one and while I don't like it and consider it to be kind of bad, I honestly think that was a better adaption of the legend of Hercules then this. All this film seems to be is some sort of Greek film with a famous character with one poor action scene after another that consist of slow mo when you know for a fact it isn't needed. Along with all the other horrendous movies that have come out this year it like the actors are sleep walking or are a loaf of bread.\nWhen I think of a movie that says the legend of(insert famous character) I'm always hoping it will be awesome but it never is.

            "content": "Unoriginal, abysmally uninspired, and unintentionally hilarious, The Legend of Hercules is lifeless (expect some laughable parts) and uninteresting in every way.\n\nPlease stop me if you heard this before. Hercules (Kellan Lutz), who is the son of Zeus, is a half-god, half-man blessed with extraordinary strength. Betrayed by his stepfather, the King (Scott Adkins), and exiled and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love, Hercules must use his formidable powers to fight his ways back to his rightful kingdom. Through harrowing battles and gladiator-arena death matches, Hercules embarks on a legendary odyssey to overthrow the King and restore peace to the land.\n\nThe Legend of Hercules is one of the worst fantasy action films in years. And plus, it is the worst film that I saw in 2014. It is baffling that someone like Renny Harlin (who gave us Die Hard 2- which is a better film) made this film and release it into theaters into the dumping-ground of January. Not only that, the movie did not make its budget back. Which leads to the question: where did the seventy million dollars when? the actors? the effect? like where?\n\nSpeaking of the effects, they are not good. The effects are some the most terrible effects I have ever seen. I never seen effects wholly inept in every way. It is just that bad. \n\nThe movie is just unoriginal (like I said before). It borrows from Gladiator and 300 (which are better films that I could have been watching instead of this) especially 300 because of the super stylized slo-mo action. And speaking of that, enough with slo-mo already. I really hate when bad movies use the slo-mo to their effect and make it look cool. Yes, they use it in 300 but it really works in that film. However, in this film, it is like Renny Harlin said, \"Let's see how can I make it worse.\"\n\nThe costumes in The Legend of Hercules look very cheap. It is like they went to Goodwill and brought the costumes there. It is just lol funny. And no the acting wasn't any better. In fact, the acting is much worse than the costumes. Kellan Kutz might be handsome guy (which I don't mind sometimes) but he is not a strong actor. Plus, he was from the Twilight series. So yea..... And no the rest of the cast was not good either. Plus, everyone in this film yells and growls including the bad guys.\n\nAnd lastly, the green-screen is just one of the worst things I have ever encountered. It is like the filmmakers including Harlin did not make an effort to make it better. How can Harlin make a movie this bad? But I guess they ran out budget. \n\nThe Legend of Hercules is an incredibly awful film in every way. There is not one good or decent thing about the entire project (if you want to call it that). If anyone want to make a movie, please watch this film. It will show you how to not make a movie. Everybody else, please watch the animated film. It is so much better.",

That's exactly what I did with this one and although it's not the greatest spectacle ever, I would be doing it an injustice to blame it for my tiredness. By attempting to model itself on previous battle arena based films it's very unlikely that it will prevail, but it did have a moderately watchable storyline that could be followed if not always enjoyed. I don't think I was aware of any of the actors or actresses in this but that's not to say they didn't do a good job. The lack of emotional impact made this film suffer, whilst there was too much love themed interaction, and not enough battle based footage. I was left a little confused by the end, and it certainly looked like its scenes were made for the 3d viewer as opposed to the film critics amongst us. It will no doubt be (if it's not already) a forgotten entity that is not in the league of Clash of the Titans and such like. I think these movies have had their time and I can't think of a suitable target audience for this anymore as teenage boys are no longer into action figures or strong powerful warriors as its all about girls, fast cars, and non stop action - why do you think they have made a countless number of Fast & Furious movies to date? With the high tech special effects and weopanry, there's enough to keep us amused for a short while, but this movie lacks a cutting edge, lacks familiar faces, blood, and basically any real purpose.

If that wasn't enough, the visual aesthetic is very much a CGI-heavy melange of 300, with the super stylized slow-mo action standing in the way for plot. A sword-and-sandals epic should not be on the verge of putting you to sleep, but Hercules goes there. Kellan Lutz (Twilight) might have the right build to fill out the character but he's too limited as an actor to do much beyond the fight choreography. The only reason to see this movie is if you're trapped on an airplane and it happens to be on. Who would have thought that the flawed Brett Ratner-directed Hercules movie would look even better?\n\nNate's Grade: D",

This movie butchers its story so badly and the filmmakers did not care whatsoever about what they were doing and they made everything dull in this lackluster film. Every performance seemed fake, every line of dialogue was delivered in a bland way, and the action scenes were so poorly directed. The cgi and green screen were so god awful that I felt like I was watching a film from 1965. The action sequences were really bad because there was too much slow-motion going on and it added absolutely nothing to the fight scenes. Kellan Lutz may be built for the role, but he can't act worth a damn and he had zero charisma throughout. Liam McIntyre and Scott Adkins are the worst in the film in my opinion and every time one of them delivered a line of dialogue it was laughable and cringe-worthy. The costumes looked so cheap and they didn't look right in the movie, because all the clothing looked brand new and was just prepared too nicely on every scene because that is not how clothing should look back then. Overall, this is absolutely the worst film I have seen in 2014 and it most certainly the worst Greek mythology movie out there.",

There's no need to give a plot synopsis because everyone knows the story of Hercules already. Let's start with the acting in this three course breakdown. First off, everyone is terrible. There's no sidestepping that fact. Secondly, and most importantly, Kellan Lutz is a horrible, uncharismatic actor. He's about as wooden as Hayden Christensen. Then there's the pacing. You have the cheesy love story thrown in with the usual hero returning home to rid the kingdom of evil and, well, you know the rest. The problem is, it's so poorly written that it just feels like it drags on for hours upon hours. And to help make the seemingly never ending runtime even more unbearable are the horrifying visual effects. I understand it's in 3D, but these visual effects look like they're ripped right out of a very bad Syfy film, which is an insult to Syfy films. By the time it ends, it's clear why this was put out in the movie graveyard earlier in the year, because this is a horrible, horrible film.",

The mythology can be ambiguous and include several historical figures' fates, all with their own rich and diverse back-stories, which can be perplexing. Somehow, the script must take on this complicated task, simplify it and yet retain the tale's integrity.\n\nThere are many things that are at fault in The Legend of Hercules, first of which is the story. King Amphitryon is a loathsome tyrant whom Queen Alcmene despises and wishes to overthrow somehow. Born and conceived to be the savior of Ancient Greece by his mother Queen Alcmene with Zeus, Hercules is a prince. Hercules' older brother Iphicles resents Hercules for his strength, leadership and mother's love. Hercules' paramour Hebe, the Princess of Crete, is to marry his brother Iphicles as a union of their lands. Hercules and Hebe dare to pursue their love in spite of the arrangement and a clash of sovereignty gets underway.\n\nAt face value this is what happened in the film. This is also only the first twenty minutes of the film, your guess is as good as mine for the rest. Besides the mythological origin story of Hercules there is little mythology anywhere else. Hera is reduced to a melancholic prophetess witch. And Hercules is instead in the middle of a political upheaval for power.\n\nSecondly, the characters are pretty abysmal. The story has no development of any relationships and you sense no history between the characters. Hercules is reduced to a stoic barbarian. Kellan Lutz's impression of Hercules can be summarized as a muscular man who speaks loudly, lacks any emotion, always runs into battle scenes snarling, and scrunches his eyebrows.\n\nThird key feature causing the inevitable demise of this film is the action scenes! This is an action movie, and they are horrible. Any chance to marvel at the abilities of the actors and stuntmen is ruined by Renny Harlin's decision to always have the action sequence in slow-motion, in every single scene, every single time!\n\nHarlin also overly stylizes the film, ripping off movies like 300.\n\nThe Legend of Hercules wanted to be an epic film packed with intense battles and a simple story of love and one man's purpose. It was instead a big disappointment and waste of time.",

This take on Hercules borrows too much and results in nothing; it barely holds itself for an hour and a half, because one minute more and it would be unwatchable.\r\n\r\nThe movie looks cheap, really REALLY cheap. This is something a YouTube filmmaker would do in special effects. It is understandable, as it's an independent production for a website, and it's only looking for recognition so it can have an opportunity in something and for those standards, it's high. But this is a Hollywood film, so it begs the question why this looks so bad. It's a large combination of bad elements, which all ultimately forms the conclusion that the guys making this doesn't know what they're doing. The film is shot dreadfully, as the shots lack any wonder or Golden Composition. It stablishes nothing. The action scenes have too many quick edits that's hard to tell what just happened half the time. If that wasn't enough, there's a lot of slow-motion & speed up shots that really got tiring even before the film shows them. Also, these guys don't seem to know what lighting is for in films; there's a lot of shots with too much bright and barely have multi-colors on those.\r\n\r\nAnd this film lacks any originality: the story is generic and bland, there are no characters, there's no more story other than a plot, and when it comes to styles, this film steals from many other sword & sandals movies, most notably Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus, William Wyler's Ben-Hur, Zack Snyder's 300 and Ridely Scott's Gladiator, and even the TV Series Spartacus and Vikings. It steals so much it might as well be a compilation of clips from all these movies. Some of the action scenes almost work, but they're shot so dreadfully and deliver so little impact and emotion that they're nothing but a desperate excuse for entertainment when the film has literally nothing to offer. It's a movie that looks bad, sounds bad and IS bad. It's literally nothing but rip-offs of other movies you've seen a million of times. If you thought Disney's Hercules was too much of a change, well, look again!\r\n\r\nThe Legend of Hercules is pure emptiness and simply nothing to worry about, as surely nobody will remember this after a few days, and it will let itself be forgotten by history. I can't believe I will ever say this, but given the result of this one, I really hope Brett Ratner does better...if a film makes you say that, it means either you or the film reached the rock-bottom.",

The leading character certainly had the physic of Hercules but, he didn't have any screen charisma at all. The storyline wasn't that bad and the fighting scenes were impressive, but it the characters really let the film down. I honesty think that it came out to near the release of Hercules starring a The Rock, which will obviously get the audiences running to the cinema. Anyway, it's not bad if you just want to see some fight scenes without much depth but, if you expecting the true story of Hercules then you will be let down. Average!\n\nRound-Up:\nWith such a big budget, the director should have invested in some decent actors. The guy who plays the lead, Kellan Lutz, also starred in the Twilight franchise and he played the lead in that awful movie Arena with Samuel L. Jackson. I don't think that anyone will remember any of his previous roles and I doubt that this film will make his career blossom. You might recognise the girl who plays his mum, Roxanne McKee, who was in Hollyoaks and Eastenders. Anyway, with such a high budget, I was expecting a Troy like movie but, this film will be forgotten after a while.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nBudget: $70million\nWorldwide Gross: $61million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there epic tales about Hercules using his strength and power to free himself and his friends from captivity. 3/10",

            "content": "Here you see, we have a story about a strong, noble, and morally upright man. He is the surrogate son to a powerful ruler, and has a brother figure who is seen as weaker, is insecure with himself, etc and is jealous of the other and is tortured by the fact that he cannot win the approval of a parent. When it looks like the hero is going to cause problems, the bad guys arrange an attempted assassination that they think succeeds, with the hero unknowingly surviving and being made a slave where he is sold to a man as an arena fighter and becomes undefeated in that field. Eventually winning his way to the capital of the kingdom he once served where he makes a grand entrance winning a match nobody expected they could, forming something of a revolution as they fight, and seeking to take down the men responsible for all this, who declare martial law. With his surrogate brother pushing himself on the local princess who is in love with the lead hero. Add in other more specific bits like the bad guys blackmailing a character into giving them information on the hero's plans by the threatening the life of their kid (leading to the hero's capture) and a scene with the evil brother giving up on trying to win over the leading and lady and outright telling her he is going to have her and conceive an heir, and it all seems particularly shameless. Now you pretty much know what this movie is. It's what you would get if you had had the Sci-Fi (oh wait, now it's \"SyFy\", because poor literacy is cool I guess) Channel had made Ridley Scott's acclaimed epic \"GLADIATOR\". (Which I hope that synopsis made obvious) It's visual style feels near directly ripped from Zack Snyder's \"300\", the presentation of the characters of Hercules and Iphicles feel like they are channeling (aside from Maximus and Commodus that is) Thor and Loki from the Marvel Studios films (Kellan Lutz at times feeling like he's actually doing a Chris Hemsworth impression), and my dad even amusingly pointed out that at a point it also seems to draw heavily from Kevin Costner's \"ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES\" of all things. Now harkening back to previous films is nothing new, and doesn't make or break a movie in of itself. Even \"GLADIATOR\" itself took strong influence from swords and sandals epics from Hollywood's golden age. Namely \"SPARTACUS\", \"BEN-HUR\", and \"THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\". However it in spite of that also manages to tell it's own story and tell it extremely well. With its own themes, ideas, and characterizations/character arcs. Making for an all around great film. This movie by comparison just feels very cookie cutter in how it's put together. The story feels very rushed, with a number of plot points feeling under-developed. Top that off with what consists of mostly poor acting, dodgy what looks like TV level CGI, as well as cheap looking sets and costumes and you are left with what is mostly a sour film experience. So that begs the question of whether or not there was anything I liked in this movie. Well, I was hoping that it would be a lot more funny than it was. With a 3% here on the Tomatometer I was hoping we'd get a hilarious disaster of \"PLAN 9 FROM OUTERSPACE\" proportions, but alas it wasn't aside from a few moments. The biggest being how fake the Naemean lion looks. Scott Adkins, who plays the film's lead villain, is amusing in an ironic way. As they not only try to make him look like Gerard Butler's Leonidas, but he tries to desperately act like him as well. Going so far as to try to shout all his dialogue ferociously. (I mean come on man, even Gerard Butler reigned it in every one in a while. haha) A couple of the action scenes can admittedly be serviceably entertaining in a bare-bones sort of way, but they're nothing spectacular. (Like say the ones in the films this is clearly channeling) However the slow-mo is abused to no end, and not used with the same level of technical ability as someone like say Zack Snyder. If I were to try and grasp at straws for anything good to say about this movie I guess I could bring up that Gaia Weiss is pretty easy on the eyes, but let's face it. This is Hollywood and that's almost always the case at this point. Add on the fact that her performance is pretty bad however as well. (LOL, sorry I just couldn't resist) Anyway, what is easily the best thing about this film is Liam McIntire, who plays Hercules' closest friend and ally throughout the film. (Best known for being the second guy to play Spartacus the eponymous lead of the Starz television series, which I admittedly have not seen at this time) He gives a legitimately good performance and has a likable screen presence. Giving a lot more effort than the film feels like it deserves, or that most others in the production did. So at the end of the day, I'd say you can easily skip this one. As the guys over in the Spill Crew put it, the film feels like a Direct-To-Video mockbuster that was actually released in theaters. As if to ride the wave of a bunch of other swords and sandals films that came out this year (\"300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE\", \"POMPEII\", and of course most obviously \"HERCULES\" starring Dwayne Johnson) to try and make a quick buck. It's too lazy, uninspired, and done in a sub-par fashion to recommend, but is not so in what can be seen as a campy/ironic way. Though keep in mind that this is of course all just in my own opinion.",

            "content": "So every few years or so, a new mythological movie comes out. Examples have been Troy, 300, 300: Rise of an empire, The Immortals and so on and so forth. Hercules has always been one of the most famous topics for film, animation, books, comics, games and shows. But then this year brought us possibly one of the worst Mythological film disasters ever, The Legend of Hercules. This film was directed by Renny Harlin, do you remember this guy? Well he did Cliffhanger, Deep Blue sea and Die hard 2. So not so much a bad lineup of films (not a good line up either) so you should expect something half way decent. Well that my friends is a brutal thought to have. Hercules should be something exciting and over the top and Harlin managed to make a film that was dull, lifeless, full of errors and just totally terrible. How, Might be the question you are asking. How could you make a bad film about Hercules, well if you truly want to know watch this film and find out.\n\nThe Legend of Hercules stars Twilight boy wonder Kellan Lutz as the Demigod Hercules; and straight to DVD action king Scott Adkins as King Amphitryon. Kellan Lutz is so uninspired in this film, he walks around with a blank expression a majority of the time. It was like someone had taken a picture of him with a blank stare and Cg'ed that same empty expression on his face the whole time. His acting is bland, and I couldn't buy him as Hercules. Who made that decision? Well regardless there are some good things about this movie and I will focus on it now. Surprisingly, Scott Adkins is actually the best part of this movie. He gives you something to look forward in the droll events that happen when he is off the screen. I would have almost been willing to have cast Scott Adkins as Hercules. He has so much energy as well as intensity; he basically carries this whole bland affair, but that's the only good part.\n\nThe story line is very simple, in Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., a queen succumbs to the lust of Zeus to bear a son promised to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the king and restore peace to a land in hardship. But this prince, who is Hercules knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time.\n\nThe story seems simple enough, but the action is poorly executed. Hercules stabs someone with a spear and I could actually see the guy holding the spear in between his arm and his rib cage........was this film seriously that strapped for cash? It must have been, because the CGI is terrible. The whole movie looked like an episode of the Deadliest Warrior on Spike Tv.  It is staggering to me that with mythology as rich and engaging to draw from, they choose a tired rehashing of Gladiator as the main focus of the film. No doubt holding the more interesting material back for future sequels. The laughable love story is unengaging, poorly scripted and given far too much screen time. What really disappoints is the action sequences. Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this. It wastes a good deal of time with a clumsy mix of fighting scenes in which Hercules is repeatedly captured and/or defeated. It is only towards the end that an attempt is made to show Hercules as he should be seen, but I had tuned out long before then. I can say that Kevin Sorbo did a better Hercules than Kellan Lutz. All and all this maybe the worst film of the year so far.\n\nFINAL RATING 1/10",

Stop using the CGI so much! It's time to go back to the basics were worked was actually required to do these things. God!\n\nThe editing is bad, the graphics can be decent at times, and at other very f***ng CGI'd. I hate this movie. Literally, I hate it. I find it repulsive and a big waste of almost 2 hours. Units seem to disappear and re-appear, the people cross bridges only to be back before it and then after it as if magic! Oh wait, it's just bad CGI! Christ!\n\nAnother thing I hated? The slow-motion. I thought 300 was annoying with the slow-motion but this has a most annoying habit of showing up every single time Alcides (I refuse to call him Hercules) was doing a bloody stunt. Damn him and the movie. \n\nThe inconsistencies, bad editing, poor dialogue and emotion, and the abuse of the CGI just ruined this movie for me. No matter what else is left. Oh, and also? Scenes just skipped and ended so fast you could not even get invested on them. \n\nThis movie is an aberration. It's a 1 out of 10 (.5 stars) and that, once more, is giving it TOO much credit.",

            "content": "Although I was a fan of Renny Harlin, the main reason I wanted to see The Legend of Hercules was because it was an example of a film with a massive budget which was seriously critically panned and I just needed to know how it went so wrong.\n\nIt is clear that The Legend of Hercules is attempting to cash in on the success of 300 and more specifically its recent sequel 300: Rise of an Empire because it follows essentially the same style. But its success is a lot lesser because the excess of visual effects in the film and the lacklustre locations that the film is shot on fail to give it any kind of legitimacy. It just makes it all look cheap, and it is too eay to believe that the film takes place in the modern day because its cinematography is conventional and its definition is high quality which means it is really easy to pick up on the cheap aspects of the setting. Essentially, The Legend of Hercules is a very unconvincing and cheap looking film which spent the majority of its $70 million budget on lacklustre visual effects while the scenery and costumes seem to be recycled from the recent film Immortals. The \nI don't understand how Renny Harlin, an accomplished film director who has created films with fun visual effects such as Deep Blue See could not realise just how lacklustre the visuals are in The Legend of Hercules. It is so clear that the actors are interacting with greenscreens the entire time because as well as the fact that they are so disconnected from the entire world around them. The Legend of Hercules could have been a good guilty pleasure if the visual effects were toned up more. I mean, they establish some decent action scenes at times, but all in all they just were not impressive. Renny Harlin could have used the visual effects in moderation in The Legend of Hercules at the right moments and focused more on live action scenes, but his excessive dedication to them and lack of focus on establishing strong physical elements that exist beyond a computer studio end up being the central problem in The Legend of Hercules. To a certain extent, I was able to look beyond that. But not to a point where I would consider The Legend of Hercules a good film.\nThe only thing I hoped that would be any good in The Legend of Hercules was the action. Although the action scenes were choreographed well and managed to use a touch of visual effects to a decent extent at times ,the issue is that they seem too artificial. By that I mean they are largely unrealistic in nature even when they are simple close contact battle scenes, and the characters do not go through a touch of blood or gore in the process. The fact is that the action scenes have a certain extent of entertainment to them and frankly they were better than I had expected, but the cheap visual effects has a habit of showing a bit too often. I guess I didn't mind too much because in a world tainted with terrible action films, The Legend of Hercules still stands out as a better film than A Good Day to Die Hard, Taken 2 and Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. It is a poorly made film, but it is certainly underrated and does not deserve the kind of flack that it received. The simple fact is that it is not a story of Hercules, it is an excuse to dress up Twilight actor Kellan Lutz in revealing clothing and have him show off his abs as he fights off other poor actors and terribly rendered CGI lions. If you can look past that as well as the total lack of sense in the storytelling then perhaps you may enjoy the film. Its best qualities are that it has some decent action scenes, although there is a feeling that there could have been more of them and that they did not rush by so past. If you go into the film with really low expectations like I did, you will not be surprised at scenes depicting Kellan Lutz randomly diving backwards into a waterfall and rescuing his girlfriend from drowning in a river. It is clearly marketed at the teenage audiences, and it is believable that many are dumb enough to fall under the spell of the film while they're busy swooning for the former Twilight star to fight off his opressors. The point is, there is definitely a certain level of dumb fun in the film, and the amount that the audience is actually able to locate will explain precisely how much they end up enjoying The Legend of Hercules. But the most picky of people will look at it and say that it is crap, because in actual fact it is.\nThe script of the film is terrible, and the acting is no better. But considering that the only cast members are underwear models, former Twilight actor Kellan Lutz, Jean-Claude Van Damme's right hand man Scott Adkins and essentially nobody else you would have ever heard of, that's practically the expectation. There are really no characters in The Legend of Hercules and the film is not in the slightest about Hercules, it is a mockbuster of 300 with a higher budget and yet lesser quality visual effects. It delivers some decent action scenes which are entertaining while the rest of the qualities in the film ranging from storytelling to the script and to the acting are so poor that they are laughable, as is the general visual style of the film. You cannot have expectations for a film like this to be good, even if you are a fan of Renny Harlin because it simply cannot be when it is a front for Kellan Lutz to parade around shirtless. But he makes a decent action hero and has me thinking he might be good in The Expendables 3, so at least it left me optimistic.\n\nSo The Legend of Hercules is crap because it is poorly acted, thinly scripted, cannot tell a story and looks surprisingly cheap regardless of its high budget and could not really have any less to do with Hercules himself. But if you go in with the expectations of it to have quality of a film by The Asylum and hoping for some slightly decent action scenes, you may not find yourself to be too disappointed.",

And I mean CHEAP looking, the lion was really hard to look at, it actually looked like it was stuffed and really small. And there is absolutely nothing to engage the viewer or keep them interested. But I mean it did get dumped into theatres in the middle of January so it's pretty obvious from that alone that the movie was going to be weak. All it is is 300/Gladiator/Pompeii shoved into one movie. Oh, and don't even get me started on the acting. This movie isn't even laughable, which would have made it a GOOD bad movie. I'm excited to see it on Netflix. There is no part in this movie and nothing in this movie that I could say is good, besides the costumes I guess, and that it's not a long movie.

            "content": "This \"Hercules\" is all brawn but no brain. Have you ever gone to the theater to watch a film and thought to yourself, \"Why was this film ever made?\" Normally, January is the dumping ground for garbage Hollywood films, but some should not even exist, and The Legend of Hercules is one them. Director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger and Die Hard 2) has made some real stinkers in the past (12 Rounds, Exorcist - The Beginning and Deep Blue Sea), but this film is an epic failure and a major insult to intelligence. \n\nOur story begins with Hercules (Kellan Lutz), who is betrayed by King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love. Now, Hercules must fight his way back on top to overthrow the king and to take back his rightful kingdom. Sound familiar? Lutz may have the brawn but his performance is dull, along with all the other actors in this film. Scriptwriters Sean Hood (Conan the Barbarian ... the remake) and Daniel Giat cannot even muster up a half-baked script, instead opting to rehash old story lines with nothing new to add. It's basically a mediocre imitation of films like Ben-Hur (a hero put to work as a boat rower), Gladiator (thrown into slavery only to redeem himself in the arena) and Spartacus (a prisoner rising up to lead a mass revolt against barbarians). With lazy writing, awful dialog and amateur acting, \n\nHercules fails to be called a brainless action film or even a dramatic one. On top of that, Harlin throws in cheap-looking slow-motion action scenes. The slow motion may have helped the Spartans look cool in 300, but here it makes Hercules look amateur. As if things could not get any worse for the film, Harlin also decides to turn it into a bloated 3-D flick. Now I am beginning to see why this film was not screened for advanced critics. It currently holds a 3 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. If you want to keep your sanity and not waste your money, then I would advise you to stay away from this film.",

            "content": "Would be the worst movie of the year if it wasn't so gloriously ridiculous.  Without getting too deep into the details, because it is absolutely unnecessary, this is a reimagining of the Greek hero, and I promise you that you haven't heard this story told this way before.  Here is what this movie is: if a Shakespeare impersonator was contracted to pen a story about a mythological figure, but then told he only had 3 hours to submit the final draft, he would scramble and put together something like The Legend of Hercules.  This is directed by infamous schlock director Renny Harlin, who would be on the same level of Uwe Boll, but he is a modicum more competent behind the camera, which at least makes his movies watchable.  He gets all of his actors to deliver some truly atrocious lines of dialogue not only with a straight face, but with conviction, which is a flabbergasting feat, all things considered.  Despite itself, this story keeps moving forward, giving you one outrageous action sequence after another with loads of Zack Snyder-esque speed up/slo-mo shots and shameless 3-D usage.  Having just watched Pompeii and 300: Rise of an Empire, I can honestly tell you that I would rather watch this.  You will at least get entertainment value here because it is constantly surprising you with the preposterous, which makes it the perfect movie to watch with friends over drinks, especially if the Rifftrax guys ever choose to cover this.",

Oh yea and those\nuniforms,weapons,arenas,customs are not Greek... they are roman, a little confusion there but no harm done. To be fair though the name Stelios aka  is Greek as well as some other names in\nthe movie so kudos on that! This movie is a delightfully horrible mixture of the following movies: 300,jesus of nazareth, thor, highlander, braveheart and  gladiator with the subtle yet obvious influence of god of war. I think that sums up the epicness of this movie. 4/10...Got to see what The Rocks pulls out with his version of Hercules in July.",

He exiles Hercules because he fears of being overthrown which is what exactly happens so expect the predictable. \n\nThe movie is bombarded by cliches from the film 300 and the television show Spartacus.

            "content": "Oh, hell. Here I was looking forward to watching an incredibly shitty film for me to tear a new asshole, and instead I end up liking this nonsensical sword-and-sandals film.\n\nI certainly wasn't expecting to, considering this film holds a shockingly awful 3% fresh here on Rotten Tomatoes, with a dismal 37% approval from the users (At the time of this writing, though it will probably drop into the low 30's or possibly even the 20's range). So, imagine my shock when I found that I actually tolerated one of the year's worst-reviewed films.\n\nIs it schlocky? Yes. Is it something you've already seen before? Yes, if you've seen films like 300, Gladiator, or any film or TV show with similar ideas, you already know what's coming. Are the special effects bad? Yes. Is the plot filled with soap opera theatrics? Indeed. It has all the makings for something I should hate (And everyone else rightfully hates), and yet, I can't bring myself to hate it, even though I should.\n\nThe plot of course, focuses on Hercules. Wanting to stop her husband's reign of terror across the land, the queen asks the gods to find a way to stop him, and she is granted this wish in the form of birthing a child named Hercules who will be both human and god, who will also be fathered by Zeus.\n\nThe king is furious to walk in on his wife during a strange and unintentionally hilarious sex scene where Zeus, who is invisible, proceeds to have sex with the fully dressed queen (Who is moaning with pleasure and gyrating from the awesome dry humping sex with a god), and thinks that there is a man who managed to escape from the room and doesn't know of his wife's prayer or her deal with the gods.\n\nHe disowns his newborn son and names him Arsades, even though his real name is Hercules, and he will never be able to rise to the throne. As he grows up, Hercules is treated like crap by his older brother and his father, and also falls in love with a princess named Hebe, whom he can't be with as she is about to be wed to his own brother.\n\nWhen Hercules and Hebe try to escape, they are caught and Hercules is sent to the battlefield with a very small army, which is then destroyed except for him and army's commander and the two are sold into slavery and forced to become fighters. The two end up fighting their way to victory, and now Hercules and his growing following must stop his father's reign and win back Hebe before it's too late, while also discovering his awesome god-like powers along the way.\n\nWhen it came to the acting, I felt the actors did a solid job considering how cheesy and cliched the script was. However, their performances can only take them so far before the script completely hams up their performances through ridiculous scenes (Like the sex scene I mentioned).\n\nThe action itself is filled with all sorts of over the top moments, lots of slow motion, some poor T&A inserted in (PG-13 T&A doesn't add up to much, that's for sure), ham-fisted romance, soap opera-level drama, and lots of unintentionally funny moments, which for me, ultimately saved the film from being a loss.\n\nUnless you're up for a poor man's PG-13 version of 300 or Gladiator, mixed with a lot of cheesy scenes, a cliched and dumb script, and cheesy drama, this is not for you. But, if you can stomach some pretty dumb films and are a hardened B-movie fanatic, there might be something you can find in this nonsensical film for unintentional humor purposes. I actually like it, even though I shouldn't.",

He did a great job,  as did Liam from Spartacus. He brought a bit of that into it which showed he was more then capable for the roll. For all the reviews I've seen about a bad CGI Lion... just don't write reviews alright? Don't discredit a movie due to one animal in one scene that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  Hercules was the perfect balance of mortal and God,  people would be complaining if he had to much God power for crying out loud. The whole point of Hercules is that he's a demigod. Half mortal,  half God, son of Zeus and a mortal mother. Not more or less either way. What are you mad a giant hydra didn't pop out? You all complaining about the bloody lion would of complained about how many heads the hydra would have.... having to do nothing with the movie along with the lion. The action was great, casting was great, my only complaint was that it got discredited by a pack of fools. The same fools who will comment on the next transformers movie saying that there's to many robots fighting.....enjoy a movie for what it is,  a great action,  mythology movie.",

It's only a notch above that, but being that as it may, it's still not a good movie. The most disappointing thing for me is that it's sad to see Renny Harlin in a situation wherein he has to make movies in the style of more popular movies. Not that he's the world's greatest director, but there was a time when Renny Harlin was, dare I say, cutting edge and had some fresh ideas on how to approach making movies. Now I may have this all wrong and the studio behind this film may have pushed him into making the film look like a Zack Snyder/The Lord of the Rings/Gladiator hybrid, but who knows for sure? The movie looks fine, but there's nothing fresh or appealing about it. We've seen all of this before, ad infinitum, and without any passion or any creative spark behind it, it fails. I can't even say that it's so bad that it's funny either, which would be the movie's only saving grace. But when you get right down to it, it will ultimately be a mostly forgotten movie. I'm sure that young men, specifically in the 13 to 23 bracket, will find some enjoyment out of it, but most everyone else just won't care that much.",

It's just basic.\n\nThe comparisons to 300 are going to be many (lots of greenscreen, slow motion, muscly men), so it's nice any time Hercules tries something different.

Though this movie was destined to bomb at the box, the instant Kellan Lutz was signed on as the Lead. Lol Incidentally enough the Casting Director himself has even stated that Kellan himself was no Hercules... prior to production... which makes just about enough sense as this film.\nThe only thing I even bothered remembering about a the Legend of Hercules, was that the actor who played Spartacus (Liam Mcyintyre) was a supporting role... which was a mistake because even Liam's acting presence was stronger then Lutz's... \nI would've been more upset at the fact that I wasted 2 hours of my life, but because I Downloaded that Piece of Shit movie for free... I could care less... like a lot less...\nSo either way, don't bother watching this movie... just go stare at an empty wall instead... you'll be spending your time more productively\n\n-ProjektSHIN",

Oddly it strives to be anything but a story about Zeus' demi-god son.  Instead it simply rips off other movies.  It's like \"Gladiator\" meets \"300\" meets \"Thor\" meets \"Twilight\".  The combination is not a good one.\r\n\r\nSince Zeus covets the lovely mortal Queen Alcmene, Hera approaches the Queen and says that she might as well have sex with the god, so that she can have a big strong strapping baby boy.  Zeus has his way with her and nine months later Herc is born.\r\n\r\nHercules (Kellan Lutz) grows to be superior to his conniving older brother Iphicles (Liam Garrigan), who just can't wait to be king.  He starts plotting to marry the heir to another kingdom, even though she only has eyes for Herc.  Meanwhile, Iphicles evil father banishes Hercules to Egypt where he is captured as a slave.  There he must fight in arenas for his freedom.\r\n\r\nAnyone else notice the similarities to the movie \"Thor\", especially with the evil, older brother who just happens to look and act a whole lot like Loki?  Lutz proves himself not much of an actor.  He barely manages to do his best Russell Crowe impression while he growls his way through his screen-chewing speeches.\r\n\r\nWhile some money went into the \"300\"-like effects, the action sequences are shot in an extremely annoying fashion.  It continously slows down everytime something is happening, so that the audience can, presumedly, relish in the awe of the agonized looks on the actors faces.  I'm positive the film would have only been about 45 minutes without the slow motion.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/LegendofHerculesThe_zps4453981a.jpg[/IMG]",

Kellan Lutz can't fight. This isn't a knock on him necessarily. He's so huge that no stunt double would be believable but between the director and editor they managed to destroy the continuity of every fight scene to the point where I don't know who I'm looking at. For example, there was a mud fighting scene where the two fighters looked almost exactly alike. And when the camera randomly cuts to another angle to make up for the stiffness in Hercules' fighting style I have NO IDEA who is who or who's winning, and after about a minute of this I didn't care. \n3. The story has huge holes in it. \na. Hercules comes back from being sold to slavery and it is much too easy for him to win the affection of the people. \nb. Hercules kills a lion who his brother takes credit for. In the final fight scene he has it on though. How? The brother never gave him the lion's mane and he wasn't shown stealing it. \nc. Hercules' love interest has a knife to her heart held by Hercules' brother and in an act of sacrifice, pushes in the knife herself so that she can't be held hostage. Later on I notice two gigantic holes: \nc1. His brother magically got knocked out. \nc2. His love interest DIDN'T sacrifice anything because she's having his baby in the next scene. How can she have his baby with a hole in her heart. This wasn't a modernized version of the tale. Even today, if you get stabbed in the heart you're in big trouble. Not her though. Apparently she's half god too. \n4. The villain, Hercules' brother, wasn't scary or impressive or even mildly threatening. I've been more scared of crossing the street while intoxicated. \n\nBad film. High production value. Also, I kept thinking formulaic when I was watching. It is less exciting than 300, less dramatic than Troy, and less",

The acting is hilariously awful (Kellan Lutz and the villains especially). The romance is laughable. The fight scenes are a total rip off of 300 and Gladiator, with obnoxious slow-mo being used every 10 seconds. And for a movie with a budget of $70 million, it looks cheap.\n\nThe Legend of Hercules has some of the worst production values I've ever seen in a film. The costumes look noticeably cheap, The props are low rent, The green screen effects are amateurish. The 3D conversion is even worse.

The film takes some of the Hercules myth and tries to create a story out of it but it strays so much from what has been told that the film is a waste.  It has a lot of fighting and set pieces ... but the recent television series Spartacus did most of this a lot better.

            "content": "The film formerly known as 'Hercules: The Legend Begins' which scarily makes you think there might be sequels in a possible beefcake franchise. Aaaaaand also even more scarily known at one time as 'Hercules 3D' which not only makes me shudder at the thought of how ridiculous a gimmick that would be, but the fact they would probably make 3D sequels too, brrrrrr! me blood runs cold at the thought of it.\n\nSo round one, lets see if this Hercules film can...oh it can't. So in ancient Greece Yuri Boyka...aka Scott Adkins, the man who makes pure straight to DVD films for a career, is the baddie King Amphitryon. This guy is apparently running things badly and no one likes him, the film shows none of this but we are made to believe it because he shouts and growls a lot. He's gonna marry off Hebe the Princess to his slimy son Iphicles, problem is Hebe is in love with mighty Hercules played by...Kellan Lurch? Putz? Yutz?, this makes them both rather upset. So in typical Romeo and Juliet style they try to escape together, get caught, and Hercules is banished to fight in Egypt. Naturally this is all a ruse by the naughty King to try and kill off Hercules because he has also been foreseen to bring down his kingdom.\n\nNow I don't really know the full ins and outs of ancient Greece as its extremely complicated, but I'm pretty sure this film is not historically accurate. I take a wild swing with this statement as King Galenus at the start of the film who is killed by Amphitryon was actually a Greek physician and philosopher, unless they just used the name. Also Hebe was the daughter of Zeus and Hera which I don't believe is used here, but anyway you wouldn't use this film for a history lesson.\n\nIf this were a TV movie then I'd be a bit more positive here, the fact its a big budget flick directed by Renny Harlin is a bit embarrassing really. By the chariots of Zeus! the visuals are drab, really drab!, its unbelievably poor looking in every aspect. The costumes are bland and lifeless, but I guess the excuse there could be its a more realistic take. Lots of bad greenscreen, the few real locations used are unexciting whilst most other landscapes we see are CGI and the sets are so darkly lit my guess is that its to hide the fact they look like foam and rubber. Most of the film uses CGI to make up the backgrounds foregrounds...everything! and its obvious, hell the CGI looks like it was done ten years ago.\n\nThe first bit of action that really nailed home how poor this all was was the sequence where Hercules fights the lion. Holy Mufasa! this sequence looks terrible, the lion must be a joke right? isn't it? how big was this budget?. The acting in this film is laughable it really is, putting the constant growling and gnashing teeth of Adkins aside, it feels like you're watching a sci-fi B-movie from the 50's. No disrespect to those classics but in this day and age you come to expect a bit more for a major release...don't you?!!.\n\nThere is very little action in the film which doesn't really help its case, especially when the acting realism and visuals are so bad. What action we do get is done in the most horrendously pointless needless and shameless rip off from the '300' franchise ever to grace the cinema screen thus far methinks. It wouldn't be so bad if it actually looked half as good, or if it was even necessary, but it just feels so futile, so totally meaningless and clearly done just to try and make everything appear more thrilling because otherwise it would be lame. Blatant leeching off another films concept.\n\nThe other thing is I don't know what this film wants to be, a serious historical epic? a bloody sword n sandals action flick? a drama? a fantasy? what?!. There are hints of a blood soaked action flick but it never materialises, it just cuts away at every crucial moment, there is no blood or gore at all really...so maybe its for the family?. The gladiatorial battles are laughable bad with cliched corny choreography and characters, the six undefeated warriors were pathetic and frankly I'm unsure how they became undefeated. One of the warriors was even a woman! women weren't really seen in the arenas, especially with the male gladiators, it didn't happen, but naturally Hercules doesn't kill her pfft! wuss.\n\nLove the short sequence just before the battle with the six warriors. Chiron and Hercules mate Sotiris reach the arena and look down on it from this massive cliff. They must be a gazillion feet above this arena in one shot...but by the pecs of Lutz! in the next shot they're in the arena just in time to watch Hercules do his thing!. They don't even look tired or sweaty!, that's some ancient Greek magic right there. Oh did I forget to mention that these arena battles are set up by a character who is clearly a rip off from Oliver Reed's character in 'Gladiator', the guy even looks the same with his facial hair and costume, is there a lawyer in the house?.\n\nThis film is such a mess it really is, most of the time it comes across as a lifeless dull drama with little bits of tame bloodless '300' wannabe style action. But out of the blue we get a couple outrageous sequences of fantasy involving Hercules using two massive boulders on chains like nunchakus in true Marvel style. And then a sequence where he summons the power of Greyskull and proceeds to kill hundreds of warriors using a lighting empowered sword...wut?!. After all that its back to being a dull plot hole ridden drama/historical epic/'300'/'Spartacus'/'Gladiator' wannabe cash cow franchise (well that ain't happening anymore).",

            "content": "The Legend of Hercules is an insult to not just Greek Mythology, but common sense. A rush plot that overuses cliches and overlooks the basics of storytelling like context, characterization, and anything resembling human emotion. The action scenes that don't include Scott Adkins are uninspired, insipid, and sucking any shred of entertainment away. These Greek set action scenes are the most over the top ever depicted in the era yet provide nothing to dissect. Avoid this film! Done and finished like that. If you're expecting anything informative you better stop reading now. Now clearly I have allot more to say about the film seeing the length of my rant. What better way to best get across my hatred than express my same exact thoughts while viewing the film. I'll leave no stone unturned because there are some bad movies worth viewing.\r\n\r\nUpon seeing the opening of the film which is an unimpressive one track wide shot of Greek civilizations going to war with each other into the ancient land of Argos. This one track shot highlights the plastic looking CG environments, blurred explosions, and humans that look smudgy regardless how far the CG is from the camera. However, despite a poor first impression the film is gracious enough to give us SCOTT ADKINS! He's so awesome that in fact, the extras in the opening scene just started cheering upon seeing Adkins appear despite being told not too. Coming into the film with a action scene that overuses slow motion and cheap props (like all the action scenes), but nonetheless Adkins presence makes it awesome. Full of energy he's able to sell an opening action scene that had no context (no seriously, it's glances over just about every detail you can think off regarding a war) and makes it exciting. At the end there's no question that Scott Adkins wins the fight, his opponent kingdom, and thus has the opposing army and his own army bow down to his greatness. Truly this man is a legend among legend and....what eleven minutes that's it. Adkins is just a supporting actor despite clearly selling a action scene that should not have had worked on any level. BOOOOOOOOOO! Put Scott Adkin back on screen. If you seriously think I'm going to buy \"I got pregnant with a God child to put end to your reign because you are just too demanding\" plotline without developing character, context, or the conflict you are wrong. I still have a functioning brain cell intact after viewing this. At some point you might expect me to flip the switch and go back to my formula with an attempt to be fair, but then Kellan Lutz appears around the twelve minute mark.\r\n\r\nFast forward the plot twenty years later and Kellan Lutz appears on screen for the first time in the film riding horses with plastic doll Gaia Weiss. I didn't think it was possible, but these two actors manage to make the simple task of horseback riding difficult to buy. Once they reached their destination at some pond they have a \"romantic\" moment. The scene gets across Hercules love Hebe despite this being the first time we see them together. For those wondering nope the film never develops the romance nor any of the characters to sell the romance. The only thing that happens at the pond is Hercules gets a necklace from the women he loves which on itself could metaphor Hercules commitment by wearing, but he's does not hold it to any importance rendering it meaningless. After Hercules brother, Iphicles, comes into the scene he tells his men to take Hebe back to the kingdom of \"Just Make Things Up As We Go Along-dom\". \r\n\r\nRiding back to their proud kingdom at day time, yet for some reason wait until night time to actually start moving the brothers hear a noise. Getting off their horses the brothers arm themselves to fight a foul beast. A lion appears making his presence known to Hercules with his loud and furious roar that shakes the land. The fact that his opponent is Kellan Lutz further boosts the beast ego so much in fact that when HERCULES THROWS A STEEL SPEAR AT A LION IT DEFLECTS IT WITHOUT A SCRATCH! How is the lion killed you asked? By being choked to death by Hercules. Nope, I'm pretty sure the CG Lion couldn't handle putting this on his resume thus ending his career on screen. CG Lion number 06-27-1997 will truly be missed. Before I move on the lion Hercules fought wasn't ordinary. It was in fact the legendary Nemean Lion who has golden fur that's impervious to attacks. I'm telling you this because the film does not explain this meaning unless you know what the Nemean Lion is this scene is various degrees of silliness. \r\n\r\nUpon returning to their kingdom together. Iphicles takes credit for killing the Nemean Lion and tells in front of a crowd that Hercules ran away from the first sign of danger. Remember this is Kellan Lutz's Hercules not Arnold Schwarzenegger so it's not hard for anyone to buy that Hercules ran away from danger. Heck I believed it even though I clearly saw what actually happened. Thus the almighty KING ADKINS (I know his character has a name, but I like the sound of KING ADKINS better) announces to the crowd that his son, Iphicles, will in fact marry Hebe in three moons. Three moons? I could help with that just give a minute to unzip...what you meant days not the other kind? You modernized 90% of the dialogue so why of all things \"wed in three moons\" is kept as is. By no surprise Hebe is dissatisfied with the announcement of whom she'll be force to wed. I totally could get behind Hebe in this situation because she's not marrying King Adkins. I mean when the only man throwing himself at you is Kellan Lutz could you really blame Hebe for running away. Hercules goes after Hebe and promises her they'll run away together. Out of kindness Hebe says yes in the hopes this will make King Adkins jealous (my made up plot sucks I know, but much better than what the film provides). Thus the two ride off into the night, but wait until daytime to actually start their journey. Are you kidding me Daniel Giat, Giulio Steve, Renny Harlin, and Sean Hood? Four freakin writers? Not one of them thought to themselve \"Wouldn't it make sense for Hercules and Hebe to run away right after Hercules makes that proposal. It's night time making it difficult to spot them, none of Adkins guards are chasing after them, and they have a head start\". \r\n\r\nAfter a bad chase scene void of any excitement and zero technical prowesses King Adkins sends Hercules to war in Egypt. It was at this point that I realize Hercules character is so poorly written that I was actually cheering for the \"villain\" of the film. For Adkins character we at least saw he led an army to gain an entire kingdom even if it was just for gold as oppose to Hercules who in the film has only killed a lion thinks he entitled to anything he wants. Out of those two I would cheer on the bloodthirsty tyrant who has a right to constantly be pissed off at Hercules because he worked hard and violently killed to get the things he got. Hercules on the other hand thought process is \"You just don't know how difficult it is to be the son of a king with no responsibility having the power of a God. I hate you\". You could labeled Kellan Lutz as a hero all you want in the film, but he just comes off as a drama queen who got a sex change into a man. It's also upon this force return Hercules learns from his mother he's the son of Zeus. This shocks Hercules upon hearing the news since Kellan Lutz's Hercules is that slow in head. Really movie? You know just force me to compliment Disney Studio writing which by my standard guarantees you just failed in the written word of storytelling. In Disney's Hercules he knew he has super strength and was conflicted about his true origin. This Hercules does not face emotional conflict, has no desire to learn about himself, nor does he ever goes to speak to Zeus unless he wants something without earning it. \r\n\r\nWould you believe me if I told you the previous paragraphs vaguely summed up the first thirty minutes of the movie. I got that much material to complain and rant on in thirty minutes. This is just a fraction of my feelings as you could only imagine how poorly I view this film in its entirety. Pass the thirty minute mark the four writers gave up on writing dialogue. ARRRGGGGGHHHHHHH, EEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR, BOOOOOOOOOOOOO, is what makes up the rest of the film dialogue. Just a constant barrage of men shouting from the top of their lungs. Moving on, in the next twenty minutes little happens. Hercules goes to Egypt to fight with his father army and with one other soldier are the only survivor of the battle. Captured, Hercules and General Goodlooking (who's too young to play a veteran war general) are force to fight other prisoners. This plot point is a poor ploy to just have the following eighteen minutes consist of action scenes. All of which rely on wire work that Pinocchio would call dated. The action scenes are unexciting because Kellan Lutz barely gets hurt. Fun fact, in the action scene where Kellan Lutz enters an arena the crowd boos when the announcers introduces Hercules was not scripted. According to the extras on set they said they were lied into believing they would see Dwayne Johnson in the movie. To be fair though the extras are justified for their boos. Hercules strikes a deal with his master to let General Goodlooking go scot-free if he could wins his freedom against six undefeated Greek warriors. Why that actually sounds cool. The film took many liberties with the legend already so maybe in this one scene Hercules will face Achilles, Jason, Perseus, Odysseus, among other worthy opponents. Oh man the possibilities are endless. One over the top, dead of excitement, and predictable fight scene later. Damn you writers I actually expected something decent from that scene!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Argos news spread across the land that Hercules died in battle. Lets take moment and mourn the loss of Kevin Sorbo's Hercules who will be missed. Or damn it, thinking of the wrong Hercules again. Actually what I meant to say was bring on the champagne because Kellan Lutz's Hercules is pronounced dead. YEAH! Afterwards King Adkins speaks to his angry wife whose hatred for him is far from subtle. Adkins wife tells him that she gave birth to Hercules to end his tyranny. Of course given Kellan Lutz is the person she gave birth to King Adkin takes it as an insult (like anyone would) and kills her on the spot. There is also a scene of Hebe stating continually (it's the only thing she talks about in the movie) how much she loves Hercules (just pretend it's Dwayne Johnson she's talking about to buy it) when speaking with Iphicles. Once Iphicles gets across Hebe has no say in the matter will forever be locked in a loveless marriage she attempts to commit suicide. In the context of the film Hebe feels sad that Hercules got killed, but in my version I actually believe Hebe came to the realization that her failed planned to make King Adkins jealous thinks a world without Adkins is not worth living. Of course Old Man (he's is not that important of a character) stops her and tells her Hercules is still alive and planning to overthrow King Adkins. \r\n\r\nSkipping towards Hercules overthrow you'll be hard press to read that nothing else happened in between. Reaching the fifty minute mark you think seeing a God attempting to rally supporters to overthrow King Adkins would on some level be interesting. All that happens is General Goodlooking finds his wife murdered, Iphiles captures General Goodlooking, Hercules is captured, Hercules gets chained up, and whipped for being a very, very bad actor. Despite these events there's no buildup on any kind and the bad attempt to sell the romance with sex. Although, I do thank the director who despite showing his stars (any male actors) togaless for more than half of the movie does not show Kellan Lutz likely bad interpretation of a sex scene. So Hercules, just because he asks, obtains his full strength from Zeus without earning it. Kellan Lutz goes \"God of War\" (Kratos, the protagonist, fights with weapons connected by chains) on his opponent and is just as lame as everything else in the movie. Witnessing this King Adkins retrieves to his castle because Hercules showing off his strength bored him.\r\n\r\nIf you read this far we're finally at Hercules overthrow. Music in this film in general is unnoticable because it's only purpose is to be loud. There's no composition nor instrumental arrangements in anything that is heard. So while people were getting killed on screen I was to listening to Aya Hirano \"Bouken Desho Desho\" to lift up my spirits and worked to put me in a good mood. Who knew listening to cheery and upbeat music for a an action scene would worked so much better than a random arrangements loud noises. Hercules army march towards King Adkin front gate and by sheer luck some of King Adkins arrows men turn to Hercules side. Man is that lazy writing and pure convenience that even though the arrow men could easily kill Hercules just turn to his side. Motivation is simply because he's a great hero, even though throughout the movie everything is a cakewalk for him. So when Hercules enters King Adkins temple he walks straight into King Adkins trap. King Adkins, despite the rain pouring down, is able to create a wall of fire because he's just awesome. So picture this, Hercules and his men surrounded, outnumbered, and ensuring that there is a high possibility Hercules men lives will be lost. Now picture Zeus just giving Hercules a lightning whip to easily killing a dozen or so men by himself. I've been avoiding discussing the idea of Hercules saying in a previous scene he's no God, but a mortal. Why don't you remember the last time you raised your hands up at the sky, physically grabbed lightning, and used it as a whip? I do it all the time because according to this film I am a mortal. \r\n\r\nThen finally it comes down to climax which is made exciting because of SCOTT ADKINS! So who'll win this fight; on one corner you have SCOTT ADKINS who in the film is a conqueror of kingdoms, commands respects looking pissed off in every single scene he's in, and most importantly age holds no meaning to him. Despite the main story taking place twenty years after the opening scene the only thing he has to show for his age is a clearly fake beard! And on the other corner you have Kellan Lutz who plays Hercules accomplishing...um no wait let me think. He went to war in Egypt despite only having eighty troops and survives...although it's technically his fault they died since he suggested to rest in a area that guaranteed their enemies to ambushed them and left themself no way to escape. Oh man that's bad. No wait, Hercules has the strength of a God and can wield lighting which he never uses in a majority of the film. Ummm....he has muscles, but no personality of any kind. Ahhh...this guy sucks. I honestly tried to make Kellan Lutz sound good.\r\n\r\nThe climax is actually decent because of the fight choreography actually allows Kellan Lutz opponent to be on equal ground. You might question Hercules strength as he gets tossed around during the final action scene like a rag doll, but remember his opponent is SCOTT ADKINS! Before Kellan Lutz has a chance to choke King Adkins to death Iphicles comes into the fight threatening to kill Hebe if Hercules kills King Adkins. Knowing the small possibility that Hercules could save her Hebe takes stabs herself in the chest because a life without Scott Adkins is just not worth living and a life with Kellan Lutz is worth ending your misery. This scene, like everything else, leaves as little of an impact as possible. The fight resume and if the film wasn't unrealstic enough Kellan Lutz kills King Adkins. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Unbelievable the filmmakers had the nerve to kill off the only decent thing to be found in the movie. Yes Scott Adkins only screams in the movie, but he has energy, charisma, acting talent, a martial art background, but most importantly is not Kellan Lutz. I kid you not when I say Kellan Lutz starring in this film is the equivalent of a sleeping pill; the longer you are expose to it the more you'll want to go sleep. \r\n\r\nHebe wakes up and lives happily ever after with Hercules. Of course with my hatred towards the film I pretend Hebe became blind thinking Hercules was Scott Adkins. Finally this is the end of the review. Without question if it wasn't for the over top performance and glorious presence of Scott Adkins this film would have earned a zero. Whenever Adkins is on screen he's brings excitement to the film working against some incredibly poor production values. Adkins was in the film long enough to earn a ten percent rating. He's the film biggest appeal even in a traditional sense his performance is bad. Unfortunately the spotlight is given to Kellan Lutz whose performance has the same effect of a sleeping pill, charisma of a corpse, non existent acting talent, and finally just sucks at his job. He doesn't look convincing in the part, he can't act, has no charm, and personality of any sort. So like I said in first paragraph there are some bad movies worth seeing and this film, under no circumstances even if you're held at gunpoint should not be seen.",

            "content": "I popped along to see The Legend Of Hercules. I was most impressed with it. Especially the introduction to the film. I went along with a view of seeing my babe Kellen Lutz. He's a fine stumpen alrite. heeheh. But as far as the plot is concerned twas quite on the challenging side of figurien it out. Normally I don't read up the reviews of a film I go to see for the first time. Now I must admit, I had a sneak preview on IMDB. Link will be provided below as per usual. But from what I could understand in the movie of where I got the plot fully is as follows. Hercules is born as a god like the way Jesus was. as in I think a demi-god like Percy Jackson(Son of Poseidon) to a Queen. The King thinks the Queen had an affair and as naturally is mad. He forces his son Iphicles(Excuse the spelling) and Hebes to wed. However there' s a slight problem, and that problem is my sexy hunk Hercules. Hercules is in love with Hebes. \"Even if he is a memory to me, I still love him\". I went to the film, as it was described as \"Twilight heartthrob... Kellen\". By George did that live to its description. He is some heartthrob alrite. So Hercules found out that the King killed his mother ie the Queen. Initially throughout the film, he wasn't acceptance of his Godship not even acknowledging his father was a God(Zeus). So when he had heard of the murder of his mother and now his mentor(the Auld fella - Chiron I think) Hercules goes on a rampage. Overall a wonderful film to a great history lesson. Oh and one more item, the voice of Hercules soooooo sooothing.",

Hera agrees which makes no sense, even offering Zeus as the father. To be fair Hercules' conception was actually kind of amusing and over the top. We cut to twenty years later - Hercules grows up to be Kellan Lutz who falls in love with a princess, but his older brother wants the princess, so convinces dear old dad to get rid of Hercules by sending him on a dangerous mission to Egypt which  shock horror is a set up and to be fair the fight scenes in the desert makes this film not a total waste of time.. Our hero survives goes all Russell Crowe for a while then returns to Greece to have his revenge.\n\nOkay this film sucks, it's that simple it should've been released as straight to DVD nonsense. The film is badly miscast, Roxanne McKee is five years older than Kellan Lutz so the mother son relatiionship in this film is just absurd, Lutz is 29 and playing 20 year old is just laughable. Somehow he manages to better in Arena alongside Samuel L. Jackson than he does here. And where in greek mythology does Hercules wield a sword which can utilise poor CG lightining.\n\nPut simplly one to avoid, one can only hope Dwayne 'The  Rock' Johnson's Hercules will be much better than this tosh.",

I can usually enjoy any swords and sorcery type film and find something good about it. It is staggering to me that with a mythology as rich and engaging to draw from, they choose a tired rehashing of Gladiator as the main focus of the film. No doubt holding the more interesting material back for future sequels. The laughable love story is unengaging, poorly scripted and given far too much screen time. What really disappoints is the action sequences. Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this. It wastes a good deal of time with a clumsy mix of fighting scenes in which Hercules is repeatedly captured and/or defeated. I really don't know what I recommend from this film. Everything in the movie has been done better in other films. I hope this film tanks but I doubt it. It will make a profit and encourage more of the same I'm sure. \n\nIn Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., a queen succumbs to the lust of Zeus to bear a son promised to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the king and restore peace to a land in hardship. But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time. The story behind one of the greatest myths is revealed in this action-packed epic - a tale of love, sacrifice and the strength of the human spirit.",

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING else is consistent with the mythos of Hercules. Below are a few misleading points:\n1)Neither Hercules nor his parents ever were royalty, they were peasants and lived in Thebes.\n2)Zeus slept with Alkmene only because she was hot(Zeus does that often), Hercules had no purpose, just cool superhuman strength.\n3)Hercules never was a slave, there is no character called Sotiris, his tutor Chiron was a centaur, his stepfather was a good man, Hebe was the goddess of youth and married Hercules after his death when he himself became a god.\n4)Hera was jealous because Zeus had cheated so she gave Hercules a madness that made him kill his family(he had a wife and kids at that point). In order to find peace he started doing the famous labours for a king.\n\nps: i don't want to be a pain, i just don't ever want to hear that Hercules was a gladiator and The Gladiator with Russel Crow is the better Hercules movie.",

            "content": "It's hard to know where to begin after you've just experienced a mountain of sh*t. Greek mythology has always enticed me. It's interesting to say the least, not to mention beautifully poetic. Films like, Clash of the Titans  and it's sequel, make my blood boil. Once again, here is yet another mythology baed film that utterly fails. \"The Legend of Hercules'' is directed by Renny Harlin, and stars: Kallan Lutz, Scott Adkins, Johnathon Schaech, Liam Garrigan, Gaia Weiss , and Roxanne Mckee.\n\nQueen Alcmene (Mckee) is impregnated by Zues one night, as was foretold by the goddess. Her husband,  King Amphitryon (Adkins) believes she was with another man, and becomes exceedingly angry. He is so enraged that he grimaces throughout the entire film. The queen names the child Hercules, by order of the goddess. Years later, Hercules (Lutz) and his love Hebe (Weiss) are fooling around in the river. Suddenly, the brother of Hercules named, Iphicles (Garrigan) discovers them in the woods. He brings them back to the king, where they are told that Hebe will be wed to Iphicles, for Iphicles will be the future king. Obviously, the two lovers are devastated, so they run away together. This results in them being caught, brought back, and punished. Hercules must leave and go fight in Egypt.\n\nOne would imagine that the actor playing Hercules would be strong, gruff, and in charge. Kallan Lutz is the worst actor one could chose for this role. He is utterly bland, boring, and lifeless. He isn't likable--as the character should be--nor is he a guy you want to root for. He is not even tough. Honestly, he comes off as soft and weak. The second worst performance comes from Scott Adkins. His performance as the king was just ghastly. He was constantly grimacing, yelling, and shaking his fists. Every single performance was dull and flat, without exception. The characters are lifeless and dull as well.\n\nPerhaps the worst element of this film, is the production value. Seeing as this is a film about Hercules, the expectation is that there will  lots of action. There is, and every bit of it is awful. The sword fights, fits fights, and battles are all weighed down by constant annoying slow motion shots. I am not against slow motion shots, as long as they are used in moderation. In this film, they'd use a somewhat appropriate slow motion shot, then follow up with several more that just didn't work. It's painfully obvious this film wanted to be like 300. However, the action is so poor that it pales in comparison.\n\nThere are allot of special effects (CGI) in this movie. Several of the special effects shots looked okay. The rest looked absolutely horrible! You can tell that they're using green screen, and you can tell that they're using CGI. Whoever was in charge of the special effects was extremely lazy. That is the best way I can describe this movie. It is very, very lazy. Even the costumes and weapons are poorly made. Several costumes looked passable, others looked like they were off the set of a high school play.\n\n\"The Legend of Hercules'' is a dull affair, full of flat performances and uninteresting characters. The only redeeming value--if you want to call it that--was the surprisingly decent camera work. Besides this, nothing is impressive about this movie. The romance is an utter joke, the costumes are horrible, the sets are obviously sets, and the special effects are lazy.",

            "content": "Swanner:           January is the worst month of the year for movies. It's when studios release the bad movies they spent too much money on and need the films to have a theatrical run so they have some sort of life on home video... Enter The Legend of Hercules. This latest Hercules from director Renny Harlin stars Kellan Lutz as the son of Zeus. My question is who gives Renny Harlin this kind of money anymore?\n\n \n\nJudd:                The last Renny Harlin film I saw was boy-licious The Covenant, which explains the amount of beefcake in The Legend of Hercules. Granted, these sword and sandal epics traditionally feature a plethora of glistening pectorals, but I don't recall one scene where Kellan Lutz is covered up. Not that it's a bad thing. At least he knows where his appeal lies - Taylor Lautner should take a lesson. However, anyone expecting to see anything remotely based on the traditional stories of Hercules is going to be in for a rude awakening. Actually, the movie is so boring that awakening may not be the right word.\n\n \n\nSwanner:           Hercules does look like it's been directed by Joel Schumacher. Did you notice how forgettable the whole film was?  I was trying to remember a couple of scenes and it's just gone. The only positive I can say about the film is that it was short. The film appears to move well but then all the exposition just weighs it down so I stopped following the story. They were trying for that Spartacus look and feel, but Spartacus had time to develop characters and storylines. Spartacus also went there with the killings where Hercules is wrestling for that PG-13 rating, so we don't even get the blood and guts to brighten up this turd.  \n\n \n\nJudd:                It may only be 99 minutes long, but they are some of the longest 99 minutes I've ever experienced. You mention the lack of blood and guts, and while that shouldn't make or break a film, The Legend of Hercules is noticeably bloodless. People are getting stabbed, beheaded, whipped and no one bleeds. It's off putting. The movie could have had potential of it were more campy. There are times when it tiptoes with the idea, but it seems that Harlin was afraid to go full Immortals - which Kellan Lutz was also in, as Poseidon, and wore the most FAB-ulous hat.\n\n \n\nSwanner:           That's what I was trying to say...no comment! Make the film bloody and violent or make it so silly we can't help but like it. This was just a bad script mixed with some bad acting. Before you start bad mouthing Taylor Lautner just remember that Taylor has that beautiful face where Kellan looks like a goof. The Italians use to make these kind of films with bodybuilder but they didn't give them any lines. Just a grunt here, a grunt there.  If they were ugly, grow a beard and no close-ups. These movies were successful because they didn't take themselves too seriously. Harlin, on the other hand, still thinks his shit don't stink, but his movies do!\n\n \n\nSwanner:            1/2 \n\nJudd:                No stars",

Not only that, but all the audience saw was Kellan Lutz's nipples the whole time. The leading lady wasn't anything to write home about... It's like the producers had such a hard time selling the script that they couldn't even convince a hot bimbo to take the role. Watching the actors stumble through their lines felt like watching a middle school play... Except most middle schoolers could probably pull off fake accents better. This was the biggest waste of money I've blown in a very long time. DO NOT WATCH THIS IN THEATERS! I would wait for it to come out on Netflix and spend time trolling it with my friends!",

Nothing works the action is just a 300 rip off, you know going slow then fast then slow again. The acting is awful, Kellan Lutz has zero charisma and the woman who he's in love with is just horrible. The only good actor is Hercules's best friend who is genuinely great. The villain is awful he poses no threat and there's nothing memorable about him. The cgi is terrible, none of it looks convincing or good. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in quite some time, it's up there with the purge as far as terrible movies of the past few years. Don't see it it's dreadful or though funny in parts. F",

            "content": "Movie Review Maven grade = C\nIn a Nutshell:  I used to get a kick out of the old Kevin Sorbo TV show \"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\".  Well, this is nothing like that.  You know that awesome Disney movie \"Hercules\"?  Well, sadly, it's nothing like that either.  Instead, this is a disappointing retelling that has no sense of humor and the worst movie extras I've seen in years.  You know a movie is bad when you actually notice the extras.  My 8 year old nephew walked out of the movie because he was bored.  Yikes. \n\nIt feels like it wants to be the movie 300, but just can't pull it together past 200.  It also reminded me of a cheesy version of the movie Gladiator. If you're interested in watching lots of massive arms and muscular thighs fighting for an hour and half, you're going to love this movie.  I'm thinking that King of Thrones fans will enjoy the stylized production sets and epic scenery.\n\nUplifting theme:\n\tA little help from God can make all the difference.  (wink)\n\tI need to work out more.\n\nThings I liked:\n\tI thought Queen Alcmene's hairdos were super cute.\n\tHercules and Hebe share some very romantic vows of love.\n\tThe aerial view of King Amphitryon's kingdom looked amazing.\n\tNice 360 degree camera work during the scene when..SPOILER ALERT...Hercules is tied up with the Captain.\n\tCool electric whip at the end\n\tSome of the fight scenes featured slow-motion action that impressively showed off skills and CGI.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n\tHercules' rousing speech could have been Braveheart worthy, but it was so rushed it was a yawn short of inspiring.  In contrast, I thought the speech given by the Princess of Crete to Iphicles about how much she loved Hercules was touching.\n\tKellan Lutz' pretty-boy baby face and blonde hair didn't scream Greek demigod to me.\n\tThe lion CGI looked totally fake and cheesy.\n\tThere were flurries in the air in several scenes.  Is it supposed to be snow? Cotton in the trees?  \n\tToo many lines were growled through clenched teeth\n\tI hate fake flying, especially in fight scenes.\n\tThere are some dumb lines like \"Get out of my way, woman!\"\n\tWhat kind of accent was Jonathan Schaech going for?  Terrible.\n\tHUGE SPOILER ALERT...so Hebe stabs herself to kill Iphicles behind her...she survives and he doesn't.  Tell me how that works?  Lame.\n\nFunny lines: None.  This film took itself too seriously.\n\nInspiring lines:\n\tThe Captain was asked \"How is it you survived those places?\" He answered \"Hope.  I was given hope.\"  Hope is a very powerful thing.\n\tThere were a lot of references to Hercules as Jesus Christ and Zeus as God the Father.  For example, Hercules is chained with his arms outstretched, immaculate conception, and even called a \"so called Savior.\"  In a speech reminiscent of Pontius Pilate, King Amphitryon mocks Hercules and asks \"Do you offer these people salvation when you cannot save yourself?\"  Hera says to Hercules \"Your father has always been there.  You were just not ready for him.\"  Another reference is when Hercules looks up in chains and cries \"Father.  I believe in you.  Grant me strength.\"\n\nThings to look for:\n\tThe pretty golden eagle that is a sign from Zeus \n\tThe fun vertical braid hairdo on the guy in the rock pit fight scene\n\tBlue fuzzy Trojan hat worn by an extra in a crowd scene towards the end\n\tCool arrowheads\n\nTips for parents: \nChildren familiar with the Disney telling of Hercules will not recognize this story or character.  There is a lot of fighting, but it is mostly bloodless.  No profanity, but there is a sexual scene when Hercules is conceived by an invisible Zeus, which is a bit odd and awkward.  Hercules and Hebe are mostly covered in a love scene in a meadow.",

It felt like the writers spent too much time drinking Red Bull, watching Gladiator on repeat and playing the video game God of War. There really wasn't an overall theme and I feel the movie suffered. It was trying to be about FREEDOM ('murica) and then you had the FAITH element and then there was the REVENGE element plus the doing it all for LOVE! None of these themes were developed particularly well and just felt scattered.\n\nThe acting in this movie wasn't really that bad, all things considered. You have Kellan Lutz playing Hercules whose sole job in the movie was to stand there flex his mighty pectorals and grunt. He did well, truly an excellent job of showing his acting chops. Ladies a little eye candy for you if you like that thing. Scott Adkins was probably the stand out performance as King Amphitryon but that was in the first five minutes; it went downhill from there. Liam Garrigan, who played the eldest son of the king, was channeling Joaquim Phoenix from Gladiator. He had the crazy eyes down but was lacking the same intensity and never felt as creepy. I noticed that the story often felt disconnected and the characters weren't given enough time to develop and their motivations often felt confusing.\n\nThe thing I did like about this movie was the hint of supernatural elements. I would have liked it if there were more of it. I must admit I was bummed that they made the story of Hercules an EPIC war movie instead of a movie about a man trying to become something more through select tasks. I think a fun Hercules movie with a plucky sidekick and a lighter tone with more humor was the movie I wanted. Wouldn't it be cool if there was a TV show like what I described that was fun, corny and a good sense of adventure? Oh you know, there IS a TV show like that. Personally I say you should go watch reruns of the TV show and skip this movie.\n\nVerdict: Found Wanting",

            "content": "There's been no shortage of films portraying the mythological Greek hero, Hercules.  Sadly, nearly every single one of them is either embarrassing and/or outdated to the point there isn't really a film to point at and say - that's the best Hercules movie.  Some could make a case for the Disney animated feature from 1997, but other than that, Hercules has been best defined by Kevin Sorbo's portrayal of the character in the television show, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.  And, if director Renny Harlin thought he was the man to reinvigorate the character in his film, The Legend of Hercules, then epic fail applies here.\n\nIn The Legend of Hercules, Kellan Lutz stars as Hercules, the son of Zeus - the father of the Gods.  The film begins with the introduction of King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins), as he easily adds another kingdom to his empire.  He is a bloodthirsty man that will do anything for power, a trait that his wife, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee), finds to be revolting.  She prays to the Gods to put an end to this King's rule so there may be peace.  Understanding what she is asking for, she is then \"impregnated\" by Zeus - and prepares to have a child that the king knows full well is not his own.\n\nFlash forward many years and Hercules (who goes by another name that the king picked out for him) is in the middle of a tryst with Hebe (Gaia Weiss), the daughter of a king from a neighboring rival kingdom.  However, she has already been promised to Hercules' diabolical brother, Iphicles (Liam Garrigan).  Naturally, the brothers become at odds with one another, prompting the king (who shows favoritism towards his one true son) to send Hercules off on a mission of war that is doomed to fail and lead to his death.\n\nAware that he's has an uphill battle to contend with, Hercules is desperate to return home before his brother marries his true love.  Along the way, he must face down an army, slavery, various battles, and eventually, his own \"family's\" hatred towards him - not to mention the unexpected realization that he's the son of the most powerful God of them all. \n\nDoesn't that sound exciting?  To some, it might actually sound appealing.  Well, shouldn't buy into it and don't you dare waste a single second thinking about watching this monstrosity of a movie.  The odds are usually going to be against a film succeeding when a sub-par director, like Renny Harlin, signs on to helm the project.  After all this is the guy that's is most notable for directing films that include A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Driven, and 12 Rounds.  The quality of those particular films speak for themselves and provide enough information to know this Hercules film is not to be taken seriously. \n\nIf the directing wasn't bad enough, the acting doesn't do this film any favors either.  Leading man Kellan Lutz, who some might recognize from his small supporting role in the Twilight films, might look buff and ready for action - but terrible action sequences and mediocre visual effects really kill any ability for Lutz to show his acting skill.  For reasons behind understanding, not one single role was given to a major Hollywood player - limiting the film's advertising capabilities and general appeal to a wider audience.  It's difficult enough for moviegoers to invest their time and money into major films (who have an above average chance these days of being terrible) with A-list actors, so apparently the people behind this film didn't learn very much from 2011's Conan the Barbarian debacle (which also starred an unrecognizable leading man in the lead).   \n\n\nUnfortunately, there's absolutely nothing (and I mean nothing) about Lutz's character that makes you care about him.  These characters, along with Luz's love interest, portrayed by the forgettable Gaia Weiss, are completely devoid of emotion - and if you need proof (the poor folks out there that have seen it know what I'm talking about), then look no further than the shrug-worthy villains.  Both King Amphitryon and his son, Iphicles, attempt to be grandiose, but simply appear to be just as cheesy and unbelievably annoying as the \"good guys.\"  Frankly, each and every one of the characters could either live, die, or become bean farmers for all I care - just as long as I never have to watch this movie ever again.  If you couldn't already tell, this is one of those generic hero-worshiping movies where the good guy lives and the bad guys die - meaning the only question that viewers will be asking themselves is how long will it take to get through it all and to the credits? \n\nOverall, The Legend of Hercules starts out badly, gets worse, rips off Gladiator (in cliff note fashion), and eventually ends on a terrible note (featuring one of the dumbest and most mishandled endings in quite a long time).   More often than not and with every passing scene, this film is a great example of how to waste a lot of money to make a monumentally poor film.  Not only is it poor, it lacks authenticity, mind-blowing effects, and characters with heart.  However, the only thing that stops this movie from being a complete and utter failure is the appeal that it might have for young boys in the 8-year-old range.  Sure, this film is violent, but it's actually tasteful violence that plays out just as a Saturday morning cartoon would - meaning there's no blood, gore, or abusive language.  In fact, the three stooges might be more violent than The Legend of Hercules.  In any event, I know it's only January, but I have a feeling this movie winds up on a lot of people's worst films of 2014 list.\n\nGRADE:  D-",

But alas, the movie itself didn't know if it was going to be real of surreal. Hercules was the son of Zeus, had the makings of a demigod and did feats of strength mainly exhibited in the last fifth of the film.  So only in the later part were there action scenes worthy of being called legendary.\n\nOn a final note, this human son of a God abandonment issue has been explored several times in other films...

The Legend of Hercules is not only going to be my least favorite movie of 2014, but I think it just made my top 20 least favorite films of all-time. Yeah! This movie was that bad. I know some people are going to say \"that this year just started and there's going to be more bad movies and who knows... some of those bad movies maybe worse than The Legend of Hercules.\" Now that could be true, but I don't think so because The Legend of Hercules was something very special, it's a movie that only comes out every few years, it's a movie that's so bad that you would rather watch all the Twilight movies twenty times then watch this movie ever again. So what went wrong? Well, everything went wrong in this movie, but I'll be more specific. First off the acting is atrocious; there wasn't a single actor or actress that could act in this movie. Kellan Lutz plays the lead role of Hercules and it was just a joke watching him play this role because he didn't do a single thing right. Now believe it or not, but the rest of the actors in the film were way worse. Every actor in the film either gave over the top performances or gave very bland performances, so either way they all sucked. Another thing that sucked was the direction. The film was directed by Renny Harlin, who's done pretty decent films in his past, like Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger, but let's face it he's done more bad movies then good movies. Look at his list; he's directed such bad movies, like Driven, Mindhunters, 12 Rounds and The Covenant. I think it's pretty bad though that all of those movies are more watchable then The Legend of Hercules. So if your movie makes Twilight or The Covenant more watchable, then your movie must really suck. Anyways! The other things that sucked in this film were the costumes. Almost every costume looked ugly and cheap looking, sometimes it looked like they just grabbed old sheets and worn them as old clothes. The CGI was also really bad looking, I can tell this film was low-budget, but damn I've seen TV shows with an even lower budget that have better CGI then this movie. Now the action! Holy crap the action was really irritating to watch. Pretty much every fight scene lasted like 30 seconds and almost every fight scene was in slow motion, which was so damn annoying. I don't know what else to say other then please don't ever see this film. This film is a film that everyone should avoid, not even young teenagers that love action movies will even like this movie. This movie is the epitome of bad; this movie is the crowning achievement of pure shit. So yeah! I highly recommend that people should stay far away from this movie as possible.",

So insipid that it doesn't inspire parody so much as make you think you're watching one, Hercules makes the craptacular Z-List TV series Hercules: The Legendary Journeys look like the intellectual equivalent of The Wire. A CG-animated lion, for instance, inspires about as much fear in moviegoers as a common cold to the Man of Steel. And speaking of Superman, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson will be taking on Herc later this summer under the dubious direction of Brett Ratner. As this Herculean turd slides down the screen, however, their version is starting to sound like popcorn--munching Oscar bait. \n\nIn this PG-13-rated adventure arriving in theaters 6 months before a similar such take on the Greek strongman, Hercules (Lutz) must use his formidable powers to fight his way back to his rightful kingdom after being betrayed by his stepfather, the King, and exiled and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love. \n\nKellan Lutz flexes huge muscles and delivers the right lines, but he's no mythmaker. Ripping off style from Zach Snyder (300) and material from, well, NOT mythology, director Renny Harlin presents not so much a low rent Thor as a broke ass Gladiator. If by selling this as an origin tale, the producers mean to make more chapters, then it's this reviewer's duty to relay some sound advice: Stop while you're behind. \n\nBottom line: Crap of the Titans",

But after seeing the trailer for this new Hercules movie, I just knew it was going to stink! So, I set my expectations really low. I figured if they at least make the battle scenes entertaining to watch and don't take themselves too seriously, I'd have something positive to say about it. Sadly, while the action does have its very few shining moments, I couldn't stop thinking about how I'd seen this kind of thing before. I few titles came to mind. 300. Gladiator. Spartacus the movie. Spartacus the TV show. Hercules the Disney animated movie, and accompanying promotion figurines available with a happy meal. ALL better than The Legend of Hercules!\n\nHercules looks cheap, and the acting (well .. being on the screen and talking and stuff) is laughably bad. I couldn't figure out why Kellan Lutz was even in this movie. Maybe they thought he was pretty or something. Hunky maybe? Tanned. Certainly tanned that's for sure. Or was it dirt? I had a hard time figuring that out. This movie made me wish I was back in the 80?s. At least then we'd have a proper God sized Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Hercules. Was The Rock busy? What about Dave Bautista? He's HUGE! It felt like we ended up with the son of Zeus-lite. A Hercules that does Pilates, eats his leafy greens and keeps an eye on his blood pressure. This film needed a Hercules that could bench press a cow while eating a bloody rare steak!\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you've seen 300 and/or Gladiator. Go watch them again and leave this one alone. Failing that, just expect a very loud, very stupid movie and lots of overly pretty men screaming at the sky. A movie that doesn't even have the good sense not to take itself too seriously.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe cheap visual effects are a bit of a let down, but this will still work best on the big screen. Just do a matin\u00e9e if you can't wait for this to be available on your Netflix or Amazon Prime streaming list.\n\nWorst element for me:\n\nAll the screaming at the sky. A lost count of how many times different characters pointed their sword props at the sky and started screaming. All the shouting too. And (eye-roll) the clich\u00e9d rally the troops speech by Hercules - hilarious! I wouldn't follow him into battle, but I'd certainly check out his show at the Improv.\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette",

I'd never seen Kellan Lutz before, but I found him completely boring to watch. However, that could be because the script didn't give any of the actors anything to work with.\n\nFrom the action that is directly ripped off from Zack Snyder (director of 300 and Watchmen) to the cardboard characters and their motivations, The Legend of Hercules is not necessarily disappointing (because I didn't have any hopes for it), but it's laughable at best.",

Dont' get me started on the costumes.  Spartacus does a much better job than what's on screen here.   It's not quite as bad as the Knights in Jack the Giant Slayer but it's not far off.

There were really only three \"Epic\" moments(Spoilers it's In the trailer btw lol) when Hercules harnessed his powers, which really is the point of the literary term Epic before it was blown out of proportion and every scene in a modern day film had to be a a candy fest. I think we've been spoiled a lot by the short attention span viewing that leaves little character development in modern day cinema. This film does goes against the grain and allows for a more down-to-earth realistic portrayal of the Greek Mythos and has some good character development which made the impact of power use even sweeter compared to the bitterness that starts Hercules' journey . The film had these good elements going for it , the love story(The girl was meh)  the girl was a good actor but didn't have the \"I'm going to kill everyone in this kingdom to get you back\" type of hotness/glamorization, the action and combat segments- I really enjoyed it and as I said I think being reserved with the boons/abilities is a plus for the movie and adds to the impact, and the titillating revenge/justice killing, and the visuals/CGI(very pretty). However, the down side was sadly the main character himself who was not relatable for anything other than the plight of being wronged. The main actor, not to bash him was pretty bad because he felt like the the \"jock\" in highschool trying to get his hot girlfriend back with purely brute strength rather than an underdog that develops in to a hero and realizes his greatness(E.G. an Epic). I mean I felt the grabbed the first Blonde haired chisled guy and placed him as Hercules. One thing that could have saved the movie I think was adding a comic-relief foil character. I mean they had \"Spartacus\" in the dang arena getting his ass handed to him. Even though I gushed at the star power I stand by having a physically weaker humorous character to tame the size of man that was Hercules throughout there journey. All in all, I'd watch it again...... on Netflix.",

Probably the worst thing about the movie is that it hard to support Kellan Lutz as Hercules. His performance is lacking, and constantly watching him make stupid faces during the action scenes is agonizing. Lutz isn't the only offender when it comes to bad acting, almost the entire cast sucks. Liam McIntyre gives the only respectable performance, and it's great to see the Spartacus star step back onto the arena sands. Shame about that bowl haircut though.\r While the performances range from lacking to just plain bad, the action is mostly decent. Granted there are countless movies that have done it better, and without constantly having characters goofily being thrown through the air in slow motion, but it's at least watchable. The action scenes are a constant form of unintentional comedic gold. One scene involving a lightning whip is particularly amusing. The action is the only enjoyable part of the film, but entirely for the wrong reasons.\r This is clearly just one huge b-movie. With Lutz failing to make a compelling Hercules in any way, the whole film noticeably suffers more than I feel it otherwise would have. Yes, it would have still suffered from the poor plot and bad acting from the rest of the cast, but had they at least found a half-decent person to play Hercules then maybe there would have at least been reason to overlook a lot of it's flaws and maybe even care about the romance at the center of this film. As it stands now I recommend you skip this one and hope that Dwayne Johnson's upcoming Hercules movie is better later this year. My total score for the film is a 4.2/10=Bad.",

Unless it features a Game of Thrones star, I ain't going to pay $10 bucks to watch another Hercules rip-off. I've watched a lot of Hercules way back in the 90's including the Disney version and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys staring the great Kevin Sorbo. How many updated versions of Hercules will they last? I don't know but Hollywood should just keep the Hercules to rest already. The Legend of Hercules features a terrible action hero who really can't act as Hercules, an dimwitted script, funny CGI elements, bland source material, and sometimes even Renny Harlin's Cutthroat Island is still a flop, maybe this one could add to his list of bad movies. He's a great director but needs to bring back Geena Davis and finally make some action movies together. If anyone buying a copy of the movie, please seek therapy. Bottom line: Avoid! Nothing you're going to see here. I just hope that Brett Rattner should be just fine about the new Hercules movie cause I know The Rock is going to kick some ass. I wonder if it's way better than The Mummy Returns or The Scorpion King?

They are so inaccurate and give people the wrong perception of history, then again, The Legend of Hercules was directed by Renny Harlin, and he wouldn't put his name on any old thing. After praying to Zeus for guidance, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) is picked to carry the son of God. The King however knows that Hercules (Kellan Lutz) isn't his and commits an act of betrayal that separates Hercules from the woman he loves. When I think of the mighty Hercules, Kellan Lutz isn't the first name that comes to mind, but he does a pretty solid job with the role. The rest of the cast also performed equally well, and for once the cast wasn't the problem. A film like this has a story to tell and that story can't be told in an hour and half. I enjoyed the narrative, but the best parts of the film were so rushed, that I felt slighted. The whole Egyptian angle should have been a major theme, but it only lasts about ten minutes, and before you know it, Herc is fighting for his life is arenas around the world, scenes that were also rushed. The film is very straight forward and far too predictable for a story like this. There are Kings and Gods, legends from thousands of years ago, but no twists or turns? No surprises thrown in for dramatic effect at least? Overall, the film is somewhat entertaining and as I said the cast was good, but The Legend of Hercules flies by at the speed of light, which makes the film difficult to really get behind.",

The answer is actually no, it isn't. Having said that it is by no means a great film, but I personally found it more entertaining than say, the po faced 'The Book Thief' or the soon to be marvelled at, but less than marvelous 'Captain America'. It's true the dialogue is uninspired and we have seen all this done before so much better in films like 'Gladiator' and '300' which it is obviously trying to emulate. However, the story is ok if predictable and it doesn't really bore one. Technically the film is more lacking than some. The special effects have a cut price feel to them and the photography comes over as an unfortunate mish mash of styles. The lighting of some scenes resembles cosmetic or shampoo adverts in how they have been shot. Other scenes seem to imply that the weather was not working for the production as they have a washed out desaturated look. I don't think anyone can argue with the fact that Kellan Lutz was built for the part even if an Oscar will not be his any time soon. On the plus side both the music and sound are very good.",

Maybe the big stars don't believe in him that may lead him to recruit second stream actors.\r The romance portions were too bad, no chemistry, physics, mathematics, nothing, but just an ordinary without the feelings. When it comes to the game of throne, that's looked okay as it scripted like 'snakes and ladders' game. Anyway, it was a well known story among most of us which was altered and told somewhat differently. Disappoint is there though still somehow watchable.\r Don't force yourself for this, because you are not going to miss any masterpiece.

I have a new contender for the worst movie of the year, and it's The Legend of F*cking Hercules. Although \"Transformers: Age of Exinction\" gets an honorable mention, this one really takes the cake. Let me start by saying that Hercules himself is portrayed by a guy who doesn't know how to act and doesn't look handsome, at all. Seriously, he looks ugly. There's one scene where his love interest is dying and instead of... well, you know... performing, he just says a bundle of words and in the next scene, his girlfriend (I think) is suddenly ALIVE! HOW? HOW DID SHE GET BETTER? WHAT HAPPENED? DIDN'T SHE GET STABBED IN HER LEFT SHOULDER?????? AHHH WHATEVER!!!\r It's one problem that this movie has: The pacing. Holy sh*t, the pacing is f*cking horrendous. We jump from one scene to another without substance, feeling more like a marathon than a movie. The plot is convoluted at times, in fact, so convoluted that occasionally you don't know what the characters are talking about. Seriously, along with the bad pacing, we still have banal conversations between underdeveloped characters that are portrayed by untalented people, resulting in a dull movie that is 1 and a half hours (hey, at least, it's not as long as Transformers 4!).\r The action and the effects are reprehensibly bad. One thing I notice in the action sequences is that the director decided to put slow-motion in every single one of them, and I ask: What was the point? Why do you need to put slow-motion in your fight scenes? Hmm? For 3D? But, I'm watching this movie in my house, and I don't have 3D, so the fights don't come as exciting (because they are not). They come as moronic. Hey, I'm not gonna lie, I laughed at some parts. When the movie is not relying on unnecessary slow-motion, they resort to misguidedly choreographed battles. They are barely enthusiastic, if you ask me. It's a pity, because with all the swords, shields and equipment this movie had, it could've been a lot better. Like, A LOT.\r The cast looks bored. Kellan Lutz makes a terrible Hercules. I bet that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson will make a better Hercules than him, and I haven't seen that movie yet! Luckily, for Lutz, he can't be blamed for torpedoing the project, as everything in this film is sub-par and so bland. The actress who plays the love interest of Lutz's character is just a bad actress. Hey, you girl, hear me out: Your bad performance in this hellish film was noticed by me! I saw how your character died, AND THAT WASN'T EVEN BELIEVABLE IN THE SLIGHTEST! URGH!\r Final Score to The Legend of Hercules: 0/10. Overall, avoid this clusterf*ck of a movie boasting a lackluster plot, generic characters, horrible pacing, uninspiring acting and laughably unexciting battle scenes. GOD, THIS MOVIE IS WORSE THAN TRANSFORMERS AGE OF EXTINCTION AND THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING BECAUSE THAT MOVIE WAS A FLAMING PILE OF SH*T.

So I bought it for 10 dollars because I seen a review that said the 3D was good. And it was pretty good overall using my PSVR on my PS4 Slim. A couple scenes in the dark didn't look good but overall the 3D I would give a 8/10. Now it's not a good movie but it doesn't deserve all the hate it gets. It could have been a 10/10 if they fixed a couple things. First the editing was bizarre. A lot of scenes were cut way too short. It needs to be re edited completely. The 3D was good but the way scenes were cut together is all wrong. I took some editing classes in College and I'm not sure what the editor was thinking here. The dialogue wasn't great. But its's not the only reason why this movie failed. For me if you're going to try to be like the show Spartacus then why abandon all the sex and blood? I was thinking ok these fight scenes are cool but they always cut away not showing any of the actual deaths. Zero nudity and no sex scenes that show anything. If you're trying to be like Spartacus then be like it. They even hired Liam Mcintyre. But he wasn't great in Spartacus, Andy Whitfield was. Unfortunately Andy Whitfield died and Liam Mcintyre replaced him. None of the season's after Blood and Sand were as good as Blood and Sand. But they were still good. Not just because of the sex and violence and blood. But because of the writing. In Spartacus they set up everything and pay it off. It's a great soap opera for men. Its one of my all time favourite shows. The Legend of Hercules is a movie for boys. It should of been rated R but they made it for children. And a movie doesn't have the time to be a show like Spartacus. It just doesn't have the time to set everything up. But it still could be cool. And don't get me wrong some scenes were cool. But there just wasn't any weight behind it. You do get a love story but I just didn't care that much. I did like the scene where Hebe finds Hercules in that little pond area. I felt a little bit of emotion but the dialogue killed it.. But good acting by Gaia Weiss here. I didn't like her in Vikings but this was a good performance by her. She's a good actress I just didn't like what they did with her in Vikings. The actor who played Hercules wasn't great. But I put it on the writing and director. He's either yelling or whispering. I liked Scott Adkins playing King Amphitryon. He was good. And the guy that played his son played his role well. So these are my thoughts right after watching. I will probably edit this again after watching it a couple more times. I would still rather watch this than Avengers Endgame or half of the bad films these days. It doesn't deserve a 0/10. The 3D 8/10 the acting 5/10 the editing 2/10 the dialogue 4/10 the story 6/10 the fight scenes 6/10 It's worth a watch in 3D.",

This film is just one more that doesIts not uncommon, unfortunately, to see Greek mythology being run over and clobbered by cinema or TV, with its most famous stories being rebuilt or turned on things that are anything but Greek mythology. This film is just one more that does precisely that, using characters of the myth of Hercules to create a new story. So I'll start by object the title. This isn't \"The Legend of Hercules\", it's just a story where Hercules enters without us understanding why. Script is so basic and primary that it looks like one of those lousy, melodramatic novels, sold in supermarkets for a few coins. I would even say that screenplay is just an excuse for a ton of action and pure hard pounding which seems inspired by movies like \"300\" or \"Rambo\".Although I have managed to like or digest some of his films, Renny Harlin is far from being a truly skilled director. In this case, he totally lost his notion of ridicule, and this movie will probably haunt him to death. The cast is extraordinarily bad. Kellan Lutz is a lousy protagonist. It may have muscles, but it also has the same dramatic expressiveness as a Guinea Pig. He has no charisma, no presence and cannot express emotions, just strength. I've seen hosts of TV cooking shows with more dramatic skills than this actor, who should look for another profession. Good luck with that, Lutz! Gaia Weiss is attractive but she doesn't seem to know what she's doing there, and is never fully committed to the movie. Somebody give a map to this girl, she's lost and confused! Scott Adkins gave life to a cardboard villain, histrionic and pathetic, worthy of the worst possible death. Roxanne McKee is too young for the role she played. Liam McIntyre seems to be the best actor in this disastrous cast.Visually, the film abuses CGI and sound effects to increase the impact of scenes, especially fights and action. However, the quality of the final work is rather mediocre. Bad cinematography, blurred, with colors between gray and brown, doesn't help either. Combats are utterly unrealistic, some blows and jumps are absurd and that effect of pausing or slowing down the film for a few moments in the midst of a jump or blow is so clich\u00e9 that it gave me cravings for vomit. Costumes and sets are equally ashamed. The soundtrack is boring and ordinary.In short: this film is a caricature, a cartoon where characters from the Greek legend of Hercules were chewed, dismantled and thrown into a kind of idiotic video game, lifeless and without emotion, for an hour and a half of pointless fights.",
