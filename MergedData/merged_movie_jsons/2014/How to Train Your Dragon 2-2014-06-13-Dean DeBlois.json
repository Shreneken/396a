            "content": "Seeing the original 'How to Train Your Dragon' for the first time made me feel like a kid again and it has since become one of my all-time favorite films, so when I got a chance to see this, I was as much worried as I was excited. In the past, some of the films I have anticipated the most turned out to be the biggest disappointments, so I took a deep breath and tried to lower my expectations going in. I needn't have feared: I'm glad to report that Dean DeBlois has crafted a beautifully animated tale that loses nothing of its predecessor's sense of fun and adventure, while it enhances Hiccup's and Toothless' journey into an almost classic - and unexpectedly touching - \"coming-of-age\" story.While still colourful, playful and visually all over the place (I mean that in a good way*), the tone of the sequel is noticeably darker and the predominant themes are more mature. The writers made some (for Hollywood movies) unusually daring decisions in having Hiccup face very tough realities in life; especially one about the danger of over-humanizing pets and forgetting about their animal nature. Small children had perhaps better stay away, since the film is also quite a bit scarier than the original. That's not saying that there isn't a lot of humour \u2013 but the wisecracks of Jonah Hill & Co. will most certainly be lost on the very young and are clearly targeted towards older children and teenagers. *A word about the animation: This is among the most visually stunning animated films I have ever seen; at times, there is so much eye-popping spectacle on screen that you don't know where to focus anymore - this one definitely needs a second viewing.My overall verdict: While the storyline may not be quite as straightforward as the original's, the well written, credible character development and the gorgeous visuals are more than satisfying. 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' could have played it safe by merely repeating the original's formula \u2013 it opted instead for the introduction of fascinating new characters while giving the ones we know more back-story and a chance to grow up and explore new territory. I would say that next to 'Days of Future Past', this is one of the best sequels Hollywood has produced in a very long time. 9 stars out of 10 (with the option of a straight 10 once I've seen it again).Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

            "content": "'How to Train Your Dragon' is my all-time favourite animated film, so when I heard a sequel was being made, I knew it was one I had to see. The last animated film I saw in the cinema was 'Toy Story 3' four years ago, so going to see this beautifully executed flick was a treat. This film truly lives up to its expectations and builds upon its predecessor's achievements like any good sequel should, and from this, the outcome is stunning. More mature and thematic than its predecessor, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is an emotionally resonant and heartfelt flick that expands upon the story of Hiccup and Toothless and their connection. With swooping and stunning visuals and epic animated set pieces, this is a sequel to remember, a modern masterpiece.",

            "content": "As unlikely as it may seem, it is a Dreamworks animation that we had most looked forward to this summer. Timed to coincide with the studio's 20th anniversary, the sequel to 2010's 'How to Train Your Dragon' could not come at a more opportune time for the studio - entertaining as they were, its more recent original works such as 'Rise of the Guardians', 'Turbo' and 'Mr Peabody and Sherman' have all underperformed at the box office, and it could certainly do with a hit to boost flagging investor confidence. But never mind that, the reason why we so eagerly anticipated this follow-up is simply because of how unexpectedly fascinating its predecessor turned out to be.Yes, the story of a Viking teenager Hiccup who befriends the titular creature Toothless and manages to convince his village that they are friend not foe was not only a rare unadulterated crowd-pleaser, it also packed some genuine emotional heft with its bittersweet ending. Like how Toothless tends to do in the film, the big-screen adaptation of Cressida Cowell's young-adult book series came out of nowhere and charmed the socks off both adults and children alike, becoming one of the biggest hits in the studio's history. And so co-writer and co-director Dean DeBlois has returned to pen and helm this sequel set five years after the events of the first movie - though this time, he is going at it without his partner Chris Sanders.Proving that two heads need not always be better than one, DeBlois' solo venture is no less compelling than the first film, and indeed sees the filmmaker demonstrate an imagination and derring-do which truly makes it soar. In a most literal way, that is exactly what the opening sequence delivers, which sees Hiccup's rowdy schoolmates - Snotlout (Jonah Hill), Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), Tuffnutt (T.J. Miller) and twin sister Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig) - participate in a dragon-racing derby which resembles Quidditch but with dragons for broomsticks and lambs for Snitches. It's an eye-popping and heart-pumping prologue, followed almost immediately by another which reunites us with Hiccup and Toothless, whose flighty adventures have turned into discovering new lands.It is on one of those explorations that both stumble onto a fortress made from shards of ice created by none other than a dragon - not just any other dragon though, but a Bewilderbeast, regarded as the most venerable of the species who can easily command the authority of his kind. Within that fortress too is a mysterious woman named Valka (Cate Blanchett), who has dedicated the last 20 years of her life freeing captured dragons and looking after them in the sanctuary under the care and protection of a Bewilderbeast - and in case you've missed the trailers, this woman also happens to be Hiccup's long-lost and presumed- dead mother.Instead of his stoic father Stoick (Gerard Butler), the emotional arc here is between Hiccup and his mother, as well as to a surprisingly poignant degree, between Hiccup's father and mother. DeBlois reserves the tender quiet moments of his film for the reunion between mother and child as well as husband and wife - in particular, a dance between Butler and Blanchett around a fire to their wedding song is bound to leave you misty-eyed - and makes sure that his film loses none of the heart and humanity that made the earlier 2010 one deeply affecting.The villain that Hiccup finds himself up against is a tyrant named Drago (Djimon Hounsou), who believes that dragons are meant to be enslaved and used against the opponents whom he oppresses. We leave you to make the judgment whether Hiccup is being na\u00efve or determined, but suffice to say that he believes in his heart that he would be able to convince Drago - as he did with the rest of his village - that dragons could very well be man's best friends if we allow them to. DeBlois plays Hiccup's naivety beautifully, culminating in some difficult consequences that reflect a temerity for the sort of heavy dramatic choices which would ultimately seal Hiccup's character transformation and ensure it be a genuinely satisfying one for his audience. Take this as a warning if you're a parent of a younger tot - it does get pretty emotionally upsetting towards the end, but the payoff is also undeniably rewarding.The same can be said of each one of the cast and characters, particularly for those who recall the earlier film. Without ever saying a single word, Toothless still manages to be ceaselessly endearing, embodying not only feline affection and playfulness this time round, but a canine sense of loyalty to Hiccup. Each of the other dragons, however brief their appearance, are also designed with attention to personality. It is just as delightful to be reunited with the human characters. Jay Baruchel captures nicely the transition of Hiccup from teen to adulthood, and is just as appealing with America Ferrera as his girlfriend Astrid. Butler brings tough and tender to Stoick and shares some lovely chemistry with Blanchett in their emotive scenes together.And if there were any doubt that the action were spectacular, well then let us put them to rest. In two words, the film is visually dazzling, and we're not talking about the cornucopia of creatures and backdrops. DeBlois once again concocts some terrifyingly exhilarating sequences here, which make ample use of 3D for maximum elation. It is a thrill- ride all right, but more than just theme part excitement, this sequel packs an emotional wallop that is both moving and uplifting at the same time. If you loved the first film, you'll be sure that this second entry into what is now planned as a trilogy more than brings this animated franchise to new and exciting heights.",

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 follows the common rule of sequels by making everything bigger, even though that isn't always enough to justify the series. In fact, it usually leads the franchise into a disaster, and thankfully this film is one of the rare which lives up to its promise. While it already provides the most breathtaking action and impressive visuals, it also able to expand the universe and give huge room for nice warmth beneath the bombast. Once again, the studio has put aside their recent style of broader gags and bullet speed pacing and settle down for a real storytelling that reminds us why animated movies are so appealing anyway. How to Train Your Dragon 2 has given all what you've wished for as a great sequel.The plot sure does heightened into an epic installment, it could have been an easy throw away of cool effects, battle sequences, and humor, but the movie is smart to keep on following its own roots by settling more on the characterization of their world and Hiccup's life with his dragon and the tribe. To keep it from being a wheel spinning visual showcase, the story embeds itself with full of inspired emotions, example is when it explores the icy dragon cave. It wasn't only an exposition, it is mainly a developing relationship between Hiccup and his long-lost mother. The quieter moments of letting the once disconnected family reunite again captures the same heart of the boy and dragon friendship of the first movie, which certainly made it pretty endearing.The film also spends its time exploring more places around and beyond the Isle of Berk. It's quite interesting to let the years pass by and make the young vikings grow mature, and how it depicts their maturity is pretty clever, like the hormonal attraction of Snotlout and Fishlegs to Ruffnut, in spite of fact their comic relief get a a bit way out of hand. The dragon species were also given enough intriguing details, essentially for the plot, which sort of recalls the book series of Cressida Cowell. This is a rich universe that makes the whole journey even bigger.The voice acting is predictably great. Jay Baruchel still brings the same earnestness to Hiccup even when the character's new appearance has outgrown his voice. Gerard Butler remains to be perfect as Stoick The Vast, he lends more gravity to the character in this one. Cate Blanchett joins in and she appropriately gives a great amount of warmth to the role. The other cast did well enough at keeping things much alive. For the filmmaking, the direction handles a better pacing compared to the other quicker cuts of the last few animated films. It's an easier way to watch by concentrating each scene of getting know of the characters, either with or without any dialogue. The flying scenes have always been a tremendous ride with scale and fortitude. John Powell's score helps making it feel much powerful, and it gets even better with a J\u00f3nsi\ufeff song in it.Apart from Disney, these are the only animated films of Hollywood today that have a wider ambition other than selling off kids with cool visuals and absurdist humor. There is an actual story to be found here, even without following its source material. The typical elements of Dreamworks are still there, but is hardly noticed. It's nearly like the first film, except of course it's larger. It does justice to today's family fare, somewhat forgetting the current mediocrity and rather fills it with inspiration from the past. One thing that is missing in most of the genre's attempt of transcending their films is the sincerity to its heart. Every affection in How To Train Your Dragon 2 never felt forced and right there it soars way up high. And if we have learned something about training dragons from the past, then it is the same thing about sequels: You don't just yell at it.",

            "content": "I picked up my future wife for a simple dinner and a movie date. We hadn't picked out a movie yet as we had decided to choose at the theater. Upon arriving, we saw that How To Train Your Dragon 2 was selling it's 8:00-10:00 Thursday night showings. I'd completely forgotten it was coming out Friday, so both of us, ecstatic, decided on that movie. I went in expecting a great film. I came out blown away. I can honestly say I've never seen a sequel better than it's predecessor, but How To Train Your Dragon 2 does nothing but improve and top the first one. The music was the best I've heard in a very long time. The story introduced so many things that was simply another piece of master storytelling. The relationships in the movie, especially Toothless' and Hiccup's, were written to their absolute strongest. After all the films I've seen, all the shows I've watched, all the books I've read, I have never come across a friendship stronger than Hiccup's and Toothless'. The way they write that relationship is just . . . it's never been done before. The story itself is actually pretty simple and actually a really short story, but it's a story you could tell the writer fell in love with. And he brought this story to the best it can absolutely be. The villain was chilling, the characters' outcomes were emotional, and the climax will completely shake your soul. I have no complaints. No complaints at all. There is nothing I would change about that film. Not a single thing. I just really hope they saved the best for last, because I don't know how they're going to top it.",

            "content": "HTTYD 2 is a sequel to the 2010 smash hit of the same name based on a novel and tells the story of Hiccup who is now 20 years old who is best friends with Toothless whom he met in the 1st movie as his father at first hated dragons but later loved them in the first one. This time however Hiccup and Toothless have to face Draco a dragon slayer who wants all the dragons for himself,and Hiccup and his co have to battle it out to defeat him. But Hiccup of course is shocked to discover that his mother is still alive and well and like Hiccup is also a dragon trainer just like him. But can Hiccup save mankind and protect Toothless from Draco? and will Hiccup's family reconcile?.Overall just like the first one this one was flaming brilliant. The effects were brilliant,the animation was flawless to look at,the voice acting is supherb and the action sequences are brilliant. There was one scene however that had me weeping during the climax scene,if you seen it you know what im talking about.So it comes to my conclusion that this is the best film of 2014,while Frozen was the best of 2013 even though like I said HTTYD 2 is better than Frozen. SO kudos to Dreamworks since its their 20th anniversary and the first time to see 20th Century Fox combining with HTTYD as The Croods was the first to be in partnership with 20th Century Fox.From beginning to end I was on the edge of my seat while watching this online as I was going to see it in the cinemas tomorrow but its on too late and I was unable to see it in the big screen. Who knows I might watch it again in the cinemas and looking forward to buying this on DVD when it comes out in October.10/10",

The sequel, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" at least features one of these things and is worth seeing despite being completely unoriginal and, in some ways, a step back for the franchise.The film features most of what you'd expect--a formulaic baddie, characters growing into themselves and the great flight scenes. What I did NOT expect was the unnecessary and confusing introduction of Hiccup's mother--something that NEVER made much sense and made her seem like a horrible person. The tribe didn't understand her and her love of dragons...so she left her husband and newborn baby!! Huh?! To make it even more confusing is that Hiccup, his dad and everyone else accepted her back with open arms. Call me odd, but I thought this entire plot line made no sense and was very poorly realized. Yet, despite all these defects, the film is entertaining and nice to look at...but nothing more.",

            "content": "Unfortunately the marketing for this film is subpar and misleading, as it was for the first one. My best advice to you is ***AVOID THE TRAILERS AT ALL COSTS. They include major spoilers to some very emotional points in the film. This is another level of animated film, one that gracefully crosses generational gaps and will speak volumes to any age group. Because of the critical and audience acclaim of the beloved predecessor, many are afraid that a sequel will not match the mastery of the first one, that this would be created purely as a money-making gimmick, like many Hollywood sequels. If these are your presumptions, you couldn't be more wrong. This film is worthy of all the hopes and expectations you are afraid to carry into the theater. DeBlois has told us a moving story, one that won't be soon forgotten, that so many of us will connect with. At Comic Con 2013, DeBlois said that this was \"The Empire Strikes Back\" of the trilogy. That is a hefty promise, which he has successfully delivered.The world of HTTYD2 has been vastly expanded and explored, very little of the film takes place on Berk. It is much more of an adventure film. The film has taken everything from HTTYD to the next level: emotion, intensity, action, adventure, humor, and depth. It takes risks I have seen so few animated films take, full of twists and turns, that will keep you engaged and invested.For me the film could have had a stronger beginning, a few less childish jokes, and a bit slower pacing (probably should have been about 10 minutes longer). Other than some very nit-picky notes, that is literally the worst that I can say about it.HTTYD2 is a phenomenal film and will deservedly pick up the academy award for best animated film of the year. John Powell, will again be nominated (and hopefully win) for his inventively emotional score.This was my most anticipated film of the past two years and it does not disappoint. The four years of work on it show, as it is a polished film. It is one of those rare films that inspires. And one of the few that you walk out of the theater feeling so much emotion and thinking \"Gosh, I can't wait to see that again.\"",

            "review_title": "My Review of How to Train Your Dragon 2",
            "content": "Way back in 2010, a little gem from DreamWorks Animation - a studio previously known for comedic blockbusters like Shrek, Madagascar, and Kung Fu Panda - both literally and figuratively spread its wings with critics and audiences alike, and it unexpectedly made me a fan just like that. The original How to Train Your Dragon still remains my personal favorite DreamWorks animated movie of all-time, and tied for my favorite cartoon movie not made by Disney. In fact, I really regret not seeing the original movie in the theater, but this sequel more than made up for that. Four years of hype and anticipation surrounding this movie made the wait, for me, more and more antagonizing, but I can say with a big, fat smile on my face, that it was well worth it.Five years after the events of the first movie, Hiccup (again played by Jay Baruchel) is now 20, yet he still retains the charm and spunk from the original movie. Hiccup not only has maintained his friendship with Toothless, the rare Night Fury, but has also strengthened it exponentially. Because of this new peace between Vikings and Dragons, the rest of the dragon riders from the first movie are now having competitions with their dragons, and these dragons have also become integrated into these guys' everyday lives.Hiccup is being groomed to become the next chief of his tribe by his burly and brawny father, Stoick (again played by Gerard Butler), while his relationship with Astrid (again portrayed by America Ferrera) has also grown - they're now officially boyfriend and girlfriend. Hiccup and Toothless mainly like to explore new lands and discover new dragons, but one of their discoveries leads to them coming upon this ice cave, and then our young Viking hero gets to meet his mom...who happens to be a mysterious Dragon Rider named Valka (played by Oscar winner Cate Blanchett)! Valka shows her son some hidden secrets and abilities that Hiccup, until now, didn't even know they had, and she reunites with Stoick and they decide to pick up right where they left off from when Valka was whisked away from Berk by Cloudjumper, her dragon, which she likes to ride like a surfboard! Turns out that she's even more experienced with dragons than even Hiccup! But soon, the normal ho-hum dragon-integrated lifestyle of Berk is soon threatened by Eret, self-proclaimed \"greatest dragon trapper alive\" (played by Kit Harington from Game of Thrones), and also Drago (played by Djimon Hounsou), who actually is the elite Dragon Trapper, and the film's primary villain.Drago has a plan - to control the humongous Bewilderbeast, and in turn, controlling the rest of the dragons so that he can destroy Berk. But all Hiccup wants to do is just talk some sense into him, but as we see in this movie, it's easier said than done. From that point, the battle lines are drawn, sacrifices are made, and relationships are pushed to the ultimate test in a movie that is sure to resonate with people young and old just as much, if not more, than the first one did way back when.In a word, it's amazing how far DreamWorks has come ever since making the original hit, and you can clearly see why here. The visuals are top-notch, the decision to make our heroes older is risky but it pays off big time, the music that got John Powell an Oscar nod still retains familiar cues from the original movie and also ups the ante, and on top of it all, the movie still has the spirit of the original movie, along with, I daresay, a Dark-Knight-esque kind of atmosphere that really made the first movie work, especially towards the end of this movie.These characters feel real - they have real emotions, and these actions that our main heroes take sometimes have real consequences, for better or worse, and you really feel like you're a part of their world. All of that is what made the original one work, and it remains here. Oh, and if you're wondering about the humor, it's still there to keep the kids giggling and engaged throughout, along with some funny lines provided by Gobber, again played by Craig Ferguson. Those moments are still there, even with the heavy emotional moments packed throughout the movie.Overall, I expected big things out of number two, and it certainly does not disappoint. This is a movie that absolutely met my expectations...and also set them even higher for No. 3 in the summer of 2016. Go ahead and see this movie with your whole family, because I know they'll all have a, pardon the pun, high-flying experience.",

Hiccup and Toothless find themselves caught up in another adventure to protect the freedom of dragons,with some other unexpected events occurring along the way.",

Half of this movie was for us to feel happy for Hiccup and Stoick having found his mother and wife..They tested our empathy and compassion just to be devastated when Stoick dies just minutes after dancing with his long-lost love!I mean come on you have to be heartless not to feel sick by that!

            "content": "The original How to Train Your Dragon was a great, no, wonderful film that was not only the best DreamWorks film since The Prince of Egypt but also one of the best animated films of the 2000s. While it does start off a tad slow and not as endearingly simple as the original, this sequel was excellent(to me it beats Kung Fu Panda 2 as the best DreamWorks sequel) and almost as good. As with the first film the animation is amazing, and actually even better than that of the first, the character designs are a touch more expressive and the colours are richer and have more atmosphere. And I don't think even the first film had a character introduction as mind-blowing as that of Valka's. The soundtrack really gives the sense of fantasy and adventure and does so rousingly and beautifully. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is strongly written, with smart quirky humour, suspenseful conflict and plenty of emotional parts without being overly-sentimental. The story scores highly too with more depth and darkness than the first- which really succeeded in how simple it was- yet the quirkiness and wonder as well as the touching sentiment that was in the original film are present here as well. Which was impressive for a film that had a lot going on. The characters and their back-stories are intriguing(remarkable for a film with the amount of characters it has), especially the emotional scenes between Hiccup and his mother and the endearing man and beast friendship between Hiccup and Toothless(which maybe could have been more prominent), with the exception of the comparatively one-dimensional villain Drago, who was still malevolently voiced and well-designed. Of the characters, personal favourite is Toothless, who never speaks but has as much impact as and even more so than other characters that do, who is even more expressive and adorable as in the original. The voice acting is excellent, especially from Jay Baruchel and Gerard Butler. In conclusion, a great sequel and almost as good. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The whiny mannerisms of the hero really began to bug me only a short way into the movie. And they kill off an important character who happened to be my favorite. Does anyone else find it odd that the other characters seem blissfully happy only a few minutes later?How this movie has garnered a rating over 8 is beyond me.

I consider it a great sequel, just as wonderful as the original, making it another Equal Sequel. I really enjoy sequels that expand on the first film's story rather than just rehash the original's plot, and this film does just that.Set 5 years after the events of the original, the Viking Hiccup and his friends are now young adults who have since made peace with the dragons and live in harmony with them in their village. Hiccup and his dragon Toothless now often go on adventures together, exploring new lands and territories. One day, the two of them discover a cave made of ice that is home to many new wild dragons and the mysterious Dragon Rider. Upon this discovery, the two end up in the centre of another conflict between humans and dragons, which they attempt to resolve.This sequel was a bit darker than the first one, but it still retains the charm and wonder that the original had going for it. I really liked how it showed another way that humans can be the real evil monsters and not the dragons themselves. Hiccup is a lot wiser and more determined than he was before, and that made the resolution much more satisfying to see.I rate it 8.5/10 and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loved the original.",

How depressing! For me, the movie never recovers from this huge downer. The animation is pretty and even better than the first movie. The returning characters are all likable, although Hiccup grates on my nerves at times. But I felt that way about him in the first one, as well. I didn't care for the mom at all. Less said about that the better. Also the whole preachy peace message is undermined by all the violence and the fact that peace is only achieved at the end by having superior firepower. Mixed messages much? If you liked How to Train Your Dragon you'll probably like this. But be ready for it to have some flaws that might bother some more than others.",

            "content": "In 2010, there was an Oscar-nominated, animated movie called \"How to Train Your Dragon\". 4 years later, they made made a sequel after several short films and a television series had come out as well. This sequel went into Oscar night being the favorite in its category, but lost out nonetheless. In the first film, Hiccup and the gang had to understand dragons and it was not really about a true antagonist, even if there was one, a pretty big evil dragon that exploited other dragons. The only thing that one has similar with this film here is the gigantic dragon and in here there is even 2 and they are even bigger. But there is also a real antagonist this time. A scar-faced tough guy who treats dragons badly and wants to kill the tribe of our heroes. Luckily for them, there is also a new character that is a much more pleasant addition to the franchise. This character brings some true emotions to this film and I loved her scene with Hiccup's dad.Talking about Hiccup's dad, he is certainly one of the main players again this time and the most significant scene of the film is all about him too. I will not go further into detail here. But I can say that I enjoyed the animation, the characters and the story in this one a lot. There is lots of drama, more than usual in animated films, but there is also lots of humour. The other young Berk inhabitants are pretty funny with their interactions. And so are their dragons frequently. The baby dragons playing around in the big one's face were really fun to watch. And there were many more hilarious scenes in this 100-minute movie. It runs slightly longer than the first, but only by a couple minutes. Both films include basically the same cast of voice actors with the exception of Djimon Hounsou, who voices the villain in this film here. No really big superstars, but some fairly decent names that have been prolific and experienced also in terms of live action movies and shows.This was the second time I watched this film already. First time was in a theater briefly after it was released. The dragon flying sequences are certainly something you want to experience on the bis screen, but even if you do not have the opportunity to do so, these are truly mesmerizing. I saw that they already planned a third, but they are keeping the 4-year-break apparently, so it will not be released until over 2 years from now, in 2018. Writer and director will be Dean DeBlois again, who also made films 1 and 2. Will the Academy appreciate his efforts then finally? We shall see. Until then, make sure you have watched films 1 and 2. I am not the greatest dragons fan and I do not have great interest to watch the series (although maybe I will at some point), but I definitely had a great time with these two films, especially the sequel, which I highly recommend. Do not miss out on it.",

The real-time passage of time is interesting, the story works, there is some real emotion, and the visuals are terrific (and, again, the film is worth catching in 3D).The voice work is very good, although Cate Blanchett affects an accent which hovers somewhere unidentifiable. I think she was going for Scots but, if so, she didn't quite make it.But I will cut this film any breaks it needs, because it did something which few films do: it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a rather great sequel to the original Dreamworks surprise hit. Just like the first film, we get another rousing product from the studios, which further expands on the world of the Vikings and dragons, as well as the expanding friendship between Hiccup and Toothless. The movie takes place five years after the original, so we get to see our heroes go through adolescent issues as they age in this original, creative world. The story is resonant and the characterization takes one step beyond from the original film. I also loved the beautiful animation, as it adds such a graceful step to the picture. This film has Hiccup and Toothless returning after the events five years prior. Hiccup is getting trained on leadership, and his friends are expert dragon racers. All seems peaceful, except there is this sinister force which plans on enslaving all the dragons and this force threatens the homeland of Hiccup, so once again they must save the day. The original cast returns and just like they did in the first film, they all do an amazing job. Gerard Butler, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, etc. There are a few key additions to the cast such as the ever-great Cate Blanchett as Hiccup's long-lost mother and Djimon Hounsou as one of the beings behind this sinister movement. Overall, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a wonderful sequel to such a beloved animated film. The film is very pretty to look at and it features a high-octane story with plenty of scary moments, so little children should be warned. There is also an emotional side to the film, which I was happy to see. I had a great time with this film and its film like these that makes me believe in the movies. If anything, this should have won at the Oscars. But I haven't seen Big Hero 6....yet, so time will tell. My Grade: A",

            "content": "I watched the first movie when it came out on Blu-ray and i remember how thrilled i was. It had all the right things in all the right places. A decent plot that unfolds gradually, keeps you involved and manages to surprise every once in a while. Awesome characters, diverse, with lots of intensity and drama between them, who search for their true selves, question the set order of things, develop and make uneasy choices, sometimes leading to uneasy sacrifices. Not to mention the beautiful animation and great voices. For me, the first movie was definitely the best animated film of that year and one of the greatest i've ever seen. One of the films that can entertain the kids, but also leave a lot to adults so they could thoroughly enjoy them too. Now you can really understand how high the bar was set and what anticipation i had towards the sequel. It had a great older brother to look up to.I don't know what went wrong along the production of the second film, but instead of actually trying to give some of its predecessor's feel (look was more or less delivered) it decided to take a kindergarten road. From the very first scene, where we are shown some silly and over the top fidgety dragon games, it felt like we would be seeing this sort of pointless commotion a lot. Right, because kids like it. But i was totally dumbfounded by this new-found ineptitude, so towards the end of the movie the only excitement left in me was about waiting for it to end.Unfortunately, those who decided that HTTYD2 must be aimed at kids only didn't stop at just filling it with lots of fuss. The characters, even those who showed wits and guts and determination and clear thinking in the first movie, became one-dimensional buffoons. Hiccup's lost-and-now-found mother, who first appears in some Slipknot'esque sort of costume, talks and acts as if twenty years spent away from the people messed up with her sanity somewhat. Stoick is a stubborn moron again, but this time even more like a dimwit with a single tune playing on loop in his head, \"You must be a new chief, a chief does this, a chief does that, you must protect your own, nothing else matters, no, i don't wanna listen to you\" kind of thing. Towards the end he's written off, but in such lazy way that you are bound to ask yourself if the screenwriters did that intentionally because he got too annoying and out of his depth. And Hiccup himself... In the first movie, he's a witty but confused underdog who tries to prove himself worthy but has more questions than answers inside, which actually result in a great versatility and lots of emotional moments. This time, we get a self-assured and defiant but terminally naive hippie who's trying to preach \"people want peace, so please stop doing bad things\" to the villain. Who, by the way, looks and acts so dumb, growling and swinging his tamer's prod, that you can't help thinking \"How did this stupid brute even manage to take control over the Alpha\". The rest of the cast, including those who mattered in the first movie are hardly more than a mere decoration, a placeholder for a handful of overused gags to fill the pause every now and then.Oh, and the dragons. Lots, lots of them, one more bizarre than the other. But now they are around all the time, constantly brawling, bantering and fooling around, like there's nothing else to do. Even Toothless. While in the first movie we were given much more time of Hiccup and Toothless by themselves so we could see their relationships develop and their personalities unfold, this time around the only thing they seem to be doing is playing games on the ground or having fun gliding in the sky. A great threat-turned-savior diminished to a mere dog with wings and a blaster. So when it's attempted to turn the things around later, it feels nothing but a deus ex machina trick. Even the newest addition to the family, the Alphas, don't bring much refreshment and originality. Once you see them moving and fighting, you just can't help thinking they are all but a ripoff of another type of beasts, starting with \"God\" and ending with \"zilla\".Given all the above, and the plot that only the target audience would find satisfying, no wonder that the result is nothing but a plain and emotionless mess. Really, there's absolutely nothing to feel for, because all the problems the characters experience they create themselves, and when they finally fix them you just think \"why couldn't you do that in the first place?!\". And to finish it off, a pumped up, with extra slices of epic, soundtrack that rocks a mighty tune every time somebody so much as farts or, more likely, barfs. Towards the ending credits i really OD'd on that stuff so i had to turn the sound down and kept watching only in case they decided to put some potential sequel teaser after. Thank god they didn't.Some people might claim that the movie's better if you don't compare it to the first one. No it's not. The good remains good, the bad remains bad, no matter from what angles you try to perceive it. The first movie just makes the second one's flaws more obvious, because it gives you a hint at how awesome could be a movie with a given premise. So while the first movie was called \"How to Train Your Dragon\", probably, to tell us a thing or two on the matter, the second movie should just have chosen a title more suited for its own message, like \"How to screw up a sequel to a great film\". With that task the creators coped brilliantly, i just hope they won't try to prove their competence in that area again.",

But there was quite a lot to be inspired by like the finding of a character thought to be dead or someone who may end up as such. I saw this on IMAX 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and his nephew and we all enjoyed this immensely.

After the light sheep baby -scene, I knew that this guy was simply 2maymayd5me, but I still watched the whole thing.It was not the jokes. It was the clich\u00e9s and the tropes.

I have never seen a nightfury, 20 seconds later tells that every dragon has secret ability and upgrades nighfury to nightfury lvl 2. Funny? No. What about the alpha dragon being controlled by fear caused by bald evil ergo villain? How was that possible. It's kids' movie so it won't matter, clearly. Did I mention that the evil villain ergo was evil? He was one step away from kicking puppies. Suddenly alpha is alpha and controls all the dragons because *spooky voice* brainwash *spooky voice* brainwash. Except the lil ones because they just won't listen to anyone. Anyone. Oh, but I have an idea, let's use the lil ones they will surely listen to us. Anyone. Us. Anyone. Kids movie. Okay! Brainwash. Did I mention Hiccup's dad died? I did! So his mother will take care of him now. They have known for 15 minutes, this will surely fix everything. And oh lookie it did. Did I mention that Hiccup got over his father's death in 5 minutes? Well now you know!Oh, and the alpha dragons fought with horns because the other method would have required animation of some sort. Neat! And then the soldier morality...

For me it is as good as the first one (and if you prefer epic action, this one is definitely better), but my favorite is still the first one because it completely took me by surprise.Animation? Superior !! but the proper credit to say is cinematography. 3D effects is easy to achieve today because of advancements in technology. But it takes great cinematography to capture your imagination. If you are tired of \"lazy\" 3D, then watch this one.Story? The Best! I won't tell anything about the plot. But I will say that the story connected to me so well. It is about \"Coming out of Age\"***************WE ENCOUNTER A TIME IN OUR LIFE WHEN WE ASK, \"WHAT DO I WANT TO DO?\" \"WHERE DO I WANT TO BE?\" .. we usually ask those questions during graduations.**************This movie will definitely help you find the \"inner you\". I wish this movie is shown during the time I graduated.

            "content": "Five years have passed since the events of the first film and the people in the Viking village of Berk now live in peace with dragons. Hiccup has been told by his father that it is time for him to take over as village chief; however he doesn't feel ready. He wants to continue mapping undiscovered parts of the world with the help of his dragon Toothless. On one such flight they find a burnt village; it is a village of dragon catchers who are working for Drago Bludvist who wants them for his dragon army. His father tells him that Drago is a violent warlord who poses an imminent threat; Hiccup believes that he can talk to Drago and persuade him to live in peace. While trying to find Drago he encounters the mysterious 'Dragon Rider' who turns out to be someone surprisingly close to him that everybody thought had died years before. She lives with dragons in their vast, remote nest. Astrid and Hiccup's other friends try to help him find Drago but are captured and soon Drago is attacking the dragon nest with tragic consequences. He then sets off to attack Berk; Hiccup and his friends will have their toughest struggle yet if they are to keep the world safe for both humans and dragons.I enjoyed the original 'How to Train Your Dragon' far more than I expected so was very pleased that this sequel managed to live up to the original. While watching the original probably isn't absolutely essential I think one should try to watch it before this as it introduces the key characters and their situation; this would probably lose a lot of its depth without that prior knowledge. I was not surprised to read that director Dean DeBlois was inspired by 'The Empire Strikes Back' as this film is considerably darker than the original, especially in the middle section where a major character is killed. There are some clich\u00e9s but that didn't bother me to much as the story was good. As before the animation is top notch; the many flight sequences are particularly spectacular. As well as action and tragedy there is of course a decent amount of comedy which is funny without being too goofy. Overall I heartily recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original and look forward to seeing the third film in the trilogy when in eventually gets made.",

            "content": "The Hollywood sequel is a fearsome thing. Most notably in recent years, we have seen an endless supply of re-hashes and cash-in's based on it's predecessor's success, commonly to disastrous effect. Animation especially - or even more so, Dreamworks animation - have churned out drivel with no heart; their only intentions being to offer something to parents that will keep their children busy for 90 minutes and to fill their own wallets. Take a bow, then, How To Train Your Dragon 2, which not only capitalises on the first film's charm, off-beat humour and dazzling dragon battles, but deepens it's mythology and expands it's world, while at the same time offering a visual spectacle to delight the kids and pose some extremely grown- up questions to the adults in the audience.Five years after the townsfolk of Berk were given a lesson in allegiance and acceptance by unlikely hero Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), the Viking village thrives with domesticated dragons. It's chieftain, Stoick (Gerard Butler), has named Hiccup his heir, but the one- legged adventurer is not ready for the responsibility and would much rather be exploring the surrounding areas on the back of his dragon, the Night Fury Toothless. His relationship with the feisty Astrid (America Ferrera) has developed into a romance, and his friends fight over the attention of Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig). While exploring one day, he comes across an island decorating in strange ice formations, and is attacked by dragon-catcher Eret (Game of Thrones' Kit Harington).Eret tells them about the warlord Drago (Djimon Honsou), who is amassing a dragon army after learning how to bend the creatures to his will using violence and intimidation. Hiccup and Astrid escape and ride back to Berk to warn the others, and learn that Stoick knows Drago and that he is a madman not be reasoned with. Hiccup, however, feels different and rides off on Toothless to treat with Drago but instead comes upon another hidden island, where dragons live in harmony under the influence of a colossal Alpha dragon known as a bewilderbeast. Also living on the island is environmentalist Valka (Cate Blanchett), Hiccup's long-lost mother.Cleverly written without heavy lessons on morality and impeccably voiced by a star cast, How To Train Your Dragon 2 stresses the importance of finding your own place in the world. The film could easily have been some kind of eco-crusade, but instead questions whether the human race reserves the right to bend it nature to our will, or if we are a mere significance who have a duty to preserve it, or even if nature is a tool which we can use to serve the greater good. This is startlingly darker than it's predecessor - humans and dragons die - and even questions whether war can be just. Drago is a psychopathic tyrant - can these men be bargained with, or should they simply be wiped out? Thrilling, emotional and extremely thoughtful, this beautiful-looking sequel is the possibly the biggest surprise of the year.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Animated sequels tend to struggle capturing the same broad appeal as the original, but in the case of How to Train Your Dragon 2, that's completely off. The first How to Train Your Dragon is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the sequel was my 4th most anticipated 2014 movie, so it had a lot to live up to. My initial thought was did it live up to the hype? Yes, and quite frankly it was a great time at the movies. Is it as good as the original? I would have to watch it again, but I think they are two very different movies but if I had to choose I would say the original is a tad better. With that said this movie does certain things better.The animation always looks beautiful, as all the flight scenes are absolutely amazing to watch unfold. The beginning journey with Toothless and Hiccup is stunning and instantly brought me back to the 'Test Drive' scene in the first film. The relationship between them is cute and of course is similar to a man and his dog. The introduction of Cate Blanchett as the mom was a nice touch, and answered some questions left open from the first. But it still kills me to think of Berk without Stoick at the helm. I have always loved Stoick and Hiccup's relationship because it brings a new flavor to the clich\u00e9d Hollywood parent-kid relationship.The film also brings many laughs, most come from the supporting riders to Hiccup, led by Jonah Hill and Kristen Wiig lending their voices. Even with all the entertainment, I do think the middle part of the film drags a bit. The first film flies by the 100 minute runtime without loss of steam. You can feel the runtime this go around but the ending 25 minutes delivers both on the emotional and action packed side. I also think the villain, Drago, was underwhelming but did have his moments. Kit Harrington as Eret was near useless, but once again, had his moments.I cant go this whole review without mentioning the true heroes of both movies, and that is John Powell and Jonsi. They both do a great job at capturing the locations, and the relationships between the Vikings and Dragons. This film while not as good overall on the score side does bring back all of the same themes. I will be as excited for the third and possibly last installment as much as this one. This film also does a lot to set up the third and any future installments. These are the animated movies that make Pixar step their game up. Not many films can do that. The score is hair raising, and the song by Jonsi is incredibly beautiful to cap the film off. It will take a few more viewings to truly decide my score, but I will go with my gut feeling as I did for the first film.+Hiccup and Toothless together :) +Beautifully spotless animation +Once again another beautiful score/soundtrack +Emotional moments are almost at Toy Story 3 level +Sets the 3rd installment up -Sometimes weak villains -Drags a tad 9.6/10",

            "content": "I was excited to see this movie. Considering it was a sequel with higher ratings than the original, I went in with high hopes. Sequels are rarely better than their predecessor, and unfortunately this one was no exception. How to Train Your Dragon 2 wasn't great. It was unoriginal and followed the average formula that most movies do nowadays. The first movie was so much more original, and the second one lacked that originality. It was predictable and, although a wee bit darker (which is what I typically like), not any better. The plot was pretty predictable: the bad guy threatens the main characters' way of life and the world and now the vikings have to stop him. Unlike the original, which was more of a story about the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless, this one tries to be bigger than it actually is and fails. It's too big for it's own good, and it ends up being no good. The characters weren't anything special either. They didn't change other than the dragons being part of their daily lives from the first movie, so it lost points there. The mother's introduction into the movie felt extremely forced and didn't make a whole lot of sense. And once again, it's predictable and unoriginal to throw in a long-lost relative for no apparent reason.Overall How to Train Your Dragon 2 just isn't any good. It lacks the charm and originality of the first one, its very predictable, and filled with weak and forced characters. If your interested, then I'd say don't bother, but go ahead if you really want to. If you enjoyed it, then your not alone. I know plenty of people who liked this movie. Personally I would not recommend it.",

            "content": "Without spoiling too much, the movie was pretty good. Still, there are some questions that need to be asked. Honestly, why is this movie still call, 'how to train your dragon 2'? There wasn't much footage of human training dragons, here. Even, the tagline says that 'the training is over'. The movie should had been call, 'How to Control your Dragon?\". Since, that's most of the plot of this. Still, how to train your dragon 2 is amazing. I'm a huge fan of the first one that came out in 2010, and this sequel did not disappoint. Visually, it was beautiful as the CGI animation was outstanding. The flight scenes take your breath away as usual, and battle action was captivating. Lots of scenery porn. It's a must-see and it has to be 3D. Like the last movie, it's loosely based on the book series of the same name by Cressida Cowell. The film is written and directed by Dean DeBlois. Since Dean Deblois wasn't involved with the DreamWorks Dragons: Riders of Berk 2012 TV series and says that he didn't take it into consideration when writing this movie, but that doesn't necessarily make this film non-canon. The third season of the show will apparently bridge the gap between the two. Indeed, the film does a good job recapping the events of the last film. Does the audience really need a sum up in the first ten minutes, of what happen in the last film? I could do without the same recycle narrative as the last movie. I think, most people whom going to watch this, at less, saw the first film. It felt forced as hell. Anyways, the events of this film take place, five years after the Viking had made peace with the dragons. Searching for new lands, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) discovered that an insane conqueror, Drago Bludvist (Voiced by Djimon Hounsou) is looking forward to getting hold of the Kingdom of Berk's large supply of dragons to help him control the world. I do have to believe, that Drago Bludvist is creepy and menacing, but he's indeed a one-dimensional evil character that was a bit over the top. There are hints of a deeper backstory, but these aren't explored beyond a token mention. Then again, that may be entirely the point: Hiccup learns that not all enemies can be reasoned with. Honestly, like how on earth, did he train Alpha dragon to do his duties?? I love the main cast. Jay Baruchel as Hiccup is just as great as the original film. I can't see anybody else, playing the role. Hiccup's sub-plot is pretty interested, but pretty predictable, when the first time, you heard what Hiccup's father, Stoick the Vast (Gerald Butler) got in store for him. You knew, that somebody is going to make it to the end of the film. As much as I love Cate Blanchett in epic movie; her presence as Valka in the film is a bit out of place and come out of nowhere. Valka's reasons for leaving Hiccup are a bit dumb. I love how Toothless, the dragon remind me of a really big house cat. It's so cute. By far, the dragons are the most interesting things in the film. I love the new dragons, they introduce in the film. I did find the supporting cast to be a bit annoying. I really can't stand, all of them. I can do without the sub-plot of Snotlout (Voiced by Jonah Hill) & Fishlegs (Voiced by Christopher Mintz-Piasse) fighting over Ruffnut (Voiced by Kristen Wiig). While, I do love Gobber (Voiced by Craig Ferguson), he sounds too much like Shrek to me. None of the new characters like Eret (Kit Harington) catch my interested. I wasn't kinda hoping, not to see his goofy self, again more in the film. The new character designs looked great. The credits roll over the film's concept art, which is just as gorgeous as the film itself. The movie score is beautiful by Jon Thor Birgisson & John Powell. Somehow the Norwegian release of this film, had an different song \"Into a Fantasy\" by Alexander Rybak, but both versions are epic to hear. The pacing was alright for the most part, but there were some slow areas in the beginning, that could had speed up. For a movie about how much Drago is a threat. You don't see him, until middle of the 102 minutes, film. In my opinion, as much as I like this movie. I think the original movie was better. It had way better character development, better story, and just fun to watch. There were a lot of dark moments in this PG film, but not as gritty as the last film. There are some frighten moments that might be too scary for little children. It's watchable for an adult due to its depth about the mental outlook of a person when face with a disability. You see, how Hiccup doesn't allow his disability to stop him from living a mostly positive life, and you see how Drago took shame of disability to a dark path. Also, the film had the first openly homosexual character in a Dreamworks animation film that might find some LGBT fans rooting for him. I do think the film has a positive message about overcoming obstacles, friendship, and the quest of resolving conflict through peaceful terms. I have to say, don't watch the trailers. As the first full-length trailer gives away Valka's role and who is the Big Bad guy. Just watch it as soon as possible. Overall: It was a good movie, and I loved every minute of it.",

            "content": "When I said the first film caught me off guard with its surprising amount of intensity. Well, its sequel may have just bested it. From epic large scale battles on land, sea and air to investing character development between a broken family. This a near-perfect family adventure that is hands-down the best film from DreamWorks since 'Shrek 2'. Hiccup's village has now embraced dragons, and his thirst for exploration grows. Whilst venturing across the vast seas, he comes across an antagonising maniac who wants to conquer the world by controlling dragons. What this sequel does, which many fail to do, is mature the franchise. Hiccup and his viking friends are now young adults, and so their thought process and understanding of the world has matured with its audience. And I cannot understate how important that is. They could've easily replicated the original and played it safe, but evolving the characters through age allows more emotion to come through. The enamoured relationship between Hiccup and Toothless juxtaposes the fragmented bonds between Hiccup and his parents, and it works! It so works! And I found myself quickly becoming connected with every character and the tangible connections between them. Upon the arrival of the third act, DeBlois just puts everything on the table. Soaring dragon battles that lead to a sense of loss where Hiccup may actually not prevail. With so much at stake, you are automatically absorbed. The absolute gorgeous animation just complements the fantastical world that is presented. Lighting was improved, character models were smoother and the animation itself was divine. Improvements all round! Plenty of comic relief (particularly from Ruffnut) to ease the grandeur of its story and, well, packed with so much heart and sincerity that it often overwhelms. If it wasn't for Drago being underdeveloped as a villain, this may have got the perfect rating. Alas, it is an outstanding piece of animation from a series of high-flying films that came out of nowhere.",

All these do not make sense The movie had no plot It was terrible Plus the person who makes Hiccups' voice has a deeply annoying voice. It is not a cartoon movie for kids. It is very dark.

This movie never gains momentum at all.Long story short, While out venturing with his girlfriend, they end up in uncharted territory with a bunch of bad guys who are led by a villain named Drago. Drago wants to use dragons to his advantage to start war with the others.So basically the theme of change is rehashed in this sequel. Hiccup believes that he can speak with the leader of this group and change his evil ways. His father warns him that Drago can not be reasoned with. Hiccup defies this and goes out to try and stop war from ensuing.Along the way he encounters someone. We come to find out that this is his mother. She has been in hiding for 20 years. We find out later why this is, but the story just seems too silly a reason for her to leave her family. Even the reunion with the husband seems awkward. I would have wanted to know why she left not just run up and kiss her.One of the characters dies, I won't say who and I was already warned before I saw it. No it's not Toothless.Why did DreamWorks feel it was necessary to try and use the change theme again? Certainly some people can change, and others can't be persuaded.

Another amazing achievement in animation by DreamWorks studios, kudos. The movie takes place five years after the events of the first film. Everyone is now grown up, everything's more mature, including the film. The first half or about first 40 mins or so was good, some action here, some humor there etc, but nothing outstanding or great (except for Hiccup and Toothless scenes, which are always great), felt lacking, especially when compared to the first part. I guess, main reason for that was that the novelty of first time experience, the build up of relationship of hiccup and toothless etc in the first part was just too good to overcome for the sequel. BUT no worries, it is the second half which just blows everything away. The movie takes a MUCH darker turn there, delivers lots of FEELS, heart pumping epic action and some truly awe-inspiring moments. Goosebumps galore in the final moments, suffice to say I was extremely pleased when the film was over, had this awesome feeling that you feel when you have watched an amazing film. The animation quality, which was already amazing in the first part, has been further improved. Easily one of the best I have seen. Can't wait to own the Bluray and enjoy the awesome eye candy. The soundtrack, which was one of the main things about the first part that made me fell in love with it, was again great here, although lack of my favourite pieces of the score from first part .i.e \"Romantic flight\" and \"Forbidden Friendship\" was a bit disappointing. Overall, it is possibly the best animated film sequel I have ever seen, and is the favourite film of this year for me alongside X-men: Days of future past. 9/10",

No, it's not as good as the original, but it is an incredibly worthy sequel, and that right there is enough for me to sing praises for it.\nI think the thing that I like most about this movie is that it is incredibly different than the original, while it still manages to maintains much of the magic that made the first movie so great. As the first movie ended with dragons being accepted into Berk, this movie starts when dragons have more or less been worked into every day life. The village of Berk feels new, while many of the things there are still the same. Similarly, Hiccup has changed; he's older, more mature. He's no longer dealing with feelings of isolation, now he's wrestling with a question of responsibility; he doesn't feel he's ready to become chief, despite what his father says. I really like this growth of the location as well as our protagonists. It feels as if the world has actually evolved, as if the events of the first film had forever changed Berk and the world around it, and that kind of gravity given to consequence makes all of the events in this film feel more important.",

The original film was written and directed by 3 people (the guys who made Lilo and Stitch, another great film), but only one of them stayed behind to direct the sequel.

Miller) & Ruffnut(Kristen Wiig). Berk is now a place where humans & dragons are friends. When Hiccup stumbles upon a secret involving dragons, it is up to Hiccup & Toothless to protect the dragons at any cost. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is brilliant! The visuals are stunning & the 3D adds more magnificence to the proceedings on screen. The dragons look stunning & realistic. Toothless is as adorable as ever! I like the fact that the film takes place 5 years after How to Train Your Dragon(2010). The whole posse of kids from the original have grown into extremely handsome/beautiful people. Well, except Snotlout(Jonah Hill), Fishlegs(Christopher Mintz-Plasse), Tuffnut(T.J. Miller) & Ruffnut(Kristen Wiig)! They look the same. But, Hiccup and Astrid, wow! Hiccup especially, is extremely handsome. He has the looks that equal Flynn Rider from Tangled(2010). He's the kind of guy, the ladies would go gaga over! The voice acting is top notch. Jay Baruchel is outstanding as Hiccup. Baruchel's voice hasn't changed but, his character has matured. This aspect of Hiccup, has been portrayed spectacularly by Baruchel. Cate Blanchett is mind blowing as Valka. The Oscar winning actress has proved her acting chops at voice acting too. Gerard Butler is great as Stoick. Craig Ferguson is awesome as Gobber. America Ferrera is good as Astrid. Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, T.J. Miller & Kristen Wiig are amazing as Snotlout, Fishlegs, Tuffnut & Ruffnut respectively. Djimon Hounsou is spectacular as Drago. Kit Harington is impressive as Eret. If I had to choose, I'd choose the first one. It was funnier. However, the sequel is far more emotionally satisfying. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a must watch. Go for it.",

This movie was breathtaking, heart-wrenching, astounding, beautiful, and funny! Without doubt the best movie I have ever seen. I convinced my mother to come see it with me, she was skeptical but humored me and she was just as blown away as I was. We had to go back to the theater to see it again. One of my favorite things about the first one was the music and I was thrilled that John Powell managed to top the original score. Like the movie itself, the music is more mature and absolutely sweeps you away. I listen to the soundtrack every day and I still marvel at its power and the emotion it evokes. Don't be put off because it's(beautifully)animated, you won't find a better movie! Now we just have to endure the long wait till the final movie. How can they top this? I don't know, but I have faith that they will!",

Once I saw the trailer a few months ago I lowered them due to some of the characters no longer resembling themselves (with aging considered). I should have lowered my expectations even more. This was just a mediocre clich\u00e9 kids film. nothing else. Everything that made the first amazing, enjoyable, original,lovable and different was gone. Everything seemed forced; the plot was all over the place. Hiccup's mother shows up after 20 years and after 5 minutes he's OK with it. There was a really awkward song that his father sang to his mother that was just painful to watch. I feel like there should have been some kind of recap also since everything was included from the cartoon series on cartoon network and i'm sure not many people going to see this movie have seen both seasons. There was a stereotypical villain, when the movie never needed a villain in the first place. It tried to hard to be too many things and to please too many people. Also, the score was very underwhelming. The volume of it was so low; unlike the first film where it was tied into different scenes, it was just thrown into the background carelessly at a low volume. There was some weird singing in it too.Just watch the first one again.",

            "content": "Finally being able to watch this movie, I was stoked! I loved the first film, and it was about time to watch another light-hearted but intelligent movie about dragons and vikings in a universe I quickly learned to love. What a bummer.The subtle humor and cuteness of the first movie has been utterly demolished by slapstick that would put early Monty Python to shame and repeated gags that weren't funny to begin with. Oddly timed jokes seemingly thrown out at random took the edge off of a lot of situations that actually needed to be played out to the fullest.Now, one thing I loved about the first movie was the balance between mature themes, expertly crafted into a believable story that both kids and adults could enjoy. The absence of a classical villain - instead leaving misunderstanding and fear as the culprits - gave it an edge and a message I don't recall seeing in any other animated movie. Sadly, it's sequel seems to completely ignore the success of this formula, and tackles huge and serious situations such as abandonment of one's family, the death of a loved one by the hand of a loved one, and treason in a manner that leaves me in wanting of other plot devices it can actually sustain as a movie primarily targeted towards children. The villain seems utterly forced, and lacks any credibility whatsoever. I never once truly believed that a raving monkey-man like that managed to subdue and bend the will of powers that were far superior to him. His motives are ridiculous, his back-story (which he apparently tells anybody that crosses his path in an instant) is as thin as a single sheet of toilet paper, and his personal integrity and conviction just makes him seem like something they just threw in there on a whim.I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but I just couldn't! I couldn't force myself to believe the family reunion and how lightly everybody took it. I couldn't believe the villain. Frankly, I could hardly believe anything! That's not to say the movie is entirely void of anything enjoyable. I like the way they keep fleshing out our main protagonist and his entourage - particularly his relationship to shield maiden Astrid. I just wish the rest of the movie would be approached with the same thought through storytelling.As much as I'd love to love it, I must sadly go back and re-watch both the first one and this once again. It might have been my mood when I watched it, or it might be another case of \"The Dark Knight Rises-\" a movie I found so utterly horrendous and pointless it still makes me angry to think of the great reviews it received. At least How to Train Your Dragon 2 was better than that one...",

To my surprise, it had nothing to do with it and it proved me wrong once again, shouting loud and clear that you can create a very good movie in any circumstance if you really want to, and of course, have the power to do it. Visually speaking, it is simply astounding, enchanting your eyes with every scenery. Combined with the same funny, well-shaped and much better animated characters, it manages to create a superb atmosphere which can be hardly described using mere words.The creators achieved something wonderful with this film, creating an emotional and satisfying story which features interesting and entertaining events after the first one's finale. Although it isn't as mind blowing as the original, it is still a brilliant piece of animation. Hats down to them!",

In the beginning, Hiccup and Toothless are experimenting their new attachments to their bodies by flying. Hiccup was testing out his new leg and his new suit that allows him to fly. Toothless was testing out his new tail. While they are flying they discover new land and add it to their map. On one of their journeys, they discover a secret cave. In this cave they find tons of wild dragons, along with a anonymous long-lost rider. After they sort things out, Hiccup finds himself in the middle of a battle to protect Berk against a warrior and his dragon army. How To Train Your Dragon Two is a great sequel to How To Train Your Dragon. This sequel ties up the questions that weren't fully answered in the first movie. This sequel tests Hiccup and Toothless' relationship, as rider and dragon, as well as friends. This sequel also ties up the hole in Hiccup's family, a surprise you'll have to see in the theaters. Finally, this sequel ties up Hiccup and Astrid's love story. Overall, this movie is a great sequel. If you liked the first movie, then you should definitely go and check out this sequel. On a scale from 1 to 10, this movie should get a 9. Thank you for reading this review on How To Train Your Dragon Two.",

            "content": "DreamWorks Animation was at one point the only major competitor that Disney had. Occasionally there was a Warner Brothers or a Fox movie that could attract attention but from the late 1990's through the early 2010's, Disney and DreamWorks were neck to neck in crafting stories that everyone could enjoy. Not every film was a ballpark, but the Shrek and Kung Fu Panda series were seen as the flagship characters from DreamWorks that everyone could recognize. Shrek's face would appear on clothing and popsicles while anything Kung Fu Panda related had been made to every kind of toy. While I like both movies, neither are my favorite. My favorite DreamWorks animated movie has to be How to Train Your Dragon.Having not written a review on it before, I'll do a quick summary. For every reason, I should hate How to Train Your Dragon as it contains many of the clich\u00e9s that I cannot stand such as the dopey kid who becomes the hero, the hiding the pet, the parent that won't listen to reason and the liar-revealed plot. Yet despite all of that, all of those seemed very new because the movie allowed itself to pace enough to get an idea of every emotion the character went through. Great animation, a fantastic story, and even a great dragon battle made How to Train Your Dragon a masterpiece. So I had a lot of hype for How to Train Your Dragon 2.Set five years after the first movie, the Viking village of Berk has settled into the idea of having dragons as full pets. Our hero Hiccup (played by Jay Baruchel) has matured into a twenty year old, taking plenty of time with his dragon Toothless to explore new worlds. His father Stoick the Vast (played by Gerald Butler) feels that his son is now ready to replace him as chief of the village. Hiccup flies off to think about the offer, with his girlfriend Astrid (Played by America Ferrera) for emotional support.Hiccup and Astrid encounter a dragon poacher named Eret who reveals that he's gathering as many dragons as possible for his chief, an insane conqueror named Drago Bludvist (played by Djimon Hounsou). Hiccup and Astrid get away in time to tell Stoick, who thinks that Drago wants a full war. Hiccup would solve the situation with peace and flies off to try. On his way to Drago's lair, another dragon rider captures him, only to reveal herself as Hiccup's long lost mother, Valka (played by Cate Blanchett). Hiccup hears the explanation for her disappearance and more information about Drago that could make Hiccup's war much darker then expected. Along with who I mentioned, Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wigg, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse all return as Berk Vikings.Talk about a sequel that doesn't rehash the first movie! How to Train Your Dragon 2 matures the story and characters in a way that brings in more comedy, more action, and even some gripping drama. The movie knows what it wants to give to it's audience, and shows us plenty of time with Hiccup, his mother and his father becoming a family.I love seeing how much Hiccup has really aged and how he has to come to grips with finding a way to become the leader his father wants him to be, while continuing to fill his position as a peacekeeper. His road is much darker here where simple reason is not enough to stop an enemy. We get to see a Viking war with many dragons that is so intense and so well shot that this battle is up there with Game of Thrones and Lords of the Rings.Like the first movie, How to Train Your Dragon 2's animation is stunning, really expanding the Viking world we thought we knew and even throwing some creative dragons not seen before. I hope we continue this franchise as this series could become one of the all time great fantasy stories. Let's just hope the DreamWorks can achieve a hit with this one.I'll give this five Toothless dragons out of five. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the rare sequel that improves upon the first, soaring high like the dragon it wants to be. It's hard to write about this movie without spoiling anything.",

            "content": "9/10 One of the best animated movies I have ever seen. How to Train Your Dragon (the first one) ranks up as one of my top 50 favourite MOVIES of all time. I don't know yet but this film might be just as good. It will require multiple viewings to decide, but for now I can safely say I left the theater utterly satisfied, with a wide smile on my face. I think that what makes ultimately succeed this movie (and its predecessor), on the top off all the good things I will say afterwards, is the fact that animation here is brought to its most extreme levels and used in such a way that it manages to achieve sequences and shots that we all dream of seeing realized, but cannot hope to see in a live action movie. I'm not talking about technology because nowadays the technology to achieve these type of complicated and breathtaking scenes is there for live action, but it would simply not fit in it (eg: see why \"Maleficient\" failed for me). This is why animation here, self-conscious of its limits and potential, brings the perfect amount of visual flare I love to see. The flying sequences are truly something special, other than being very involving they are truly beautifully animated and really manage to bring the whole idea of the cinema experience, the ordeal of \"being taken to another place\" to the next level, from the moment you sit in the theater to the last frame you are truly carried away in another place and even during the whole duration of the film I didn't realize how much I was stuck to the screen and I wasn't paying attention to absolutely anything else. When a movie manages to make you forget you are sitting in a chair something really special is going on. And I have to give a shout out to a long battle shot (who has seen the movie knows what I'm talking about), from the moment it kicks in and starts spinning around I was gasping for breath, shivers were sent down my spine and I was honestly begging it not to cut.Take that plus a fascinating mythology upon which the movie builds on, some really funny moments, characters that feel real, for whom you truly want to and actually care for, who also happen to be very relatable, a far from clich\u00e9d or traditional narrative that has the balls to stick to itself proudly, a nearly flawless pacing and most importantly a score, an epic score that I actually think has a shot at winning the Oscar, that's just how amazingly good it is. The movies does have some very minor inconsistencies or conveniences and the villain isn't as strong as the movie thinks it is, yet still a better one than more than half of the ones you see in a year. But I really couldn't bring myself to care too much about these problems in the mist of such a wonderful journey full of heart and emotion to the point that I was genuinely moved to a couple of tears in multiple moments. I do wish they had expanded some more on the romantic relationship of Hiccup because there is lots of chemistry there, yet I can't really blame the DeBlois for not concentrating on this because the other story lines he went for were just as interesting, shout out to the dragons here because other than looking amazing they are just as fascinating as the human characters. This movie was one of the best theater experiences of the year, I'm really looking forward to rewatching this one.",

And it made me cry more than any other film this year. Even more than The Fault In Our Stars. And can I just mention the character development? Hiccup's journey from the young, rather careless boy in the first movie to a young man-a young leader- in the second one is INCREDIBLE to watch. And the father has a lot of development, also. And so does Astrid, but it's mostly Hiccup. And even Toothless gets his moment to shine, in one of the coolest scenes in the movie. I don't want to give anything away, so I won't say much more about it.Just, be prepared to bring tissues. And be prepared to be amazed. Really amazed. This is an instant family classic.",

That is a very charming movie, where the young dragon hunter Hiccup wants to impress his massive dad, traps a seldom seen nighttime dragon. He damages the dragon's tail in the process, but manages to fabricate a piece of a tail, and befriends and trains the feared dragon.In this recent movie Jay Baruchel is back as the voice of Hiccup, and since the first movie the two have bonded and are seen constantly flying as a team. But the story comes from a rival dragon trapping clan threatening the existence of Hiccup, his dragon, and the rest of his clan. So the movie contains many conflicts, battles where dragons are trapped and people are threatened. While I applaud their efforts to come up with something different, this movie has none of the charm of the first installment. There is a touching human-like story, but overall nowhere near what we saw in the first one.SPOILERS: A new character is voiced by Cate Blanchett as Valka , the long missing mother of Hiccup, feared to be dead. She is discovered as everyone is out to defeat the bad guys, and she is reunited with her son and her husband, Stoick, voiced again by Gerard Butler.",

As circumstances would have it, I would watch the movie 2 years later and be completely mesmerized by its beauty and amazing storytelling. So with success came the inevitable sequel. I think it's safe to say that most of us fans weren't worried about this one. For starters, the director and writer of the first was back on board. Then there is an undeniable connection between leads Hiccup and Toothless that even with a lackluster script, I think it would still have had its moments. The thing is that not only does HTTYD2 deliver, it is on equal level with its predecessor, but in a different way.The movie's plot focuses on a now human/dragon community in Berk and all seems well. Hiccup is in search of the many lands and dragons to be discovered, while his father is trying to pass the mantle of leadership onto his son. When Hiccup and his girl Astrid come across a ship that's trapping dragons for an unknown figure named Drago who's assembling a Dragon Army, an impending doom seems certain. Hiccup will also come into contact with his estranged mother, whose disappearance is explained in the most beautiful of ways. In the end though Hiccup will have to make choices and deal with the consequences of what does around him do.Overall, this movie is a better sequel than most. Not only does it become its own movie without disconnecting from the first one, but also does lead to some bigger stakes, something I feel most sequels should do. The relationship between Hiccup and Toothless is a strong one, yet not impervious to threat. It was very refreshing seeing even the most strong of friendships challenged with both sides coming out stronger after the ordeal and their bond even more apparent.There's no doubt that comparisons will be made between both movies, and for me I'm still on the fence given I haven't watched the original in a little while. Still I feel that they are of an equally good quality whilst being different from each other. For now though, I can't deny the impact How To Train Your Dragon 2 had on me and I can safely say that this is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.Rating: 9-9,5/10",

            "content": "At this point, Hollywood has mastered animation, and the craft exemplified here is certainly some of the best I've ever seen\u2014the wonderfully radiant colors, lifelike movements and mannerisms, as well as the utterly photorealistic skin and scenery. How to Train Your Dragon 2 commences with a focus on Toothless' (the dragon) and Hiccup's fully developed relationship and the profusion of dragons now coexisting with the Vikings on the island of Berk. Hiccup's \"alpha-male\" father\u2014 the king of all Vikings\u2014 is still dying to see his son reach the heights of true manliness\u2014a point where he's prepared to rule after his father's reign. On that note, trouble reprises, and the peaceful balance that was finally restored is once again in danger of rifting as an imposing threat, named Drago, who can tame dragons and has already bred a whole army of them, promises to take over everything that was once serene. Over the past five years, I frankly lost hope for animated movies as each one put too much effort into pleasing the clueless children and not the rest of the crowd that's actually there in the movie theater along with the 5-year-old's. Well, after all of these excessively kiddy cartoons (like Frozen and Wreck-It-Ralph), there's finally an animated film with enough maturity and tonal darkness to appease the adults as well. Then again, Dreamworks Animation might just have a better idea than Disney (in its shameful modern state) as to the proper direction of cartoons. You seriously have to appreciate how this picture treats the period of Vikings because it was definitely a perilous and violent time back then. Never shying away from quite adult content (including the large battle sequences), this treat has enough dark moments to depict the mood of the era as accurately as possible for a family movie. For instance, it's especially confident in its storytelling, unafraid of killing off characters unlike modern-day Disney and Pixar. Parents, don't let this predominately grim-sounding description draw you away because make no mistake: there's still plenty for kids to enjoy. In fact, what makes How to Train Your Dragon 2 the best animation in a long time is its perfect blend of humor, seriousness, characterization, and cuteness/warmth. Sufficient screen time is given to each of the major characters for effective development\u2014a display of mastery in shuffling each character's arc and story with ease. The cast features a multitude of popular and talented actors like Gerard Butler, Jonah Hill, Djimon Hounsou, Kristen Wiig, and many more. Don't think for a second that I won't mention Cate Blanchett\u2014I mean, wow, she even dominates voice acting, bringing her utter grace to the screen. Her character is filled with so much emotion and enthusiasm. Matter of fact, having a background in theatre acting allows Blanchett to wholly take advantage of her voice, exuding a humane level of sentiment that helps her transcend what could've simply been a cartoon of a character. In addition, the primary villain of the film (Drago, voiced by Hounsou) is one of the few convincingly evil and menacing villains I've witnessed in a modern animated picture, causing a surprising amount of loss and emanating shrouding tyranny upon a previously-gleeful land. Then\u2014and one of my absolute favorite aspects of the film\u2014we have the amazingly beautiful score by John Powell that honestly sends me back to the days of classical, elegant Disney tales. The music's melody gradually heightens with that sense of grandeur and adventure that's greatly befitting when considering the movie's setting. Moreover, as opposed to most contemporary animations, this one's themes actually aren't cheesy and clich\u00e9d. Instead, HTTYD 2 promotes highly relevant messages of peace and the crucial need to keep one's composure and tranquility in the face of frustrating and hopeless situations. That not only makes for a fresher approach but surely resonates with everyone in the audience in comparison to the overdone preaching of the significance that is friendship and teamwork elsewhere. Unfortunately, I feel like Dreamworks Animation is often overlooked and underrated when in reality, they have produced a plethora of thoroughly enjoyable pictures (see: Shrek, The Road to El Dorado, Sinbad, Flushed Away, The Prince of Egypt, Antz, etc.). The studio seems much more aware that both adults and adolescents are viewing their productions, and thus, they seek to mix maturity with playfulness in order to satisfy both demographics. Shrek also accomplished that goal magnificently by including both adult-oriented humor and subject matter along with the more family-friendly kind. All in all, the HTTYD sequel is a fun journey with enough authenticity to avoid the overly kiddy tone most modern cartoons set for themselves. After repeatedly stating that it's the best animation in years, I really can't make it anymore obvious how much I recommend the watch.",

This sequel does a rare thing - it is even more enjoyable than the original! The cast are all back again, but more importantly, so are the animators. I'm not sure how, but the detail, colours, movements and everything in this film are so vivid, it's truly astounding to watch.The story is relatively simple - someone's making a dragon army to conquer the free Vikings, so it's up to Hiccup (Baruchel) & Stoick (Butler) to save them. The twist comes with the introduction of Valka (Blanchett) and the dragon sanctuary she has created. Seeing where/how these hundreds of dragons is both amazing and strangely beautiful - and a little reminiscent of 'Avatar'. Needless to say, the clash of the two armies certainly makes for exciting viewing.There's some good morals of helping your friends and fighting for what's right for the kids, but still plenty for the adults. Much of this is thanks to the great support cast - Jonah Hill as Snotlout, T.J. Miller & Kristen Wiig as the twins, Chris Mintz-Plasse as Fishlegs and Kit Harrington/Jon Snow as Eret - they add the fun, banter and sidekick-ness to the film.",

In no way did I believe that this film was better than the first--that is--until I saw it for myself. This truly is one of my favorite animated films, right up there with Wall-E and The Incredibles. The animation is light years beyond any of the recent Disney films, including Frozen or Big Hero 6. It was so good that it actually distracted me at times, having to rewind the film over and over to catch all the dialogue that flew past my ears. I really wished I had seen this in the theater.The story is more mythological than the first...and the script really goes deeply into the Dragon myths. It may be a bit too deep for younger viewers, as the villain's motives may come off as a bit silly for those who are unacquainted with the meaning behind all the spiritual/religious connotations.But myth aside, the story's heart lies with the characters, and especially the strong bond between Hiccup and Toothless. Never have I seen such a duo on screen with so much love for each other. Another reason why the film works is due to the threatening villain named Drago Bloodfist. He presented a big challenge in this film, and it made for a very dramatic, sad, and happy ending all at once. The best animated film of all time!",

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the sequel to the classic Dreamworks animated movie How to Train Your Dragon. It continues the story of Hiccup, but this time, he's leading up towards adulthood. He's also traveling and trying to find new land. While on an adventure, he comes across dragon hunters, who are building an evil dragon army. It's up to Hiccup and his friends to stop them. I know it doesn't sound much; part of it is because I can't give a good synopsis for the life of me, but this movie takes everything that the first How to Train Your Dragon had and makes it better. And this is coming from a guy who thinks that How to Train Your Dragon DreamWorks' best work. Although it's not anymore. Now, DreamWorks' best work is How to Train Your Dragon 2. I realize that I do a terrible job telling the stories of movies, but trust me; the story here is really good. Not only does it expand the mythology of the world and stories of the characters, but it creates a plot that is much darker than the original. The setup is excellent, the pacing is perfect, and the conflict between the characters is fantastic, which brings me to how well developed these characters are. Almost all of the characters in this movie are relatable in some way. DreamWorks does a great job with these characters. The CGI animation is some of the best I've ever seen. Every shot is beautiful from the worlds to the character models to the animation itself. There were a lot of breathtaking visuals in this movie, including some shots that looked live action. It was a sight to behold. Something that both the first movie and this movie have are, no surprise, dragons. I love the dragons. All of them have great designs, personalities, and bring a lot of comedy to the movie. Most of the laughs that came from this movie were from the dragons acting like your common household pet. It's adorable and hilarious at the same time. One of this movie's greatest strengths is the heart. There are some genuinely emotional scenes in this movie. Some are very sweet, some are very sad, but no matter what the case, it will get you emotional and probably make you draw a tear or two. I didn't cry in this movie, but I completely understand if someone does. Something that really surprised me in this movie were the action scenes. I knew they were going to be good, but I didn't expect them to be awesome. This movie had some exciting, exhilarating, fast paced action scenes that had my heart pounding and a smile gradually grow on my face. The action was so fun to watch. If I had one complaint, I'd say I think the villain is a little on the generic side, at first mainly. As the movie goes on, he becomes more menacing and ends up as a great villain. However, at first, I thought he was a little weak. He does have that generic villain eye scar thing though. Overall, I think this movie is amazing. A combination of beautiful animation, great characters, fun action, lots of heart, and every other good thing I mentioned makes for a great experience. I was having trouble deciding if I liked this or X-Men Days of Future Past more, but I decided on this because this is the only movie of the year where I wanted to see it again right after I left the theater. And if a movie can pull that off, it's deserving of being a favorite of the year.",

The story once unfolded is very straightforward and is predictable. But that does not take away any of the fun or the action that is really nicely \"drawn\" here.

Amazingly so. It's 3D, but a good 3D. What I found very interesting is that the actors did NOT look like their 3D models at all. Just look at the cast. It is also very well voiced and character acted. Where it fails is the storyline, adding a lot of... stuff where none was needed. I wanted more freedom given by flight, interesting uses of dragons, any expansion in the aspects that I liked in the first. I don't care about how many dragons there are and how different they are and other stuff like that.Bottom line: I really wanted to like this film, but the script messed it all up. I rate it average just because it was well done. With a good script this could have been really cool. It wasn't. Instead it seemed like another good animation team abused by producers with Disney like stories. Exactly at what time after they discovered they could ride dragons did the Vikings forget they were Vikings? That is the question I am left with after this film.",

Like the Toy Story films, it brings purposeful and legitimate storytelling to its franchise. The sweepingly astounding visuals we've come to expect are still here; throw in great characters, strong emotions, and thrilling fun, you have fantasy adventure movie-making at its best. HTTYD2 picks up five years after the first, with humans and dragons co-existing harmoniously, and Hiccup is struggling between his passion for exploring and his duty to take up the responsibilities of his father as village chief. All the brightly ranging characters we loved in the first are here, with Miyazaki-like creature and world building propelling them. The back story and lore is heart-wrenching, the adventure is inspired, but the core relationship between Hiccup and his dragon, Toothless, is the foundation: sweet, believable, and complex. Throw in the best score of the year, it was hard not to stand up and cheer with exhilaration at the truly surprising plotting. These elements are enough to highly recommend any movie, but HTTYD2 is more fearless than most children's stories. The emotional complexities of character decisions, the will-versus-destiny questions, the inevitability of war where peace should reign\u0085far from what we see in most kid's fare. The first one swept us off our feet and the sequel does the same, while managing to burrow deeper into your core. It even got a little dusty in the theatre a couple of times. Manipulation?

With the amount of time that has passed, the dragons are now fully integrated into the Vikings' society, with both now working and living together. All is well, until danger shows itself in the form of Drago Bludvist, a maniacal ruler who is bent on taking over the lands with his army of dragons. And, as can be expected, it is up to Hiccup and friends to stop him. The story is an entertaining one, with laughter, romance, action and sadness all coming together to appeal to kids and adults alike.Character-wise, all voice actors play their parts well, albeit Cate Blanchett's interesting take on a Scottish accent, all returning to their respective roles from the first film. Other than the main cast, Craig Ferguson is providing comic relief as Gobber, the chief's sidekick.One of the biggest things you will walk away from this film remembering is the stunning visuals and design. The first film amazed cinema-goers with views of dragons flying over the Viking wilderness and seas, whereas this time the designers have outdone their previous efforts and created some true moments of awe. The variety of dragon species in this film allows for some amazing shots, reminiscent of certain scenes from James Cameron's Avatar, and will truly leave you wanting more.All in all, Dreamworks, becoming a true contender for Disney's crown, have created a stupendous film, surely capturing all ages and leaving them reeling for another.

I also liked how they didn't turn away from the relationship between Toothless and Hiccup, they are the core of the whole franchise. And I couldn't resist Toothless in this. I love that he doesn't say one word of dialog, and yet he's more believable then most blabber-mouthed characters. With Toothless silence is golden, and he is the best part of the film. Plus, he does something I never would have expected. But you've got to see it for yourself. It is indeed a must see, and by far one of the best animations ever made as well as possibly the best film of 2014 with one of the most iconic characters in animation, Toothless.

We see Hiccup's impression on the village with everyone using gadgets and inventions, however our hero is not feeling confident with his father's plan to make him the new chieftain. But when a notorious dragon training tyrant called Drago has plans to take their pet dragons for his army, Hiccup feels he can resolve the problem without violence.I felt the 2010 film didn't require a sequel; it functioned as a single feature and even the series of books it is based upon does not give it a sequel, but... this new film is great! Our characters have grown up, but they maintain their snappy dialogue and relations and possibly the best part: they aren't angst-ridden teenagers! Hiccup may have identity issues, but the film does not linger on this, it doesn't even try the old clich\u00e9 of putting deliberate wrenches in his relationship with Astrid (this is very tastefully handled in general!) Toothless too has retained his cute charm and gains plenty of knowing looks towards Hiccup's more harebrained ideas. I love where they take his own personal story. Hiccup's father, Stoick the Vast, remains one of my favourites, in fact a lot of the film is focused on his past which I really appreciated; it fit what we did and did not know from the first film. I was going to argue that Drago (Djimon Hounsou) the exotic villain of the piece, is the weakest element, but upon further reflection he does provide a tremendous amount of weight to our lead characters, and even acts as a mirror to Hiccup's own ethics (being a dragon trainer himself) and I believe his character will improve over further viewings. The graphics are gorgeous. Over the four years between films the characters and locations have been virtually made high definition, most obvious being Astrid's hair! The 3D too was very good, much like the first film.I'm talking a lot about the characters, but that is because I love good characters more than the stories themselves, and these two films have had a consistently great cast!My only gripe does not affect the film itself. While the plot's narrative felt far more predictable this time around, I hate this film's trailer. The trailer gave way too much away! Trailers need to stop doing this because there are reveals in this film that should be both intense and surprising, but if you've seen the trailer entire scenes become needlessly ambiguous. This review is not giving away any of this and I implore you: if you haven't seen the trailer yet... don't! Just believe me and go and see the film (and the first one if you haven't already!)HTTYD2 does what sequels rarely do these days; it takes everything that made the original good and didn't mess with it. It doesn't over-complicate its already splendid characters with clich\u00e9d yo-yo plot lines, it doesn't throw in grandiose concepts that break the narrative's simplicity, it merely gives us what we want: more! Expanding the world, explaining the lore just enough to keep things light and fun but also challenge us with intensity and daring.I think I have a new Film of the Year.",

I teared at least three times. I feel like I'm getting soft. I never used to cry at movies, even the really sad ones and then now I seem to be tearing up in every movie. Oh well.The story-line was pretty interesting and not all that predictable. Though I feel that the screenplay could've been better. It felt a bit awkward and dry sometimes. Or maybe it was because the speech was targeted towards children, so it seemed a bit stale.Toothless really steals the show. He's the main attraction and the facial expressions he makes are superb. The relationship between him and Hiccup is really well portrayed. I feel like a lot of animation movies that have animals as part of their main cast, make them out to be somewhat like dogs. For example in Tangled, the horse really acted like he was a dog, with the leg scratching and sitting. I guess that's what makes them adorable and relevant to us. Because we wouldn't understand what it's like to have a pet dragon, so if they acted more like dogs, we would feel that connection.

The movie actually makes it clear that there is a possible way to stop the fight, but then completely ignores it and goes on to focus on power struggle.All the emotional moments are extremely clich\u00e9d, uncreative and feel \"cheap\" and sugary. They make a huge part of this movie. Not much humor, either.The very beginning was good enough - relaxed, cheerful and I thought a few minutes of friendly banter between Hiccup and his girlfriend were nicely done, felt natural. But the more the movie evolves, the worse it gets for those who notice more than the visuals.",

            "content": "What I originally watched a few years ago as a fun Dreamworks animation with comedy, a moral message and cool dragons seems to have decided it is now going to be a trilogy and, in its attempt to make itself more than just a fun DVD to be put on for the children as a standalone but to instead be a franchise player, the second film takes a darker tone. It isn't one that is evident from the very start where we have minor characters involved in dragon races and Hiccup out avoiding responsibility, but it is not long until a plot involving dragon hunters and an enemy raising an army of dragon to capture and enslave other dragons. Gradually we get into a fairly dramatic plot that produces a lot of thrills, scares and probably tears before we get to the end of the film.It is a bridging film in the trilogy and as such it also bridges age- range as it reaches out to the audience that was four years younger when the first came out, tries to please the new younger audience coming in and also tries to make sure the adults are entertained too. In some ways it doesn't really manage this where in others it does. One of the ways it seems weaker is in the comedy; there are some laughs early on but soon the comedy is put to one side apart from a few hit and miss jokes along the way. It is also worth noting that for very young children, the action and its consequences may be too intense even if they are brilliantly done \u2013 for all Toothless' cuteness, some of the larger dragons are genuinely imposing and there are some dramatic scenes that will upset. That said, for the most part the action is thrilling and it is just a shame that it is so franticly edited so that it is dizzying at times. It does have a feel of danger and tension though and it is hard not to be moved by some of the plot.It is done with broad, thick strokes though; the film doesn't leave you with much doubt when you are supposed to have tears in your eyes, when to laugh and when to do a bit of both with relief that all is well after all. I guess part of this is a kids film but some of the dialogue seemed a bit forced and generally the delivery of smaller emotional moments lack realism and finesse \u2013 which is a shame because the much bigger moments are generally very well done indeed. Unfortunately for the cast these smaller moments put a lot of pressure on them, and it doesn't always work. I didn't care for Baruchel too much early in the film as he seemed unnatural but as it went on he was better with his material. Butler, Ferguson and Ferrera all did pretty good work although I really have no idea what Blanchett was doing \u2013 her character was pretty thin and the accent was terrible (all of them). Hounsou's voice helps his character have a lot of presence, which is needed considering how little detail there is to him; meanwhile Harington was a decent find in a role that teased about his impressive physique.HTTYD2 is not a perfect film but it is a very good one. It struggles with the broad, heavy strokes that it uses when it has smaller moments to detail, and also has a few misfires moving from being a comedy to be something more serious, but once it gets into the guts of its narrative it delivers a real ride of excitement and action and emotion that is worth seeing.",

We get to witness the isle of Berk roughly 5 years after the events of the last movie. Hiccup and Toothless are exploring the world, and the rest of the Vikings have fully accepted dragons into their society. This movie informs us that the residents of Berk aren't the only ones who have gained \"mastery\" over dragons, and it reveals some of said people, while still opening up space for more story, more continuation, which I am all for. Story-wise, this receives a 10/10 from me.Then we come to the music. All the old feeling and majesty during dragon-flight scenes from the previous film returns, while still mixing in and adding new sections to fit fresh scenarios. The visuals are also fantastic, exceeding the original and adding new detail and fresh designs to dragons. Overall, a wonderful movie that held my attention for the entire duration (I can't say the same for some people sitting near me....), and I now look forward to the planned third installment to this wonderful adaptation.

            "content": "God, I love Summer Blockbusters! How to Train Your Dragon 2 is not just better than it's sequel but it is the best film by DreamWorks Animation to date.To start off with, the animation was superb, the use of the new software shows because this is probably the best animation I have ever seen. I imagine seeing the film in 3D would be unbelievable. I was also impressed how far the animators took the animation, in the sense of the violence in some scenes, particularly the Drago's stumpy arm.The character development was another huge selling point in this film for me. I don't know what it is about DreamWorks animation but they just have this way of developing characters that you can almost feel that the years have past, and you don't see that with other animation studios. First in terms of physical development as the characters actually seem to have developed but do not appear to be adults. Also in terms of personalities, for example Hiccup is much more confident in this film as opposed to the first film while other characters such as Astrid and Stoick are much more relaxed.There is also the introduction of new characters such as Eret (Kit Harrington) who provides a bit of comic relief as well as Valka, one o the best characters DreamWorks has brought to the big screen as (partly through the brilliant voice acting of Cate Blanchett) as she hits the right balance between funny, kind and vulnerable. If I had a problem with the film, its that the villain was a bit weak. He does not do a lot and is not even that developed. His backstory is mentioned but it is glanced over and I would have liked it to have been explored more. I'm a big fan of Djimon Honsou and he's given his all. The film is ambiguous as to weather the character will come back but if he does, I hope he's more developed. However, he did still serve as a threat and has a few cool lines.Honestly, I would say that this film is the modern day equivalent to The Lion King and will have the same impact on kids as The Lion King. There is just so much beneath the surface and life lessons that apply to adults as well as children.",

Its even up to the standards of Pixar Films such as Wall-E, Up and Toy Story 3. The Director of the First film returns and thank god because if someone else inexperienced had gotten their hands on this film it would have gone all downhill for Dreamwork's reputation as a animation studio. All I have to say is Wow. The animation is breathtaking and the story is emotional. Something that lacked in Dreamworks movies. The only thing I will say about the story... its sad. It really is and I loved it because it was a huge change of things for animated films that have been released in a while. Sure Disney does sad stuff, but they always have! Dreamworks has rarely done it. The only ones I can think of having some emotional stuff in them is Puss in Boots and Shrek the Third. So this is a breath of fresh air for Dreamworks. Also, the story is actually developed with perfect care unlike The Croods where it was all style but no substance.The characters are the best thing about this movie. Mostly because of the way they interact. Hiccup and Toothless have an unlimited amount of chemistry together and you never know what will happen next with them and lots happen with them in the movie. The ending. My god. I will not spoil it. But... my god. I loved the end also. It was astonishing. So if you can, see this movie in theaters. I don't care if you see it in 2D or 3D. Its just a great film. I loved it.94/100 A-",

            "content": "Heroes are made in most unexpected circumstances. Courage is what takes a man forward. I think the director of this film Dean DeBlois believes that strongly. Because, his belief is evident in the treatment of the film. From characterization to emotions and even a including a humorous tiny sub plot. This film comes of as a sequel that dares to beat the original itself. Its multi layered in terms of screenplay and characterization. Look at the scene where Hiccup discovers a strange place and in that a person whom he missed. The conversations are good and are deep in emotion. Even the tiny discovery of using the flaps on the tail of Toothless seems endearing. The small things add up to the big picture and give us a magnanimous feeling. Never there was a dull moment in this pacey animated film. Whilst most animated films have to indulge in a song dance sequence, lot of peppy feel-good music and histrionics of the characters. This film, keeps it pretty simple, it cuts straight into the story, does not waste a moment in discovering characters and the purpose of the film and then achieves it without much hype. Damn, terrific is the writing and kudos to the director Dean DeBlois for his bravery. As it has been said \"Fortune Favours the Brave\" and this film proves that saying yet again.The editing is sharp, the cinematography is super and the animation is simply class apart. It embeds the motion picture and the typical storyboard animation beautifully and in an IMAX 3D, it comes alive. Thanks to the pain the animators took in detailing. It's all rendered beautifully on screen.DreamWorks is not a PIXAR yet, I suppose if it sticks to films like these, I hope it can better that animation company. Of course, since TOY STORY 3, PIXAR did not stand up to it's name yet. And apart from the Shrek franchise DreamWorks itself did not make it big. With this Franchise, I suppose it has got it's breakthrough and can make it big. This is a rare sequel and a gem of a film. It's not for kids alone, they have company and the adults will love it. It's dark and yet humorous. I loved it and hopefully you will too. A 4/5 for this.",

The movie will let you bring out all emotions, even those you have not even experienced yet, whatever it is. I am very much happy I've seen this on it's first showing date and with my siblings. The message about caring and protecting your family and the ones you love and the ones who need it most will hit you right in the heart. The comic reliefs were intelligently placed, especially those that are happening in the background while another scene is being played. TIP: Watch out also for those dragon antics when the humans are interacting. You'll notice this in the first few scenes where everything in the frame is real busy. You won't even feel it but you'll be able to just magically see these until the last part of the movie. Don't hesitate to point at the dragons. Lol, in the theatre where we watched this, everyone's seen doing this at least once. Don't worry, they won't get annoyed :)It's just sad that there was a death in the movie, I didn't see this coming. Almost everyone, sniffed and brought out tissues in this scene. It was simple, yet there were a lot of emotions that will make you feel sad. One - when you try to shoo a friend, blame a friend, lose a family, and then realize you lost a friend at what you just did. One very outstanding sequence was the Alpha at Berk. Boy the Night Fury really lived up to his status. The blue luminescence of Toothless was so emotionally uplifting, better than the rendition of the blue atomic breath of Godzilla. Add to that the narration in the background- \"He's protecting Hiccup, He's protecting the dragons, he's challenging the Alpha.\" (something like that, we were almost at the edge of our seats with this one). Prior to that, we thought there was another death, but lo, a super saiyan type of change happened to Toothless. The battle scene was like classic David and Goliath, but was beautifully interpreted as their own. Eret (Kit Harrington) was entertaining here. His character was also very beautifully built right from his first appearance. ROFL really on Ruffnut's interest in him. Overall, just watch it. The film doesn't need gimmicky press releases like from Godzilla or X men or any previous movie shown this year. (The prankster in America F's dress not included.) This is great quality.",

            "content": "'HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2010 DreamWorks Animation hit about a boy (in a Viking world) who befriends a dragon. This computer animated film picks up five years after the end of the original; with Vikings now living peacefully with dragons, until a new enemy emerges (threatening to destroy the peace). It was directed and written by Dean DeBlois (who also co-directed and co-wrote the first movie) and it's once again based on the book series (of the same name) by Cressida Cowell. Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera, Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kristen Wiig and T.J. Miller all return as voices; with Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou and Kit Harington all joining the cast. I don't think it's quite as good as the original movie (or as well made as a lot of the overly enthusiastic fan reviews, I've read, have proclaimed it to be) but it is a good movie.Baruchel once again stars as Hiccup; who now spends most of his time exploring the skies with his dragon, Toothless (Randy Thom). The rest of the island of Berk now lives in peace with dragons, sharing food and enjoying dragon races. On one of Hiccup's adventures he, and Toothless, come across multiple angry dragon trappers, led by Eret (Harington), who blame them for a recent attack on their fort (in which dragons were stolen from them). The duo, with the help of Astrid (Ferrera) and her dragon Stormfly, learn that Eret, and his team, are capturing dragons for a ruthless dragon hunter named Drago (Hounsou). They warn Hiccup's father, Stoick (Butler), about Drago but he just wants to prepare for war (where as Hiccup would rather try to reason with Drago). Hiccup and Toothless fly off to try and stop the potential war and also come across a mysterious dragon rider, named Valka (Blanchett), while doing so.Once again the visuals look beautiful (like the original film) and the dragon riding scenes are breathtaking. The movie is darker and a tad more violent (I'd say) this time. I saw it with my two young nephews (Eugene and Justin) and I think they both really enjoyed it; it might have been a little too scary for my youngest nephew (who's 6) at times though. There are some lighter comedic moments, throughout the movie, but a lot of those feel forced (although the dragon humor is always funny). The dragon bonding scenes continue to remind me of my relationship with my best friend Keno (my cat). The film does lack some of the awe and wonder that made the original movie so special though. It does a good job of building on it's mythical world (it established in the original film) but the character development isn't nearly as well played out (this time). With all of it's flaws it's still a better animated family adventure film than most. I'd definitely still recommend it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2f4dnLXvGI",

What got me was the idea that another background baddie was Draco. A man who has kept dragons at bay using what is known as the Alpha dragon.This type of dragon uses the ability to brainwash all of the other dragons to do its bidding under the direct orders of Draco. But as we all know Hiccup does not go down without a fight unlike his father who met his demise while saving his son. In a way it was symmetrical that Stoic should fall from his engagement with Draco only to have hiccup lead his village now.Other than the obvious Draco is not out of the picture just yet. He did manage to escape his fate when all of the other dragons which were under the Alpha's control came out of the nightmarish trance. Now all must be on their guard in the days ahead. Hiccup will have a great deal of thinking to do if he is to keep his village safe from the outside forces that continue to wreak havoc.But for right now... racing, and enjoying their victory is the norm. I have to say that this was a refreshing sequel. To see the gang all together with some added new characters keeps my interest going in such a franchise. Dream works did it again with success in every corner of this animation. Great music, excellent action, and wonderful new dragons to see. Fantastic not over the top family fun.

            "content": "*Contains Spoilers for both HTTYD 1 and 2* I thought that How to Train Your Dragon (2010) was a phenomenal movie; in fact, I think that it still stands as the pinnacle of animated movies to this day, both through storytelling and through beautiful animation. In the original, a young boy realizes that dragons and Vikings can coexist after main protagonist Hiccup bonds with a wounded dragon trapped in a crater. Hiccup nurses the dragon, whom he named Toothless, back to health, and the two characters realize that the species they both were brought up to hate are not ruthless monsters, but instead intelligent and compassionate beings. The two then bring their worlds together and unite to face the real evil- the malevolent Queen dragon that forces her dragons to feed her, or else. There is quality character progression, a love interest, moments that make you laugh, moments that make your heart skip a beat, and you come to love the setting and the characters- especially the unbreakable bond between Hiccup and Toothless. But then came How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014). It started off exactly like the first, with Hiccup narrating the lifestyle of his homeland. The opening scene with the game of capture-the-sheep is very... forced. There is nothing that throws us into danger like HTTYD 1 did with the epic battle of Vikings vs Dragons. The dialog of the other teenagers/young adults is annoying and repetitive (and this continues throughout the movie), and the scene only exists to reveal that Hiccup is missing. Cut to the next scene.NOW we get thrown into the Fantasy world we all loved from HTTYD 1- the dynamic duo is soaring through the air, we see Hiccup's impressive armor and flight suit, and we realize that their bond remains as strong as the original. But then comes Astrid, who has had her character image flipped upside down. The former badass tom-boy that played a critical role in HTTYD 1 is now a happy and carefree character that serves as a sidekick rather than a partner/love interest. Throughout the entire movie, she follows Hiccup's lead. Again. And Again. And again. She is a flat character with no development, which is a shame seeing as she was such a round and dynamic character in HTTYD 1.Skipping ahead, we see a pirate trapper with no motive as to why he serves a villain who gives him nothing in return, the continuation of Stoick playing the \"I never listen to my son\" father, and Gobber playing the comic relief character who says nothing witty or clever (except for his quote on marriage- that quote had some funny, hidden adult humor). And then comes... Drago. The clich\u00e9 name combined with a barbaric tone of voice is bad enough, but do you know why he has set his sights on world domination with a fierce dragon army? No? Neither do I. He is the horrible \"bad just to be bad\" villain that we neither sympathize for nor love to hate. He hints that his village was destroyed by dragons, but their is no detail or backstory. And with his village destroyed when he was a young boy, he somehow managed to take control of an Alpha dragon that could squash him like a bug. Oh, and this Alpha also has mind control powers. But it only works on other dragons. Why? To drag the plot forward of course.The saving grace for the main characters was Hiccup's mother, Valka. The reunion scenes, both with Hiccup and Stoick, were touching. Her knowledge of dragons that she passes on to Hiccup is crucial. Her dialog progresses the plot, adds drama, and her soft voice is a nice break from the annoying banter of the other young adults. Combine Valka with Hiccup and Toothless, and you get enjoyable scenes from the time she is introduced to the end of the movie.As for the dynamic duo, they were a joy to watch for the entirety of the movie. Their unbreakable bond and humorous arguing and character progression was amazing. And the symbolism is even greater- at the end of HTTYD 1, we see the bond of the due symbolized through Toothless' clipped back wing and Hiccup's amputated leg. This connects them. By the end of HTTYD 2, Toothless became the Alpha of his species and Hiccup became the Chief of Burk. This shows that the are both capable of individual achievements. Stoick passes away, yet stays with them in spirit as seen when a statue of him is carved in a cliff. The list goes on and on.Conclusion: They say that the sequel never beats the original; heart and soul was poured into HTTYD 1, but HTTYD 2 got the remaining drops. HTTYD 2 has a weak story, weak characters (besides the duo and Valka), and is a real let down from the first movie. If you are expecting a great continuation from the Masterpiece that is HTTYD 1, you will be disappointed.",

It's visually amazing, and although it doesn't feature anything groundbreaking in visual department, it looks fabulous. The story here is probably were this movie felt a bit for me. It's good, but not engaging as the first one was. \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" expands the universe of the first picture and gives some new characters, but only one of them was interesting - voiced wonderfully by Cate Blanchett. Overall, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is a true big screen experience for almost all ages. It's looks and sound wonderfully, and although the story isn't anything new or special, it's definitely worth seeing. There were moments were i felt this movie dragged a bit in the middle section, but it has one interesting turn of events near the end of the movie that i didn't see coming.",

Now living in harmony with the dragons, the citizens of Berk face extinction from an unknown foe, it's up to Hiccup, his friends and the dragons to save their way of life. Four years on from the original, the animation in this sequel seems to be more seamless and slick and I find myself immersed into the world on the screen as if it is live actors in real scenery. Reunited with old friends and introduced to new ones, we are immediately sucked back into the world of the animated Viking and their unusual way of life. Once again I'm in awe of the animators who can put so much personality into characters that don't speak. Children and adults in the audience seemed to enjoy this and it's definitely a good way to spend a couple of hours.",

            "content": "This film is highly recommended.Se-quel-i-tis: The unnecessary remaking of a tale once told, based on a previous original idea using familiar characters, plot, and setting in order to profit from the prior knowledge and admiration of an unsuspecting viewing audience; this becomes a popular practice whenever the creative force is bereft of any new thoughts or practices with the sole purpose of exploiting the masses in search of its own identity.Nowadays, so many books and films suffer from this malady. Commonplace in today's world, this safe haven is the ideal format for writers and filmmakers who may be hatching a moneymaking scheme at the cost of their own integrity. The results usually become a disappointing venture that is a par below their first imaginative offering.\ufffcMy apprehension for returning to the \"new-old\" has been regularly tested, especially with recent past experiences the likes of The Amazing Spiderman 2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Mr. Peabody and Sherman. That said, How to Train Your Dragon 2 may be the cure. This animated film is a new breed of sequel: an uplifting and marvelous blending of wonderful visual images with a clever and insightful story about courage and family ties. HTTYD2 is one of the best films of the year, totally satisfying and absolutely enthralling.\ufffcSomehow avoiding all the similar traps and formula that befall other second helpings, HTTYD2 is a giddy joyride, an unabashed delight for the entire family. Kudos go to Dean DeBlois who has written a literate screenplay that avoids sophomoric humor and dated pop references and also for his yeoman-like direction. Fine voice-over work from Cate Blanchett, Gerald Butler, America Ferrera, Djimon Housou, and Kristen Wiig complete this delightful filmgoing experience, with special mention to Jay Baruchel, vocally perfect in capturing the teenage tone and awkwardness of the film's hero, Hiccup. The film does occasionally slip into conventional sequel territory and its villain is a tad one-dimensional, but those minor infractions are few.\ufffcThe story takes play five years after the first film, in a land of Berk where humans and dragons peacefully co-mingle. Hiccup is now a gawky teenager full of self doubt and recklessness, ready for adventure but not ready to take over the throne of his father's Viking kingdom. Trouble looms just outside its gates in the form of an evil dragon tamer named Drago. Hiccup, along with his trusty and loyal reptilian sidekick, Toothless, decide to make peace, not war, by trying to plead their case to this marauder and his winged fire-breathing army. Of course, that decision leads to more conflict than expected.\ufffcHTTYD2 remains a thrilling adventure, a visceral treat for old and young alike. The mind- blowing aerial sequences are energized with enough panoramic vistas, wide angle perspectives, and fluid camera-work that one is simply amazed at its artistry. The photo realistic details are stunning achievements in state-of-the-arts animation. Colors literally pop and the background settings are massive in scope. Textures (ice, water, fire, fur, scales, etc) are exacting and precise. Characters are nicely rendered and their natural movements subtly enhanced. The dragons come in all sorts and sizes with unique features and they themselves all have that cute as a puppy persona which helps to instantly connect with viewers.\ufffcThis is masterful animation in every frame. No sloppy seconds, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is that rare children's film that has more to say than \"Gimme your money.\" It is a exhilarating film experience that captivates its audience and begs for another viewing. If more sequels had this much imagination and artistic inventiveness, all I can say is, \"Gimme more new-old!\" GRADE: A-Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com\ufffcNOTE: I saw this film in its 3D IMAX format, expensive, but well worth the price for any serious cinephile and / or lover of superior animation.",

Having seen the first movie, I had very high expectations in seeing this and, I assure you, it surpassed every last one of them. This is the most complex, \"kids movie,\" that has ever been made. The storytelling aspects are light years ahead of any other movie of its genre that I've seen\u2014 and I have seen a lot. It has enough humor and good enough pace to keep children entertained and even more so for adults; kids will like the movie, adults will love and appreciate its intricacies. Never before, in any animated movie that I have ever watched have I cried, laughed, and felt awe like I did with this one. Each minute, every second, you will find yourself in love with this world that has been so expertly crafted. The detail and attention that has been put into this movie, the subtle nuances of emotion and the strikingly real portrayal of the human condition, makes this, not only the best of animated movies, but one of the best movies period! This is filmmaking in its finest; it's not a way to make quick money, but a way to communicate to viewers what makes being a good person, someone who is caring and selfless\u2014all the things that we, as people, should aspire to be\u2014worth it.

            "content": "Sequels are tricky things when it comes to animated films. They have to contain the same charm, lovable characters, and the same solid foundation while also furthering the storytelling, bringing in new characters, and taking courageous risks. How to Train Your Dragon 2 does this, and it does it so well that it takes the series to a new height, literally, but also raising the bar for what an animated sequel should be like.We pick up 4 years after the first film, which is also in real years considering the first film was released in 2010, and the island of Berk has grown and flourished with the inclusion of dragons. Every citizen has a dragon; there are races, they help out, and they are used to travel to new and uncharted lands. Hiccup is spearheading this effort, tracking where dragons are located while also trying to discover another dragon of the same breed as Toothless. He soon discovers (spoilers from the trailer ahead) that his mother is actually alive, and she is helping raise and care for dragons in the wild while also stymying the efforts of dragon-trappers led by the evil Drago.The story is a lot more in depth than the first film, containing some more serious elements that mirror real-world situations (such as the poaching of wild animals). It is a good way to involve children at a young age who might find the actual idea too frightening. The writing is pretty great for the most part; the characters all have their shining moments, we get to learn more about the backstory of Stoick (Hiccups father), and we also see characters who have matured since the first film. However, the writing for Hiccup's mother, whose name is Valka, was not that strong. Having been in the jungle for a while raising dragons without any other humans might make someone crazy, but to have her essentially be looked at like someone who was actually raised in the wild is a little bit jarring and unnecessary.The villain, Drago, is just your run-of-the-mill villain whose goal is that of most every villain: to take over the world. It would have been nice to have him have be a little more original, but it does not take away anything from the final product. The movie also takes risks. I will not say what risks these are because it is a major part of the movie, but it certainly is a bold move in my opinion.The entire cast from the first film reprise their roles. The dialogue is a lot meatier and seems more directly written for the characters as opposed to the first film. We also have the introduction of Cate Blanchett as Valka, Game of Thrones' Kit Harrington as Eret, and Djimon Hounsou as Drago. They all do great jobs at joining the already strong cast, but like I previously mentioned, some of the dialogue of Valka seems out of place.This sequel also packs more of an emotional punch than the first film. There is a lot more to do with the past, loss, and maturing that is sure to make any tough-skinned dragon lover to feel a little. While it is not overwhelming, it uses it at just the right times to make you feel the right emotion without it feeling forced or unnecessary.The dragons and all of the animation are all top-notch. Vastly surpassing the animation of the first film, the sequel takes things to a whole other level. The intricate details on the dragons, the new and gigantic alphas, the beautiful rendering of clouds, and even the facial hair are all beautifully drawn. It is a gorgeous film to watch. The action sequences in the latter part of the film are some exhilarating pieces of animation, resulting in some jaw- dropping moments.In the end, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is one of the most fun adventures you'll have all year at the movies. The characters are more lovable than ever, the animation is some of the best of the year (if not of the decade so far), and it has some great action sequences. How to Train Your Dragon 2 has set the bar on how to make an animated sequel, go check it out if you haven't already.For more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com",

            "content": "A visually spectacular and thoroughly fun CGI movie, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a worthy follow up to its inspired predecessor and a movie made absolutely for those young and those young at heart thanks to its brisk pacing, imaginative design and witty yet emotionally resonate script.Dreamworks original HTTYG was a surprise smash hit that not only made a handy buck for its studio but was well received by critics and audiences alike. The first Dragon was a real blast thanks to its abundance of charming visuals, energetic voice work and sense of adventure and it makes me happy to report that all those elements are well and truly back for Hiccup and Toothless's second instalment and there are consistent moments throughout the movie that will bring a great big smile to the face of all and maybe even a few moments sad reflection. It's great to see a CGI movie make such fine use of a script that appeals to the child in all of us and will no doubt thrill children of all ages thanks to its epic nature.Flying through the air on the back of a dragon or falling through the clouds feels incredibly vibrant and real once more in this adventure and the stylish aspect of the films production no doubt benefited from renowned DOP Roger Deakin's assistance in crafting the films set pieces. What makes all these elements even more joyous however is the films ability to craft an interesting and effective story around all these dragons and key to the film's success no doubt, lies within its beating heart and it's a real credit to the filmmakers that first and foremost the story portrays something we're actually invested in. In an age where animated films try so hard to be hip or current it's refreshing to see Dragon mix the fun with the serious in such a splendid manner.A hugely enjoyable ride (sometimes quite literally), How to Train Your Dragon 2 is easily one of last year's best CGI movies and one of the most entertaining movies full stop. This is one of those rare children's films that parents the world over won't be dreading each time their child requests to put it on for the umpteenth time. I for one am looking forward to Hiccup and Toothless's next journey into the exciting dragon filled world.4 flaming swords out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "I really enjoyed the first \"How to Train Your Dragon\" and this sequel is actually pretty good, but just not good as the original. The story just wasn't as uplifting as the first one and the pacing seemed a bit off at times. A lot of parts appeared to be rushed and not developed as well. The relationship between Stoic and Hiccup was weak, yeah it had the previous movie to develop in this area. But when it came to the turn of events, I just couldn't feel much emotion...And that includes the characters that deals with it. I think it should have developed more with intriguing dialogue between the main family characters. Even the villain in my opinion was just weak and nothing is really known about him. The main villain Drago Bludvist has control over a Alpha Dragon which is a dragon that has control over other dragons. But it never mentions how he managed to do that, maybe they might mention it in the next installment. But it's bothersome when you see a movie that has so many untold aspects to the story. Besides the fact that he got scarred up by dragons in the past, Drago just seemed like a generic family movie villain. Dragon wranglers plays a part in the story and they are just their and nothing stands out about them either. It's a good movie, but it just falls short in a lot of areas. The parts that are suppose to be emotional just wasn't. Mainly because it just lacked the right elements to get me emotionally invested into the story. Now I know that it's difficult to flesh certain things out with the budget and all. But I personally thought if things WAS more fleshed out it could have had more emotional depth. Maybe they could have sacrificed certain things to help develop certain things more. I don't mean to drag things out like certain TV shows, but just the right amount would have added to the effectiveness. It's like a lot of ideas ended up getting wasted because of the direction of it all. Overall it's a good movie, but I have seen a lot better. The soundtrack is just fantastic.6.9/10",

            "content": "In a squeaky voice I hear Hiccup screaming to the top of his lungs \"ARE YOU READY BUD?\" and I end up replying in a soft whisper, \"Not sure yet.\" The shivers of anticipation and fear trembled throughout my body. The fact is the first \"How to Train Your Dragon\" was so amazing (then again, that is opinion but mine stands) how can it possibly be topped?! Well I found the answer to that question and to Hiccup's question after walking out of the theater. Boy I wasn't ready for it but \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" brought it big time. Needless to say, I was in awe with how fantastic this movie was.We begin five years after the first movie ended. Hiccup and his friends are living the good life with dragons for pets being the new norm. However, this new paradise seems to disappear with the emergence of a vicious enemy who aims to create a dragon army for the sole-purpose of world domination. Then of course comes along a mysterious dragon rider causing all types of trouble (if you've seen the previews then this will not be a shock but I shall be kind just in case you have not). Hiccup ends up working with Toothless once again to bring down this enemy and in the process change everything they've ever known.The way this film builds upon it's predecessor is by simply doing the one thing most sequels do not like doing; continuing the story in such a way that it could stand on its own as a stand-alone film. This film is not the first film, in fact it dives even deeper into the story and world the first film brought us.A sequel, a great sequel knows how to broaden the story and mature it as it goes along. And that is exactly what they do here. We find Hiccup realizing that maybe he has been naive with certain ideals he carries, he realizes maybe it is time to grow up. Now-a-days coming of age stories are almost ubiquitous, but \"Dragon 2\" knows how to make it feel fresh. In the first one Hiccup was trying to find himself, he is still doing that here but it is more from a desire to find his place in a grown up world than to be accepted for who he is. The transition between the Hiccup we met in the first movie to the Hiccup of this movie is very well done and completely believable.And just as Hiccup has grown, the story grows with him by becoming darker and more mature with it's themes. Here we deal with a new form of family discord not really seen in animated films. We find teen romance on the bloom. And the idea of diplomacy over war. This film deals with such complex issues that it can be easy to forget this is a kids film about dragons.Which leads me to comment on the visuals of the movie. The animation is absolutely breathtaking. From the very first scene showcasing the dragons on Berk to the final epic fight sequence. This is a film of the highest caliber in regard to how animation should look. The clouds mixing with the red and orange of a setting sun, the mountains that touch the sky, and even the giant ice fortress that looks like something from a far away dream. This movie is huge on spectacle but it never forgets the heart of the story.The characters are just as endearing as they were when we first met them. Some of them have grown up some considering the time-span but this is to be expected. Jay Baruchel is, as always, fantastic as Hiccup. This time he brings a maturity to the role while keeping him goofy and good-natured. The same can be said for the rest of the all-star voice cast. Gerard Butler, America Ferrara, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, and even new cast member such as Kit Harington (Game of Thrones) are all fantastic.Amazingly, they manage to keep all of these different factors under control when it could have so easily gone wrong. Once again this films backbone (just like the first) is the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. This simple, yet vital, relationship could've been lost in the franticness of the plot and the wide range of characters. However, Director and Writer Dean DeBlois nimbly moves around these issues as if there was no problem at all. It is expert filmmaking to the highest degree.\"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" put my fears to rest by giving us a story that is darker and more mature than the first. They expanded on the world from the first movie and gave us even more wonderful character moments. Filled with great, sly humor and breathtaking visuals. This movie is filled with spectacle but it never forgets the quiet, tear-jerking moments that made the first movie such a hit. Since both movies are so great there is room to debate for either one. Both have valid points for being better than the other but I would have to say \"Dragon 2\" is better than the first (as hard as it is to believe). This is \"The Empire Strikes Back\" for the \"Dragon\" Trilogy and even (as of right now) the best animated movie of the year. Kids and adults will both be walking away saying one thing \"Can we go see it again?\" and I'm sure you will.",

I thought the first movie was so fun and amusing that I was very excited for the sequel and had high expectations (I guess you can say they were as high as a dragon in the clouds but that would be a silly, very forced metaphor). The thing that I wasn't prepared for was how my expectations were met and then instantly exceeded! It would be easy to say that HTTYD2 was better than the first but that would be selling the first film short. Instead, I see this completely fantastic follow-up as an intensely epic building block that built superbly well on a great foundation. Like the first one, the film is funny, adorable, and filled with a great voice acting cast but this one does one better by keeping all that and improving on their animation, bringing in more great actors for new and interesting characters and then decides to bring about a darker, more mature story that proves that animated films don't have to be talking animals doing fart jokes. In all honesty, the story is the best part about this film as it is capable of being emotionally dramatic, fun and amusing all at the same time.\"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" proves that this is a property that is a legitimate contender in the animated film department and, with all its epicness, I'm am more than excited to see this franchise have a long life and I hope to see more and more sequels in the years to come.Hey there, good looking!

            "content": "It's always a hard job to make a sequel for a successful movie. It becomes harder when the first one is an epic. How to Train Your Dragon is one of the best animation movie ever made and it's one of my all-time favorites. So, when I heard about a sequel, I was more cautious than exited. First of all, How to Train Your Dragon was a perfect piece of cinema. It had everything that a moviegoer could ask, with which are perfectly blended together. It was also a bit conclusive. They had a problem and they found a solution, it was as simple as that. So, what was there to bring a follow-up was actually a few. With all these in my mind, I visited the movie house, and it's safe to say that the experience wasn't a disappointment. Just like it's predecessor, How to Train Your Dragon is a fun movie with ravishing visuals- a must-watch on 3-D, awesome action sequences, adequate drama and sentiments. Though the movie derails a bit in the middle parts, the following action and visuals takes the wagon to the finish line in fashion. The plot goes as follow- Hiccup and his buddy Night Fury embarks on a voyage to find new lands, and they finds themselves in the hands of a group of dragon thieves. They are trying to capture and forward dragons to a man named Drago, so that he can build a dragon army. To persuade Drago to relieve from his evil task, Hiccup travels to find Drago by neglecting the warnings of his father. The story moves with Hiccup's findings through this trip.Apart from everything technical, which are as good as the predecessor, what the sequel lacks is a strong plot. Well, it's a fact that it can't be matched with the original since it was entertaining and touching at the same time. It had to be concluded that plot-wise, the original can not be competed. But on every other aspects, the sequel managed to catch up with it's predecessor.As a final word, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a worthy addition to the series, but it's no match for the original. Still, it manages to entertain us. Aside from a bit dark plot lines and some ambiguous back stories, this movie is a perfect entertainer for the weekend, and so far the best one of this year.....",

            "content": "My Thoughts:The sequel takes place five years after the first one and opens up to showing us how good life is now that humans and dragons have started to coexist. They have even come up with a game involving dragon riding, sheep, and baskets, but of course one person is missing Hiccup (Jay Baruchel). He is off exploring the new world around him on Toothless.Through this exploring Hiccup comes to find that there are people out there trapping dragons to bring back to Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou) who is enslaving the dragons to do his bidding. Of course this does not sit well with Hiccup and he sets out to bring peace back to his home.I really enjoyed the first movie when it came out and have to say that they have done a good job with the sequel and keeping us interested in what is going on with Hiccup and the gang. And I will have to admit that the 3D is not to bad either but as is usually the case animated movies do a good job incorporating 3D.The underlining story of the movie though is loyalty and family. We still have the Hiccup and Stoick (Gerard Butler) family relationship. Stoick now believes that Hiccup is the one to lead the clan in the future but Hiccup still has his self doubts even after the events of the first movie he still does not believe that he can live up to his fathers expectations.We also see how the relationship between dragons and humans have kind of changed the vikings and their thinking, which factors into the movie further down when Drago shows up and starts reeking havoc and enslaving dragons against their will. My Recommendation:This is a great family movie and all will have fun when watching it. So if you are looking for something to do with the family treat them to some dragons.",

            "content": "I understand that sequels have a tendency of trying to present a moral and I feel like the plot and conflicts were hard to comprehend. Because the trailers are everywhere its fair to say that we all know that the main character's mom left her family to go live with the dragons and make her family and people think she has been dead for 20 years. I have a major problem with this plot. Firstly, she isn't even protecting the dragons. As in the first film, there is a big dragon that's defending the nest. She simply gone to live with the dragons with a stupid outfit. Secondly, I found it amazing how cool the father and son where to see her. Like, okay thats completely understandable to abandon your people and family to go spend your life playing with dragons. There is a villain, and like the first movie, the main character with an annoying voice ignores his father's stance on him and disobeys him to go tell him that everyone can hold hands and sing songs over a fire ... His father just told him a story about how he pretty much killed everybody in his tribe. But older people are just stupid so its okay to go out and disobey them because their old. Someone important dies because of this idiot's stupidity. This is the first time Disney made me sigh during one of their movies. Because of how fast we skim over the villain's background; who I must add is the most interesting person in this whole movie, on purpose so that we just view him as a bad guy. I thought it was interesting that in one instance, they actually say something along the lines, \"There are no bad dragons. Just bad people.\" That fact is actually disproven in the first movie as well as the second. In fact the bad dragons never get a chance to become good. In both films they must and are defeated. So, I thought that was interesting. You are supposed to just look at this one bad guy and say, \"he is the reason for all this commotion...\" Of course you probably forgot his back story. But whatever, right?When you watch the film its also interesting that the important part is to ignore the negligence of both the main character, Hiccup, and his stupid, good for nothing mother who are responsible for a major character's death as well as the destruction of their city and many other people's deaths. But they saved the dragons so its okay. I look at it in two perspectives. Firstly, I'm like 25 years old, so I'm not to young and not to old. It was a stupid movie to watch as a youth. I'm married and hope to have kids, and in that light... the movie was much more stupid. Kids absorb things from movies, and the rubbish portrayed in this film made me want to vomit. But also, I feel like I should watch movies alone before taking my family to one of these. Seriously, lets think about it as a parent. You tell your kid not to do something because you have had experience and they go do it and get someone killed. That's actually a very realistic scenario. The movie kind of makes it okay for stupid kids to go do something like this and then when they are done with the deed you pretty much have to say something like, \"oh its not your fault, now let me clean the doo doo on your behind.\" Not sure what to think about the mother in this movie. Was it suppose to represent women can do what they want... okay, I guess. You can get a job, become a leader, do what hiccup did and make a difference. You don't have to be a dead beat mom. But hey if that's your cup of tea then go ahead. I hate dads that leave their families to go to the bars and completely ignore them as well. Also, the amount of destruction created by the idiots in this movie is amazing. There is a carefree sense being shown to our youth. I have never had a problem with Disney films in my life. I'm not a film Nazi. But what the heck was that? Hiccup does something in the film that constantly puts him in his dragon into danger. They discover a way to continue to do it, but that with the negligence and destruction left in their wake, it gives this careless vibe. This film has an idiotic plot and a bad message to people. I could have been happy with one of the two. I graded the first an 8 out of 10. It is interesting how you would view this one compared to many others that have posted. I really don't see the hype. Maybe their is a stereotypical villain and its much easier to absorb. However, he isn't a complete stereotypical villain. The way the villain gets defeated is idiotic as well. Just watch it and ask yourself what the heck was going on. Just to explain my ratings a bit. Anything 5 and up, I could watch again if it was a rainy day and there was nothing else on. The only reason I rated it a 4 is because there was a couple good actors voices. HICCUP sounded like a whinny little girl. Thats another thing! I wouldn't want my son thinking its cool to talk like that. The art and background of the story was pretty spectacular. But then again... I find it interesting how fanatical people can be by posting extremely good review. Thats why I don't feel ashamed to be the odd ball out. I am not hardcore about ratings.",

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a decent follow up, for an animated sequel, and kids and other fans of the original should be happy with it. In it, our former Viking nebbish Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is now the hero of the town of Berk, which is still ruled by his dad, Stoick (Gerard Butler). Peace reigns in Berk; instead of endless fighting and pillaging on the part of the marauding Vikes, dragons and men are friends of a sort. Even the most hardened of savages favors the flying reptiles.Hiccup knows that his dad wants very badly to be the next chief of their Viking tribe, but he himself doesn't want to follow in those large footsteps. While scouting with his own dragon, Toothless, Hiccup discovers an island that's part land, part ice - in that there are huge shards of ice skewering the island and the domiciles. Then he - and his gal pal Astrid (America Ferrera) and her dragon - are trapped, partly so that Hiccup can find out more about this new place. And it quickly comes out that the band of men on the island have been attacked several times by dragons and that they themselves are, in fact, dragon trappers. They're catching dragons to serve in a dragon army ruled by Drago (Djimon Hounsou), who's naturally out to rule the world.The Dreamworks animation is fine - as good as in the previous movie, anyway - but more importantly the voice characterizations are great. In one fun scene, Astrid pokes fun at Hiccup's speech mannerisms, which of course mimic those of the real-life Jay Baruchel: a lot of shrugging and hand-waving. Jack Black, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, and Kristen Wiig voice Hiccup's friends, and Kit Harrington (Jon Snow on Game of Thrones, who knows nothing) plays a duplicitous dragon trapper. Oh yeah, and Cate Blanchett's there as well.The movie and its predecessor are based on a series of books by Cressida Crowell, and there are plans to make a third film. No surprise there - the sequel did great box office and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. And while the effects and action make for a wholly entertaining movie, there's some beautiful, quieter moments, between parent and son, girl and boy, boy and dragon. A fine offset to the comic-book mayhem surrounding it.",

            "content": "How To Train Your Dragon 1 is one of the most delightful surprises I had in cinema. I went in expecting to hate the film because of its \"unattractive\" human and dragon animation. However, as the film unfolded, this story of how a boy Hiccup and his new pet dragon Toothless totally changed the history of human-dragon relationships turned out to be outstanding and endearing. Catching this sequel is a no-brainer. We all wanted to see the next chapter in the lives of the two inseparable friends.Part 2 happens five years after the events of the first installment. Hiccup is now a young man of 20, already being primed by his father to be the new chief of their village Berk. However, Hiccup discovers a plot of a scarred renegade named Drago to form a dragon army to control the world. While his father Stoick prepares for war, Hiccup decides to seek Drago out in order to settle the matter peacefully. In his quest though, Hiccup chances upon the secret icy lair of the legendary Dragon Rider, who turns out to be Hiccup's long-lost mother Valka.The artwork is so much more improved than the first one. The play of the artists on texture is impeccable. The leathery black skin of Toothless, the stubble on Hiccup's chin, the thick hair and beard of Stoick, each idiosyncratic little feature of each of the countless dragons, the flames, the ice, the oceans -- the artists have outdone themselves. The acrobatic flying sequences and battle scenes are very imaginatively executed. The way the artist make us feel the wind currents as the dragons are in flight was unbelievable. The musical score by John Powell is very effective in evoking both the exhilaration of the action scenes, as well as the drama of the intimate scenes.The voice acting of the actors behind each of the lead characters add so much to their personalities. Jay Barruchel's voice perfectly captures Hiccup as a fun-loving, earnest but lost young man, uncertain of where his future really lies. Cate Blanchett's characteristically cool voice lends a lot of credibility to Valka, torn between her commitment to her dragons and to her reunited human family. Gerald Butler's commanding voice as Stoick as warrior can convincingly turn loving and gentle as the situation warrants. Butler will also surprise us again with his singing voice, which we have missed since his stint as the Phantom of the Opera years back.Writer and director Dean DeBlois successfully tells us a story that is mature with a generally dark mood, with very serious themes of family, loyalty, selflessness and heroism. There will be tears, so get ready for that. For the very young kids, count on Dreamworks to spice things up with some comic moments with foolish kiddie pranks and cute dragon babies though. Overall this is one big emotional roller-coaster ride -- so fun and entertaining, yet complete with important lessons in life for all ages. 9/10.",

            "content": "4 out of 4 stars.Animated sequels can be a dangerous thing. I've seen plenty of animated sequels that just do what the first did, but bigger and louder. It's a shame when this happens, especially when the first one was good. However, Dean DuBlois' \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" actually expands on the universe it built and does it beautifully. The story follows Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and the dragon Toothless as they continue to explore the lands surrounding Berk and the dragons that live around them. Most of the cast from the first one has returned with Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou, and Kit Harrington joining in. All of them do a great job and bring life to these characters.This film is visually stunning. It's one of the most beautiful three dimensional animated films I've seen. John Powell's sweeping score complements the scenery and the grand scope of the film. There is more action in this film, but it doesn't overwhelm the story or characters. Everything feels balanced and progresses naturally. It doesn't just redo what it did in the first one. DeBlois explores new territories and gives these characters a story they deserve.\"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" is great fun for all ages and does what a sequel should do. It's a beautiful looking film that is well written and has a great cast. It's one of the best animated films of the year and is just a really good film.",

How they were able to come up with different species of dragons and make them adorable instead of frightening like the typical dragons we see on screen. It easily became one of my favourites because of its epic action scenes as well as all the different elements that form a great movie: action, drama, comedy, romance.As soon as I heard news that they were creating a sequel, I was definitely excited, but also worried that it would fall short as so many sequels do. The majority of sequels just don't live up to the expectations that we place on this.But when I saw How to Train Your Dragon 2, I knew that it not only lived up to my expectations, but it probably became my favourite animated movie of all time. I was expecting a continuation of the storyline, but the efforts put into this movie by the creators allowed the audience to actually see cartoon characters grow into their teenage or young adult years and mature in front of our eyes. Even better to watch this happen in 3D!It's a movie that will please all viewers, from young to old. It possesses all the elements that the first film had and more, and the music score is amazing. I really hope that it will win the Oscar for Best Animated Film and Best Original Score because it is well-deserved.",

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the kind of sequel that most sequels try to be. It's a film that recaptures the magic of the first film, while telling an entirely different story. Like the main character of Hiccup, this film is a little bit more mature than the first outing, with five years having passed for the viking dragon riders of Berk, and yet there is still a levity to the proceedings in all of the darker moments that maintain the innocent, child-like charm of the story.The simple truth here is if you liked the first film, then you will enjoy this one. While I feel that the first film is a more complete narrative experience, there is sheer joy in seeing your favorite characters, human and dragon alike, back together again for a new adventure that is full of emotionally charged moments that get to you. If only the villain, Drago, had been a little more than just an external conflict for our heroes to face, this film might have bested its predecessor. The truth is, the film often bogs down a bit when Drago is on screen because in a film that is as emotional as this one, a character there merely for plot contrivance doesn't always work. Of course, aside from an uninteresting villain, this is about as perfect a sequel as you can make.All of the cast and crew of the first film are back and it really feels like you're watching a reunion of sorts unfold. I can only imagine that this must be how people felt when they saw The Empire Strikes Back for the first time. While How to Train Your Dragon 2 is not The Empire Strikes Back, the comparison is one that I feel sums up all of my favorite aspects of this film. From the musical score by returning composer John Powell, revisiting the catchy musical themes of the first film while adding new ones, to the spot on vocal performance by Jay Baruchel as Hiccup, this movie works because of its lovable characters and the same emotional heart beating underneath it as the first film. From the first time you see Hiccup and his dragon pal, Toothless, flying together as one to a new song by Sigur Ros frontman, Jonsi, you are transported back into this world and you only wish you could stay a little bit longer.I give How to Train Your Dragon 2 a 9 out of 10!",

            "content": "How To Train Your Dragon 2 is every bit as entertaining and endearing as the original. Refreshingly for a sequel, it is not necessarily bigger and brasher, but feels like an extension of How To Train Your Dragon. Set 5 years after the events of the first film, the script has grown up too, very much like its enchanting lead characters- Hiccup and Toothless. At the same time, it is human creativity to the max- a superb 3D fantasy ride that will leave you breathless.\"This is Berk,\" Hiccup says. \"Life here is amazing. Dragons used to be a bit of a problem. But now they've all moved in.\"In a world of temperamental dragons and unreasonable humans, patient and reasonable Hiccup and non fire breathing Toothless were both misfits. Yet their relationship changed the world- this we saw at the end of the first movie. This one starts off in thrilling style, with Hiccup's friends engaging in a juvenile dragon race, which is a cross between basketball and buzkashi. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) however, prefers prosaic activities such as skimming with the whales, trying his hand at gliding, and in general running away from the leadership role that his father, Stoic the Vast (Gerard Butler), wants him to don. In one of his expeditions, he comes across a vast horde of dragons, and meets the source of his dragon whispering skills- his long lost mother, Valka (Cate Blanchett). Toothless meanwhile is no longer a pet, he and Hiccup are but one soul. There is a power hungry villain, Drago (Djimon Honsou) in the horizon though, who wants to build and commandeer a dragon army. Hiccup and Toothless must overcome personal loss and fight their heart out to save what they have so painstakingly built.The magic of How To Train Your Dragon 2 is the way director Dean DeBlois is able to create a mood of intimacy and awesomeness. First the visuals- the dragon flying scenes are absolutely marvelous- dragons soar, swivel, dive and spit fire in enthralling fashion. The action sequences are full of subtle gags that require a second viewing to fully appreciate, and the imagination and detail that has gone in the design of a million dragons on screen is mind-boggling (no two dragons are the same). Then the emotive elements- there are genuinely scary moments, major characters have to deal with death and treachery, and there is a rekindling of a love story between people long lost. The visuals and the emotions come together with rare fluency to create a joyful, immersive 3D experience. The voice acting by all the stars is very good too, in addition to the racy musical score.Children will most likely be immersed in all the visual frenzy, but will also ask questions- this is a film that will make them think too. At the heart of every animated movie is the message. Here it is about the symbiotic relationship that humans have with animals, and the thought that we need to make our own destiny.

            "content": "Intense, powerful, stunning. These are a few words that you may hear used to describe Dreamworks Animation's How To Train Your Dragon 2. It is certainly one of the best sequels ever made. The film picks up the beloved duo of Hiccup and Toothless five years after the also excellent first film, and walks a new path in family-oriented animation. To explore the depth of this incredible film, we'll look at Story, Character, Music, and Animation. Starting with story, which is after all the heart of a good film. Ultimately the story is that of a young man struggling to find who he is inside, and having to face the sometimes harsh realities of growing up. He must deal with adversity, and anger while finding the courage to fight for all that he knows and loves. He must face an enemy called Drago Bludvist who is out to destroy all that is good. The story is written by Dean DeBlois who, for the first time is minus his co-writer Chris Sanders who worked with DeBlois on titles like Lilo and Stitch. Personally, I think he's done a better job on his own, and a magnificent story is the result. Overall, the story and plot flow nicely. Some may think it to be a little rushed, but in reality that's the point in order to keep the audience on their toes. In the end, there are plenty of loose ends, but that's okay, because we have Dragon 3 to wait for in 2016 where lots of questions will be answered. Now moving on to characters where there may be some weak points. Let's start by saying that Stoick, Valka, Hiccup, Gobber, and Toothless are well written and don't really have much room for improvement. However, Astrid, Eret, Drago and the other dragon riders do. Astrid for example is a voice of reason for hiccup... for a scene, makes Drago mad... for a scene, and is Hiccup's cheer leader... for the rest of the film. She could have had a better part in all that happens, but she didn't. Eret, as many notice in the trailers turns over to Hiccup's side, but it seems a little too fast. it is understandable because it's made clear that Drago is cruel to him, and the dragon riders were a perfect opportunity for him to turn his back on Drago. If you ask me, I think his turn could have been drawn out just a little to add some dramatic flair into the story, but in the end, the way it was done worked great. Drago Bludvist, the villain was introduced fairly late on, and we never find anything out about him. Of course there is the third film on its way and surely we'll find out some things about him like why does he have a dragon paw for an arm? Or why does he hate dragons so much? Drago is an example of an undeveloped character but it just adds to the mystery of the man. Finally the other dragon riders. Once again, they are kind of just there for comic relief. They don't do anything noteworthy, even though there were several opportunities for at east one of them to do something of the sort; unfortunately, I doubt this will change much in the third film. Now, the grandiose score which is once again composed by JOhn Powell. Powell's score for the first film was nominated for an academy award, and this new one most surely will also be nominated and hopefully win this time. On it's own, the score can pluck at your heartstrings, and when added into the context of the film, there are several moments where it amplifies the emotional content drastically. Like any well written film score, it tells the story, and makes the film better. Powell built off of and re-arranged some cues from the first score to fit the new content and tone, while introducing some incredible new themes including two collaborations with musician Jonsi. Ultimately, the score makes the film what it is, without the score the film would be almost dead. There is bad news in this because Powell will not be returning for the third film and we can only hope whoever picks up the franchise will do just as good of a job. Lastly: animation. The quality is extremely good. It's damn near believable. New techniques and software were applied to make bodily movement as realistic as possible. Also, Lighting coordinator Roger Deakins returns! Deakins is an award winning cinematographer who understands lighting well enough to make animation look realistic, which adds to the overall quality of the film. The amount of time, care and detail put into the quality of animation on this film really shows on screen. Overall, this film is incredible. It's will be a hard one to beat for this year. It possesses the ability to make the audience laugh, or cry, or just sit dumbfounded by \"what just happened\". \"Dragon 2\" is deep, emotional, fun, and visually stunning. It really is far better than the first, whether you look at it on it's own or in context of the big story. It is the rare kind of sequel that instead of just being there, it expands on the plot of the first film, and leaves room for the next, which doesn't happen often enough. How To Train Your Dragon 2: in a word, sturdy, and will surely be enjoyed by generations to come. It is a film worth seeing, and it's fun for the whole family. Overall rating: 8.6 Recommend: without hesitation.",

The biggest disappointment of the whole movie is the part, where Stoick is killed. I was expecting Drago to give order to Alpha, who would order to dragons to attack Hiccup and then Toothless would jump in front of Hiccup regardless of Alpha's command, risking own life protecting him, now that would send a powerful message. Afterwards probably a surprise of Alpha, who would then refuse to follow Drago's command as well. But no, he kills Stoick without any hesitation and please note, that he was not expecting Stoick to jump in front of Hiccup, so he would kill his best friend without any remorse and that destroyed the whole movie and removed everything that previous movie and series achieved thus fur. It was the most disgusting scene I have seen in a long time. In the movie, Hiccup actually mentions, that he shot down Toothless and it is because of him, that Toothless can not fly, so it might seems like a revenge and that is the only thing, that makes sense, why would be Toothless willing to kill Hiccup just like that and there goes the real friendship. Even the part, where Toothless tries to go near dead Stoick and Hiccup screams at him to go away, is shameful, it only proofs, that Hiccup does not really value Toothless as his friend. Hiccup was always trying to find the best in dragons and people, who were bad, even in Drago, but not this time, when Toothless was obviously not in control. You might argue, that his mother was just killed, but previous Hiccup would never do it. Simply put, after watching this sequel I am throwing out the DVD of the first one, because I could never watch it again without thinking about, what is going to happen next and that the whole friendship is just a pretend. They were together simply because Toothless could not fly alone as it was also mentioned in the movie and that is it.",

Created as the first DreamWorks animated film to use the new \"Premo\" and \"Torch\" lighting software throughout and with the assistance of some excellent direction from Dean DeBlois, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is technically a visual masterpiece.Synopsis: We continue to follow the voice-cracking young Viking, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) and his dragon Toothless as their adventurous ways lead them to stumble upon a previously undiscovered dragon sanctuary, which of course must be threatened by a dragon hating bad guy.Now, is the story as strong as the visuals? Hell no! Actually, if I had any complaint at all, it would be that that story is fairly weak right up until the end of the Act 2 where things suddenly take a dark and quite attention grabbing turn. But the plot was entertaining enough to keep my attention, which means it's more than entertaining enough to keep the attention of any child and/or fan of the first installment (neither of which describes me).Final Thought: Lack of a memorable plot notwithstanding, and aside from the fact that, in my opinion, it was a strange production choice to have a movie with such a particular plot twist open on Father's Day weekend, I GUARANTEE (judging from the lackluster Disney \"Big Hero 6\" teaser trailer) \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" will win the Oscar for best animated film, based solely on its technical merits. Go ahead and quote me on that.",

            "content": "At first I was skeptical of this film. The first movie did deserve a sequel, but I thought that the trailers revealed too much and that there wouldn't be much of a film left.I was wrong.How to Train Your Dragon 2 makes bold leaps both metaphorically and literally. The movie brings the audience to new locations, reveals many new dragon species, has new characters, and explains much more about the dragon universe. Shockingly, this movie actually has a villain, unlike the first movie, and the movie still proves to be very emotional and loving.People seem to complain about the villain for being too simplistic and not well fleshed-out. I agree that he is not fleshed-out. He does need a bit more of a back story. However, I don't think he was bad. How To Train Your Dragon 2 isn't about who the villain is, the movie is about power, freedom, and how some people can't be reasoned with. Drago is bad. However, it is established that he is kind of insane and you can clearly see it. You can see through his facial expressions and his attitude that he is a very powerful person who always wants to show his dominance. His presence is actually very powerful especially when you see him take on dragons and force them into submission. He isn't a complex character, but he is very interesting. His heartlessness shows a huge contrast to Hiccup's caring. This makes him a good villain because he went through the same things as Hiccup, but ended up with a different outcome. A much different outcome. The movie makes a power hungry villain seem realistic. There are people in real-life who are power hungry. They are simplistic, but they are still very real.One of the best things in this movie (other than the great camera angles, lighting, and action) is the character interaction. The characters will actually sit around and talk like... actual people. The relationships are great because the father and mother ACTUALLY work! You can see why they got married in the first place and you can see why they had their issues, but you can tell they both love each other deeply. The same goes with Hiccup and Astrid. In the first movie their romance seemed forced, but in this movie it feels natural and realistic. There are some touching moments between characters.The mother adds to the movie significantly. You can tell she isn't quite... right in the head. She has a lot of odd moments, she is a bit strange and out of it, but you can tell she still loves her family, she just doesn't know how to express it properly. It is very rare to have an interesting motherly character in an animated movie.I thought one of the most interesting aspects of the movie was the concept of force and power. People naturally go towards the side with power, whether or not they agree with it. This makes the villain all the more terrifying because he is obviously very powerful to have an Alpha Dragon on his side.On a side note: This movie is one of the most detailed and beautiful animated movies I have seen. Generally most animated movies will have their hiccups (no pun intended) where the character's face looks a little plastic, or certain objects lack fine textures, but this movie... this movie has it all. The lighting is spectacular, the textures look amazing, and the camera angles are all fantastic looking.Overall, How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a great sequel. It doesn't tell the same story as the first film and it adds a lot to the Dragon Universe. The character's actually age, and it tells a good moral (while a bit forced at times).",

            "content": "In the summer of 2010, DreamWorks Animation released their finest feature in the form of How To Train Your Dragon, which surprised everyone with its remarkable balance between story & animation elements and remains a rollicking adventure for all ages. Surfacing 4 years later amidst enormous hype is How To Train Your Dragon 2 and how does it fare in comparison to its predecessor? Let's find out.Set 5 years after the events of the first film, How To Train Your Dragon 2 continues the expedition of Hiccup & his pet dragon, Toothless, as they embark on a new journey to discover & map unexplored lands & territories. But when they come across a secret ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons & meet the mysterious Dragon Rider, Hiccup soon realizes that a larger conflict brewing between humans & dragons and finds himself at the centre of it.Although there is no denying that unlike most sequels, How To Train Your Dragon 2 never tries to play it safe, takes the road-less-travelled, tries many new things in the process, pushes its story to uncharted places & I really admire what the filmmakers were trying to do but in the end, it comes out slightly undercooked thanks to its unpolished script that could've been benefited from a little more refinement.Like its predecessor, the animation is absolutely dazzling, the dragons are vividly imagined, designed & rendered, the camera-work is expertly handled and John Powell's score wonderfully supports the entire narrative. But unlike the last film, the humour this time feels unnecessarily forced at some stages, the new characters aren't developed at all & everything that made the previous film a genre classic doesn't blend as well this time.On an overall scale, How To Train Your Dragon 2 is an exciting follow-up to DreamWorks Animation's finest feature that has a certain amount of freshness & originality of its own, is finely directed & lively scored and despite its shortcomings, most of which arose due to my really high expectations from it, this fun-filled adventure somehow manages to deliver an entertainment that's worth your time & money.",

How to train your dragon 2 is spectacular.What I like most about the movie is the animation. The character designs are great. I especially like Hiccup whose new look help to show how much he has matured since the last picture. The backgrounds and layouts were very lively showing the full scale of the whole thing. This was great for the flying parts. Some of the new dragons in the movie were really cool to look at. My Favorite was the Alpha male Dragon, one of the best giant monsters I've seen on the big screen.The animation only complements the strong story. It feels like the Franchise has grown up with the audience since the last picture about 4 or 5 years ago. Definitely something that the whole family can root for.This is a must see for IMAX 3D",

The events in both movies take place in a mythical Viking world and revolve around the young protagonist Hiccup, son of the village chieftain and his dragon \u2013 a Night Fury called Toothless. The 2010 movie is noteworthy for its 3- D animation, imaginative illustration of dragons and dragon battles, the coming together of dragons and humans and how friendships can be forged.The sequel follows Hiccup, who is now an acclaimed dragon master, and Toothless searching for new unexplored lands. The story unfolds to reveal a dragon trapper working for a mad conqueror Drago, a whole new bevy of dragons cared for by a Valko (Hiccups Mom) and the third act is a face/off between Hiccup and Drago.The sequel boasts of even better 3-D animation than its predecessor, characters that draw you in, hundreds of different and beautifully imagined dragons and a few touching moments that can tug at your little child's heart. However some predictable moments in the movie to take it forward serve as spoilers.Sequels generally lose the plot (like Cars 2) but this one delivers all the right punches and some more.

            "content": "After watching this hugely anticipated second entry into the HTTYD series, I completely understand how Natalie Imbruglia felt in 1997: torn. On the one hand it's an entirely satisfactory family flick that has plenty going for it; on the other it can't get out from underneath the shadow of its marvellous predecessor to be a triumph in its own right. Visually, there's nothing to complain about; the high-flying sequences are breathtaking and the animation in general is vibrant, imaginative and full of detail. From a storytelling perspective though, there are some serious problems. Set five years after the rocky Dragon/Viking-uniting events of HTTYD1, we catch up with Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) as he explores unchartered parts of the world on the back of his winged companion Toothless, and ultimately stumbles into newfound danger. With Hiccup and his pals now 20 years old \u2013 technically adults, but still behaving like kids \u2013 the tone of the movie is as awkward as the age of our skinny hero, consequently stifling majority of the attempts at humour as well. A sense of narrative d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu also creeps in, with a few of the plot beats conspicuously similar to the first go round, and there's an unforgivably dull extended passage at the midway point centred on a character bizarrely voiced by Cate Blanchett. On the bright side, there is a bold final act shock that is genuinely affecting and will hopefully be the catalyst for a fresher story in the already announced third instalment. As a soaring, roaring adventure film this sequel gets a thumbs up, but as a whole package building on the original, it doesn't come close.",

It is completely unclear why the villain (who, by the way, lacks any depth beyond I'm-angry-because-the-dragons-burned-my-village) is able to control such a huge dragon as the alpha. The introduction of the alpha as a race, after seeing the dragon villain in the first movie, is also very debatable. The telepathic control that the human villain gains almost for himself is such a stretch that it's bordering inconsistency. The list could go on and on and on.",

I do realize that this is an animated film, one that revolves around vikings riding a flying dragon. But you still have to have a strong plot, one that follows what happened in the original movie. There are moments in the movie that make you think, \"Huh? Where was that in the first movie? Where did this (sub-plot) come from?\" A case in example: Hiccup's mother is alive? And she never bothered to try to come back to her family for all those years?

At first How to Train Your Dragon's trailer wasn't that good. Plus DreamWorks Studios hasn't made a great movie in a while (since Shrek in my opinion). Against all odds the first movie was actually a really good movie. And How To Train Your Dragon 2 follows in its footsteps. This time the film appears like a very adult animated movie and it goes where the original movie didn't in regards to characters and even the story, which is what a sequel must actually be doing. It's mixing an animated film genre with a very mature cinematography and direction. It's really great as I think this film is considering children as \"grown up\" people; not waiting for them to sit in a cinema and watch cool stuff happening till the end of a movie. There are lots of things going on under the surface, actually How To Train Your Dragon 2 is dealing with universal concepts such as growing up, maturing, family background, responsibilities, obligations and stepping up from the crowd in order to find our own voice. Moreover, it's good to see how Toothless and Hiccup relationship evolves. The only drawbacks of this movie I think is the villain. I was a bit disappointed by Drago's character. At first sight he is not as evil as I imagined him to be but his evilness is pulled out little by little along the movie. Beyond the fact that the score is awesome (John Powell), all the CGI aspect of the film: from characters to landscapes and dragon's action scenes are boosting the technical credit of the movie. Finally How To Train your Dragon 2 is emotionally deeper than just massively good cinematography visuals. This is a quite classical plot for an epic and drama animated movie but it's what makes the film really efficient at last. Overall, this film is exciting and has everything a great movie can wish for: great characters, great plot evolving around very mature and universal concepts, really good action scenes, well defined emotions and DRAGONS!",

            "content": "The story still focus on Hiccup, the hero from the first movie. Now, five years from the first movie, Hiccup's village Berk has already adapted to the dragons. Hiccup's father Stoick grooms him to be the next chieftain but he's reluctant at it and prefers to explore new areas. One day while exploring, Hiccup and his dragon Toothless found a band of dragon trappers, who work for Drago. Hiccup tells Stoick about it but Sroick gets afraid and seals the village. Hiccup escapes to go and talk sense into Drago about dragons. In his journey he stumbles to a masked dragon rider, who turns out to be\u0085his mother Valka. She reveals to Hiccup about a less-known alpha dragon, which all dragons obey. Stoick and friends follows Hiccup. Stoick reunites Valka, right in time when Drago attacks. Valka calls upon the alpha but to everyone's surprise, Drago brought his own alpha, which wins the battle against Valka's alpha. Thus all the dragons, including Toothless, surrender to Drago. Toothless, against his will kills Stoick with his fire burst. Drago then goes on to bring the battle to Berk. Hiccup and his band of riders get the baby dragons, the immature dragons which don't listen to the alpha yet, to Berk where he then manages to disenchant Toothless. Toothelss then challenges Drago's alpha and wins, and the alpha and Drago flees. The rest of the dragons then bow to Toothless.The base story is quite good because it gets more mature and dramatic compared to the first movie. Now the movie gets more emotional by giving not a perfectly happy ending, instead the story executes a character change from one character to another by the means of a return and death. The story design is quite nice because it's able to stand as itself without the overwhelming need to watch the first movie.Instead I found some discrepancies to some detail that will be clear especially if you've watched the first movie. For example, the story is set from the first movie, when Hiccup was still a 15-year old teenager, but the funny thing is that Hiccup's voice doesn't really change, when he should've grown an adam's apple which would've deepen his voice. Also, while Astrid gets a bit of body work in five years, Hiccup's body growth is virtually unnoticeable.But the changes offered but this installment is quite nice. About four years from it's prequel, the thing about Hiccup's mother appearing is a good thing, though it should've been predictable from her absence in the first movie.The cast is quite the same from the first movie, which is a good ensemble of actors. The new additions of voices from Cate Blanchett and Djimon Hunsou is also a good one. About Djimon Hunsou especially, he has quite an easily recognizable voice, and the character design can compensate this well enough by giving the white raced Drago dread-lock hair.The new concept of ice-spitting alphas, and the ensuing epic alpha battle, is just a great addition to keep viewers' eyes on the screen. The practical jokes of dragon behavior gets more cute and funny in this installment, having new dragons join in to the dragon roster.For me, How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score and a definite recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. It's a fun and good family movie to enjoy together.",

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2Animated Movies have changed a lot in the past decade. Pixar and Disney's reign over the industry is at and end, and Dreamworks is now a real contender. I loved the first How to Train Your Dragon, and its sequel is even more impressive. And yes, it is better than Frozen.StoryAfter the events of the last film, the Isle of Berk has been changed forever. Dragons have been fully incorporated into the Vikings' lives. Practically every character now has there own Dragon.While the rest of Berk are enjoying the benefits of dragons at home, Hiccup and Toothless (who is as cute as ever) are busy exploring the world and discovering new lands. The movie takes place five years after its predecessor and Hiccup has matured into a responsible, but stubborn, 20 year-old. Hiccup's father Stoick wants Hiccup to take over as Chief of Berk, which puts a lot of pressure on Hiccup. Some nice internal conflict to kick things off. Anyway, Hiccup and his now-steady girlfriend Astrid discover a group of dragon hunters who are working for an evil dragon hunter who controls one of the most powerful dragons on earth. His method of control: Screaming at the top of his lungs like a madman. I think this is supposed to be \"scary\" but it just comes across as funny.Hiccup also finds out that there are other dragon riders out in the world and sets out to find them. This sets off a series of events that spawn some intense action scenes and an engaging plot. Many of the scenes will send chills down your spine.There isn't much else I can say without spoiling anything. However, know that some things happen in this movie that will affect the rest of the series. The only thing I didn't like about the story was the side character development. There is supposed to be a love triangle between Ruffnut (of is it Tuffnut?) and the two other boys, whose names escape me. However, this plot line is smothered by the main story and Hiccup and Astrid's romance. All in all, the side characters don't amount to much, and they are pretty much ignored.Voice Acting/DialogueJay Baruchel (Hiccup) did a fantastic job voice acting. His voice has really matured and grown since the last film, and he is still the perfect fit for Hiccup.Gerard Butler (Stoick) does a good job as well, but I am giving the award for Best Voice Actor to Jay Baruchel.The dialogue (which is a word I cannot spell for the life of me) is perfect. I thought it was the perfect balance of childish and sophisticated. In fact, it is the wonderful script that makes this movie more mature than most other animated films. It isn't just a kid movie; It's one everyone can enjoy.Graphics/ActionNote: Since this is an animated film, I have changed the SFX category to Graphics.The visual effects in this movie are, to be frank, beautiful. The world pop with color, and when multiple dragons fly through the air, you can see every detail. Just to but the level of detail into perspective, know this: You can see practically every strand of hair on Hiccups hair. He even has stubble! The action scenes (of which there are many) are so cool. The dragon vs. dragon combat is especially great. These scenes are where this movie shines, and provide suspense and a huge sense of danger to the movie.ConclusionHow to Train Your Dragon 2 was magnificent. All the great ideas fit together well and produce a well-rounded and mature film that sparks the imagination. I give it an 8.5/10. Better than Frozen, HTTYD2 is the best animated film of 2014. I look forward to how it hold up against Big Hero 6 this fall.",

            "content": "Animated movies are not immune from the dread cinematic curse of sequelitis. Often, the desire to bring in bigger bucks at the box office results in the successive installments of a franchise fading into mediocrity. Of course, Pixar has bucked that trend with its quite spectacular Toy Story trilogy, in which each individual film stands proudly as one of the finest the medium has ever produced. But few other animation studios have managed to create sequels of comparable quality to their original big hits - until now. How To Train Your Dragon 2 is an unqualified delight, a sequel with just as much heart, ambition and sweeping emotion as its predecessor.A few years after the adventures of the first film, the once anti-dragon Viking village of Berk is now fully integrated with dragons. Hiccup (voiced by Baruchel) explores the high seas with his trusty dragon companion Toothless, partly to avoid his dad Stoick's (Butler) constant attempts to mould him into Berk's next leader. In the course of his explorations, Hiccup stumbles upon the icy hideaway of a mysterious dragon-rider (Blanchett) - one who has spent years trying to keep the majestic beasts safe from the bloodthirsty Drago Bludvist (Hounsou) and his nefarious plans to build a dragon army.Anyone who was charmed by the endlessly charming How To Train Your Dragon would approach this sequel with excitement - but also some apprehension. The first film was such a pleasant, perfect little surprise: something genuinely heartfelt, emotionally powerful and raucously funny - the kind of film we would, frankly, expect from Pixar and not from DreamWorks. It was anchored on a story at once full of innocence and depth, as a boy struggled to find his way and his voice in a world in which he doesn't belong. What story is there left to tell, one might worry, now that Hiccup has successfully bucked Viking tradition and settled more comfortably into his own skin?Plenty, as it turns out. How To Train Your Dragon 2 takes as its premise the intriguing - and very realistic - notion that growing up is a process that never ends. People evolve, as the problems and possibilities in their lives do. Just because Hiccup and Toothless found a happy ending in the first film doesn't mean their lives will be perfect from here on out. Instead, it all gets increasingly complicated, as it tends to do when one gets older and the world more complex. As Hiccup tries to evade his political responsibilities, he's called upon to open up his heart again when he realises that the aforementioned dragon-rider is none other than his long-lost mother Valka (a plot twist revealed way in advance in trailers for the film).This is actually where the film really triumphs: in allowing its characters to grow, age and mature, just as they would in real life, it unearths great insights about its characters and the human condition. There's Hiccup's relationship with his dad: much improved from years ago, but still based on Stoick never quite hearing what Hiccup has to say for himself. The almost heartbreakingly tender relationship between Hiccup and Valka is also masterfully developed: we realise that his affinity for dragons is what gave her her life's mission, which helps to soothe away much of the pain and loss stemming from her absence. Even Hiccup's ongoing love story with Astrid (Ferrera) is given room to breathe: we can easily see why they're still a great match, now that they're a few years older and no longer engaging in playground teasing and flirting.At the heart of the film is also its brave, bold decision to tell a story that confronts the pain and tragedy of loss, head-on, with no fairy-tale happy ending as we've come to expect of all animated (and many Hollywood) films. In Valka and Stoick's reunion, you can see the years of misery that stretch between them, hardly scrubbed away by a bittersweet moment in which they share a song from their past. Later on in the film comes a moment of quite spectacular drama and tension, one that has the potential to break Hiccup in two, or to turn him against his best friend Toothless. It will shock audiences, and perhaps shatter them emotionally, but its bold, emotional truth is part of what makes How To Train Your Dragon 2 such a worthy successor in the franchise.That's not to say the film is an exercise in melodramatic doom and gloom; it isn't. There's plenty of humour and sheer, unbridled joy to be found alongside its humanity - whether Hiccup is soaring through the clouds with Toothless by his side, or his buddies Snotlout (Hill) and Fishlegs (Mintz-Plasse) are vying stupidly for the affections of a largely unreceptive Ruffnut (Wiig). It's also, quite literally, a sight to behold: battle and aerial scenes, many with the heaving, swirling ocean as a backdrop, are gorgeously animated. It's easy to get the sense that this really is a full-fledged world, one that Hiccup and his audience are only just beginning to map out.If there's anything that brings How To Train Your Dragon 2 down, it's the film's villain. Drago is a frustratingly two-dimensional character in an impressively three-dimensional world, one who snarls and stomps through his scenes with much menace but hardly any depth. It makes the final act of the film - packed as it is with action sequences and stand-offs - feel a little empty.All in all, How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a fantastic example of how a story - even one geared to appeal to children - can deepen, mature and grow. It's every bit as entertaining for the kids (Toothless remains the best animated pet-kitten/puppy/dragon hybrid ever), but also allows its audiences to experience fresh challenges, joys and heartbreaks with these characters we already know and are now given the opportunity to love all the more.",

            "content": "It's 5 years later. Berk has become a dragon friendly village. While Hiccup and Astrid go exploring, they encounter dragon trapper Eret who blames them for an ice attack. A warlord named Drago Bludvist is gathering an army of dragons. Hiccup comes up with a plan to reason with the ruthless Drago. The plan goes astray and Hiccup is captured by a mysterious dragon rider. The rider turns out to be his mother Valka who has been protecting a colony of dragons including a giant Alpha which controls all other dragons except for the baby dragons. Drago attacks the colony with his own Alpha to wrest control of every dragon including Toothless.This movie does something different from other animated franchise. It ages the cartoon characters. One of the advantages of animated movies is that the characters don't have to change. That's why it's somewhat surprising that they did this. It's commendable but the franchise loses a bit of something. Part of the charm of the original is that these little kids were able to teach something to the adults. There is something compelling about little kids riding dragons. However this movie does follow some other aspects of franchise math. Mainly there are dragons that are even bigger than before. The danger is even higher. All of that works fine in this continuation of the franchise.",

            "content": "Hi everyone. This is gavin.thelordofthefuture and today's the 2nd of March which means that the third and final installment of the How To Train Your Dragon trilogy will be out in one more year. So, I'm going to review this second installment that came out almost four years ago.After the success of the original film in 2010, DreamWorks started production on the sequel. Dean DeBlois, who directed the first film with Chris Sanders, revisited the films from his childhood, My Neighbor Totoro and The Empire Strikes Back as inspirations for the film to focus on the scope, the characters, and the fun. The original voice cast including Jay Baruchel, gerald Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, T.J. Miller and Kristen Wiig returned fo the sequel along with three new additions like Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou, and Kit Harrington from Game of Thrones. Then, after finishing the design and look of the film itself, it came out to theaters and was met with critical acclaim, with praise for it's animation, voice work, action sequences, John Powell's musical score, emotional depth for the characters, and the more darker and serious tone compared to the first film. So, having loved the original, this sequel blew away my expecations and is the best animated sequel from DreamWorks since Shrek 2, Kung Fu Panda 2, and Madagascar 3.How To Train Your Dragon 2 shows Hiccup trying to take responsibility when he becomes the chief of Berk. Suddenly, a threat occurs when the new villain named Drago Bludvist sets to conquer the world and it's up to him and the other dragon riders, along with Hiccup's long lost mother, Valka, to save it.This film is a reminder of a second installment done right. It reminds me of Kung Fu Panda 2, also a great sequel to the original film, which I also loved as well. Because not only does it provide a compelling story with breathtaking flying moments that are as good as the original film, excellent action sequences and emotional moments (the flashback of Valka being taken by the dragons, the reunion of Stoick and Valka, the death of Stoick (SPOILER ALERT to those who haven't seen the film yet), Hiccup's attempts to free Toothless from the Bewilderbeast's control with the power of compassion and friendship) but it does a great job in expanding on the original film by making the new characters and villain have a connection to how the war between the Vikings and Dragons started. The new characters are great. Valka (voiced by Lady Galadriel-I mean Cate Blanchett) is a female side character done really well because of her relationship with Hiccup and their perspectives on how to create peace for all the dragons and vikings of Berk. Eret, the dragon trapper and working for Drago Bludvist, is really entertaining and while having some menacing moments, he also has some hilarious moments. And last, but not least, Drago Bludvist. Some people considered him to be a generic villain wanting to conquer the world, but to me, he's one of DreamWorks Animation's best villains since Rameses, Tai Lung, and Lord Shen. The reason why his connection to how the war between Vikings and Dragons started make sense is because his people were slaughtered by dragons is what drives him to use dragons to bring fear to other people.That being said, the rest of the film maintains the same strengths that the original film had. Hiccup continues to be relatable due to his struggles by trying to take responsibility as chief of Berk and his relationships with Toothless, Astrid, Stoick, and Valka are beautifully written. The other dragon riders Astrid, Fishlegs, Snotlout, Tuffnut, and Ruffnut weren't given as much screentime, I'll admit, but they contributed a little bit more to the plot while still providing some great humor particularly with Ruffnut, whose expressions when encountering Eret became really hilarious. Stoick, whose stubborness changed after the end of the original film, is still a great chief and shared his emotional moments with Valka perfectly while Gobber is still a funny side character. The animation continues to be beautiful from the landscapes, the even more unique character animations and movements and expressions so beautiful. And last but not least, the music score from John Powell and he did a great job. He reprises the themes from the first film while introducing new themes for the new characters, but not only that. It retains the scottish tone and provides some really strong action music writing while also being as epic, dramatic, haunting, and emotional as ever.Overall, How To Train Your Dragon 2 not only managed to be as good as the original film, but reached the mature heights for DreamWorks Animation since The Prince of Egypt. I cannot wait for How To Train Your Dragon 3! Solid recommendation to fans! :)",

            "review_title": "A visual delight, even if the story sags!",
            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a big movie \u2013 even epic.Where most animated movies these days are mousy and small, this one has a giant canvas with a visual sweep that reminds you of The Lion King and Finding Nemo. It's a fun movie to behold. The animation makes the sky into a living, breathing place without boundaries. The animators have taken the simple idea of flying through the air and made it into a roller coaster of visual delight. That's a relief in the age of TV-style directing where filmmakers think that everything has to be shot in tight close-ups. The skies here are limitless, cloud strewn and dotted with dragons of all sizes and shapes.The story picks up five years later as Hiccup (voiced again by Jay Baruchel) and his Viking community of Berk have embraced dragons and turned dragon flying into a sport. They've even taken to racing one another in a Quidditch-style sport involving live sheep. Hiccup is now is a little taller, his face a little longer \u2013 though reasonably, in five years he should have started a beard. He loves the sport of flying dragons, but it is clear that his mind is elsewhere. He wants to explore the world beyond Berk to see what's out there. So, he and dragon pal Toothless head off to find unexplored territories. What they find isn't exactly new ground, but a new problem. There are pirates out there whose intentions are deadly, and whose boss is even deadlier. Not to give too much away, but let's just say these guys are building a fearsome dragon army, and not for racing.The story is kind of beside the point. It's your standard bad-guy-wants-to-use-his-army-to-rule-the-world plot, the narrative has an heir of predictability but that doesn't mean isn't full of surprises. The best moment comes early in the film when Hiccup is flying home at dusk on the back of Toothless above a landscape of clouds. Off to his right, a wraith-like figure emerges from the clouds wrapped in bandages. It's a ghastly sight, wrapped in warrior garb with spines protruding from its head. Until we learn its identity, it is reasonable to think that it is a visitor from the land of the dead. What makes this moment so breathtaking is how unexpectedly it happens.The identity of this being will not be revealed here except to say that it opens up some of Hiccup's familial identity. It's a subplot buried in a very PC story that preaches that the best way to train an animal is to gently understand it. The movie's villain wouldn't agree. His name is Drago (voiced by Djimon Hounsou) and he is rumored to be a fearsome warrior with thousands of dragons at his disposal. There is a very effective build-up to Drago on par with Keyser Soze. He is spoken about long before we see him, hidden in shadows and legend. When we see him though he's a bit of a disappointment. He looks like a caveman and seems made up mostly of scars, sweat, hair and anger management issues. His personality is all grumbles and threats. Does he have a life of his own? There are some nice touches in the film involving the relationship between Hiccup and his village chief father Stoick (Gerard Butler) that leads to a development that is really unexpected. Yet, it might be nice to tie up Hiccup's relationship with his girlfriend Astrid. She's kind of in this movie for support \u2013 maybe in the second sequel we'll get the romance.What shortcomings this movie has story-wise is overcome by the visual inventiveness. The animators have pulled out all the stops to create dragons of every scope and size. Some dragons are as big a basketball while others are the size of a stadium. Drago has one beast at his disposal called The Alpha that could tussle with Godzilla.Now the million dollar question \u2013 will kids enjoy it? The answer: most definitely yes. There's enough visual delight here to engage their imagination and not insult their intelligent. It's not as creative as The LEGO Movie but they definitely won't be bored by it. This is the kind of movie that is a treat for the eyes as well as the heart.",

She starts off as this uber dragon queen person and then as the story goes dissolves into a bit of a nobody - except Hiccups mum. What happened to the use of her weird dragon blade weapon? Why was her Alpha so lame?Hiccup ends up as chief even though clearly he has no interest in that kind of thing?Why did the Alpha follow this nasty guy Drago?The whole intelligence level of this movie just seemed quite a few notches down on the first one.",

The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times. This film is worthy of all the hopes you have. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the characters. DeBlois has told us a moving story that won't be soon forgotten. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of a friendship between a dragon, a young man and you.",

            "content": "Like I said a couple of year ago during 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2' review, it's a terrible title for a sequel. The host, Neil Patrick also said the same thing during the 2015 Oscars. But in the digital world, slight change in the title makes random in order. I mean on the computer and web world, it won't show in order. Even sometime it might get lost in a vast number of other titles if they dare to chance the first word in the title for a sequel. Other than that they are not stupid as many people think. That's why they highlighted 'Dragon' boldly than the rest of the words.This part two was not much different to its first. The story continues five years after Hiccup recovers from his injury. He and his pet, Toothless discovers a new land during the survey for the map. So their's adventure begins, but end in a trouble and forces all his people from the town to involve and fight against the rising evil force that tries to conquer them all.Like I always say, those days are gone, now animated movies are for all ages. This was a very nicely and carefully written screenplay, did not fail to deliver. Very close to the impact the first movie made, but due to simplicity it stayed a couple of steps behind. Developed well with a bit of suspense, thrill and entertainment. Nothing more we could have asked, a perfect follow-up and hoping to explore beyond lot more in the upcoming movies in this series. Four years gap between the movies is a nice idea and fine breathing space for this franchise fan. A movie must be seen by animation fans, especially if you have already seen the first then don't miss it. 8/10",

I decided to read a book I had with me because I was bored!

Fortunately it is used many times in the film. There are some emotional punches that I won't spoil. Also, I like how the film further uses characters that have been maimed.

There were some surprising moments, and a few moments of animated magic.However, I enjoyed this sequel somewhat less. I was restless throughout the entire film, and I actually had to walk out once. It's hard to put my finger on why. Admittedly, my expectations were quite high.For one thing, this sequel was too busy, too frenetic, too fast moving, too loud, too much shouting. Somehow with this one I was more conscious of the artifice. In HTTYD1, the dragons seemed amazingly real; in this one, they seemed obviously cartoonish.The movie seemed to be about quantity rather than quality. It was the difference between a nature documentary focusing on one small group of animals, and one focusing on a herd. You don't really care about herds.I would have preferred a quieter, more focused film with mystery and magic. There was a little of that here, but this was more like an action-adventure video-game film, with even a nod to recent giant lizard movies like Pacific Rim and Godzilla. There was even shooting and chasing.I just couldn't get into the narrative. It felt convoluted and uninteresting. I groaned audibly when Valka revealed her identity (although I think she was an interesting character, well played by Blanchett). Was I right in thinking that the technology and complexity of this Viking village has increased a lot, more than seems right? In the first move, I felt like it was almost a real Viking village (after I got used to the accents).Perhaps my issues with this sequel are nothing more than the loss of the surprise factor, a problem for any sequel. I'm sorry the filmmakers did not succeed in recapturing the breathtaking originality of the first one. This was an overwrought, overdone development of a good idea rather than a re-creation. A good sequel should be watchable without having seen the original. I don't feel this was the case here.Several things in this movie downright annoyed me, eg the way Hiccup kept asking \"what's going on\" and kept calling Toothless \"bud\". I suppose that's the writing; however, I also think Baruchel was miscast. I get it: whiny, insecure, smart-alecky kid tames nightfury and becomes hero and then grows up and becomes smart chieftain. I couldn't get past the whiny smart aleck.Maybe I have to see this movie again to appreciate it properly. It's worth about 6.5 in my books.",

He finds a crazy dragon lady, a war brooding...and he wants to escape a chieftain's job. This perfect duo was sure able to capture the admiration and undivided attention of the audience; they well animated love and utter connection shown both in heart-felt and humorous fashion. Don't let the mesmerizing good looks of Hiccup fool you: He is still a wise-cracking and geeky guy hiding behind a rather fortunately well formulated puberty.The animation's handy characterisation of this trait is well done; and a worthy example of the amazing art begin the design of this film: You see Hiccup's ingenious inventions he wears on his armour: A set of handy gliders, a pouch for pencils, another paper dispenser for mapping, a compass on his arms, a multi-function blade handle which sheaths a fire-lit blade and a trigger on it for wizzle-back gas (excuse the dragon naming).The side characters, expectedly got less focus, but the film makers illustrated the pure love between Stoick and the grossly spoiled-in-the-trailer Valka (yep, Hiccup's mother) so well, they could well have a movie made just for those two. But of course, some good things never blossom. Which brings to the movie's emotion storm: GET READY FOR A EMOTIONAL RIDE. The humour of the twins, Fishlegs and Snotnout also gets a mention: The jokes out of them were not in-your-face; desperate to get a chuckle of you, but they work so well.Watch for the background: While the humans talk, the dragons play for your laughs; and watch for Toothless' cat-screech moment.This movie is also one of those few movies that can hold the 3D banner high, and be damn proud of it! A dragon movie screams 'pretty flying scenes' and this film takes full advantage of this: A solo-gliding start, a catch-up session with mum (fishing for food by the way), a few awe-striking battle scenes and of course the dragon racing. Now the music...DON'T LEAVE JUST YET. I am sickened by how movie-lovers can ignore the musical talent that is John Powell, who wrote a 90 minute long roller-coaster of a score for this. I urge you all to appreciate the frantic writing of the music behind the pretty picture and remind yourselves how music elevates the film to another level. I ask of you 5 minutes of your time: Stay back for the credits to enjoy just a snippet of the Oscar-worthy music.All in all: Get your arses into Imax and dust off a pair of 3D glasses, and enjoy this piece of Divine Masterpiece, and wait another 3 years for one final shot with HTTYD 3.",

The dragon \"Toothless\" along with his rider \"Hiccup\" are again main leads of the movie which pretty much is same thing for viewers and the ancient charm and terror of dragons are seemed to be carried away from the movies which i think is giving a new perception towards the dragons. this may effect the original and ancient terrorizing and horrific image of dragons and a new conceptual idea of dragon being a pet makes place in the viewers mind.

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014): Dir: Dean DeBlois / Voices: Jay Baruchel, Cate Blanchett, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera, Craig Ferguson: Sequel to the popular animated hit. This one regards a cruel villain named Drago who is forming a dragon army and unforgivably conquering everything and anyone in his way despite any efforts to reason. Hiccup attempts this. He is the young hero from the first film and this time he is ducking his father's urges of him becoming the next chief. While trying to locate Drago he stumbles upon a lair populated by dragons. This is where the mystery of his mother arrives, when she apparently preserved these creatures from harm's way. This leads to a rousing climax where Drago and his army war against the peaceful vikings led by Hiccip's father Stoick. Simple plot but detailed structure where Hiccup's parents meet after several years apart with the belief that she was killed by a dragon. This is an effective moment as all pain subsides to make way for memories of love and passion. Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup whose youthful nature crosses responsibility. Cate Blanchett voices his mother, Valka who ponders regret and the willingness to stand up for a cause. Gerard Butler voices Stoick whose brute authority melts upon meeting his wife after so many years. America Ferrera voices Hiccup's girlfriend Astrid. Craig Ferguson voices Stoik's closest friend who has a peg leg but no shortage of courage. The dragons are creative in their animated presentation, which should result in entertaining in the target audience engaged in its chaos. Score: 7 / 10",

            "content": "What spurned this review is that I decided to wake up on my day off and watch both the 1st and 2nd movies. I meant for them to play in the background as I accomplished real work, but they sucked me in just like they do every time I watch them, so silly of me.First off, I LOVED the 1st movie so I had high expectations for the sequel, especially after waiting so long for it to come out. And it didn't disappoint. I love that it's not just a children's movie, that it has values and ideals in it that resonate not only as a lesson for young children, but as something relatable for adults. The friendship between Hiccup and Toothless makes me tear up (which I almost never cry when watching movies). And you can watch this movie multiple times and see the many details added to the backgrounds of the main scene, like dragons messing with one another, etc. The music speaks to me...there are so many things that I'm sure I'm not mentioning, but I think you can understand I love pretty much everything about it based on my review.My only spoiler is that I was very impressed with the scar on Hiccup's chin tying into the storyline regarding why he grew up without a mother. I didn't even notice it in the first film, and so I went home and watched the 1st movie again after watching the 2nd in theaters. Details like that make me want to go back and watch everything again to see if there are any other clues that may tie into the 3rd movie. My guess is that because we got Hiccup's background in the 2nd movie, we'll get Toothless' in the 3rd.",

            "content": "I urge everyone to see this magnificent movie. It is filled with stunning, sweeping graphics and of course in-depth, emotional moments between human and dragon, but is mainly portrayed between Hiccup and Toothless. This movie is massively successful because it focuses and beautifully captures the love and friendship between the humans and dragons. Especially Toothless and Hiccups'relationship because it is defined by non-verbal communication; looks of pure affection and love for each other. The eminent message of devotion, trust and intimacy between a human and what ever it may become companioned with is perfectly portrayed. Although this is a fantasy film viewers will be able to relate to this message because every interaction between these characters replicate the interactions between a human and their dog/cat/bird etc. Every human who has mutual adoration with their companion will begin bawling because their interaction with their companion, is mirrored by Hiccup and Toothless.For example, while ascending the climax we see Toothless saving Hiccup from a icy blast from the Bewilderbeast((the Alpha dragon)encasing them. Toothless launches a plasma blow to free them, then roars to challenge the Alpha, because he wants to protect Hiccup ,no other reason. This act where Toothless selflessly leaps and throws himself in front of the blast to protect Hiccup, is similar an act of a loving dog or cat protecting its human. Yet this action was not the point where the emotion began to pour out of me like a well. It was that look Toothless gave Hiccup after freeing them of ice. That look reflected the love for Hiccup and Toothless's goal of ensuring Hiccup's safety was of the utmost importance to Toothless, nothing else. The only thing that mattered to Toothless. After this emotionally charged scene Toothless attacks the Alpha in order to protect hiccup and in the process, begins to assert himself as Alpha, by breaking the trance the Alpha ensnared the other dragons with. Eventually with the help of the other dragons, and a final plasmic blow from Toothless, does the Alpha fall and retreat. The battle scene concludes with another, extremely touching interaction between Hiccup and Toothless, with Hiccup thanking Toothless in his own way and touching his head against Toothless's. An incredible moment to slow the climax of the movie. This movie deserves every accolade it receives. Animated films usually do not receive massive amounts of awards. But it should. As you can see, I am truly blown away. The moments between Toothless and Hiccup are priceless and Their relationship could be admired by all. But for those who are companioned with a dog, cat, bird etc. there is no need for ad ration, as you already know the feeling. You were right there with Hiccup and Toothless as that relationship between them may have reflected the relationship between you, and your companion.I know it reflected mine. Also, just to add, I created this account just so I could write this review. I loved it to the extent that I needed to express it to the public.",

            "content": "oh my god! this summer's just so awesome! so if y'all don't know this, i loved \"How To Train Your Dragon\", and back in 2010 it was 3rd favorite animated movie (first being \"Alpha and Omega\" and the second being \"Toy Story 3\"). i loved the movie. so i went into HTTYD 2 all pumped and excited, but i was also a little worried if it was gonna turn out terrible, like most sequels do. thank god, that never happened. \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" is the BEST animated movie of the year so far! first of all, it's absolutely gorgeous! and the best part: it takes the incredible animation of the first movie, makes it even better and takes it to the next level. the flying scenes in this movie are incredibly stunning! like they're flying around and the camera's following them, it was so beautiful and it felt like i was up there with them. and i saw it in 3D, so my mind was literally blown away. and the CGI in this movie's definitely top notch! like there's this shot of a piece of land and a ship. it's a far away shot that looked so great, i was like \"It looks like live action. This looks like a live action movie\". but aside from the incredible animation, deep down this movie's something even more. it takes the characters we all loved in the first one to the next level, just like a good sequel should do. ya know in the first movie, Hiccup was the boy, the boy who found a dragon. in HTTYD 2, he has to become the man, the chief of Berk. this reminded of \"The Lion King\" or \"The Empire Strikes Back\". i walked outta the movie like \"This is probably \"The Lion King\" or \"The Empire Strikes Back\" of this generation\". the action's exciting, the comedy's hilarious and it has fantastic emotions. i actually cried like 3 times in \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\". this movie's not just for kids, it's also for adults. i mean, adults are gonna love this movie, cause there are themes that really hit them, and kids are gonna love the movie cause it's a fun and exciting action/fantasy movie with incredible animation and awesome dragons. and when they grow up, they'll start to understand the darker themes and emotional aspects the movie was going for, and they'll appreciate it even more. that's what i call a good sequel! another one of the great highlights in the movie, it's the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. to Hiccup, Toothless's a lot more than just a pet dragon. he's Hiccup's best friend and they really show how complex the emotional bond between a person and an animal can really be. it was perfect in that sense. the only small gripe i got with the movie, it's that Drago could've been a little better as the villain. don't get me wrong, he's still a great new character and the movie does make him better as it goes. it's just that, when he first showed up, i was like \"This guy feels kinda weak\". that's just a small gripe, it's not enough to bring the movie down. honestly, i can't think of anything bad in \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\". it's the best animated sequel from DreamWorks we have, since \"Kung Fu Panda 2\". Dean DeBlois, i really hope you win the Oscar for this movie. you definitely deserve it! you gave us one of the best sequels in a really long time. i'm telling ya, Dean DeBlois knows what he's doing in every movie he makes. he gave us \"How To Train Your Dragon 1\" which was amazing. now, he gives us \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" which is even better. i'm really excited for \"How To Train Your Dragon 3\", but i don't know how they're gonna top this one. this is the BEST animated movie of the year, and probably one of the best animated movies in a really long time. so, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it. i swear to you, you're gonna love it.10/10",

I thought the first film in the series was, and I thought there would be both deeper story and more substance and further development to the characters from the first. Well, there definitely was an attempt, but I just thought the execution failed.I try not to be too critical of movies, especially ambitious projects like this. But this movie felt rushed, and the way the problems and obstacles presented were resolved toward the climax also seemed rushed.The music of this movie is a definite highlight, but I'm afraid can't make up for a lot of the sappiness in this movie, which is found heavily in Hiccup's familial circumstances and revelations.This is definitely a wait-for-it-to-come-out on DVD or Blu Ray, if you're going to bother to see it.",

            "content": "'How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)' is technically an improvement on the first in pretty much every area, expect from the narrative. The story itself is actually quite messy, stalling in its middle section before rocketing into an unearned and kind of rushed finale. What it does better than its predecessor, however, is character. I mean, it's nothing groundbreaking but it's better. The core players aren't as flat this time, especially the father figure; he actually feels like a 'real person', as opposed to a caricature, and his actions are far more three-dimensional. There are far more scenes that rely solely on the interaction between characters, without really pushing forward the plot. Because of this, the pace seems slightly slack. There also isn't the sense of thematic integrity that the first so strongly had, which is a shame because it results in a film that doesn't really feel as though it's about anything. The violence is also bizarrely tame, especially since the feature tries to push a somewhat darker tone on the whole. The flick cuts away, essentially, every time something even remotely approaching 'bloodshed' is about to happen, which is very noticeable and reduces the impact of more than one key moment. Other than that, the action is pretty satisfying. It's high-flying and fast-paced, brought to life by animation that is, in general, much improved. The rendering, in particular, has taken a large leap forward, though there still seems to be a little something missing from behind the characters' eyes. Overall, the experience is enjoyable and, usually, comparable to that of the first flick. It isn't as tight from a narrative perspective, though, and this actually limits its emotional impact. It's certainly not a bad effort, but there are better movies out there. 6/10",

            "content": "Believe every bit of hype you hear about this film. You will be hard pressed to see a better animated feature not only the rest of this year, but in the next few to come. It does something that not only animation films strive to do; But it does something that sequels strive to do as well. That is expanding their world even further with more excitement, more lovable characters, more emotion, and an overall more enthralling story. 'HTTYD2' does that and then some. It takes off with majesty and flair, leaving all other recent animated films in the dust (Yes including 'Frozen' and 'The Lego Movie\"). This isn't a kids film. This is a film for everyone that's dying to be engulfed into what it feels like to be a kid.What makes this film so wonderful is it's emotional grip, interwoven with it's immersive visuals. There are some very real themes here about the strength of friendship, courage, and family. I was amazed at how touched by the film I was. There was at least twice in this film I was really holding back the tears. It's been quite some time, probably since \"Finding Nemo\" that I've had that type of connect with an animated feature. I think one reason for this is how strong the voice cast is. It's not easy capturing personality and being expressive while doing voice over work. And this cast does as it as well as any I've ever heard.And my oh my; The animation. It's incredibly to me what can be done with this realm of filmmaking. It's almost as if we shouldn't connect to the characters at all, because we know going in that they're 100% not real, and they can't be real. They're a cartoon. Yet we connect better with them than most human characters we meet. It's a sense of wonder. Animation also allows the 'camera' if you will, to travel to places that you could never shoot in live action. Shots soaring with dragons above the clouds, practically bringing you along for the ride. The textures of clothing, depths of colors, expressions of every character and creature; It all works perfectly. There were landscapes shots in this where the CGI totally felt gone, and I was looking at a real countryside or ocean view. It's that good.Parents take your kids to see this now. Let them be absorbed into this beautifully crafted world. This isn't a film; It's a cinematic experience. An experience fit for ALL ages. The reason we go to the movies. Can you tell I loved it? I loved it.",

            "content": "I'm going to be honest here and say that this chapter wasn't anywhere near as good as the first one, but then again that is generally what you get when you come to sequels. Maybe it had something to do with me being distracted, or maybe it was just that they were simply trying to cash in on the success of the first movie that they decided to head into sequel (and now trilogy) territory. Well, that sometimes works, and the movies were actually based on a series of books, but that does not necessarily mean that they actually follow the books all that closely (apparently they don't).Anyway, the film takes place five years after the previous film, and as we know from the end of the previous film all of the dragons moved in with the villagers and they are now part and parcel of their life. However, as Hiccup is out exploring he is attacked by some pirates, or more precisely dragon hunters, and discovers that there is this rather nefarious person out hunting all the dragons to create an army of dragons riders. Being the rather idealistic person that he is, Hiccup then decides to try and locate this fellow and attempt to convince him to have a change of heart (which we all know is going to fail abysmally).I guess this is in part a coming of age story, but then again the first movie was like that as well with Hiccup training to become a warrior, but instead of following the ways of the villagers, heading out on his own and actually changing the village for the better. This is the story that continues here, particularly since we learn that he doesn't have a mother (and even though it was never explicitly stated in the first movie, the lack of an older female figure in his life suggested that he may not have one). Of course, we also have his rather good heart, and his belief that he can change somebody through reasoning and a well founded argument \u2013 only to discover that unfortunately doesn't work.Yet even though it felt weaker than the first film, I still quite liked it. The film expanded the world somewhat, and we also discovered that there are many more varieties of dragons than what was introduced in the first film \u2013 including the gargantuan dragon who has the ability to control all other dragons in its vicinity. Of course, we have our antagonist, whose goals aren't that particularly clear, though we do know that he seems to have a chip on his shoulder with regards to dragons.In the end, even though I didn't find this anywhere near as good as the first one, it was still a really fun movie to watch, and I admit that in the end I did enjoy it.",

The creators used a new technology to move muscles and fat in subtly realistic ways. It is not just technological aspects I am talking about: pay attention to the score and how well it runs with the mood and atmosphere of different scenes. Most importantly pay close attention to the dialogue as their is some great political subtext about diplomacy when you dive below the surface level of the film. All of these subtle things help to enhance the more obvious stuff like how three dimensional the characters are, how genuine the emotions are and how awesome the action is. This is a great film in my opinion, it is an absolute crime it did not receive an Oscar,an absolute crime it only has a 7.9/10 because of book puritans and overly concerned parents, and an absolute crime this did not at least make $750 million. If you have a 3d TV or a cinema is showing it in 3d or IMAX definitely watch it that way but even in 2d it is still an awesome film. Do not dismiss this because it is animated, you will regret it. I am giving this one the instant classic award.",

            "content": "For starters, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" has a very mature and rich story that is filled with emotional and dramatic depth. It grows our characters from the first film and really feels like a continuation of the series and not just some cash grab. We see how Berk has changed and how the lives of everyone on the island has become better, I really love how the film tackles darker subject matter like remorse, forgiveness, and redemption, while at the same time touching on themes of love and loss. The screenplay is filled with moments of pure heart and we really see the bond between Hiccup and Toothless expanded upon. Not only is this a great screenplay, but also Dreamworks' best since the original \"Shrek.\" The characters and voice actors are perfect. I love how the characters have grown and their personalities have been enhanced. Hiccup takes a more proactive role in this film and we really see that he's matured a lot from the first film. His and Toothless' relationship is expanded on and it really is still the core emotional center of the film. The side characters like Astrid and Snotlout get more screen time this time around and they actually do more with the film. They aid with the comic relief to keep the movie a little lighter than the extremely dark tone that it's going for. There are a few new characters introduced into the universe like Valka, Eret, and Drago Bludvist. Valka is a great character and she's another great female addition to the roster. She has a great emotional ark and not only that, she is a strong character and a better dragon master than Hiccup that really holds her own. Eret is a nice addition to the cast as he is also comic relief, but also a interest side villain character. Drago is a fantastic villain and is really a cold hearted murderer. His method of mastering dragons really differs from Hiccups and its a great contrast that shows the different types of people that are in this world. I love how they build him up before actually revealing him.The animation and visuals are probably amongst the best I've seen from any CGI film to date. It is just breathtakingly gorgeous. The character's movements are so fluid and each character has their own way of moving. What I found really impressive is the facial animation. There are so many intimate moments in this film that require no dialogue and we can sense exactly what the characters are thinking from their expressions. There is always something happening in the foreground as well as the background and it's unlike anything that I've seen before in the medium. Characters could be taking in front of the camera, but in the background there could be an epic battle taking place. There is a lot to take in, but the director, Dean DeBlois, knows how to balance the visuals with well paced story. The layout and environment are also quite impressive. Every blade of grass, powder of snow, and water particles are just amazing to look at.The score from John Powell impresses again and really enhances the already great score of the series. It's bombastic, epic, touching, and moving. There is something about the score that really makes the film so much better than it already is. I was literally left in tears because of the score and how beautiful it is.I'm gonna come out and say it. \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is a MASTERPIECE amongst modern films and a revolution in animation. It is a film that is going to push animation further and allow the medium to be taken more seriously. For a major studio production, it goes to places that the medium has only thought of, but couldn't really pull it off because of limitations set by studios and audiences alike. It is almost a near perfect film and I award it the highest 5/5 that I can.",

Basically, it has been five years since dragons and Vikings on the island of Berk were united by the influence of Hiccup (This Is the End's Jay Baruchel) and his dragon friend Toothless, the villagers now live among the dragons and use them for everyday life. The island's new favourite sport is dragon racing, challenging against Astrid (Ugly Betty's America Ferrera), Snotlout (Jonah Hill) and the rest of the gang the now inseparable pair journey through the skies, exploring new worlds and charting unmapped territories, and one of these adventures leads them to a secret ice cave, home to hundreds of wild dragons and a mysterious Dragon Rider. Hiccup and Toothless find themselves caught in the middle of what will become a battle to keep peace between the dragons and the humans, and what it makes it more complicated is that the Dragon Rider reveals herself to be Valka (Cate Blanchett), Hiccup's mother who was thought to be dead after being taken by a dragon, in fact she stayed with them, learning more about their skills and abilities, and staying away to protect her son and husband Stoick (Gerard Butler). The battle really takes flight when insane conquerer Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou) wants rule of all the dragons, using the gigantic Alpha dragon called a \"Bewilderbeast\", which hypnotically controls the smaller dragons, including at one point Toothless who controlled killed Stoick, the baby dragons cannot be controlled, Drago wants to use dragons to destroy the kingdom and take over. With the help of Valka who knows everything about the ways of the dragons, and his friends, Hiccup goes into battle against the villain, defeating him with him and the Bewilderbeast going into the ocean, and in the end Hiccup becomes the new king of Berk and peace returns to the island, dragons and humans are once again united and work together to protect the kingdom. Also starring Craig Ferguson as Gobber, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fishlegs, T.J. Miller as Tuffnut, Kristen Wiig as Ruffnut and Kit Harington as Eret. Young dragon-whisperer Hiccup and the other characters are still likable, Toothless is still lovably cute, I'm not sure if the story is as good as previously, but it is pleasant and easy to follow, and the special effects do make for exciting and terrific scenes, a watchable family animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Feature Film and Children's Award, BAFTA Kids Vote - Feature Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film.

If not quite as memorable as number 1.Like the original, \"How to train your dragon 2\" has amazing special effects, imaginative action, and a heartfelt story. Its a lot soppier than the first flick, so you should maybe bare that in mind if your going in expecting a funny cartoon. I wasn't expecting a lot of jokes this time I guess. After all, the first film was more about its story, and heart. Though its still 2 steps from greatness, because it isn't quite as inventive, or as ambitious as the first. Nor does take some of its great ideas just that little bit far enough.There's a much needed villain thrown into the mix, who really adds a new element to the movie, which also has some twists and turns that will at least surprise the kids at which its aimed.

            "content": "In this sequel to the 2010 smash hit, Hiccup and Toothless discover an ice cave that is home to even more dragons and come face to face with a villain who is amassing a dragon army. This time around, as is typical with sequels, they up the ante and the stakes are raised. There's even more dragons and not only that, but there's also a greater variety. But more importantly, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2 has the same charm and heart that made the first one so enjoyable in the first place. We get a deeper look at Hiccup's relationship with his father, and he also meets and bonds with his long-lost mother who turns out to be a kindred spirit. All of the supporting cast is back, too, and funny as ever. My favorite running gag was Astrid continually being smitten by a dragon trapper, Eret (voiced by Kit Harington). Sadly, though, the villain was rather weak in terms of motivation and his actual presence in the film. He wasn't introduced properly until about halfway through, and the way in which he was defeated was a bit cheesy, making him seem like somewhat of a pushover compared to the villain in the last one. However, despite the weakness of the central conflict, there are some resonant themes which are explored. The primary one, and one which has been done before in other films, is that of finding your true self. Hiccup is torn between his father naming him as his successor and living a free life with the dragons like his mother. More relevant to the central conflict is the struggle for peace when those opposed to you have their minds set on war. Hiccup remains an idealist for much of the running time, but ultimately discovers that occasionally you do have to fight for what you believe is right. Both of these messages should appeal to the demographic this movie is aimed at, especially the first one. The film also takes a rather poignant turn in the third act (which I will not spoil) that should have people reaching for their handkerchiefs. Overall, this sequel, while not quite living up to its predecessor in terms of the central conflict, is still a rollicking, fun time for kids and adults alike. If you saw and liked the first one, there's not a reason I can think of that you wouldn't feel the same here.",

(I'm referring to Brave) This is one of the best, if not the best, of all the films they've put out. Don't expect this to wrap everything up though, because just like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, this isn't a sequel, but rather act 2 of a 3 act story that you have to watch in order. Fans of the book series may be dissapointed to learn however, that just like the first film, its completely different from the books. This is also not the same formula that Dreamworks has used for \"Shrek\" and \"Madagascar.\" Unlike those films this has a darker, more serious tone and is definitely anything but cookie cutter. I'm optimistic that \"Dragons 3\" will not be Dreamworks milking a dead cow, but rather making a fresh cut of prime rib out of it.\nGrade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars",

            "content": "My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)I missed the theatrical release of the first How to Train Your Dragon film in 2010, but I eventually saw it on DVD, and I loved it. It has since become one of my favorite animated films, and one of my all-time favorite films in general, and, in my opinion, it is a completely flawless film. So, naturally, I was a bit apprehensive when I found out that they were going to make a sequel. Not so surprisingly, I didn't think How to Train Your Dragon 2 was as good as its predecessor, but it is still a good movie.The film is set five years after the events of the first film. Instead of killing dragons, the Vikings of Berk now welcome dragons into their village. The chief, Stoick the Vast, plans to retire soon and have his son, Hiccup (now twenty years old), take his place as chief, and even Hiccup's girlfriend, Astrid, thinks he has great potential for the job\u00ad. Hiccup, however, prefers flying around with his dragon Toothless and mapping new lands, and is rather averse to his father's wishes. One day while out exploring, Hiccup comes across a group of dragon catchers, who work for an evil warlord, Drago, who wants to assemble a dragon army. Hiccup, against his fathers orders, sets off to try and peacefully reason with Drago, but is waylaid by the mysterious Dragon Rider, Valka (voiced by Cate Blanchett), who turns out to be Hiccup's thought-to-be-long-dead mother.How to Train Your Dragon 2 is, for the most part, an example of a sequel done right. It further develops and expands upon its universe and underlying themes, and it actually takes the story in a new direction rather than essentially repeating that of the first film. Also, while it's still fun, endearing, and family-friendly like the first film, it's also darker and more mature, and a bit more complex. It doesn't shy away from some dark themes, such as war and death, and it doesn't have that feeling that everything is inevitably going turn out alright in the end. There are even few good twists in the film's third act (which I found to be the most emotionally powerful part of the film).The first HTTYD film was a simple and straightforward but extremely touching story about friendship, loyalty, acceptance, and family. Its emotional core consisted of the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. This relationship is still crucial to the story in HTTYD 2, but it takes a back seat until the film's third act. The primary core of this film consists of a couple different elements. One of them is the reuniting of Hiccup's family. The other, more important element is the coming of age element. Yes, more than anything else, HTTYD 2 is a coming of age film for Hiccup.The animation in this film, as expected, is spectacular. The characters, dragons, and scenery are excellently designed and visually pleasing, and the flying and aerial battle scenes are very good as well. John Powell, who composed the fantastic soundtrack for the first film, has returned and composed it for this film as well, and he still did a very good job. The soundtrack even contains a very good song that ais worth mentioning: 'Where No One Goes'. Also, the voice acting is very well done, especially Jay Baruchel as Hiccup.Unfortunately, while I thought the first film was flawless, I cannot say the same about this film. This film has some pacing and plotting issues, a few contrived moments, a one-dimensional villain, and some underdeveloped supporting characters (the main characters are well developed, though, especially Hiccup). Additionally, the film is a bit weaker than the first film in terms of comedy, and a few of the comedic moments fall flat. Nonetheless, the film does have several humorous moments that do work.Despite its slightly messy pacing and plotting, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is, in my opinion, a good sequel, and a good film for anybody of any age, and I'm glad I got to see it in the theater (twice \u2013 and I actually liked it a little better the second time). It is emotional, heartfelt, and humorous in areas, with some strong messages about family, friendship, forgiveness, loyalty, coming of age, and living to one's potential. Kids will enjoy it as long as they can handle some of the darker and more mature content. There is also plenty of content in the film for adults to enjoy. HTTYD 2 is one of my favorite films of the year so far, and it may very well end up being my favorite animated film of 2014 \u2013 if nothing else, I hope it receives a nomination for Best Animated Feature.",

HTTYD2 was a worry, but that turned out to be completely unfounded.The sequel took the characters and concepts of the original and cranked up the maturity. The characters have all aged, the children now adults and the adults graying and although not all of the children seem to have matured mentally, they are more or less forced to by a twisted turn of events that left almost everybody I know in tears. Its as if the original tested the waters to see what they could do and get away with, and this film took that idea and ran with it into the worst possible emotional direction in the movie's climax. As movie audiences, we are much more used to seeing villains killing the good guys, but when its one of our own - the one we love the most and suspect the least - it carries with it an enormous impact and it leaves us wondering what Dreamworks could possibly do in the third installment that could top both the tragedy (and triumph) of this sequel. The sequel simply cant top the original in my eyes, but it is by far best sequel to any movie that I have ever seen, and plenty of people rate the sequel even higher than the original. The emotion alone is enough to earn itself a permanent place on my favorite movies list, especially the bond between Hiccup and Toothless that has grown to an extent that is literally undefeatable. Once you have fallen in love with these characters in the first movie, you cant watch the sequel without feeling a whole lot going on in your heart - from stomach dropping lows, to heart pounding highs.",

            "review_title": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is flat-out great film, period.",
            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a textbook example of how to do a world- building sequel just right. It expands the world established in the first film, with new characters, new worlds to explore, and new mythological tidbits, but nonetheless concentrates on telling a complete story centered on its main characters. It reunites audiences with their favorite heroes but makes it very clear that these people have changed since the last film and will change by the time the credits roll. And most importantly, in terms of a successful sequel, it is a flat-out terrific motion picture. It is a visual dazzler and an emotional powerhouse, taking the established world in interesting new directions while remaining rooted in real character growth.This sequel picks up five years after the first film, which means that the new status quo at that film's conclusion has settled into what amounts to the \"new normal\" for the people (and dragons) of Berk. The young heroes of the first picture are now young adults, and it's a bit of a shock to see an animated film featuring realistically aged protagonist, as most animated franchises tend to involve talking animals that don't necessarily undergo physical transformations in between installments. After two eye-popping airborne prologues, which reintroduces our old friends and reaffirms the peace that Hiccup brought about by ending the human/dragon conflict, we get down to business.The plot is pretty straight forward, eventually dealing with a long- forgotten tyrant (Drago Bludvist, voiced by Djimon Hounsou) who believes dragons are monsters meant to be enslaved and used as weapons against those he might oppress. He isn't quite as complex an antagonist as those found in the Kung Fu Panda films, but his quest for power is merely a means to an end for Hiccup and friends to make other more interesting discoveries. Chief among those discoveries for the world of Berk is that there are many more dragons and dragon riders out there in the world. Chief among those discoveries for Hiccup is that there is a mysterious woman who has spent her life freeing captured dragons and caring for them in what amounts to a dragon sanctuary; a woman who is quickly revealed to his presumed-dead mother.Cate Blanchett is unafraid to play this dragon caretaker as just a little unhinged, as befits someone who has cut themselves off from humanity for two decades, and it gives what could have been a standard family reunion a real edge. As Hiccup comes to terms with this revelation, he in turn realizes that he may share more in common with the mother he never knew than his proud and loving father. DreamWorks Animation sequels have all dealt with family revelations in one form or another. This one is no different. While Kung Fu Panda 2 for example dealt with Po coming to terms with being orphaned by violence, How to Train Your Dragon 2 deals with how much of Hiccup's personality quirks and beliefs came from his parents versus those he might claim as his own. The story allows Hiccup to make mistakes and allows every character to have a relevant point-of-view about the conflicts at hand.While the focus is squarely on Hiccup, this is the kind of sequel that establishes what a wonderful ensemble the filmmakers have developed over two films (and the television series, natch). Hiccup and Toothless are separated from rest of the cast for much of the second act, which allows the other characters, especially Astrid, to have their own moments in the sun. Astrid and Hiccup have a wonderfully relaxed chemistry, as the fact that they are now lovers is handled with minimal fuss (their most romantic moment involves Astrid doing a killer impression of her boyfriend's agitated worrying). Like the also-superb Kung Fu Panda 2, this is a sequel that remembers that it is a sequel, so in place of comic antagonism is mutual respect and fondness among this core group of friends and family.That makes the eventual escalation of conflict all the more powerful, and there is a second act story turn that is heartbreaking while remaining utterly logical. I wish the ramifications of said character/plot turn wasn't somewhat tidied up by the end, but that's the price to be paid for a film that leaves no hard loose ends for the third film. Nonetheless, the picture ends all of its major characters in a very different place from where they started, and I trust this film making team to pick at the emotional scabs two summers from now. Moreover, in terms of franchise building, this is a series that I can't wait to see the next installment for not because I know what's coming but rather because I have no idea what to expect.Writer/director Dean DeBlois, with the aid of production designer Rebecca Huntley, has pulled off a real gem. This is a glorious adventure picture, a sterling sequel that expands the mythology while telling a mostly stand-alone tale that is unafraid to take real dramatic risks. It is an audio-visual wonderland, with wonderful vocals from all parties (Gerard Butler is terrific as the proud but not-entirely predictable patriarch), a fine score from John Powell, and a towering sense of visual wonderment. This is the kind of triumphant film making that ennobles so-called blockbusters. How to Train Your Dragon 2 isn't just a great sequel, a great animated spectacle, or a great example of successful franchise-expansion/world-building. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is flat-out great film, period.",

It had the spirit of Brave and the heart of Frozen, not the frozen heart, but you know what I mean. It really gave it a more lifelike feel and mood. Great job maintaining the charm of the characters we love. Finally, Toothless gets his moment to shine and Hiccup gets out of his awkward stage. They are definitely not kids anymore and their maturity creates a great loop hole to get out of those gaps in the plot. Also, the element of surprise is back which was the reason we all loved the first one. Can't wait for the final installment of the series soon to come. Hope you love it as much as I did!",

            "content": "How To Train Your Dragon 2, which is directed by Dean DeBlois, is the story of Hiccup, now at the age of 20, and the growing bond between him and his dragon Toothless. I think this is a great film for many reasons. First, this is probably the best cinematography I've seen in an animated film. The action is great, and aesthetically speaking, this movie would definitely get a 10/10. This movie really illustrates the growing bond developing between Toothless and Hiccup, and how they can't take each other for granted. This movie also portrays Hiccup's maturity, as opposed to 5 years ago. Hiccup is starting to realize that he can't be the chief his father wanted him to be, and that he'll never replace someone so selfless, caring, and brave. This movie really has a lot of heart. It delves into themes like responsibility, dealing with loss, loyalty, and peace. How To Train Your Dragon 2 builds upon its predecessor, and exceeds it by encompassing the virtues of a true chief. How To Train Your Dragon 2 is definitely worth 5 watches, and I'd highly recommend checking it out.",

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon is widely regarded as one of the best animated films ever made by Dreamworks Animation. As usual, it's about time that we get another sequel for this box-office hit. The big question is: Will it succeed and turns out better than its predecessor? Well, it's a definite yes, and this film will definitely soar and wins the hearts of many.The sequel reunites us with the village of Berk and its people, comes with a darker tone and emotional heft this time around, which puts the unusual friendship formed between the lead, Hiccup and his Night Fury dragon, Toothless to the test. It focused more on world building to expand its story, explains the nature and hidden abilities of the dragons, other than plot and character development. Aside from that, Hiccup needs to learn to take responsibility for his Viking clan, as his father, Stoick decides to hand over his position as Chief Of Berk to him. While the film does have its serious moments, it also retains its predecessor's fun action-adventure style with clever witty dialogue as well. The film is visually appealing, its CGI effects were improved and better this time around. The flying sequences with Hiccup and Toothless, together with the film's score, were spectacular than ever before. Toothless remains adorable and would certainly manage to charm both adults and children alike. The film also introduces new breed of wonderfully coloured dragons, each of them comes with a personality and manage to create an impression to the viewer despite their brief appearance in the film.The film's emotional moments...notably the arc between Hiccup and his long-lost mother, Valka, as well as the heartwarming reunion between Stoick and Valka after so many years apart from each other were done in a remarkably poignant manner that captures your heart...together with the unexpected, surprising and deeply affecting twist near the climactic third act, this film managed to bring me to tears not once, but twice.The film loses none of the heart that's previously established by its predecessor. It's simply outstanding on so many levels that it's completely worthy of praise. It's a thrill ride that's both entertaining and moving at the same time. If you love and enjoy the first film, then I guarantee you will love this sequel. It's one of the best animated films of the year.Rating: 8.5/10 For more reviews: http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014",

            "content": "I had no desire to go and see this, but since Hercules was no longer showing this is what I went to see. This time, 5 years after the first which is the most disgustingly overrated animated movie of all time, Hiccup and company team up to fight a laughably unscary villain and discover more of the HTTYD universe. This is like many sequels: Darker (blame The Empire Strikes Back), more complex and bigger. The first was pretty underwhelming so how would this turn out? The answer is OK. What impressed me about How To Train Your Dragon 2 was how it managed to do what a sequel should in a relatively short run time. It's darker, it ups the stakes, it's bolder, it's bigger, it goes in a new direction and the characters have changed as well. It takes the first and turns it up to 11. The animation is stunning, showing it's not just Pixar who do great visuals while some of the plot is memorable. The death of the Viking chief in the middle is unexpected and powerful, while some of set pieces offer some thrills.So what didn't I like? Pretty much everything I didn't enjoy in the first one. The fictional universe is decent and beautifully rendered, but what sets it back are the characters. Hiccup has been seen many times before and has zero chemistry with his bland and irritating love interest. Aside from Hiccup's mother, all the others are either flat our plain irritating. The script is often flat and unengaging, the film is stupendously unfunny and it has generic written all over it. It's just another DreamWorks mediocrity vehicle with little to distinguish it from the other 500 kids movies out there. This may be because I'm so uninterested in the whole HTTYD world, but for me this was a strictly average sequel which never really soared and without a doubt one of the more lacklustre experiences I've had in the cinema in 2014. Like the first, it's also too montage based and feels rushed and brief. It's not a terrible film and as critics seem to enjoy animated clich\u00e9 fests (How To Train Your Dragon, Megamind and Bolt I'm looking at you) and children will probably be entertained most will likely find this passable. But for me, it only took off in the second half. Too little, too late.6/10",

It's definitively not meant to just cash-in on it - it has a very good plot, the animation improved quite a bit and they were able to make it just as much fun as the first one. And in some areas they even surpassed it by adding more dramatic elements, moments which reminded me of the old animated movies from my childhood like Lion King or the Land before Time. So all in all it's a polished and well executed production. The only 2 things that bothered me a bit were that the plot doesn't fit as smooth as you'd like to see it in a sequel and Baruchel's voice, which was a perfect fit for the first one, is too close to the awkward teenager and doesn't really help to make the transition to the young adolescent Hiccup is supposed to be in this one.",

The story was so well developed that it was hard to guess exactly what was going to happen. You will try to not cry twice and blubber the third as the story tugs at your heart as you feel the love and the pain the characters feel for each other. Thankfully there is just the right amount of comedy at the right moment to bring the movie out of depression and back to joyfulness. After one of the climaxes, I was terrified that they were going to do a cliff hanger and was begging in my head that they were not going to end the story at that point and it was going to continue. I spent the entire movie trying to see everything that has happening with the main actions in the scenes as well as the very active characters in the back ground. I have never watched the movie where I was paying more attention to the background than the speaking characters but you will find that both are wonderful to watch and that it is easy to know what is being said and be able to watch the back ground. 3D was wonderful, it wasn't a lot of objects flying at you but it brought you into the world and made you feel like you were flying the dragon coming around the corner. like the clouds were flying past you as you were on dragon wings.

            "content": "This movie is great in many ways. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking. The dragons are cute and powerful. The dragon battles and flying scenes are amazing. The character designs fit perfectly with everything about each character. Hiccup now has designed an arsenal of awesome dragon related tools including his own wings and a flame lightsaber (don't worry, it's explained well).In a deeper way, this movie has many great aspects. The movie takes place 5 years after the first one, making Hiccup 20. Early on, you find out that Astrid and Hiccup are engaged. They're relationship doesn't get much screen time but the screen time it does get is well used. They really only spend 2 moments being \"couple-y\". In the first, Hiccup and Astrid discuss whether he will become chief of Berk as his father now wants him to be. They have a healthy, good discussion that is a great model for real couples. Absolutely brilliant. Later on they have a stereotypical \"We Won\" kiss scene at the end but it's still quite sweet and cute. As far as the other teenagers from the first movie, they seem to all be infatuated with the apparently sole other teenage female in Berk (with the exception of her twin brother, of course). This is weird, forced, and unnecessary throughout the whole movie. I'm not really sure why it was there and than that it was kind of funny (but this movie had much funnier and less questionable moments so this seemed a waste). This is the first of my three complaints about this movie.The other relationship we see a lot of in this movie is Valka, Hiccup's mother, and Stoic, Hiccup's father. They are also sweet and cute. This relationship is really well done throughout the whole movie. But, after a really epic battle scene between Stoic and Drago Bloodfist (the antagonist, if the name didn't give that away), Stoic is killed...by Toothless while Toothless is under the mind control of a crazy super dragon who was under the control of Drago. Maybe I didn't see the meaningful reason for Stoic's death, but to me it seemed like a lazy way to force Hiccup to become chief at the end of the movie (which, had they decided to keep this plot line up to the standards of the rest of the movie, could have been resolved without Stoic's death and with much more reflective growth on the part of Hiccup). This is my second and biggest complaint.My final complaint is that it is never really explained how Drago can control the Alpha dragon which controls all other dragons. It is vaguely suggested that he does it through intimidation and fear but how he could control the beast that dwarfs the thing at the end of HTTYD1 isn't really elaborated on.This movie has a lot of meaningful elements in relation to Hiccup and his parents, and the nature of control (which of course, because the movie is good, rails against it). In the end, Toothless, after having defeated the Alpha and become super over powered, is the new leader of all dragons and decides to liberate them. The movie is good and a lot of fun but seems to be lacking in a few key areas. Naturally, as the second part in a trilogy, it felt highly incomplete. Definitely worth seeing but might leave you conflicted",

            "content": "Releasing on June 14 of this year, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" had some very big shoes to fill, following up to its 2010 predecessor. The first film, I thought, was a very rare gem; a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy in equal measure. It had action, it had humor, it was beautifully animated, the cast was amazing, and the score was absolute perfection. To say that I was looking forward to this film was an understatement; this was actually one of my most anticipated of the year. And thankfully, this film met my expectations and then some.First off, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is not just another installment to the franchise; it is a superbly written tale that can easily stand on its own. You do not need to have seen the first film to understand what is happening, and you could actually view this as a standalone film. This is what I always look for in sequel films that are not based off of books. I love seeing a movie that can be its own, without depending on the audience being up to date on every event leading up to a certain point. Just like last time the cast is Stellar, and I could probably write a five page paper on just why the soundtrack was amazing. But I will spare you the details and simply say that this is one I am going to try and get off of Amazon around Christmas time. This is one of those movie scores that cannot be enjoyed enough when watching the movie. This is one that is great for almost anytime. The score alone could carry this film, but the story and animation were just as good.I have taken a semester of 3D animation in high school, so I know firsthand how difficult it can be to make an object move the way that you want it to. That being said, this film's effects are flawless. From the mesmerizing dragon flights to the intimate character moments and even the grand scale battles, this film demands viewers to look for even the slightest details and be wowed. I will say one of the two nit-picks I actually do have with this film is that I would like to see a few more traditional, European, styled dragon. Just saying\u0085Finally, the last part of the film that I would like to comment on is the story. So many times a sequel will sacrifice story in favor of bigger and better effects (I am looking at you \"Transformers\" series). However, this film managed to take a common story thread and combine it with enough unique moments and characters that it felt new and exciting. It also had one of the absolute saddest moments I have seen in theaters all year. I will not spoil it here, but it was so effective that I have heard stories of teen girls who actually left the theater they were crying so hard. This, however, does lead into my second nit-pick. After the tear wrenching moment, the story does pull out a few very kid friendly jokes that felt badly placed. But thankfully, they do not demean the traumatic moment enough to ruin it. This event does impact the rest of the film, and I was glad to see it be more than just another throwaway sad moment at the movies. From it flawless animation to the way it did not sugarcoat its more mature themes, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is one of the best films of the year. The traumatic moment in the film was not simply brushed over; it played a huge element throughout the rest of the film, and I was very, very pleased with this. The story was superb, the animation was breathtaking, and the finale of this film was THE best I have seen since the start of 2014. Not even Godzilla breathing radiation was as exhilarating as watching Toothless prove that he is one of the greatest dragons in cinema history. This film deserved every moment of the applause it received when the end credits rolled, and my only regret is that I did not see it twice in the theater.I give this movie a 9.75/10.",

            "content": "If the first \"How to Train Your Dragon\" was an endearing introduction to the world of Vikings and dragons, the sequel is a full-throated immersion in the same. At this point the Vikings of Berk have fully adopted the dragons into their lives and lifestyles. They race them, play with them, and they're all basically family members. Hiccup is back, of course, as a hero for the Berkians who is settling into a minor existential crisis as the prospective Chief-in-waiting, a job he doesn't particularly seem to want. In fact he's happier exploring the outer reaches of his realm and mapping out as-yet unseen lands with his presumed lady-love, Astrid. These adventures bring him into contact - and, ultimately, conflict - with dragon hunters lead by the evil (and somewhat ironically-named) Drago Bludvist who essentially holds dragons hostage, fearful to do his bidding. As expected Drago - who seeks ultimately to control and/or eliminate all dragons - is on a mission to confront Hiccup - rumored to be, somewhat like Drago himself, a \"dragon master\" and ultimately control his dragons and head to Berk to finish them and him off. This leads of course to the biggest action sequences and conflicts between Hiccup - who only seeks peace - and Drago, who seeks anything but.Most of the more important plot elements are spoilers so for the sake of this review I won't elaborate on them but suffice it to say the action is excellent, the story compelling, and the results of this second outing just about perfect. Following up on what was really a fine, wonderful introduction to this universe of uber-macho Vikings and a wild variety of dragons with the first of this series, \"HTTYD#2\" proves to be a worthy successor, a fun, entertaining punch and joyous ride - on a dragon, no less.",

Moreover, I love animation movies so that was another reason. This movie had enough exposition in the beginning of the movie to explain what mainly happened in the first movie, so I didn't have much questions about what had happened previously when I started watching the sequel. The opening scene was really amazing. It kind of set the tone for things to follow. The animation is really fantastic! It's not a realistic animation, it's a cartoonish one. But I'm not complaining\u0085I'm appreciating! Some of the picturesque scenes look awesome because of the animation. Even the different kinds of dragons shown are very appealing. This is definitely one of the best and most beautiful animation movies ever. The voice-over is simply brilliant. Each voice suits the character in the movie perfectly. The main characters, namely Hiccup, Valka, Stoick and Drago are very likable and appealing . The supporting cast aren't that appealing except for Astrid and Eret, who were magnificent. The emotional quotient is very high in the movie. The attachment between a dragon and it's rider is shown in a very realistic and believable way. SPOILER ALERT \u2013 BEGIN The first half of the movie was pretty good. Story was moving along nicely. And then in the 2nd half, a very tragic incident happens. Hiccup loses someone close to him, because of Drago. And surprisingly, though Hiccup is very grieved about losing that \"someone\", still he doesn't seem to have ANY anger towards Drago. This kind of made me angry. Any character in such a situation would be very angry. After this incident, I just lost interest in the character of Hiccup. I felt that instead of a man, that character was a loser. Even in the climax, when confronting Drago, still Hiccup was talking about peace, to a murderer. It seemed very ridiculous. Apart from this, the ending seemed bit unrealistic. The good guys seem to win bit too easily. Wish it could have been more dramatic and exciting. SPOILER ALERT \u2013 ENDThough I'm very disappointed with the 2nd half, still the movie has lot of things to be enjoyed and feel good about. But somehow, now I'm not that interested in watching the sequel to this.",

Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), still the most oddly named viking ever, and his trusty dragon Toothless have expanded the map of the surrounding lands, finding new lands and dragons for the village to enjoy. Yet new threats lurk around the corner as Hiccup and Astrid (America Ferrera) come across dragon trappers working for a mysterious warlord.What How to Train your Dragon 2 gets extremely right is avoiding the usual sequel clich\u00e9s. The story is entirely new, not just the original with a new villain, there are no aggravating wrinkles in the romance, no old problems resurfacing. The world of Berk has evolved due to the events of the first film and the characters have grown during the five years. Immensely satisfying and all of the characters, dragons included, still feel familiar and identifiable, yet you can see time has passed.The technical aspects are also once again topnotch. The flying scenes are amazing, the world is full of details and nuances, the facial expressions look believable and smooth and even the 3D doesn't detract from the experience like it usually does. The score is also very impressive and supports the film perfectly. Some really hauntingly beautiful and/or uplifting melodies.All that being said, it's not a perfect film. I applaud the film makers for having the guts to forward the story and take it to new directions, but it still has a few kinks. There are a few plot twists I could see coming miles away because they were foreshadowed so heavily and awkwardly. In addition, the villain is pretty weak. Djimon Hounsou gives him a lot of presence with his voice, but overall he's not that interesting of a character. His motivations are pretty see-through, his plan is clich\u00e9d and full of plot holes, and even his design is pretty basic.On the other hand Cate Blanchett's character is superb. Warmhearted, capable, beautiful, a little kooky, wise, everything the character needed to be to shine. The scenes between her and Hiccup are easily the best in the film and I truly appreciated her inclusion, even though beforehand I had dreaded her based on the trailers. Fortunately I was proved wrong.How to Train Your Dragon 2 doesn't quite reach the level of its predecessor. The first one had a tighter story and the novelty on its side. Its sequel is still one of the best Dreamworks films made to date and pretty much guarantees a sequel, which is great.",

And how it showed that while not all people can change for the better, and some battles just can't be won, it is always worth the effort to reach out to others and fight for what you care about. There were also a lot of cute and funny scenes that I really enjoyed.What bothered me about this movie was that some of the minor characters seemed - I don't know, shallow? For instance, Ruffnut, Tuffnut, Fishlegs, and Snotlout only seemed concerned with getting a date the entire movie. Their characters were SO flat compared with how they were in the first movie. Even the evil trapper guy showed more personality than they did.It also seemed rather far-fetched that the villagers would accept the events at the end of the movie so easily, without acting more confused. I mean, this guy just showed up without warning with an army of dragons, and announced that their chief was dead. And then Hiccup shows up and wins back the support of all the dragons, and becomes chief. That's a lot to take in.I'd also hoped this movie wouldn't be so dark and violent. I know it's meant to show the trials of growing up and taking on a leadership role, but it was still a very dark movie, especially for Father's Day.But besides these things, this movie was awesome. The song that Hiccup's parents shared was very cute and really showed how much they loved each other, even after being apart for so many years.I hope that there's another movie after this one. I really want to see how Berk fares under Hiccup's leadership. I love the dragons and the setting of these movies, and I hope we get to see more of them. :)",

Frankly, this is not as obvious as DeBlois may like, but it is good to hear animation advancing... within a decade, perhaps the line between animation and real life will be blurred.The overall story here does not seem quite as strong as the first, though it does add two important elements to the story. One, it expands the world of Hiccup. Apparently not much, as they seem to travel to different areas quickly, but this still opens the story up to more possibilities, including possible spinoffs.And two, it balances the message of peace from the first film. Although the first film's idea not to see others as enemies is a very important and timeless message, there will also always be that evil inside people that just never listens to reason. Folks like Hitler (to use the classic example) could only be stopped by force, not reason. Such a character is introduced here, adding to the overall mythos of the Vikings.Where will the story go from here? We eagerly await the next installment.",

It has a lot of things that only adults would get, but it is a good movie none the less for your kids to see. The only thing that I would have against this movie, if i was being picky is that I do not like hiccups's character's voice. The actor behind that voice really irritates me. But that's just because I am not a fan of that actor. But the movie is wonderful and I have already pre-ordered my blu-ray. everyone should watch this!I did not feel like there was much drag time in the movie, some scene could have been taken out but it all served to the story and did not feel like a waste of time to me. This is definitely one of the top 3 animated films that have been release so far. And probably in my top 5 movies of 2014. That is how good this movie is. Story is strong. Characters are strong. Dragons are awesome and Animation is superb.",

The plot is just marginally entertaining in the first half, and I was very annoyed by the woman who is portrayed to be a nymphomaniac which I thought was rather inappropriate for a children's film.

There are some new staff that makes the movie entertaining though, like finding hiccups mother and the major characters death.

            "content": "Back in 2010, a fun animated movie about how to train a dragon took Dreamworks by storm. With such success as the first movie achieved, a sequel came out 4 years later. As such, How To Train Your Dragon 2 had very high expectations to meet. To me, at least, these expectations were met and more.The movie picks up with Hiccup and Toothless training to become a better duo as Berk, their home, has become a place where humans and dragons live together in peace. But Hiccup still has loose ends he needs to tie up, such as the timeless question to figure out his identity. Who is Hiccup? It is while looking for the answer to this very question that he and Astrid, his new girlfriend, stumble upon a group of people working for Dragonfist, the new villain, replacing the hell dragon from the previous movie.Along the way, he meets his long-lost mother, who has a dragon safe haven of her own, which includes an Alpha, a king of all dragons. While she and Hiccup catch up and the dragons play with each other to get to know each other better, a mother-son bond forms in such a way that behind all the laughs in the movie is a heart-warming chemistry that works well with the plot of the movie. We even see Stoic, Hiccup's dad, reunite with her and see the promise of a family rebuilding. Honestly, that is something I'd be looking forward to seeing.That is... until Dragonfist decided to be a dick and try to hold all the dragons hostage. This is actually important because it not only present Hiccup with his greatest challenge, but it puts to the test how well Hiccup and Toothless have really bonded with each other.The animation is done just as well as the last movie, which alone makes this fun to watch. The laughs are well-timed in this film, which only makes since Toothless is still the most hilarious dragon this side of Eragon's Saphira. The plot is engaging and consistent with a healthy balance of action, drama, and comedy, which is what a good animated family film about dragons needs in addition to well-done animation, which this has. It is a sequel that not only matches the first, but builds on it.Astrid and Hiccup aren't near each other too much, but when they are, their chemistry is good, so their relationship works. I would love to see this build upon itself in the next sequel, coming out in 2018. The only real downside was how easily Stoic was able to locate his son every time. Granted, this is explained, but still, I found this a bit too convenient. That aside, I would hope this doesn't go the Shrek route and impress the crowds again when movie 3 comes out.",

This series has vikings and dragons kids will love it even if it is horrible but there is not one frame that fits into horrible. The charters are fantastically well developed even more so with both movies and the second film even gets a bit dark though nothing dramatic. While the sequel cold take the obvious easy cheerful route it opts no to do so at all keeping parents honestly telling their kids that they do not know if it will all be okay when the credits hit. It very smartly does turn out fine so do not worry about taking any kid to see this that you would take to see The Lion King as this is as close as we have got to such a masterpiece in over a decade, no lie the wort part of this is knowing the credits mean it is over and I say that proudly as 28 year old guy that loves brutal movies (which again this is light years from)",

Being a sequel of a much loved movie, Dragon 2 walks on the tight rope of maintaining the fun quotient of Dragon 1 and providing some new fresh ideas which can make Dragon 2 memorable. Movie improves in the stunning imagery and usage of 3D effects considerably. Dragons' flight scenes would be hard to forget especially by new kids in the audience. Characterization of humans and dragons both is done with much care. But it is hard to ignore the fact that fun quotient has been lowered and movie takes a darker way in second half in providing few key twists and turns. Burdened by high expectations, Dragon 2 falls short of being a milestone movie but dares to take new chances. The chemistry of our hero Hiccup and his dragon Toothless remains the strength of the story. I am going with generous 8 out of 10 for How to Train Your Dragon 2. It has its flaws but is very well saved by excelling in visuals and characters department. Watch it in 3D for full impact.",

Dreamworks is one of those movie companies that starts something amazing and pushes it even further like Shrek and Kung Fu Panda but back to the dragons. The animation was incredible and the soundtrack was memorizing and beautiful. The main takeaway was the story. Since I don't want to spoil everything for the people who hasn't seen the movie yet, I'll give a brief summary of the plot.The story follows a new and upgraded Berk where the citizens use dragons for their everyday lives. Stoick, the chief and father of Hiccup, knows he can't be chief of Berk forever so he passes the role to his son, Hiccup, due to his impact he put on Berk and having the qualities of a leader. At first, Hiccup doesn't think he can really take much of that responsibility because he doesn't see his true self, his true potential. (There's a takeaway from how Po felt in Kung Fu Panda 2.) But there's nothing like discovering a new place where dragons thrive and a new enemy that'll prove to Hiccup all those things and much more.Don't be fooled that it's just another animation movie; See the movie while you have the chance! If you do miss it, there's always DVD.",

            "content": "When I first saw the original How To Train Your Dragon, I was impressed. I have to admit that I'm not a fan of animated movies at the best of times and even now I wasn't sure if the second one would be as good as the first one. I saw this new one as a preview in England, I'm so glad I did.The first one focused on a young viking called Hiccup trying to change the attitudes of his tribe, who at the time was attacking dragons instead of living with them in peace side by side. He managed to succeed, but it came at a price by losing part of his leg. The 3D animation effects where amazing (but not over the top) and the story behind the first movie was great.Now the second movie takes place five years after the first one. There has been a lot of changes, Hiccup has to step up to take over as chief of his tribe and he is afraid to take that responsibility on. So he and his dragon Toothless,explore other lands and discovers a land full of new dragons and their is a mysterious person who looks after and protects them.Now How To train Your Dragon 2, has a few \"back\" stories which you need to be aware of. For one, the mysterious person who looks after and protects the dragons also happens to be Hiccup's mother, who went missing twenty years ago.Secondly, the bad guy in this one called Drago is a major enemy of Hiccup's father Stoick and with good reason, which if you watch the movie you will find out why.I did however say that this movie is slightly darker than the original and sadly due to a terrible twist of fate, the choice for hiccup taking over as chief of his tribe (wither he's ready for the responsibility or not) is made for him. Again if you see the movie you will find out why. The price for him becoming chief comes at a much bigger price than losing his leg in the first film. He loses something else (or should I say, without giving too much away) someone close to him.How To Train Your Dragon 2, is a massive improvement to the first one. Because it has better 3D animation effects (which again are not over the top) and the story in this one is not just for kids and teenagers. It's also geared towards adults as well. Both 3D Animated effects and story go well together in the correct proportions, the director Dean DeBlois got it absolutely right and has done Cressida Cowell books a lot of justice.If you go and see a movie this year, make sure this one is on your list. As Hiccup says in the trailer when he is flying \"This is amazing\", well he should have been saying that this movie, not his flying. IT IS AMAZING and it's well worth seeing which is the reason why I've rated it and it's predecessor as highly as I have.Don't just take my word for it, if you see any film this year, Make sure you add this one to your list. Brilliant.",

The animation is amazing, gaspingly beautiful as always added with a much richer story line. Just like potter, when there are more people involved for a single goal, it gives extraordinary shape to the story. Hiccup and Toothless took another step and entertained us brilliantly. Although there are some tiny tiny things which could have been better, one should not expect the artist will do everything for you, after all he is a human and has got his own brain and economy. I supply full 10/10 to this movie for being great and also for not spoiling the image of previous part as most of the other movies do.I wish to get a dragon to ride and fly the sky.

The original How to Train Your Dragon core development 30 to 40 min is as good an animated entertainment as I've ever seen, so would be difficult to match to say anything of surpass. Where this sequel did surpass the original though was in it's even better animation texturing, movement, colors, and details. (major spoilers) Main problem here though, I thought the mother character seemed kind of thrown in, forced, and almost gimmicky. Too much focus was on her too. Might've been better not making her related. Still a good watch - 7/10",

This is the second of a trilogy-in case you could not tell by the number in the title. It takes place about 5 years after the last film. Jay is the son of the Viking chief, Gerard, and has started to explore his world more, including making maps of the new lands. The Vikings have started playing a game, which involves flying their dragons around in circles and catching sheep that are hurled into the air. They then dunk the sheep, which kind of reminded me of the game that was played in the Harry Potter movies-I think it was called quiditch, but I'm not sure of the spelling. Anyway, on his searches Jay finds more dragon riders. Cate, his long lost mother, who was thought to be dead, is on an island and in charge of some friendly dragons. Then there is the evil dragon rider, Djimon, who wants to conquer the Vikings and eventually, the rest of the world. He also has a past history with Gerard and adds an omega- dragon to the mix.

I was looking forward to it, but hoping that it didn't crash and burn like the Shrek series after the 2nd one. I had no reason to fret, as this gem did not disappoint.Set five years after its predecessor, Hiccup, now 20, is due to become chief of his tribe on the island of Berk. His father Stoic, thinks he's fit for the job, but Hiccup isn't so sure. His troubles only double when he finds out that a dragon trapper, Drago Bloodvist, is building a dragon army for purely evil purposes. In the meantime, Hiccup and Stoic reunite with Valka, the latter's wife and Hiccup's mother, who had been snatched by dragons 20 years before, and, like her son, felt at home amongst the beasts. Hiccup believes that he can talk sense into Drago, but his parents warn him that he is a madman, and that they must protect their people - such men cannot be reasoned with. Like his father in ways, Hiccup ignores them, which leads to a tragic event that will change him forever.I recently read a quote by a critic, which stated that the first HTTYD was about a boy finding his best friend, and that the second was about the same boy becoming a man. He/she could not have said it better. HTTYD 2 is much darker and mature than its sister movie, with bigger problems (and bigger dragons!) and an even bigger message. The moral is very Lion King esque, to face one's responsibilities. There is also the important lessons of forgiveness, loyalty and friendship - and listening to your elders! The bond between Hiccup and Toothless has only grown stronger over the five year gap, and it's evident, and portrayed beautifully. Hiccup's older design, as well as the subtle changes in Toothless's features, add maturity without taking away from their younger selves. Hiccup and Astrid share great chemistry, and have lovely moments together. Valka and Hiccup connect immediately, and the love that she and Stoic share after all the years apart is a joy to behold. There is a great father and son bond that seems to have grown stronger, but rather than Stoic learning from Hiccup, Hiccup is learning from Stoic.The emotions run high in this film, and there are certainly some heartwrenching scenes. HTTYD 2 is more for the teenagers who saw the original, now adults. However, it is, like The Lion King, a fantastic family film that teaches important lessons, as mentioned above, and brings back the same characters we fell for before, with exciting, high flying adventures.(the animation is even better than the original, and the music just as beautiful).A worthy continuation of what is possibly DWA's best series.",

Perhaps it was just because it irritated me so much, Jay Baruchel is a lot more tolerable when he's on screen. However, with a recent and thoroughly enjoyable rewatch of Lilo & Stitch from Dean DeBlois & Chris Sanders, I was open to appreciating this acclaimed sequel. And indeed, it is a step up. Free of juvenilities besides its humour, it approaches much more interesting if familiar archetypal territory. I'm still not a fan of its world, but the popular bond between Hiccup and Toothless is growing on me, especially during their introduction set to a Sigur Ros soundtrack. Unfortunately the film is quite misjudged during the introduction of Hiccup's mother. Their depiction of her comes off as cold and awkward. Perhaps that's what they were going for, but the film feels off. I must commend the animation upgrade that Dreamworks has undergone. The detail is tangible and astonishing, especially paired with the extraordinary scale certain scenes reach. I'm still not won over, but I may stick around for the third if it's as warmly received.6/10",

            "content": "Now this is how a sequel is done. For a while, I haven't seen a sequel to animated movie\u00a0that is not only good, but better than the original. Until now. \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is the perfect description of a\u00a0movie that conquers the first film and keep in mind, the original movie was probably the best animated movie DreamWorks has ever put out. This movie continues the story like a good sequel should and also ups the story, characters and animation in the process. I even think this is one of the best animated movies ever made and\u00a0have so much to say about it.Five years have passed since the last film and the Viking village of Berk has evolved. The island now lives with their former nemesis, the dragons, in harmony and have even turned many of their former weapons of war into items of use for the dragons like turning giant torches into feeding stations. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his dragon Toothless have been exploring and mapping islands outside of Berk in hopes of finding other dragon riders.\u00a0He instead discovers dragon trappers who are seeking revenge after their fort was destroyed and solidified by ice. Led by Eret (Kit Harington), he reveals that the\u00a0warlord Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou)\u00a0is raising an army full of dragons in hopes of conquering the world. After warning his father, the chieftain Stoik (Gerard Butler), the island of Berk is put in a secure state to protect the dragons\u00a0in preparation for a war. Hiccup,\u00a0believing\u00a0the war can be avoided, leaves the island with his girlfriend Astrid\u00a0(America\u00a0Ferrera) in hopes to talk with Drago and prevent the\u00a0battle not knowing that they aren't the only ones protecting dragons. I could tell you what happens next, but I'd rather not spoil the movie.While the last film was directed by \"Lilo and Stitch\" directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, this film is rather written and\u00a0directed by DeBlois himself who plans to turn the series into a trilogy. He claims he mostly got inspiration from \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and it clearly shows. The film does what a sequel should do. The film expands the world, introduces more new characters including more species of dragons and also the fun. The story is what I love about this film the most. It ups the emotion, heart and comedy from the previous movie while also taking the movie in a more\u00a0darker and serious tone. One particular scene near the end of the film was so powerful that I actually did get a little teary eyed which is a very high compliment. The animation is some of the best put to film. With help from visual consultant Roger Deakins, the animation was so beautiful and even at times\u00a0very\u00a0realistic. There was one shot in the film involving glaciers that looked so realistic that I initially thought it was filmed on a camera. The character are again, fantastic. They evolve like characters should, while keeping their charm that we liked about them from the previous movie. The new characters are also fantastic with the villain Drago Bludvist being a genuinely unlikeable\u00a0villain while having a believable backstory to explain his actions.\u00a0My favorite character is still\u00a0Toothless who can be both cute and funny at times while\u00a0also being epic and\u00a0awesome\u00a0in others. I can go on forever\u00a0praising this movie, but I'd rather not.\"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is one the best animated sequels ever made. This is a film that has everything I expect to a sequel. A story that is as good if not better than the original, some breathtakingly real animation, and fantastic memorable characters. It's really a fantastic movie and I'm pretty excited to see where the story goes next.\u00a0There are many reasons why DreamWorks is considered one of the best animation studios in the business and this is most certainly one of them.",

The cream of the crop are the movies which make you care for the characters... you get to know their personalities... you identity with their goals... and you want them to succeed. After all, if you don't give a hoot about the cast, how are you supposed to concern yourself with anything else? This could apply to almost all films, but it goes double for animation... as too many these days get lost in puerile jokes and mindless action to give us anything else of substance.How To Train Your Dragon 1 was a pleasure, and the sequel shares many of the same qualities. Sure, there are amazing sequences of giant winged creatures dipping through the sky, and some humorous interludes involving some of the more... special members of the crew. But it never loses sight of the most important thing: Remember your characters, stay true to them, and just tell their story. There are some wonderful moments involving family ties, reunion and loss which will move anyone in the right frame of mind to tears. Not me, though. I'm TOUGH.So, perhaps an alternate title could be 'How To Make An Animated Movie', because this and it's predecessor show us how it's done. Are you watching Madagascar? 7/10",

I have to say, there is something about the HTTYD series, it seems as if everyone who was working on it put all the effort they could into creating an animated kids film like no other, yes the story structure is quite familiar, but the twists and turns the story undertakes is what makes the franchise unique, that and the amazing visuals, because of this HTTYD was a huge success and now i am here to talk about the sequel. The visuals were amazing in this movie, no they were more than amazing, the visuals in this movie took 3d animation to the next level, some scenes i just forgot about what was happening and watched the scenery and there were a few scenes where the audience is supposed to just soak up the environment, these animators have created. There is one problem with the story, it felt as if the writers had just adapted the story to be slightly different than the first one, except this time we had a lot more character development, actually i think that this was what the movie was all about developing the characters for the 3rd film, overall the story was believable and kept me interested but perhaps not hooked. Finally the characters, yeah the villain was interesting, didn't really feel as if he was a bad guy, i felt he was more a misled man who really didn't understand what he was doing- and that was exactly how the movie played him, he was a misled character who Hiccup tried to convince to change their ways and be one with the dragon, and i suppose the whole franchise you could say has the message of 'be one with nature, and respect the creatures who live with us', and now this is good message to tell the younger generations, and the franchise does it so well. My final verdict is that HTTYD2 is a fun family film and i highly recommend you go see it. 8/10",

            "content": "As a former animator who once used to be quite familiar with principles of animation, complex technical tools in 3D software, and the determination for what it takes to be a great digital artist just got awestruck by an awesome sequel, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" that was thoroughly created over the last 4 years. The Hiccup and Toothless aren't the only ones that grew up dramatically as the first sight of dazzling island of Berk amazes me in a neck-breaking pace. The pristine stream that rolls beneath the ragged hills filled with authentic houses where vikings and dragons frolic together look so real that I can not visualize the strenuous process of creating a beautiful scenery within a boundary of the computer animation. Every element is packed with details, such as wild environments, costumes, and uncanny textures on various shaped dragons. Not to mention the frosty dragon aka Alpha, that feels much gigantic and overwhelming than the Godzilla will never be forgotten.Moving on to the animation part. The grown-up hiccup and his gang showcases what they are capable of by maneuvering their dragons swiftly and sometimes, botching mischievously. The humorous part comes from Astrid, voiced by America Ferrera (Known for Ugly Betty) where she impersonates Hiccup's habits and articulation. It goes without saying that the amount of time and efforts spent for animators on acting in front of the mirror to scrutinize facial expressions is presented through my eyes. That applies to other scenes where Hiccup tries to persuade Drago and his dad, Stoick to steer clear of the war as well as the most emotional scene where an absent- minded Toothless awakening and getting reunited with Hiccup who almost turns his back on his partner because of an unintended attack of Toothless that ends Stoick's life. There are more to praise about in terms of the cast, character developments, and most importantly, the touching plot that moves so many audiences to tears. The newly developed animation and lighting softwares by DreamWorks that make this distinguished along with a lot of talented artists is what I am so proud of. This film has motivated me to re-challenge to join the team that produces spectacular and feisty animation like this one someday.",

Now, they are riding dragons once they learned to train them. They have a sporting event with riders and their dragons using sheep as a ball to toss in a basket. Stoick (Gerard Butler) has wanted to train Hiccup to follow his footsteps in being a leader for their tribe someday. Hiccup is prematurely not wanting to take that responsibility yet. Hiccup is flying to new territory. He discovers another tribe that was demolished by some unknown new dragon which Eret (Kit Harrington) blames any dragon riders to be responsible. Hiccup soon discovers his mother Valka (Cate Blanchett). Who is living in an area filled with dragons. Which she is trying to protect them against a warlord Drago (Djimon Hounsou). Who wants to raise a dragon army for his own power.There are new fun characters that you meet. And also a menacing villain Drago. And the dragon he raises which is known as the Alpha is a gigantic monstrous beast that looks kind of scary. The animation in the film is beautifully done.

Instead it lets the narrative flow organically and believably, once again written and directed by Dean DeBlois. The best friend dynamic between Hiccup and Toothless is richer so some of the wonder is gone in that regard. To make up for it Dreamworks does not mess around with this sequel and instead go right for the really sensitive heart strings to tug on.The story is definitely more mature in How to Train Your Dragon 2 but still has the essence and soul of the first. Sequels of animated films can really only go one of two ways and thankfully How to Train Your Dragon's sequel is phenomenal.There are a few new characters inserted into the narrative to revitalize it but not so many as to completely change the film itself.

            "content": "Dreamworks has made a film, finally, that matches the brilliant caliber of films Pixar normally creates. No this is not at the caliber of Bugs Life and Cars. Instead it is in the upper echelons with great animated art such as Up and Toy Story 3. In addition and THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO NOTE: The sequel far far far far exceeds the first film and then some. Yes, you heard me right this film is better, by leaps and bounds, than the first film. While the first film has visual theatrics going for it and in fact was a good film, it relied way too heavily on potty humor and immaturity. The themes were a bit generic in the first film. Now that is not saying the first film was bad, i just found it forgettable. HTTYD 2 is a gorgeous film, whose aesthetic beauty far exceeds that of the previous. The animation is of exceptional quality, realistic even. The artist for this film need to be commended for marvelous and stunningly beautiful animation quality they have created. The work, effort and determination shows. So very impressive.Now theme wise this film is more darker, much much darker, and more emotional that the previous installment. It deals with some pretty solemn issues unlike the generic prequel. It is about finding ones self and realizing ones true destiny, responsibility in the face of heartbreak, the powerful bond of family, love and sacrifice. In addition this film deals with the connection we share with animals and themes of loss and grieving, love, relationship dynamics, war, hatred, peace and real life issues we see in today's world. Most importantly it deals with growth, growing up and maturing, transitioning and most of all it deals with life.Themes alone do not a great film make. This film has story. Not just story but a deep and meaningful story that is much much darker and way more mature than the last film. It is beautiful and moving and delves deep into emotion and heartfelt depth. A soaring story about life and adventure and inner strength.In terms of scale, this film is EPIC, perhaps even beyond. The people, and they are many, who have been involved in this film have done something that we rarely see and that my friends is taking a very unique and wonderful idea, the first film, and building what is a better and more powerful sequel in terms of animation, story, action, emotion, intelligence and depth. The sheer scale of this film is something to be compared to that of The Dark Knight Rises, The Lion King or The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It soars to heights i never thought i'd see in a fantasy animated film. It reaches heights i wish Frozen had been able to reach. HTTYD 2 did not pander to the lowest denominator. It didn't need crassness to draw in the masses, it chose to be true to itself. An all round triumph and a film that all other animated films should aspire to. The gold standard for Dreamworks animation. The scope matches the grand feel of all the great fantasy films and i cannot wait for the next film.And the score? Even more epic. You need to hear it to believe it.HTTYD 2 has replaced Kung Fu Panda 1 and 2 as my favorite Dreamworks animated feature.Could this film win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film? Well i sure hope so, i found it much more fulfilling than The Lego movie, Mr. Peabody and Sherman, Rio 2 and Legends of Oz, all the animated films this year and those of the last few years COMBINED. Yes The Lego Movie was inventive but it was missing something crucial, something How to Train Your Dragon 2 has in abundance.EDIT: Watched it the third time and still as epic and gorgeous perhaps even more so.",

There is far more substance here and you can tell that they've actually put a bit of thought in to the story. There's also far more for adults in it too, it's not just silly kids jokes. There's a bit more jeopardy and the romantic gags are enjoyable.I'm still not keen on Hiccup though. He's grown up in this one, but his voice hasn't broken and it just doesn't suit him. I think it's totally wrong for the son of a Viking who had a Scottish accent and he's not a particularly strong character, although I suppose that is what they're building to.And with regards to accents, what was Cate Blanchett trying for? It was all over the place. Some Welsh, Scottish, Northern English and with a bit of Scandinavian or Nordic thrown in. It's a shame, because I actually rate her very highly otherwise.Kit Harrington however, should focus on his voice acting, he's so much better when you can't see his face. Don't get me wrong, he's handsome, but that sulky thing he did all the way through 'Game Of Thrones' (2011-19) was not appealing for me. I'd like to see him prove me wrong in another role, but my only other real frame of reference is 'Pompeii' (2014), so you can see why I was so impressed with his performance in this film. He was really very natural.All of that is actually quite irrelevant though, because once again, Toothless is the real star. The small black dragon is adorable and cute like a tiny kitten.I still find it so frustrating that Hiccup's Dad never listens to him and it's not clear how the 'Alpha' is controlled? Which will mean nothing until you watch it, but it's actually not a bad film this time. It has far more going for it and kept my interest far more too.If I had seen this one first I may feel differently about the first, because I'd be more keen to find out about the back story, but I actually think that you could turn up to this one without watching the first at all.474.58/1000.",

The storyline was well put together and the different characters were a joy to watch. Hiccup and his dragon, Toothless, has to fight against some evil doers to save the dragon race. With the help of his close friends and his parents, the battle gets really intense and they manage to lose some close friends along the way. There is definitely something for everyone in this film, and the animation looks impressive. The director also added some emotional scenes, which actually touched me, and you can't help but feel for the sweat dragons who get hypnotised by a evil dragon who is controlled by Drago. Anyway, I personally preferred this to the first movie and I can't wait to see what they do with Hiccup and his travelling companion. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I'm obviously not alone with thinking that this movie was a great watch because of the box office success. The first movie was more to make but this movie has nearly doubled the first movies profit, which must please the people at Dreamworks. Anyway, the voices used in this movie were well chosen by the director and the action scenes had a lot of attention to detail. The relationships between the characters is what makes you care what happens to the individuals, which is what surprised me about movie, and there are some great twists which keep the movie fresh and interesting. I think you can tell that I enjoyed this film so give it a try, even if your an adult without kids.Budget: $145million Worldwide Gross: $619million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/comedy movies about the journey of Hiccup and Toothless who battle to save the dragon race against the evil Drago. 7/10",

            "content": "Well, there's not a lot of training going' on in this, the movie having dispensed with all that in the first movie. This now, is a grand soap-opera, a la 'Star Wars'. Not necessarily a bad thing, and mo' Craig Ferguson is always welcome.With the animated prod design that repeatedly evocative of 'Avatar', this one does try to soar high, and has a few beats that keep it up a notch compared to a lot of non-Disney, non-Pixar animated fare. But it does not quite reach the pinnacle achieved by the first one, other than for the nice camaraderie between the leads, that seems to have grown a bit stronger.The 'Empire strikes back' reference by other audience-members is also spot-on, and you might wanna get prepped on how to explain a few key occurrences to your child. Not an easy ask.The new baddie, voiced by Djimon Hounsou, is a sadly under-developed, stock- baddie, who's not even menacing, though he's all-powerful to the extent of making some key changes to the landscape that these movies reside in. In spite of that, he's just meh.There are still quite a bit of things that work, and most of it is credit to the animation and the action set-pieces. And yes, mo' dragons, and quite sure, for me at least, more Ferg. But all the 'Avatar' esque imagery gets tiring (perhaps because I've watched that flick like a gazillion times). The 3D's actually fantastic, and this is one of those movies that make the case FOR 3D, rather than 'those' ones that make it look all yucky. The voice-work's pretty decent, since other than Ferguson, Baruchel and Butler do really good jobs. He and Blanchett croon, even. There's quite a bit of comedy thrown in, but it's not for the ones who treasure smart repartee, but for those who get high on Michael Bay's Transformers kinda comedy. And that's really sad, considering the benchmark set by the first one.The soundtrack's a complete drag, in perfect accompaniment to the plot, which is all tired and pedestrian, with a baddie who has no reason to be in this movie at all, and is meh all the way.All in all, quite a good watch, for once, on the big screen. But I will not be induced to watch it once again. I had higher expectations. Sigh.",

No one was really around us, so we got to experience the movie even better. It was truly captivating, I really felt like I was seeing everything in real life, THE MOVIE MADE ME WANT A PET DRAGON AND BE A VIKING! We cried so much during this one VERY sad part :( Like literally sobbing and people heard but we didn't care cause WHY ARE YOU NOT CRYING?!!! The movie was better than the first, definitely! I watched the TV Series I had no idea about after. It took 4 days for me to watch 2 seasons, around 10 episodes a day.. but I.. just.. love.. this series. I saw it again today, not the same experience as the first because there was so many people, but I still cried a ton at that one part, maybe a teary eye at another.. I'm 16 and I love the HTTYD series and I DON'T CARE <3 <3 Dreamworks over Disney movies any day! This beat Frozen for me.. favourite movie by far. Expecting an amazing 3rd movie!P.S. I also really love the soundtrack and the song of my favourite scene! \"Where No One Goes\" by Jonsi and John Powell!",

While the newness is not as present here in the sequel, and the idea not as original, the action is more intense, the scenes more grand, and the time FLEW by. The plot isn't super predictable, as there are some decent surprises, the writing while not stellar is acceptable. Some of the best moments here are the tender, fragile moments, and the moments between Hiccup and his dragon, but I'd give the nod to the action here, good times.",

            "content": "How To Train Your Dragon 2This film is deeper than it looks. If you've loved the Cressida Cowell How to Train Your Dragon series then it's probably best you leave your expectations at the door as you pick up the popcorn. This is good as was its predecessor, but nothing could ever be as good as those wonderful books. Cressida however is credited as one of the screenwriters, which means this quite different treatment of her stories for screen has the weight of her storytelling skill.What remains from the books are the dragons and some of the deep themes and the fact that it is set on the mythical island of Berk amongst a Viking tribe. The names of the characters have also survived the treatment but the rest of the story is a made for movie affair, the antagonist from the books for example, almost comically evil - Alvin the Treacherous - hasn't made it through to the films yet but this is right and proper, as different media require different storytelling approaches. The story starts off fast-paced and frantic and initially you might be forgiven for imagining you're being subjected to just another Disney Frozen piece of candy-floss and colour-fest full of light and zaniness, signifying nothing. However\u0085this film has depth, emotional gravity and power. It hangs on a traditional five act structure and the point of no return is well tother side of the middle. Our hero has to face a deep tragedy (I will say no more as I don't want to spoil it) and how he copes with this and how the characters around him respond turns this film into something so much better than the normal cartoon blockbuster.The story is lovingly envisaged, the characters are well drawn and not prettified. Disabled characters play a key role, both good and bad and even the very, very bad guy has a back story that offers us a way of looking at his evil from a redemptive perspective. This story has something important to say to children about the world and how it ends up the way it does. Evil is caused rather than made, which means, hopefully, evil can be transformed as well as being overcome.How To Train Your Dragon 2 is moving and emotionally nuanced. Sitting amongst small people watching it from the middle third of the story there were lots of difficult silences and half- hidden snuffles. The stories final act is very well-played and it's all okay in the end but on the journey children experience the very real prospect that it won't be and that life vomits up terrible surprises that will challenge, upset and possibly change their lives forever.A great family film in the tradition of Up, Finding Nemo and Wall-E. There are those fast-paced popcorn munching moments, but you'll need to take the tissues too!",

Filled with humor, heart and a surprisingly mature tone at times, it seemed to signal that DeramWorks was finally ready to abandon the focus-group banality of the 'Shrek' films and compete with the big boys. Sadly that still hasn't happened, but at least they have the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series.The sequel isn't quite as funny as the original--and intentionally so I believe--and its lacks the thrill of discovery that naturally comes with a coming-of-age tale like 'HTTYD', but what it lacks in laughs it makes up for with thrilling action action and some genuine pathos.Though the second act drags a little and it tries to keep a few too many dramatic balls in the air at times, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is that rare worthy sequel.",

            "content": "\"Something is coming. Something you've never faced before.\"I was a huge fan of the first film written and directed by Dean DeBlois thanks to its memorable characters and beautiful visuals. How to Train Your Dragon continues to be my favorite DreamWorks animated film, so I was highly anticipating this sequel. Although I really enjoyed this film, I felt a bit disappointed because I felt it wasn't up to par with the first one. I enjoyed the visuals and the characters once again, but I felt there was just too much action and too little character development. The film is very fast paced and I didn't find myself as absorbed by the story and the characters as I felt the first time. There are plenty of funny moments and kids will be satisfied with all the action scenes, but adults may get tired of the action overload at times. This is still a good film and perhaps one of the best animated films of the year as it does manage to keep the audience emotionally engaged and it has several funny scenes. The best thing about How to Train Your Dragon 2 is without a doubt the beautiful visuals which once again amazed me. It was a fun ride, but I would rather watch the first film over the sequel.The film takes place five years after the original as we follow our hero, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) living peacefully amongst his people and dragons. He spends most of his time exploring new lands with his dragon, Toothless. His father, Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler) continues to be the chieftain of Berk, but he plans on leaving Hiccup as his successor. Hiccup however, doesn't feel like he was meant to lead the people and would much rather prefer to continue exploring unknown lands. During one of his explorations, Hiccup and his friend Astrid (America Ferrera) run into some men who are trying to capture dragons. They both escape, but Hiccup decides to return and try to convince these men not to capture dragons but reasoning with them is pointless. A mysterious dragon rider named Valka (Cate Blanchett) shows up and takes Hiccup to a hidden island. He later discovers that Valka is his mother and that she has dedicated her life to saving dragons from Drago (Djimon Hounsou), a man dedicated to capturing and using them for his own personal gain. Together, and with the help of the rest of his friends from Berk they decide to stop Drago and his men before he starts another war and hurts more dragons. Sequels usually suffer from not being as fresh as the original, and that is what happened here as the interesting premise from the first film was missing. I was already familiar with this world of vikings and dragons and the new characters didn't really resonate with me. It didn't help that it felt so fast paced either, but there were some strong emotional moments that I wasn't expecting from an animated sequel like this. There is some heart to this story allowing it not to rely entirely on the beautiful visuals, but I guess my expectations were just a bit too high because I wasn't blown away by this sequel as most people were. I really wasn't too engaged with the action, but I did enjoy the comedy.",

This sequel puts that bond into the test and into boundless limits.This movie comes out fresh since the prequel. Five years and the vikings and dragons are living in harmony. Dragons are utilized for Berk's commerce, transportation, entertainment, and of course, as pets (which is very cool by the way) to name a few. But a villainous figure then threatens the harmonious relationship of humans and dragons.The setting has vastly widen with Hiccup and Toothless discovering uncharted lands. The plot has a smooth roll in it and is quite fun for adults in such a way every member of the family can enjoy it, and it has no lame dead airs. The characters are as always rich in a variety of personalities. With Hiccup more daring and adventurous and genius more than ever.The plot is versatile since the enemy, Drago Bludvist escaped giving an opportunity for a trilogy (which Dean DeBlois confirmed). The ending, in my opinion is a fresh start for a more interesting ploy for the 3rd film.

The movies starts out with a Dragon competition with all the dragon riders. Astrid, Snotlout, Ruffnut, Tuffnut, and Fishlegs. At first you have no idea where Hiccup is. Once the competition is over we are now soaring through the sky with Toothless and Hiccup. Greeted with one of the best songs in the film, \"Where No One Does\". Some critics and viewers talk about this movie not having heart, but it's heart is just as big or maybe even bigger than the first film. It will make you laugh and maybe even cry. It had it's joyful moments, some sad moments, and intense moments too, but throughout it always was perfectly balanced. It was darker than than the first movie, but that's okay. I love that it tread on the dark side sometimes. Life has it's darker moments and that made this movie feel so real, even with Dragons soaring through the sky. Toothless always brought a smile to your face, even when he was viscous. Without a cute dragon like Toothless the film might have been too dark for younger children. I say see it as soon as you can if you even remotely like animated films. Watch it with kids if you have any because they certainly won't be bored, and I don't think you will be either.",

When you realize this, you will cry. Trust me.But trust your instincts over anything else. My instincts told be to be wary. Aye, they were right... boy, America needed more Scottish-sounding accents like it needed an ice spear to the head. XD Sorry, am I being too harsh? What's truly wrong with this movie is that we lose our beloved Hiccup and Toothless to convention. Now, I love these two. It's *because* I love them that, were the sequel up to me, I would defy the loosey-goosey plot devices in a second.I'm not convinced when Hiccup suddenly surrenders himself to The Best Thing In This Movie (i.e. TAKE ME!!! ^^) nor am I deeply moved by Valka's plight.What I am convinced was that the creators were thrown to the dragons by DreamWorks, who told them to make a sequel and have it done by summer 2014. The animation is passable, but a little underwhelming after Frozen (God Bless you Elsa, may you star in many of my dreams tonight O_O). The comedy is only good when Eret and Ruffnut are involved and the few dramatic movies scarcely reach the depth of Stoic's passing.The heartfelt and whole-hearted connectivity of Hiccup and Toothless is at once a warm hug and a dagger to the heart, especially in that final moment when Hiccup must solely rely on heart - thank you Astrid - and heart alone. It is a miracle for the two brethren and yet a curse for those who expected more. What I mean is: they didn't earn it.HTTYD 2 takes the beautiful heart and expands upon it, but it's done so gracelessly you'd swear you were stuck in neutral. I wish only good things for Hiccup and Toothless, aye, I love them. But the clich\u00e9 (Hiccup, more upset then angry, sends a confused Toothless away after he's done a horrid yet accidental deed), the repetitive (didn't we already see that Toothless was a master doodler?) and the commonplace (yes, there's a lot of different kind of dragons. WE GET IT) make it so that this classless little grand adventure cannot truly stand up to it's sophisticated giant small epic.Also, Hiccup is too much of a goody-goody and Toothless has lost his edge and is far too childish to merely have grown out of his bratty behavior. Much like Stitch throughout his stint through the grind of sequels, Toothless has been robbed of his edge.I'm sorry for the loss of their personalities, I truly am. But I am NOT SORRY for the loss of their integrity. Though the first movie was nothing new, the *execution* was that set it apart from the pack.Though I did not expect Stoick to die, it's not any easier saying that D: , I bet others could see it coming in the song-and-dance number. I could go on and on. If you want a fun, family-friendly(?) movie for tweens (could be a bit intense for the under five, but hey, I only thought Mufasa was sleeping in kindergarten ;) ) by all means, go.I don't regret revisiting my beloved Berk, but I do regret the abysmal fall into standard children's movies.

Producers could save a bundle by just hiring decent voice actors -- kids wouldn't care who is providing the voice, and I can't imagine that adults are going to an animated movie because a celebrity is doing the voice.I have to wonder if they used Tommy Wiseau (The Room) as an inspiration for the design of the bad guy.

            "review_title": "This part 2 manages to implement great achievements on new levels worthy of a modern fantasy epic, and as intimate and true to its drama better than most recently dramas",
            "content": "Written and directed by Dean DeBlois, who was co-writer and co-director of the first feature, the film uses little of the original book series. The time between the two features allowed the characters to grow and mature, especially Hiccup, his girlfriend Astrid and Stoic. The basic characteristics of their personalities are still there, but tempered with more life experience. This can also be seen in their design. We recognized them at first sight, but we also noticed how Hiccup became a young man, the more pronounced curves of the brave Astrid and the white strands in Stoick's beard and hair. These are details that enrich the experience.Hiccup who is now 20 years old has to deal with pressure from Stoick, his father, for him to become Berk's leader, something he is very reluctant to do. In fact, he still doesn't know what he wants out of life. His romance with Astrid continues in full swing and Snotlout and Fishlegs were enchanted by Ruffnet, which only has eyes for Eret, which ends up generating very funny scenes. There are new dragons, some very interesting, but none are as captivating and charming as Toothless, which has mixed cat and dog ways. Their relationship with Hiccup is even more intimate and thanks to a new invention, they can now fly side by side.What sets this How to Train Your Dragon 2 apart is how director / screenwriter Dean DeBlois inserts the human factor into the story in a natural, almost imperceptible way, largely because he doesn't have to create a mystique around the plot, as it is perfectly derived from the first feature. Anyone who watched the 2010 will immediately have fun with the constant humorous tirades, get excited by the dizzying adventure scenes, but neither will they feel uncomfortable when the essential dose of drama is dissolved in the midst of it all. The existing messages in the composition of the characters of Hiccup and Fury of the night give the film a mature and coherent tone. There is what you don't see in Disney / Pixar products, the imperfection that makes humans perfect and the equalization of values that indicate that we are all capable of living in constant harmony, even if different.Valka's insertion also directs us to the ability to forgive and that the second chance is an index of love. But, the important thing to stand out is that everything is passed on to us in the subjectivity that makes animation exciting. There are no limit situations, that \"forced bar\" that has been disfiguring the latest works of the genre. All that DeBlois assembles are pieces of a tale of family love and overcoming its limits. Of course, all of this works due to the peripheral characters, which, although limited to comic support, are the necessary relief so that we do not forget that we are in front of something that can also have fun. This prevents the film from moving on to a melancholy and stressful drama. In other words, everything is part of the cinematographic language of animations and that makes them something peculiar.The new characters are not just there to be new toys to be sold in stores. All have an essential function for the unfolding of the plot. Valka and Drago bring about a real revolution in the lives of our heroes and do so in an absolutely organic way, with the script not rushing to show the reactions of Hiccup and Stoic with the resurgence of these figures so different from each other and their respective philosophies. Drago is a destructive force driven by pain and loss, a dark reflection of what Hiccup could become (even with a sacrificed limb). Valka is the opposite, representing the origin of everything that makes Hiccup unique among the inhabitants of Berk. The presence of the character and his peculiar way also strengthens Stoic, not only in this feature (the two share two extremely touching scenes), but also in the previous one, showing some of the pain that the Viking leader felt when he saw his son act so similar to that of your lost wife.This does not mean that the connection between Hiccup and Toothless, the heart of the first film, has been neglected. This bond is put to the test in the most painful way possible, which shows the courage of DeBlois, who never underestimates his audience. Yes, it is an animation aimed at children and teenagers, but the filmmaker recognizes the capacity of this audience to deal with more complex emotions, especially those involving parents, children and friends, precisely the most important connections for this age group.It is on the emotional side that How to Train Your Dragon 2 loses in relation to the first film. Hiccup's very personal arc gives way to a more conventional plot of Manichaeism and emotional blackmail - like the element of \"enchantment\" that a dragon exercises over others, central to the film, which is first of all a very obvious tool of narrative manipulation. However, Hiccup is the character that most evolves in the plot. As in the first film, we accompany the character in an internal struggle, still trying to find out who he is, a leader or peacemaker. His evolution is closely followed by that of Toothless.If, while the first film dealt openly with themes of animal abuse and the family theme in the troubled relationship between Hiccup and his father, which was reflected in the endless guerrilla conflict in Berk against dragons, its continuation returns to dealing with the same themes but elevated to a new level of spectacle and universality. Whether in the aforementioned obviously religious representation that the film makes of the figure of the Alpha dragon as being this mystical species of the natural environment of dragons, and those who control them are true messiahs of this world, as Drago sees himself to be and what Hiccup ends up becoming, a Moses of the dragons if you prefer.As well, and again, within the family environment, now present in the relationship between Hiccup and his mother Valka, dealing with themes of motherhood, loss and withdrawal, but at the same time forgiveness and wisdom through affection. Be it in the quick forgiveness of Hiccup for his mother still in the opening third of the film, the unexpected and beautiful forgiveness in the reunion of Stoick with his beloved Valka, and later the forgiveness of Hiccup and Toothless after the great Lion King moment of the film, which I guarantee that managed to shake many hearts with the hardness and almost dry tone with which this moment is dealt with in the film and only adds to the moral complexity with which DeBlois seeks to give this story.And all these acts of forgiveness, bear fruit for life learning for each one of them. Hiccup finds out more about dragons and the universe he inhabits; Valka discovers through a sweeter and more affectionate Stoic that people are indeed capable of changing just as the entire Berk (and Eret Snow) changed their feelings towards dragons; and the last one, both concludes with a flourish the Hiccup's bow finally discovering what it is to be a true leader for his people, both humans and dragons now united, and Toothless takes on a new responsibility within his species when he becomes the Alpha dragon, both gaining responsibility and maturity.DeBlois 'direction moves skillfully between the various narrative nuclei, deepening the protagonists' relationships, but without failing to give due attention to the action scenes, the humor inherent in the series and the dragons themselves, respecting the elements previously presented about the animals and expanding them, including using unusual devices to introduce new information (such as letters referring to current card games). The film is very light, passes fast and does not make mistakes in any aspect. It is funny and sad when it needs to be and it is tense and soft when it also needs to be. The story and the visuals are richer and more comprehensive, given the ease of traveling around with a dragon. That simple. It can be said that the events of the first film, in addition to contributing to the plot, collaborate with the technical aspects of the second. In this way, Hiccup's ease of exploring the region puts him in contact with the mysterious dragon guardian, Valka (voice of Cate Blanchett), who knows much more about dragons than anyone else in the world, in addition to hiding one. Big secret. To give you an idea, Hiccup is introduced to the Alpha Dragon, a colossal dragon, perhaps bigger than the Godzilla, who controls all the other dragons.Again showing a performance far above the average for an animation that is still a type of cinema underestimated in cinematographic capacities. Unlike continuations that are carried out simultaneously, just aiming at a continuity conducive to raise a lot of money from the success of both films targeted as products, its creator shows again having time and dedication in the execution of How to Train Your Dragon 2 and make it and his story is his own independent film, even though it still leaves a beautiful door open for a lavish future. Even though it may not contain the same solidity as its predecessor, it manages to implement much of its great achievements on new levels worthy of a modern fantasy epic, and as intimate and true to its drama better than most recently released dramas, forming here successor more than worthy to his predecessor.",

            "content": "It's now 5 years on, and both dragons & vikings live together in peace. The Viking leader, Stoic, is trying to prepare Hiccup for leadership, but Hiccup is more interested in exploring uncharted territories with his faithful dragon, Toothless. Their exploration leads them to a secret ice cave far from the island of Berk, and it's here that they discover the island is home to hundreds of dragons and a mysterious Dragon Rider. Before long, Hiccup & Toothless find themselves in the middle of a battle to help protect the dragons from the evil Drago who is trying to organise a massive dragon army. Only time will tell if Hiccup and the rest of the Viking's will succeed in rescuing the dragons.How To Train Your Dragon 2 turned out to be a pretty enjoyable animation movie...eventually. I say eventually because it actually took a wee while to get going and was pretty slow for the 1st 30 minutes or so but it does get better as it goes on. The animation was superb and you can actually see a difference between the 1st and 2nd films.Plot wise, however, the two are about the same which is that they are both pretty mediocre when it comes to story, although there is a nice wee twist in the 2nd film. The plot isn't the only thing that lacks slightly either as there isn't all that much humour. I mean there are moments that will make you chuckle, but it's not on the same level as Brave, Wreck It Ralph, or the Despicable Me films, and it could be a case where kids may find it funnier than adults.One other thing that slightly annoyed me was the terrible Scottish accent from Cate Blanchett for her character of Valka. Why movie makers do this is beyond me because if they wanted the character to be Scottish, then they should have brought in a Scottish actor.Anyway, even with all this mentioned, and I know it may not seem like it with what I have said, this is still a pretty enjoyable movie. Is it one of the best DreamWorks movie's ever? No, but it's not the worst either.",

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 was AMAZING (This review is spoiler-free because I want more people to see this movie and love it). Forget X-Men Days of Future Past or Edge of Tomorrow, THIS is the movie of the summer (or maybe 22 Jump Street, but I doubt it). I walked out of the theater extremely satisfied. You know when you walk into a movie expecting to know what was already gonna happen, and you're right? This movie surprised me A LOT. It's a HUGE step forward from the first movie. Everything was just beautifully delivered; the action, the story, the comedy, the heart... It was all just brilliant. This movie does not fall short on anything at all. And you know how there's this new trend where movies are split apart into 2? There was this one scene that was just so freakishly amazing that at the end of it, you think \"damn, that part was so cool, that HAD to be the climax, but there's still so much stuff that hasn't been resolved. I guess there's gonna be a H.T.T.Y.D. 2.5....\" and just when you think the credits are gonna roll, BAM! The movie plays on, more amazing sh*t happens, and we get a proper resolution. I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of the constant cliffhangers at the end of movies. I mean, yeah, it's awesome that there's a sequel, but there's always that feeling of dread that you have to wait for it for another 2-3 years. It's nice to watch something that is great as it is, something that isn't an advertisement for the next movie. How to Train Your Dragon 2: 8.8/10 stars. This is a greaaaaat movie. Don't miss it.P.S. - There is no after-credits scene. You may leave after the concept art slide show - There's a slight Godzilla homage in the movie, but maybe that's just me. - Jon Snow (Kit Harrington) voices the leader of the small band of dragon poachers. I didn't know that when I saw it, but I'm trying to recall if anyone in the movie told his character he \"knew nothing\". That would just be funny.",

            "content": "In 2010, Dreamworks Animation feature \"How to Train Your Dragon\" was released and at first glance at that film, I was reluctant to see it because it looked weak and way too kid-friendly for my tastes. But I went to see it anyway and I admit, I was wrong, it was a pleasant surprise. In 2014, the sequel \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" came out and from the trailers I had high expectations to see it, but feared it would not measure up to the original. Fortunately, it held up to the bar of the original quite splendidly and had a satisfying aftertaste once the credit rolled.One of the principal attributes for this movie's success was that it managed to be quite bold in its delivery. Rather than just repeating everything we saw from the first installment, writer/director Dean DeBlois who had to go at it solo (because fellow co-diector Chris Sanders had committed himself with \"The Croods\") decided to make the characters five years older from the previous movie and to change the dynamic forward in order to keep it newer. While the previous film ended with vikings learning to embrace love with the dragons, the sequel sees the creatures an acceptable comoddity to their society and our teenage protagonists have become older, responsible adults.I was greatly impressed with Dreamworks Animation in the design to making the characters older which is a bold move because in the history of animation, characters never age or if they do, it's very slow. Sure they didn't go to extremities about it, just to continue the story five years after the original. Meaning that though the characters have aged, it was only slightly. And while as the characters have gotten advanced in age, so has the visuals, only this time as a change for the better.Deeeply inspired by the \"Star Wars\" sequel \"The Empire Strikes Back\", DeBlois wanted to make the movie stay true to the kid-friendly atmosphere like the original movie, but here in the sequel, he wanted to add more mature and more personal issues to go along the narrative. The primary plot is about the vikings who work along with the dragons take on an army who's purpose is to enslave them. The emotional arcs are open, but not over-the-top and never once does it come across as too dialogue inducing that becomes distracting or mundane for fans who want to see action and comedy in this movie. For example it doesn't outpour the romantic subplot involving the relationship between Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and Astrid (America Ferrera) and doesn't try to add conflict to drive a wedge between them like so many movies try to do with happy relationships. They're a happy couple and it's so refreshing that nothing here tears them apart. The main conflict that comes to life here is the torn apart relationship between Hiccup and his dragon companion Toothless, who became rogue after being under the spell of an evil Bewilderbeast. But eventually, the spell would broken and they would reconcile.Sure this film is saturated with an ensemble of supporting characters, they still provide a great deal of importance to the narrative and keep the flow of the strory going whether it's through comic relief, brief scenes with them doing fun stuff like dragon races or things like that. But they're kept to a minimal capacity and are not upstaging the main plot of the story.Even though this movie lives up the same levels as the original \"How to Train Your Dragon\", there are a few flaws that didn't sit well. For instance the leading villain, Drago (Djimon Hounsou) was sadly underdeveloped mainly because he came late into the story and it seemed they spent too much time building upon his character. I would've thought it would be better if he showcased his evil ways rather than just telling us personally, Drago would've been a more effective antagonist. The same could be said of the mysterious dragon-rider who eventually is revealed to be Valka (Cate Blanchett), Hiccups estranged mother. And the way they resorted their differences is off-putting. She was absent for most of his childhood and that should've had a bit of resentment with Hiccup, but after five minutes he's okay with that is a bit awkward. It's a serious issue we're facing. It's still childhood abandonment and not all issues are settled with a brief explanation. I wanted to see more conflict in this subplot with some form of rejoicing in the end. Sort of like \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" in which Indy and has father would conflict with each other constantly, while rescuing each other from danger, only in the end do they embarce their love for each other. That would've worked effectively in this movie.Sure the first installment is better, but this one still holds on effectively. By taking the sequel to a different direction, by way of maturing the characters in age and situations, it can still pass as a stand alone movie. Though some improvements could've been fleashed out a bit, didn't ruin the film at all. The movie was made with a considerable amount of care and compassion making this movie a very useful and reliable sequel that's not doing it to cash in from the success of the original.",

            "review_title": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 VS. Kung Fu Panda 2",
            "content": "In this review I am comparing HTTYD 2, to KFP 2, because both films are DreamWorks Animation sequels and contain two very similar plots, in which one is family related and the other one is about stopping a central villain. The difference between those films however is that only one of them managed to tell its story right. (Spoilers for HTTYD 2 as well as KFP 2)KFP 2 starts with a short intro about the past of a character that will become the main villain of the story, Lord Shen. He was supposed to be heir of Gongnam City (not a known city in KFP 1. He discovered that Fireworks could be used as a modern weapon in order to take China, he was banish after wiping out the Panda's homelands after seeing a vision from a soothsayer that only a black and white warrior could prevent his plans. Years later Shen continued his plan nonetheless, followed by a village raid for resources his weapons. Po (who is now the Dragonwarrior) tried to stop them but meanwhile gets a short flashback of his mother after seeing a familiar Symbol carried by Shen's right hand. Later he asked Mr. Ping about his past, but in the end Po learned nothing other that he is adopted and raised by him. After that we see how Shen uses his secret weapon that can outmatch Kung Fu and both plots are more or less settled in only 20 minutes of the film.Now in HTTYD 2 we have to wait 30 minutes before one of the plots comes in light(Hiccup's missing mother) and we have to wait another 15 minutes before they finally introduced the main villain. The only things we know before that is that Eret works for him and that this villain went once to Berk and killed plenty of Vikings there, because they didn't want to obey him, but why not intimidate those Berkians with his dragons like the way he intimidates them? Oh and apparently he also managed to control an alpha dragon. How he did this is beyond me, but most of all his motive to conquer other people. After one hour Drago explains why he needs to intimidate all these dragons by literally showing his lose, caused by dragons and his motive is therefore to force dragons to work for him? He does not kill them though, he just uses them in his advantage to conquer other lands for no good reason actually, because his past is barely related to this. In short we got a villain with an illogical match between motive and that simply gives no satisfaction to Drago's character whatsoever.Shen in KFP 2 was far more compelling. He discovered a way to transform firework into a weapon he could use for greater goals. This makes it believable (enough) that this position makes him hungry for more power. It was from the message from a soothsayer that Shen went out to destroy those (the panda) who could be a thread to him should he continue with his plan, but therefore he got banned by his own parents. His character could've been handled better in the movie, but Shen's actions made far more sense in contrast to Drago. KFP 2 managed to connect the two plots too. I am not saying that different plots should be connected, but the way KFP 2 handled its story was more conherent and woven than HTTYD 2, which made the story more impactfull and comprehencive.HTTYD 2 kept the two plots separate and it was only at the middle where they come together. The problem with this is that the story loses its pace. It was after 30 minutes Hiccup coincidentally found his mother Valka(really do love the voice of Cate Blanchett) and after they got to her hideout. She said that she only left in order to 'protect' Hiccup, but against what? Dragons will still come to raid the village anyway. If she truly wanted to protect Hiccup and the villagers, then she would've taken every dragon away from Berk. The only reason why she left is because she disagrees about killing dragons, but that is nearly not good enough to disappear for good without even visiting the place. Valka's dicision to stay away simply does not make sense.There are plenty other questions I have for this film, for example: Why is everyone okay with that Valka left for 20 years, if that is the only reason? Hiccup did not care at all (only surprised), Stoick sang together with Valka like nothing ever happened and the rest did not bother. Also why does Valka continuously act that she knows who Hiccup is after knowing him in about 2 days? Saying that being Chief is who Hiccup is, while the one thing that we know for sure in HTTYD is that Hiccup is NOT a leader, but an explorer. Astrid on the other hand was a far more dominant character. She could've been a great leader, but in this film she turned into a tag-along rather than an independent character she used to be in HTTYD 1. Speaking of characters (Spoilers), Stoick died during the battle and surprisingly Drago just left Hiccup and the rest unharmed after he had the clear upperhand, but he has no reason to do so. Shen in KFP 2 would not have taken any risks. He would have finished the job, if it wasn't for Po's counter ability with 'inner peace'. Also why did no one either spoke or mentioned Stoick again after the funeral, they just got over it? This is very rushed and forced writing at this point. In KFP 2 the story started very early with emotional investment with Po and his dad(Goose), that last through the entire film. So why didn't they start with at least one emotional gripping conversation between father and son that also last through the whole film to make his death more emotional and memorable?In conclusion: The story of HTTYD 2 did not satisfy partly due to its pacing problems. They went for a slow mysterious approach rather than a swift, dynamic approach in KFP, which is fine, but the beginning was way too slow in order to tell all there is and as a result we got a very rushed middle and end. The choices of the characters Drago and Valka did not make sense. Astrid was not the real Astrid and the death of Stoick did not have anything memorable to it. I can only say that KFP 2 tells its story far more clever. It had a clear direction and the story had a very compelling villain with an interesting goal and motive, but above all it made sense, along with more development of the characters Po, Mr. Ping and Tigress. All in all HTTYD 2 is a mixed bag, It has its good moments but also plenty of very contriving elements that tearing the movie down from being good. Valka might had her reasons to leave the village. Drago might had his reasons to conquer Berk. But in this context they appear as merely plot movers not actual characters with good motive. Hiccup's character arc(from explorer to leader) could be interesting, but it was unfortunately too little too late.",

            "content": "For starters, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" has a very mature and rich story that is filled with emotional and dramatic depth. It grows our characters from the first film and really feels like a continuation of the series and not just some cash grab. We see how Berk has changed and how the lives of everyone on the island has become better, I really love how the film tackles darker subject matter like remorse, forgiveness, and redemption, while at the same time touching on themes of love and loss. The screenplay is filled with moments of pure heart and we really see the bond between Hiccup and Toothless expanded upon. Not only is this a great screenplay, but also Dreamworks' best since the original \"Shrek.\" The characters and voice actors are perfect. I love how the characters have grown and their personalities have been enhanced. Hiccup takes a more proactive role in this film and we really see that he's matured a lot from the first film. His and Toothless' relationship is expanded on and it really is still the core emotional center of the film. The side characters like Astrid and Snotlout get more screen time this time around and they actually do more with the film. They aid with the comic relief to keep the movie a little lighter than the extremely dark tone that it's going for. There are a few new characters introduced into the universe like Valka, Eret, and Drago Bludvist. Valka is a great character and she's another great female addition to the roster. She has a great emotional ark and not only that, she is a strong character and a better dragon master than Hiccup that really holds her own. Eret is a nice addition to the cast as he is also comic relief, but also a interest side villain character. Drago is a fantastic villain and is really a cold hearted murderer. His method of mastering dragons really differs from Hiccups and its a great contrast that shows the different types of people that are in this world. I love how they build him up before actually revealing him. The animation and visuals are probably amongst the best I've seen from any CGI film to date. It is just breathtakingly gorgeous. The character's movements are so fluid and each character has their own way of moving. What I found really impressive is the facial animation. There are so many intimate moments in this film that require no dialogue and we can sense exactly what the characters are thinking from their expressions. There is always something happening in the foreground as well as the background and it's unlike anything that I've seen before in the medium. Characters could be taking in front of the camera, but in the background there could be an epic battle taking place. There is a lot to take in, but the director, Dean DeBlois, knows how to balance the visuals with well paced story. The layout and environment are also quite impressive. Every blade of grass, powder of snow, and water particles are just amazing to look at. The score from John Powell impresses again and really enhances the already great score of the series. It's bombastic, epic, touching, and moving. There is something about the score that really makes the film so much better than it already is. I was literally left in tears because of the score and how beautiful it is. I'm going to come out and say it. \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is a MASTERPIECE amongst modern films and a revolution in animation. It is a film that is going to push animation further and allow the medium to be taken more seriously. For a major studio production, it goes to places that the medium has only thought of, but couldn't really pull it off because of limitations set by studios and audiences alike. It is almost a near perfect film and I award it the highest 5/5 that I can. Now, is How to Train Your Dragon 2 better than How to Train Your Dragon? Not necessarily. In some respects, yes -- especially in terms of technical achievement and scale. That said, there's no right or wrong answer when it comes to a series this strong, and cases could easily be made for both films. But in terms of sequels, How to Train Your Dragon 2 has made some serious strides in delivering quality entertainment, and that makes it a must-see summer movie that all audiences can enjoy.",

Also (and not necessarily a bad thing) there seemed to be a shift in the character artwork and it felt akin to TROLLHUNTERS, which was also a DreamWorks production.

The storyline is virtually non-existent, there are strange things that happen through the film that wouldn't happen at all if the writers and animators had looked it through thoroughly before they started making the film, while making the film and just before finishing making the film they would have seen these problems and removed them so that their work wouldn't look sloppy unless of course they wanted their work to look sloppy in which case they did a truly brilliant job! For example, Hiccup comes across an area that after this part we learn is an area protected by the Alpha dragon who keeps the area safe and helps keep all of the dragons there happy. Well in this area when Hiccup first comes across it with his girlfriend (whose character has changed and is now completely the opposite to what it was in the first film, but then everyone's character has changed and so have the way some look!) there are dragon trappers there who surprise surprise blame Hiccup for the damaged caused to their fort/home/living area. Now as the area is protected by the Alpha dragon why is it that the trappers are (allowed to be) in the same area as the Alpha dragon while they are dragon trapping all of the dragons? Surely the Alpha dragon, the king of all dragons (as Hiccup was told he is by his Mother) would have seen them off? but he happily allows them to stay in the area trapping dragons for Drago! It was never explained why they were trapping dragons for him which was another strange thing about the film! Oh and then there's the strange thing where we find out Hiccup is now 20 years and his dragon, Toothless, is as old as him even though four years ago it was a baby! then there is the strange thing where his mother..... Nope I'm not going to go through every single anomaly in the film as there are lots of them, far too many in fact as there shouldn't be any at all! All of the anomalies, the characters' characters changing, some of their looks changing, a plot line that is thinner than a single ply tissue and is extremely and exceedingly boring, characters that if they were not in the film would not make the slightest bit of difference to anything, the fact that it tries to cater for everyone and in doing so ends up not really catering for anyone (ok so it does cater for everyone but only slightly/a little bit in each case, not enough to see the it through to the end) are only a few of MANY problems in this dreadful, dreadful, dreadful sequel!

It was already great in the first movie and now its even better.The story is where the problems come in. This movie is fun, and its great for a kids movie, but it is full of supposedly intelligent characters acting like complete morons. Most of the plot devices and conflicts are due to loss of logic and intelligence. This movie is bordering on Despicable Me 3 levels of how the characters figure out where other characters are and get to those places in like a minute of screen time. I know that they can fly around on dragons, and that there is some suspension of disbelief required, but this cliched mess is full of dumb plot devices. I did enjoy this movie, but there is no tension or suspense in it. There is however, a lot of stupid.",

It really makes you feel like you in the clouds with them gliding through the air. Trying to review this movie without spoiling it is really hard but just take it from me if you like HTTYD 1 you are going to love this movie even more and if you haven't watched HTTYD 1 go watch it before you watch this one.",

            "content": "Quickie Review:Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his loyal friend, a dragon named Toothless, over the period of 5 years after the first movie, have built a Viking clan at Berk that lives harmoniously with dragons. As Hiccup explores faraway lands he crosses upon the mysterious Dragon Rider, and learns about Drago Bludvist, a dragon hunter who is building a dragon army to take over the world. Hiccup and Toothless must face this madman before he ends the peaceful co-existence of humans and dragons at Berk. How to Train Your Dragon 2 (HTTYD2) is a great example of what a sequel should be. It builds upon the previous movie, further grows and develops the characters we love, and takes the story to places which most other animations would shy away from. A great, beautiful, and charming film for all ages, a must-see without a doubt.Full Review:When the first movie released I went in with low expectations and came out absolutely in awe and love with the movie. So with this sequel, my expectations were high from the moment I saw the first teaser trailer. Wow, HTTYD2 delivered in every respect, solidifying itself as a wonderful franchise in animation and film in general.I love the fact that we see the characters as young adults now, facing new challenges in their lives. Most animations would have to the freedom just start where they left off and stick with what worked. In HTTYD2 the film takes a risk to age the characters, and yet they all feel their familiar charming selves. They are the strongest part of the movie because their interactions between each other is believable and of course hilarious. There is a new significant character that is introduced, initially known as Dragon Rider. I don't want to spoil who exactly it is (even though the trailers did so), but the first encounter between Hiccup and Dragon Rider is very well executed and felt natural. Throughout the movie there are many emotionally impactful scenes. Especially the strong bond between Hiccup and Toothless is something that everyone will relate to, more so if you ever had a pet. Also the story is not afraid to take some dark turns. I like when animations don't shield their younger audience just because they are young and instead treats them intelligently.I should not forget to mention of course, the animation is gorgeous. I swear there were moments that felt like I was watching live-action scenes. It is that good. Every single flying scenes gave me goosebumps because it was so beautiful. Usually when I do these reviews I make short list of things I liked and disliked about the movie, and in the likes there is Toothless, in all-caps and multiple exclamation points. He was already an awesome dragon in the first movie, and somehow Dreamworks have turned him into an even more badass dragon! Why couldn't he be real!?There is very little to complain about this movie, but there is one noteworthy flaw. I didn't really care for the villain Drago. He felt a bit generic in that he is just evil and wants to conquer stuff for the sake of conquering things. So that could've been a bit improved but it didn't detract me much from my enjoyment of the movie.So if you are looking to have a fun adventure with great funny characters and emotional depth, look no further than How to Train Your Dragon 2. I watched it just few hours ago and I want go back and watch it again now. Do not miss out on this one.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "How to train your dragon part one was a refreshing and enjoyable movie. Part 2 on the contrary fails to deliver in my opinion.The special effects, dragon fight scenes and animation are superior. But I feel there is something faulty in the domestic scenes which don't involve fighting. The shallow way the mother reacts after 20 years apart from her son. The asinine way in which the chief dies in an instant but the other characters are all standing without a single scratch in the middle of 1000 fire breathing dragons which are mind warped ie. hypnotized by the alpha dragon is a little immature. Also how night fury manages to challenge the new alpha dragon is bewildering, considering the fact that both alphas looked to be a completely different breed. They were both 100 times bigger than normal dragons and breathe ice plus look somewhat like a Japanese Spider Crab. But somehow this tiny night fury defeats the alpha ... crazy huh?If you still thought its all well and good then you will enjoy this film. I gave it 6/10 stars because I feel kids would like this movie.",

            "content": "How to train your dragon 2 is the second installment in this trilogy. Its now five years later and most of the main characters are young adults. It's definitely a bold move. But it pays off nicely. The animation software used to build this film is amazing. The environments, characters, and dragons all look premium. Trying to watch the first after seeing this almost is unbearable its that good. Even if the first film has amazing animation. Which it does. Hiccups dad now is realizing his time is up as chief of his viking tribe. He wants to train hiccup in becoming the chief. But being young and rebellious hiccup just flies off on his pet dragon. Finding new unmarked territories. The relationship between him and his dragon is better then ever. The solid bond is made even stronger in this film. While in a new territory hiccup stumbles across a masked figure who takes him to a dragon colony. Its his mom. Yeah! Turns out that his mom ran off years ago and is living with these dragons. She knows nearly everything and anything about them. Not unlike hiccup. A little while passes and we finally meet the villain of this flick. Drago Bloodfist. He is for sure the weakest part of this film. While we learn emotional deep things about most of the main characters we learn nothing about him. He is a pretty pathetic attempt at a villain. If they tried at all. Once we meet Bloodfist the plot also thins out. A very promising premise is thrown away to try and have the emotion carry it. It attempts to cover it up in almost any way you can think of. Death, loss of limb, etc. Its sad to see it give up on itself like it does. All in all How To Train Your Dragon 2 is great kids flick filled with emotion, superb animation, and brilliant deep characters. But it does suffer from a flat plot line and a 2nd dimensional villain.",

I can say each one of them because... well, how rare that we can like almost all the characters in the movie? But, it does... in this one. I love the main character (which is also rare in my case) but the supporting characters are ALL exciting too, I even wish there're more scenes for them.

            "content": "The very first thing I have to say is that I watched the dubbed version. There were no original plays in my city anytime soon, so I had to go and watch the dubbed version. At times it was surprisingly bad dubbing for a great movie like this. IMO it partially ruined the movie experience.Despite the bad dubbing, this movie was AWESOME. The friendship between Hiccup and Toothless had become even deeper and funnier to watch. The animating had advanced a lot from its predecessor. There were so many amazing visuals and beautiful details during the movie. The flight scenes were so well made it felt as I was flying myself. One of the best 3D experiences ever.The only thing better than the visuals was the music. It was so beautifully made it gave me goose bumps. It was so.... I... There is no describing it well enough. You just have to hear it yourself.Only thing that got (only a little) worse from its predecessor was the storyline. It was fun and quite well thought but still a little confusing. The were missing pieces of information all over: Where did Hiccup get his flaming sword? (Coming in next season of DW Dragons, I recall) How had Stoick got so \"soft\"? When had Stoick and Gobber taken their new dragons? Why they brought Eret in with so small role? (he did only a little bit and still he got Stoick's dragon)Also after Stoick was killed, Hiccup doesn't seem to be grieving his father for very long and he doesn't seem to show personal hatred against Drago. It doesn't affect his actions visibly, witch isn't normal human behavior. This was a setback from the first movie.I think the movie was a little too focused on visuals by bringing too many new dragon species at once. The interactions of human and dragons were a little underdeveloped (excluding Hiccup, Toothless, Valka and Cloudjumper).IMO they should have released the third season of DW Dragons before this. They would have had more time to improve this one.It's also interesting to see what they come up with (if they even do) to fill the spot between this film and its successor that will be released in two years.Conclusion:What this movie loses in a plot that isn't quite as well thought as its predecessors, it makes it up in visuals and soundtrack. It is definitely the must-see-film of the year so far. I recommend this film to everyone: it makes you happy, it makes you sad and most definitely it makes you wonder why on earth can't you live in Berk and have your own Toothless.I give it 9/10, but it might rise to 10 after seeing it again (with original soundtrack)------ Update ------I re-watched the film with original soundtrack and it was a lot better. I raised the rating to 10, because now I understood the plot a lot better. If you didn't like the movie on the first time, I recommend you to re-watch it. It's definitely worth it.------ Update 2 ------I re-watched the film, again, with the original soundtrack. I still could find new details from the background. The visuals are just insane. If you re-watch the movie, follow the background actions too. There is so much details the eye doesn't meet the first (or the second) time.",

Action and scope are increased in this one, but more importantly, a significant emphasis on Hiccup's journey to find his identity and face up to responsibility. His belief that all people can change for the better is challenged, and a high price is paid in testing that conviction. The major relationships in Hiccup's life, his dragon and parents and girlfriend, are developed from the first movie with depth and maturity, with characters bouncing off one another vividly. Emotions run high -- the thrill of flying sequences, the humor of sarcastic comedic relief, and the gut-wrenching sadness of climactic narrative sequences.",

            "content": "Straight away I'm gonna say that I like this franchise, the whole idea surrounding Nordic fables of Vikings set within a fantasy realm with a vast array of dragons is really intriguing and exciting. This franchise is adapted from a large set of children's books which I've never heard of (until now) but admittedly they look really good...for kids.So after the first adventure of the Viking tribes befriending the dragons we are now presented with this idyllic world where the villagers of Berk live in harmony with the dragons. Many of the elder Vikings have adopted dragons as pets and ride them as their personal steeds as have the younger characters, of course Hiccup is best friends with Toothless the rare dragon. The main problem with the plot would be there isn't really anywhere to go with this that hasn't been seen and done a billion times over. Unfortunately low and behold that's exactly what happens, its basically about the villagers of Berk fighting against an evil pirate dragon trapper character and his huge evil dragon.This evil character really seems to have stepped out of the Disney Pirates of the Caribbean franchise seeing as he's basically a clich\u00e9d rastafarian pirate with a prosthetic arm (not quite a hook but its the next best thing). Now admittedly this guy is a bit of a merciless jerk and with that he does add some gravitas to the proceedings plus he looks well ard'. His gigantic pet uber dragon is the equivalent of the Rancor on steroids with some f*cking big tusks...it kicks ass!! This huge alpha dragon hypnotises other dragons (somehow) which enables Captain dreadlocks to amass a vast dragon army with which he will take over this fantasy world...although I don't really know why he wants to do that (don't question it).Of course its the band of plucky Viking kids that must save the day on their quirky dragons...cue lots of obligatory silly visual humour and gags for the kids. I won't go into the kiddie characters here because they are all the same characters from the first movie, as are most of the adult characters. What I really liked about this movie was the in depth and highly detailed array of dragons species we see. Once we discover the hidden dragon sanctuary in a vast ice cavern (created by another uber dragon...this time a female one), the visuals go into overdrive with dragons everywhere. Its like looking at a cave full of colourful butterflies all rendered perfectly in CGI, seriously its such a beautiful spectacle to behold. From here on there are dragons everywhere yet it never becomes dull or repetitive...it just looks super sweet.I don't wanna spoil it too much but I gotta give kudos to the uber alpha dragon clash. This is easily the standout sequence in the movie and it is impressively slick looking as these two humongous beasts ram each other with their jumbo horns and roar a lot. It really felt like I was watching a battle from the animated 'The Clone Wars' show...only a gazillion times better looking. I loved how the camera follows the flight of some dragons around like some crazy roller-coaster ride, nothing too outstanding these days but it looks awesome. With each passing animated movie the visuals just keep getting more glossy, more magnificent and generally spectacular.I still dislike the choice of Baruchel for the voice of Hiccup...I mean I really don't like it, its so fecking annoying. Everyone else fits into their roles well (or as before), Butler again giving us a lovely Scottish Viking. But when its all said and done this movie like other animated movies is all about the visuals and visual humour, and this doesn't disappoint. The plot is a tad boring, sure it offers some little moments, some tiny twists...but essentially its a very safe bog standard affair (I realise its based on a book but still). The characters are well developed and designed, most of the dragons are also well designed (some looking too silly and freaky for me) and the main battle is right up there with any big live action fantasy adventure.Obviously not quite as fresh as the first movie, it takes its time to pump out the thrills but it definitely gets there in the end. I think the fact it appeals to all ages really makes this franchise a winner. Much like 'Toy Story' its so damn likable, who doesn't enjoy dragons in a movie?! In the end this movie (franchise) made me wanna live in this sumptuous little universe with my own pet dragon, what more can I say?...a job well done movie.7/10",

The films have a consequence that Pixar would never use, since they don't want to scare the family audience. The second part of How to Train Your Dragon is equally beautiful then the first one. I just saw him twice and it's technically very good just as the content. Some people say that there are too much effects and the emotional part isn't represented as in the first one.

            "review_title": "A sequel that confirms the \"How To Train Your Dragon\" films as my favorite animated movie series of all time.",
            "content": "THIS REVIEW IS HEAVY ON SPOILERS! THIS REVIEW IS HEAVY ON SPOILERS! THIS REVIEW IS HEAVY ON SPOILERS! THIS REVIEW IS HEAVY ON SPOILERS!I will start this review with something important: I am the biggest \"How To Train Your Dragon\" fanboy you will possibly ever meet. I have praised this movie's predecessor to no end as my favorite animated movie of all time, and waited excitedly for its sequel this summer. Because I loved the first film so much, I was incredibly anxious going in. I was totally expecting some aspect of the movie to go wrong, whether it was the aging of the characters, the new villain, or just the plot itself. I was NOT expecting, however, a movie that, in many ways, was better than its predecessor. And \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" did just that.The first thing that stuck with me about the movie were the visuals. When I saw the first movie, I was amazed at how detailed the environments, characters, and dragons were. I knew that HTTYD 2 would be slightly better, but the visuals in this film were just DROP DEAD GORGEOUS. Every single detail seemed to have been cared for, whether it was the fur on Hiccup's armor, or the eyes of Astrid's Deadly Nadder. When viewed in 3D (like I saw it) everything is amplified by a factor of a thousand. These movies are made only better by the inclusion of 3D. The last thing I'll say about the movie's animation was the lighting. This movie has some of the greatest lighting I've ever seen in an animated film. I have no idea what they're doing different, but it just gives every scene an added bit of realism.\"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" takes place 5 years after the original movie, and as you've probably seen from the trailers (or from the movie itself) the characters have grown up as well. I was at first uneasy with this concept; very few films I've seen that have taken on the challenge of aging characters have done it satisfyingly to the point where you can believe it. Thankfully, the true character of these characters remains in tact, while their attitudes towards each other and the world around them change (just like puberty in real life... well, maybe it was just like that for me... I DON'T KNOW LETS ALL AGREE TO DISAGREE). It makes Hiccup's struggle with becoming heir to the throne seem realistic, it makes all of his previous arguments with his father seem less sophisticated (a good thing, it shows maturity in the present), and it makes the interactions between Hiccup and Astrid and the others seem genuine and realistic.A new concept added in this movie to the HTTYD franchise is death. Two deaths occur in this movie, one minor and one major. The minor is of the Alpha Dragon, the leader of all dragons, in one of the fight scenes. The major death is the death of Hiccup's father, Stoick. I was honestly shocked when I saw them kill off Stoick; coming from the perspective of the first movie, I thought they would narrowly avoid the concept of death with minor injuries (as in the first, where Hiccup only loses a foot in a death defying fall into a ball of flame). After the death of the Alpha Dragon, I thought, \"Well that's just a plot point, they'll brush it off.\" However, after the death of Stoick I had NO idea where they were going to take it. Death had been foreign to this movie's environment right up until this very scene, and it hits hard for both the characters and the fans. The movie handles it in a dark and beautiful fashion, using it as a way of portraying the tragedies of war, and the love between a father and son. It also helps give Hiccup's mom a role. She tells Hiccup about how Stoick never gave up on him, and always knew he would be the greatest warrior of them all. And you know, people may hate on the fact that the mom isn't very emotional in this scene (I mean she only saw her husband for what, a day or two after twenty years?!), or that her character is unnecessary, but in this scene, she ROCKS it. She is heartfelt, understands what Hiccup needs to hear, and delivers it in an emotional and beautiful speech. Her moment here actually sold Stoick's death as a plot point for me.Because I'm low on words, here are the very few complaints I had about this movie. First off, Hiccup appeared less upset than the others at his father's death at both the funeral and when he first realizes Stoick is dead. Like, SIGNIFICANTLY less. Everyone is crying, and he just stands there in shock. However, I have heard from people who witnessed death this suddenly that there is a sort of shock induced initially where almost no emotion is produced. I just was expecting Hiccup to break down completely after such a huge loss. Secondly, I thought that the movie's villain, Drago Bludvist, was rather lame. Sure, he had an intimidating character design and some very impressive villain powers (ok, I'll admit, his abilities were quite evil) but as a character I thought it was rather uninteresting and didn't add much to the story.In conclusion, How To Train Your Dragon 2 is an incredible film. It builds upon the previous movie with confidence, creates epic new characters and lands, succeeds at the ever so daunting aging process, and packages it with stunning visuals and more Toothless and Hiccup adorable-ness. I mean really, what more could you ask for?10/10",

The dialogue seems forced and unnatural, the plot conveniences are too glaring to forgive, every single side character feels completely useless as they have no reason for being on screen except to deliver not-that-funny one liners here and there. And to top it all off, the animation hasn't really improved from the first film. If you've seen an animated movie before, you'll be able to stay one step ahead of the movie the entire time because it's unbelievably predictable. There's a scene where Hiccup is captured (pretty inexplicably?) and when his captor takes off her mask and you see his captor is woman, I audibly said \"That's his mother isn't it.\" And it was! Towards the end of the movie Hiccup is in \"danger\" and I audibly said \"don't tell me his dad is going to sacrifice himself for his son.\" And he did! This movie will throw the shallowest of plot twists in the feeblest attempt to keep this movie interesting, and as a result, none of this makes any sense. Hiccup and his father finally see his mom after 20 years and everyone's okay and back to normal in like 5 seconds. The villain's motivation was basically just \"I'm evil and I have a deep voice\" and Kit Harrington's character kept switching sides for what seemed like no reason. This sequel isn't exceptional in any way, it's unforgivably average and mediocre, which is really upsetting considering how much I liked the first one.",

(except for the distances, which was the same in the first ^^) I always watch a movie at least 3 or 4 times before posting a review: and at least once fully awake and once half asleep. And the result was conclusive: I enjoyed it thoroughly every single time. Technically, story-wise, and emotionally, it most definitely achieves its goal: being at least as good as the first, and even slightly better.Still. because there always is a still, and that this one isn't exactly minor. After each time I watched it, I couldn't help but realize that I did not have enjoyed it the movie so much as WISH I had enjoyed it. ANd yet everything was good or better, so why? The answer I found was... time. In actuality, I could not enjoy most of the events of the movie for the simple reason they all went too fast: as soon as the feeling of delight starts, you are thrown into something new, which leaves you suddenly empty, and by the time you are into the new situation, the next one is about to come. In my opinion, this movie should be roughly 40 minutes longer. Now, I know it would bring it up to around 2h20m, but I believe that the length of a film doesn't matter so long as it's justified.So, Dean Deblois: very nice job, but please don't rush your movies in the future; it's such a shame :/",

But we also get a new insight into his people and his family, and I'll admit that was engaging to watch.

I felt it surpassed the original by far in engaging the viewer, even as an adult. It did a perfect job of taking the original and amplifying it (rather than so many sequels that just water the original down). There wasn't anything that stuck out as a negative to me, which is very rare indeed. See it in 3D if you can; it only adds to the action!P.S.(I loved seeing Craig Ferguson's role significantly included; I have a newfound fondness for him and will miss his voice on late night TV soon!)",

The slightly older Hiccup, Astrid and Toothless push all the right buttons and all the right times. Taking us on a journey that is sublimely written and doesn't stutter for a single second. The action is fast paced, the villain is chilling, the backdrops are stunning and we get to know every character that little bit deeper. The relationship between Hiccup and Toothless could be THE most powerful, believable and dynamic friendship ever to take place in film. Their bond is so fantastic and so compelling to watch that it makes me feel warm and fluffy inside.The music which carries on perfectly from the first film perfectly sets you up for the emotional roller-coaster you are put through. But the true champion of this film is the story. Its outstanding. A great follow on from the first that helps us love every character more and more whilst pulling hard on ever heart string available.

The movie shows everything a typical animated movie does - love, loyalty, friendship, courage and a bad bad villain. But this movie takes it a notch higher to the point of killing a very main character (something we don't usually see in lighter animated movies), which came as a good surprise (I do not want to spoil it for you any further).

I felt such a strong connection to Hiccup and Toothless and their bond was really well told. All of the characters were more in dept and multilayered than in the previous HTTYD. The story was believable and I liked how Hiccup was searching for what he was meant to be. It was far from predictable and kept you on the edge of your seat. The animation itself was gorgeous. The dragons were very original considering there are dozens or maybe hundred of different dragons in this film. The environment was absolutely beautiful and convincing. The soundtrack was magnificent, both thrilling and emotional. Without spoiling anything I must say that the soundtrack is a great contributing factor in making me cry at a certain point in the movie.

My favorite moment between Hiccup and Astrid is when Hiccup pulls Astrid in for a kiss near the end of the movie. What was also great to see was how Hiccup helped Astrid win the game at the end when he grabbed the black sheep and threw it into Astrid's basket. One other great thing about the movie was the music and how it was as good as the first and again specific themes were used to represent certain things.

            "content": "The animation genre, despite being in a relatively nascent stage, is fast becoming prevalent. With over fifty movies in the last two decades, competing studios such as Pixar and DreamWorks Animation are consistently rendering animated fare. Needless to say, not all of the above are of a satisfying quality.An adequate analogy for animated movies is their comic book counterparts. The latter has every major studio investing millions of dollars in CGI, which has paid considerable dividends. However, as is the case with animation, some products will always be better than others.Sadly, How to Train You Dragon 2 falls in the inferior bracket. The major shortcoming of Dragons 2 is its lack of originality. While its predecessor was a breath of fresh air and retained endearing qualities in abundance, the new installment is a victim of sequel syndrome and missing a captivating spark.Adapted loosely on its namesake books by Cressida Cowell, the narrative transpires after considerable passage of time, with unlikely allies Hiccup and Toothless' bond becoming stronger as a result. Furthermore, the Viking brethren have accepted dragons into the fold. The emergence of Hiccup's mother, long assumed dead and a new threat named Drago, a dragon hunter, and causes major upheaval for the duo.A wider canvas and earnest story with emotional resonance prove significant. In a story about dragons, human sentiments take center stage. The film reinstates the essence of family and the variation of design and characteristics of the title characters are exquisite. Animation is driven by the potency of innovation and imagination and Dragons 2 is an excellent manifestation of such qualities. The dragon armada specifically merits an honorable mention.Moreover, director Dean DeBlois tackles mature subjects such as the age old predicament of poaching versus preservation. Also, a one legged teen befriending a handicapped dragon is a fantastic metaphor for acceptance and forbearance.Dragons 2 also adds Cate Blanchett, Djimon Honsou, Kit Harington and Kristin Wiig to the voice case although only Blanchett's talents are utilized competently. The others only enjoy fleeting dialogues at best. The accents are executed in a flawless manner, with the returning Gerard Butler the pick of the bunch.While DreamWorks have produced a plethora of animated movies, they have not enjoyed the resounding success of standard bearers Pixar, whose stock in trade is an excellent animation aesthetic and unique storytelling.An organic extension of the original and better than generic animated family movies, Dragons 2 is definitely bigger but not always better, unlike the original.",

            "content": "The first entry into the How to Train Your Dragon universe soared effortlessly into the upper reaches of my chart of favourite films. To this viewer, it was a defining example of what animated cinematic storytelling is\u2014the embrace of the opportunities afforded in executing breathtaking visual sequences, and doing so with such gusto and conviction in conveying visceral emotion. Though it had a simple (and not at all groundbreaking) storyline, I was drawn in by its heart and sincerity. Judging from its box office run, it's not a stretch to say many audiences were as well.All high praise indeed, and really then, attempting to follow How to Train Your Dragon with a sequel that rises even higher would seem to be impossible.In several key aspects, How to Train Your Dragon 2 accomplishes this feat. Its technical animation is stunning in detail and sophistication. The scenes of flight, though inevitably lacking somewhat in emotional weight compared to their counterparts in the first film, are visual masterpieces in cinematography and computer generated artistry. The backdrop of lush flora, the precise character and dragon expressions, the fantastic lighting, and lively colour palette are markedly upgraded in this entry to the series.John Powell's fantastic score from the first is matched here, though sadly none of the new themes reverberated with me in producing as much wonder as say, Test Flight did. Still, motifs both old and new are incorporated with apt timing and enough emotional texture\u2014from deliberately delicate to triumphantly bombast\u2014to carry several scenes throughout the entirety of the film.At its core, the first movie was the story of an almost childlike discovery of friendship and trust in a strange creature, and now inseparable companion\u2014both on the part of Hiccup and Toothless. The sequel advances this into the story of the discovery of personal meaning and maturity from the duo, in an incredible exemplification of the hero's journey in a coming of age adventure. The parallels between Hiccup's and Toothless's respective journeys adds welcome depth and impact to the story, and the movie intertwines them with stirring heartfeltness and resonance.How to Train Your Dragon 2's potential to be a glorious example of how to make a sequel however must be tempered by the fact that it has flaws in its storytelling that simply were not present in the first. Most immediately, the relative subtlety of humour in the first film is completely cast aside, replaced with unwelcome and sometimes crude jokes that interrupt the flow of more than one scene. Most disappointingly of all, the pacing of the story and its delivery is far looser than it could have been. Though still by far excellent, it is guilty of leaping from one story element to another in a far more staccato manner than its predecessor\u2014a masterpiece with its methodical and organic development of Hiccup's and Toothless's relationship in a wonderfully fluid story.These criticisms mar what otherwise very well might've been a film that joins the first as a lesson in the cinematic joy and bliss animated movies are capable of, and arguably even perfect for, delivering. Still, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is so very close to doing so that like the first, to miss it is to miss what makes the cinema and animated films in particular such an extraordinary medium.",

Dragons now all live in Berk and everyone gets along great until a man named Bloodfist (if that's not the most clich\u00e9 villain name ever I don't know what is) begins rounding up dragons to start an army and take over the land. Meanwhile Hiccup (being played again by Jay Baruchel) finds his lost mother who has been keeping dragons safe under the protection of an alpha dragon. Now they must team up with the dragon riders of Berk to stop Bloodfist.If this doesn't get some kind of visuals award at the Oscars I'm gonna be angry because this movie is beautiful. I got the joy of seeing it in Imax 3D and it's so freaking amazing to look at. The animation is amazing, you can make out like every hair on Hiccups chin. The flying scenes make you feel like you're right there on a dragons back taking out the enemy. I don't know what else I can say besides how amazing and fun it was to watch. Now with the good also comes what may be somewhat of a nitpick. So bloodfist has recruited his own alpha dragon to use against our heroes alpha. Here's my problem, what he does to recruit dragons for his team is tie them down, swing his club in the air and scream at them. He doesn't like scream a special chant or anything, he just screams like some kid with very bad autism. I maybe, just maybe can understand how this could work on smaller dragons but this alpha dragon is bigger than the queen dragon from the first movie and he somehow got it to listen to him by waving a stick and screaming like a kid who didn't get the McDonald's toy they wanted? It's tough to believe but everything else in the movie completely makes up for this plot hole. There's a major character death in this movie that I won't spoil but it actually left one of my friends in tears and my other friend fighting back tears. If a movie titled How To Train Your Dragon 2 starring the guy who plays a stoner in 90% of his roles can make someone cry then you know it's doing something right.By far the most fun and entertaining movie I've seen so far this year and I can't wait for the 3rd one.a 9.5 from me.

How to Train Your Dragon 2 has given all what you've wished for as a great sequel.The plot sure does heightened into an epic installment, it could have been an easy throw away of cool effects, battle sequences, and humor, but the movie is smart to keep on following its own roots by settling more on the characterization of their world and Hiccup's life with his dragon and the tribe. To keep it from being a wheel spinning visual showcase, the story embeds itself with full of inspired emotions, example is when it explores the icy dragon cave. It wasn't only an exposition, it is mainly a developing relationship between Hiccup and his long-lost mother. The quieter moments of letting the once disconnected family reunite again captures the same heart of the boy and dragon friendship of the first movie, which certainly made it pretty endearing.The film also spends its time exploring more places around and beyond the Isle of Berk. It's quite interesting to let the years pass by and make the young vikings grow mature, and how it depicts their maturity is pretty clever, like the hormonal attraction of Snotlout and Fishlegs to Ruffnut, in spite of fact their comic relief get a a bit way out of hand. The dragon species were also given enough intriguing details, essentially for the plot, which sort of recalls the book series of Cressida Cowell. This is a rich universe that makes the whole journey even bigger.The voice acting is predictably great. Jay Baruchel still brings the same earnestness to Hiccup even when the character's new appearance has outgrown his voice. Gerard Butler remains to be perfect as Stoick The Vast, he lends more gravity to the character in this one. Cate Blanchett joins in and she appropriately gives a great amount of warmth to the role. The other cast did well enough at keeping things much alive. For the filmmaking, the direction handles a better pacing compared to the other quicker cuts of the last few animated films. It's an easier way to watch by concentrating each scene of getting know of the characters, either with or without any dialogue. The flying scenes have always been a tremendous ride with scale and fortitude. John Powell's score helps making it feel much powerful, and it gets even better with a J\u00f3nsi song in it.Apart from Disney, these are the only animated films of Hollywood today that have a wider ambition other than selling off kids with cool visuals and absurdist humor. There is an actual story to be found here, even without following its source material. The typical elements of Dreamworks are still there, but is hardly noticed. It's nearly like the first film, except of course it's larger. It does justice to today's family fare, somewhat forgetting the current mediocrity and rather fills it with inspiration from the past. One thing that is missing in most of the genre's attempt of transcending their films is the sincerity to its heart. Every affection in How To Train Your Dragon 2 never felt forced and right there it soars way up high. And if we have learned something about training dragons from the past, then it is the same thing about sequels: You don't just yell at it.",

Too many sequels are cash cows designed to take advantage of loyal fans of the franchise. This is not, I repeat, IS NOT one of them. The studio (which is struggling from several financial catastrophes in the past few months) has undoubtedly struck gold with this. It keeps the same winning formula found in the first film and makes it grander. The soundtrack, for example, is every bit as distinct and moving as the movie's forerunner in John Powell and J\u00f3nsi's capable hands, but is more moving, more emotional and more dramatic. That isn't to say Dreamworks doesn't progress the storyline. Everyone ages several years and, without any spoilers, there are huge changes to the dynamic of the story that other franchises would be too afraid to make. At times, it's dark. It's mature. It made this Welshman cry. It's also beautifully crafted; the animation is remarkable, breathtaking and vast. I would be lying if I said it was anything less than the best animated film Dreamworks has ever made. Please see it.",

Seeing Hiccup try to find who he is now that he's a young man was powerful and then what happens around all that, wow! I loved the music and the story as well as Toothless and the other dragons.

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon was a surprise hit, even to Dreamworks- the studio that released it. The masterfully animated and scored story of a boy and his dragon captured hearts and minds everywhere and naturally lead to a franchise. Much like it's predecessor film, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is packed full of tons of heart and humor but it does something unexpected, like it's characters- it grows up.It's five years after the events of the first film. The little Viking town of Burk is now a bustling and active haven for dragons. When Hiccup (Baruchel) and his dragon, Toothless, discover an ice cave that is home to thousands of dragons and Hiccup's long lost mother. After meeting fellow dragon rider Valka (Blanchett), they must fight to defend the safety of dragon and human alike from the evil Drago (Djimon Hounsou), an evil dragon master who plans to build an army of dragons to control humans.The whole gang is back and more hilarious than ever, but they are older now and have new fights and complaints. Snotlout (Jonah Hill) and Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) now vie for the affections of Ruffnut (Kristin Wiig). Astrid (America Ferrera) is now a full fledged Viking warrior woman and looks awesome flying her dragon around with just as much skill and bravery as Hiccup does. Hiccup is no long the scrawny, nerdy, and self-doubting lad he was before. He's a self assured twenty year old man who has found his place atop the back of his trusty dragon best friend, Toothless. Baruchel's voice is just as nasally as ever but when the movie turns serious he can pack an impressive emotional punch. Astrid and Hiccup are the cutest Viking couple and having now been together for years, they save the audience from any awkward first steps of love. It's refreshing to enjoy a young couple with a healthy relationship, making it possible for them to just be there for each other when they need it.John Williams delivers another exuberant score and the music he composes is somewhat outside of his traditional canon. Williams usually arranges in a more classical realm, but like Toothless and Hiccup, he goes above the clouds and beyond with his Gaelic inspired and overwhelmingly beautiful pieces for the How to Train Your Dragon films.There are many beautiful and poignant moments that make up HTTYD 2. One is an early conversation with Astrid and Hiccup- the scene is very well written and helps the audience naturally relax into their relationship. Another is a scene where Stoic (Butler), Hiccup's father, is reunited with his long thought dead wife. All of these little moments are so well written and exquisitely executed you might forget you are watching a movie made for children, and that is why these movies ascend from other Dreamworks pieces. Hiccup is faced with many adult emotions and it's fascinating to watch him explore them, but on the flip side it's also fun to see cute dragons show off some slapstick comedy. Just because a movie is marketed for children does not mean it can only be enjoyed by children. The How to Train Your Dragon movies are examples of lovingly crafted films made for everyone.See more at: http://www.mediumraretv.org/review/how-to-train-your- dragon-2/#sthash.7h5iwGbv.dpuf",

            "content": "I loved the first How to Train your Dragon and I was really upset when it didn't win the Oscar that year; I still say it go robbed by the sentimental favorite Toy Story 3. So I couldn't wait until they did it again. The first promo looked promising but the more I saw the subsequent trailers the more I worry about Hiccup and Toothless story getting lost in endless dragon battles. For the record I agree with a lot that they really need to rethink trailers that give away crucial surprises in the story; it's getting to be quite irritating. Also I feel that things they mistake for drama and heart really seem to fall flat and that is the case with this sequel. It really kind of turned into a sappy, preach feast that really lacked the emotional impact of the first movie. And the ending monologue by Hiccup was really awful; it sounded like he was giving a political speech instead of wrapping up a kids film. I do have to say that the visuals and animation are still the best I've ever seen second to Frozen. They really do a great job with the aerial sequences and they kept some of my favorite music from the first film, though I would have like to have had more great new music. Again some his and some misses but we still love the characters and the dragons.",

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsExciting, emotionally resonant, and beautifully animated, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" builds on its predecessor's successes just the way a sequel should. The entire film is a romance - of visuals, of sprawling vistas, of the ecosystem, of parental sacrifice, of camaraderie, and mostly of the special bond one shares with a pet (don't the dragons, especially Toothless, bear a stark resemblance to our canine friends; not so much in their appearance but more in their mannerisms). It has a richness that's highly compelling; especially in the way it explores the complex relationship between man and beast. Moreover, it's got the emotional, humorous, exciting sweep you want from a summer movie. And hats off to Dreamworks for offering some bold surprises in a wonderful sequel, filled with copious moments of fun and resonating sequences, which genuinely tug at your heart strings. To achieve this among the film's ample noise and movement is all the more praiseworthy.It's been five years since Hiccup and Toothless successfully united dragons and vikings on the island of Berk. While Astrid, Snotlout, and the rest of the gang are challenging each other to dragon races (the island's new favorite contact sport), the now inseparable pair journey through the skies, charting unmapped territories, and exploring new worlds. When one of their adventures leads to the discovery of a secret ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons and their mysterious Dragon Rider, the two friends find themselves at the center of a battle to protect the peace. Now, Hiccup and Toothless must unite to stand up for what they believe while recognizing that only together do they have the power to change the future of both men and dragons.Although there are times when bits of the movie feel extraneous, the production as a whole comes across more like an organic extension of the original tale than something tacked on purely to score at the box office; something that can't be said for most sequels of well- received blockbusters. This is truly a rare sequel - animated or otherwise - that expands the story of its predecessor without rehashing it, and an even rarer family-oriented film that manages to be fun and mature without being condescending to its audience. And yet, the sequel doesn't attempt to take things in a completely new direction, choosing instead to expand its world and characters with great success.With multiple Oscar-nominated British cinematographer, Roger Deakins (Skyfall), advising, the film's visual work is beyond stunning. Another bright spot in the movie are its characters, they pile on the charm just like they did in the first film, and you end up actually looking forward to the third part. Credit for this must go to writer and Director, Dean DeBlois, along with the brilliant voiceovers - most noteworthy being those provided by Jay Baruchel, Cate Blanchett, Gerard Butler, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, Kit Harington, Kristen Wiig, Craig Ferguson, and Djimon Hounsou.Funny, big-hearted and - as you'd expect - a visual feast, this is a family film in every sense, and one to be lapped-up by both kids and grown-ups alike. It continues a very compelling mythology that I hope carries in to the third film. \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" isn't just a great sequel, a great animated spectacle, or a great example of successful franchise-expansion/world-building. \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is flat-out great film, period.",

There are also plenty of distinctive characters, mostly adorable and hilarious in their own ways so the film is generally fun to watch! The animation is stunning, the plot is admirable but sad to say that there is not much authentic dragon actions (the dragons are being controlled most of the time) and it is not emotional enough. Perhaps they did not intend to make people to get emotional and tear but I really feel that deaths should, at least be given more elements or screen time to it ... I don't enjoy the fact one of the dragons that I am fond of just die (quite easily too) and be gone forever. </3 Nonetheless, it is a great 3D animated film and for a second I thought I started to develop acrophobia by watching this film! This film also make me want a companion dragon, so bad :<",

The bond between Hiccup and Toothless is a heartwarming one, and seeing Toothless come back to him despite the Alpha's control was a great scene. The plot is cut and dried, with an obvious redemption arc, a token sacrifice (which was still well played in the moment), and Hiccup being the obvious hero while everyone else stands around watching. Exactly how the Alpha via Drogo controls other dragons, and how he was taken down at the end, were pretty vague, as was Drogo's specific reasoning to put together an army and take control now when it seems like all he needs is the Alpha control to get everyone. Astrid was more or less ignored by the film. I honestly didn't find it convincing from a coming of age perspective - Hiccup doesn't learn about himself, he just saves the day with Toothless. It's still an interesting world and the plot mostly works, and you still end up rooting for Hiccup and Toothless. Mediocre, but not quite a disappointment.",

            "content": "And this is why...The first How to Train Your Dragon touch the hearts of adults and children alike. However it fell a little short in the graphics department and had details I couldn't help but notice. For example, why, when they have said there are multiple kinds of dragons do they only six? Also when Toothless's tail is damaged why was there no wound or trace of the tail flap? These are minor details when considering this is a kids movie, and when the story makes up for its short comings. I'm not going to give this movie slack just because it's mainly targeted to children. If I used that as an excuse then I might as well give Food Fight slack. (If you don't know this movie GOOD. Let it stay that way). The only reason I say this is because I understand it had limits because of its target audience, but even with its lower rating the first movie did great. Then in the sequel found what was missing in the first. This is probably because the creators had received a bigger budget thanks to the first. The sequel takes place five years later and shows that many of the characters have changed. The animation is a lot better and you can see many new dragons. While the characters do change in appearance some have the same personality as the first movie. Stoick is still hard headed, but you can see he's truly proud of Hiccup. A few of the jokes are ridiculous, but the overall story clearly takes more precedence. Also I want to say this; why do so many people have a problem with Stoick dying? Did you complain when Mufasa died in the Lion King? What about when Jack died in Titanic? Did the deaths in these movies make you think they were terrible just because it didn't have the picture perfect ending with everyone happy and care free? Death is a factor in life, nothing can change that. People will get emotional about death. This also won't change, but to say this changed how you feel about a movie is honestly unreasonable. It carries purpose and pushes other characters forward. I think that if Stoick got his wife back and that it was happily ever after then it makes the movie unrealistic. That's why I give it more points for it's choices.Overall this movie turned out to be a lot better than its predecessor. It's worth watching and it was worth the cost of the movie theater ticket. If you haven't seen yet you truly are missing out. Go see it.",

I like the way the young characters now look more mature and bad-ass. The voice acting, just like in the first movie, is great. I especially enjoyed Jay Baruchel and America Ferrera's voices.Now comes the bad parts. The story is just all over the place. It contains two main plot lines that have little to do with each other, and the movie spends the whole first hour jumping back and forth between them, trying to connect them and establish the plot but still fails to explore any of them thoroughly. Every event happens too fast and too suddenly that viewers just don't have time to truly feel any impacts they have. The characters, especially the new ones, seriously lack real emotions and convincing motivations. Any emotions that they do have, just simply don't last long enough as they usually get interrupted by the terrible pace. As the result, everything feels really forced, vague, and frustrating.The jokes are also awful. They get repeated a lot and most are either too childish or just lame.Overall, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is not a bad movie. It's actually quite entertaining thanks to the action and the great visuals, but still pretty messy and underwhelming, especially compared to the first one.

Toothless and Hiccup both preserve their humorous personalities from the first movie. The animation made Toothless a really unique and cute character.The movie's score resembled that of the first movie, but had also developed to suit the environment and setting of the second, still sounding amazing.This movie is pretty much easily the best animated movie so far this century. It has continued the legacy from the first movie and further developed it, making it even better.I give this movie 15 STARS!",

            "content": "I recommend this movies to families especially, but anyone can enjoy it with the exception being perhaps very small children (for mature themes). How to Train Your Dragon 2 manages to even surpass its predecessor, avoiding the sophomore slump in spectacular fashion.The visuals and music were absolutely stunning, melding together without seams. You know you're in a good movie where sometimes, you don't even say to yourself, \"Huh, this is good,\" but simply watch and enjoy. With this movie, I was fully enraptured. I watched in 3D, which made the cinematography even more breathtaking. Some movies are converted to 3D to make money, and I'm generally leery of feeding the cash-gobbling movie studios without compensation, but HTTYD2 has plenty of scenes to justify the additional cost of a 3D ticket. You'll still enjoy the film without the 3D, but it definitely adds to the scenes in HTTYD2, unlike in some other films.The plot is noticeably darker, but the mature themes are handled well (with some tears might I add, and I'm a stoic person!) and leaves plenty of material for the sequel to explore. DuBlois makes a good choice to have Hiccup, the 20-year-old protagonist, face the realities of life here. Without such lessons, the film may have fallen into simply a visual stunner with no story. DuBlois' film ultimately succeeds because of a plot written for not just the visual thrills, but also the believable character development and world-building.Summary: Must watch. I'm already considering watching it again and adding it to my DVD collection, and I'll certainly watch the third film.",

If I could go back and see it again, a thousand times for the first time would be miraculous to get the feel of it over again. I just couldn't wait to see this movie I just wish I could of planed a party to see this. Everything about it was so vivid and emotional, drastically improved and well stoked in fire and dragon stone. The only thing that could make this better would be if I could be a part of this story. The music was awesome every scene had the best songs. The chars had well improved characteristics and action, animation was so beyond anything I could learn to achieve. I really have this idea to introduce at least one dragon because the story compels a desire to be apart of the hoard. I for once don't have any wish to take Hiccup's shoes in his story like on many other protagonist, instead I would love to be there as a side character. I can't really say my impressiveness any more then this already. The great family oriented moments were to live for. Ah I certainly can't stop thinking about everything that went on in this so vivid like a waking dream. I hope the other has more of this up their selves, even if its a different scenario. I would like to see more of Hiccup's story but anything else way would be awesome as well.",

            "content": "A quick confession before starting this review. When How to Train Your Dragon came out in 2010, I thought it was a silver lining in the underwhelming slate of Dreamworks films. It had interesting characters, beautiful animation and imagery, a brilliant concept, and an even more brilliant musical score. And unfortunately, I did not see the original film until after its theatrical release when it happened to be on HBO. After fixing this mistake I felt an instant feeling of regret. It had a strong message and overall theme that made me realize animated movies can still pack a punch like they used to. And now four years later we finally have a sequel. And I saw it in IMAX 3D!Did it deliver?.....Absolutely! Many talks early in development for this sequel was that it was going to be handled in a style alike to \"The Empire Strikes Back\". I could personally agree that the film is more than worthy of such a title. The story this time around features an older and much more adventurous Hiccup and the undoubtedly lovable Toothless adventuring what lies beyond their home of Berk, until they discover a threat to their new found peace. There is a five year time jump that shows us how much these characters have grown, physically and progressively, which gives you more to be invested with. Hiccup still has his wit and spirit, but is still shy of how some aspects of the world work. It's a large theme that runs its coarse, and pays off in ways that one couldn't of seen coming. For a movie with an aim mostly at young kids, it can pack a very emotional punch. Every actor in the roster brings everything they have and more to the table. Rather it's Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler as Hiccups father Stoick, or the fantastic addition of Cate Blanchett as the mysterious dragon riding liberator Valka. And if you thought the score for the first film by John Powell was good? He outdoes himself. Every time you think a scene couldn't get any more exciting or even heartbreaking his majesty plays each instrument as if they were individual emotions. And with the brilliant addition of Icelandic musician J\u00f3nsi, there is a particular with Hiccup and Toothless flying side by side in which he sings along with the John Powell's theme. It was one of the most exhilarating and heartwarming things I've ever witnessed on the screen.This summer has had no shortage of great movies. Rather they are about a giant radioactive lizard, a patriotic super hero, or time traveling mutants. But having a movies whose heart that's just as powerful as it's visual trills takes the spot on my list. From it's stunning imagery to the emotional guy punches. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is not only the best animated movie of the year, but it's one of the best in general. And that applies as well to sequels in general, for I will be returning to the cinema again to help ease my anticipation for the next one!",

            "content": "\"This is Berk. Life here is amazing. Dragons used to be a bit of a problem. But now they've all moved in...\" and with this starts the next installment in the \"How to Train Your Dragon\" series. Five years have elapsed since the first time Hiccup and Toothless met. Hiccup is now twenty years old and more in tune with his dragon friend, Toothless. People of Berk, the small Viking village have comfortably settled in with the Dragons who are now a vital part of their lives. Hiccup is our usual shy and unconventional Viking who spends more time exploring new lands than heeding to his father's talks of succeeding him as the chief! Trouble, however, has a way of finding our hero and this time they are against a ruthless, conscienceless villain who will not stop until he has dominated all humans and enslaved all dragons!Can Hiccup and Toothless stop this evil man before it is too late?The movie starts with a super entertaining and simply breath catching aerial performance by Hiccup on the back of his too cute and cuddly dragon, Toothless. If you thought the first movie was awesome, wait till you watch this one.Definitely more darker, deeper and mature, the story presentation expertly balances wit, humor, emotions, action, adventure and a spine tingling end. The plot is beautifully adapted for the screen that doesn't follow the conventional follow up path from the first movie but takes an unexpected course which delightfully surprises and heightens the interest of the audience. The direction is as usual crisp and Dean is able to keep up the rhythm of the movie. The viewers are kept at the edge of their seats with twists and turns that shock and make you gasp while making you pray for a happy ending!The animation is top class and the voices of Jay Baruchal, Gerard Butler, Cate Blanchett etc. make the characters seem so real that it sometimes feels like we are there amidst all the action and adventure!Hiccup is all grown up and totally cute with his innocence and individuality. Toothless is my absolute favorite with his expressive eyes, cuddly almost baby like antics and his fluid conversion from cute into a brave warrior whenever there is danger. Astrid is her usual fiery and brave Viking self who often guides Hiccup when he is confused. Stoic, Hiccup's father is endearing, boisterous and although exasperated with his son, is always ready to do anything for him. This is the second movie which has made me go after unconventional wishes like hoping to befriend and train a dragon of my own! The first movie that ever influenced me like this was the Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone which made me wish for owls as pets and have floo powder for travel! :) I laughed with Hiccup and Toothless, felt proud of them like a parent, wished for an adventure like theirs, wowed over the beauty of the unexplored lands, was shocked and then frightened, cried with them and finally won along with them. All these and more experiences make this movie a must watch in my list and I know I will eagerly await the next in the series! :) If you haven't watched the movie yet, then go watch it. This is a must watch for children and adults alike. 10 super glowing stars to \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\". I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and hope you do too. :) This review is also available on my blog Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff",

After years now I bought the second part and watched it and hmmm... emotionally nothing happened. The only thing still super touching is Toothless, who is quite in the backround in this movie. But for the rest, well, it just get's too unreal. It of course had a touch of unreal when in the first part Hiccup's father understood his son in the end, said sorry and changed his behaviour. (in real life that is something that probably doesn't happen ever, but we all wish it did)\nBut in the second part now, they just overdid it for me. Hiccup meeting his lost for twenty years mother, who is of course the wise dragon lady. Both are not awkward but HIccup just makes flapsy jokes and the mother is all wise and in no time they smile at each other and everything is fine. Next, HIccup's dad finds out his wife is still alive. And after these two people parted in anger twenty years ago, they just kiss and then dance and again - everything is fine?And apart from that I couldn't help myself but getting annoyed of Hiccup with his behaviour. His father tells him, and rightly so, that there indeed are people who are evil and won't change their views and ways. He underlines this with telling him a story, that Mr. Bloodfist caused a whole hall of vikings to die in fire, and Hiccup still doesn't care and goes onto this mission to just talk the evil master out of his evilness? In in doing so, he endangers his loved ones, Toothless several times and with his behaviour, he actually causes the death of his own father, who tried to warn him. What is the message of this movie supposed to be? Just talk to psychopathic terrorists like Bloodfist and they will understand and from then on be nice people? Sorry, but that was just too much, and instead of touching me that movie annoyed me mostly.Also the actually wonderful soundtrack themes of the first part go totally under in the second movie due to too much action sequences for the sake of it.I understand that they want to have a positive message in these movies, and in the first part they did it so perfectly. But in the second part they just overdid it and made the shown emotions between people seem totally unreal and kind of forced.\nI still have to watch the third part and really hope they get back on track with it.",

            "review_title": "How To Train Your Dragon 2 - Did it top the 1st film?",
            "content": "How To Train Your Dragon 2, DreamWorks Animation SKG's exciting and amazing second instalment in the How To Train Your Dragon series, was recently released in the UK, nearly a month after the release in the US.Set 5 years after the first film, Hiccup and the gang (20-19 year old's), now young adults, enjoy the simple and amazing life on Berk, and compete in the popular sport, Dragon Racing, whilst Ruffnut, now the only single female on Berk, must deal with the constant actions of Snotlout and Fishlegs as they try to win her heart. But, Hiccup is not one for the competitive sport, and is constantly out mapping out the world with his best friend and beloved Dragon, Toothless, and enjoy practising their flight sequences, and increasing their bond even more. However, on one outing with Astrid, they soon uncover a new foe, Drago Bloodfist, who intends to raise, and control a dragon army with only evil intents in mind, and when Hiccup set out to talk reason into him, he is kidnapped by a mysterious dragon rider, astride a four-winged dragon, but soon learns the rider to be his long lost mother, Valka.After the first film, I was very amazed and excited to learn that 2 more films were to be created, and did not think it was even possible to top the first film. However, I was very wrong. The animation in this film is visually stunning, especially in 3d, with the environments very realistic, and every texture and detail as real as the actual things. The characters have been developed very well, both in appearance, actions, voice, etc., to show how they have aged since the first film, whilst using the same voice actors. Each character is displayed well, showing their personalities and relationships to others, such as Hiccup and his father Stoick, now 50, who act like old chums, but still occasionally have a disagreement. And the beautiful relationship between Stoick and Valka is... There's not a single word that can describe how beautiful it is, especially in the scene when the two sing 'For the Dancing and Dreaming', and when they were reunited, and Valka believed for him to yell at her for not returning. Instead, I believe DreamWorks created a beautiful relationship in just 9 words. \"You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.\" Which actually made me very emotional, and I cried quietly for a good 5 minutes, and it really makes the ending all the more emotional, especially with the other character's reactions.John Powell, the score composer for the first film, has also written the soundtrack to this film, and combined the tune of How To Train Your Dragon with the voice talents of Jonsi to create the song 'Where No One Goes' which features at the start and the end of the film. Jonsi had previously written 'Sticks and Stones' for the ending song of the first film, with one of the verses being sung in Icelandic, and 'Go Do', another one of his songs had been used for one of the adverts for the film. I am very glad DreamWorks had asked him to create songs for the film, as they fit perfectly due to how the songs have been written and performed. But other than Jonsi, John Powell's soundtrack fits the film absolutely spot on, and fits the emotion and atmosphere so well, it made the emotional scenes even more emotional, such as when Stoick and Valka were reunited.Packed with a new kind of adventure, lovable characters and daring storyline, How To Train Your Dragon 2 has definitely received my vote for Animated film of the year, and I am glad the third film is due to be released in 2016, and I believe on June 17th in the US.In one of the TV adverts, 3 quotes used to describe the film were: \"Braver than Brave\", \"More Fun than Frozen\" and \"The Mother of All Animated Sequels\", and I couldn't agree more, as this is not just aimed at children, the way it has been created has made it suitable for all audiences due to the fact that it has it's laughs, but also the beautiful relationships shown between Stoick and Valka, and Hiccup and Astrid. I believe this film also teaches a valuable lesson about courage and friendship, as it is strongly shown throughout this film.However, I believe that DreamWorks should have developed more on Drago Bloodfist's story, as I believe they did not develop his character as well as they could. Also, DreamWorks seemed to be self-confident about the idea of the release, and I believe they released to many clips of the film, giving away a lot of spoilers, though, they did alter them slightly so they weren't exactly the same as in the film.Overall, I am rating this film 9/10 Stars, as I believe it was worth the 4 year wait, and the entirety of the film was breathtaking, and worth my time and money, and definitely recommend it.",

The music fits the movie perfect, it really doesn't even make me feel like i am watching an animated movie. Some of the scenes were so real looking it blew me away. Jonsi who does the theme song for the movie did a amazing job at making a song that fits the movie so well. My friend and I were kinda surprised that it was a PG movie because it has a much darker story and very surprising deaths. It could have been PG-13. Little kids that were in the theater had to leave because there are some scary scenes. But I am looking forward to the next movie in the series.

Glad to say that I was truly impressed and very pleased with this movie, my children raved about it and we all left the cinema happy. Is it as good as the original? That I am not sure about: the charm of the original; the growing friendship between toothless and hiccup; made the first film endearing, a \"bromance\" between dragon and boy. Dragon 2 is a great movie, indeed I think it is a brilliant, exciting and captivating movie; but there were more action scenes (which seems to be the norm for sequels: to include more action and CGI to pad out the story line) that started the warning bells ringing. I say this only because I note that Dragon 3 is already in production and I fear the descent into an all-out action movie. There was some character development in Dragon 2, notably between Hiccup and his mother, but there were a lot more 2D characters; the story that begs to be told is the relationship between Hiccup, Astrid and their dragons. Although I enjoyed the action, I missed the character progression from the original film leaving some of the main figures in the background. In summary, a great film, but worried that it might become too action orientated in the next installment.",

            "content": "In the director's own words, \"This movie is an odyssey through a dream, both tender and nightmarish\". The latest installment of the \"How to Train Your Dragon\" franchise (2nd part) surpassed its predecessor in terms of depth of story. This movie's story takes place five years after where the previous one's story came to a halt. The main protagonists of the epic adventure, eccentric teen Hiccup and his tamed dragon Toothless have helped the Viking tribe, Berk community, to build a society where humans and dragons live alongside in harmony. Once while exploring uncharted territories, Hiccup and his friend Astrid came across a humongous ice fort where they met a notorious dragon entrapper who works for an insane conqueror, Drago. Against his father's will hiccup set off to stop the inevitable war and ran into a mesmerizing 'Dragon Whisperer', Valka who happened to be his long lost mother in a castle. That fortress was an icy stronghold that was erected by the titanic ice breathing 'Alpha' dragon and in a dragon clan all the other smaller dragons abide by the Alpha. But shortly afterwards their hideout was compromised and Drago's massive army, that included another alpha dragon, overwhelmed the entire dragon clan. During the battle Hiccup's father was brutally murdered and the winner Drago left the battlefield with all the dragons of the dragon clan bewitched under the hypnosis of obedience of the Alpha and shockingly, Toothless was one of them. Afterwards Hiccup invaded the alpha's army and his love for Toothless broke the spell of hypnosis and with the help of the fearless \"night fury\" Toothless, Hiccup and his meager army consisting of barely a handful of teen soldiers brought down the tyrant's reign. This is pretty much the storyline of the movie but somewhere along the line of presenting this utterly soothing story this movie transcends the obvious appeal of the story and takes the audience to a magical voyage to a land of extremely vivid imagination. It sometimes feels like an emotional roller coaster, sometimes feels like a story of vengeance, sometimes mundane but mostly blissful. This movie also portrays a perfect coming of age tale as young Hiccup undergoes the phase of sever indecision whether to succeed his father as the chieftain of the Vikings community or not. This movie is set in a surreal world where dragons coexist with human but the portrayal of the events made all of this believable and the audience can relate themselves to the flow of events as it leaves quite an ample space for imagination to run wild. The director (Dean DeBlois) is triumphant in his creation as the audience can't but feel attached to the characters that bloom so vibrantly as they behold the magic unfold in the midst of some exquisite storytelling. It starts as a fairytale but somehow sheds the childish image as it provides deep insight regarding to ego conflicts, everlasting friendship, animal-human bond that transgresses the premise of a standard fairytale. It is also a motivational story as it makes us believe that only one determined person is enough to bring about a radical change or revolution irrespective of his age, physical size or social stat-quo. DreamWorks animation studio has always been one of the leading achievers in the field of animated movies and in this movie the quality of animation is nothing less than extra-ordinary. The voice acting of well-known stars like Jay Baruchel (Hiccup), Cate Blanchett (Valka), Gerard Butler (Hiccup's father) was superb and the director's (who also happens to be the writer and screenwriter) stroke of genius made the movie captivating throughout its entire course of 102 minutes runtime. There are no noteworthy downsides of the movie apart from the predictable plot twist that featured the family reunion of hiccup and his lost mother. Though it was presented as a twist, the audience could see through it even before it took place. But then again, this movie doesn't focus on unfathomable or unforeseeable plot-twists as it never aspired to present the vibe of a thriller movie. This movie's genre can be categorized as fantasy, comedy but in wholesome perspective, it's a genre defying experience as it doesn't remain loyal to any single genre in particular. Overall, this movie stirs up thoughts and as the end-credits start to role, the audience has a hard time leaving the fantasy world. Fayruz Maysha",

The flight sequences are just as amazing as they were in the first movie with some incredible animation with some real talent behind it's style and designThe villan is also scary and intimidating which is great to see, most Dreamworks villans in the past have been good but the one in this movie is actually ruthless and monsterous to a point where it will scare kids and feels like a threat.The lore of the world of dragons deepens as more is discovered about the source of the dragons and the home they live in aswell as more being learned about Hiccup's familyThe movie is an incredible achievement from DreamWorks that continues the story of dragons into darker territory with once again the imagination and talent behind the animation team at DreamWorks shining through once again pushing the bar higher on what can be done with animation",

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2(2014) Staring: Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou, Kit Harington, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, T.J Miller, America Ferrera, Craig Ferguson, Kieron Elliott, Philip McGrade, Andrew Ableson, Gideon Emery, Simon Kassianides, and Randy Thom Directed By: Dean Deblois Review THE TRAINING IS OVER. You know when the first film came around I did not want to see it, but after I saw how many good reviews it's sequel was getting I decided to watch the first part just to catch up to speed. It was actually pretty good. But holy crap was this more fun. This film now has Hiccup traveling to new worlds with his Knight- rider dragon Toothless to find more dragons to keep safe. He is meant to be the new chief but doesn't want the position that badly because he doesn't know what kind of person he is. Among his travels he upsets a Dragon snatcher who is capturing as many as he can for Jargo Bloodfist. Hiccup meets his mother and brings his family back together to stop Jargo from controlling all the dragons. These films in particular are interesting kids films that I'm pretty sure any kid would like to see, if and when the third film does come which I'm pretty sure it will, it will probably be the best of the trilogy because this is actually based on a series of books the first book of the same name. The movie is more engaging and fun then the first, it exceeded my expectations, I wasn't looking forward to this either like I said word of mouth made me change my mind so I had to see what all the fuss was about. Jay Baruchel is voicing Hiccup once again and delightfully so, I don't any other voice would fit the character. Gerard Butler voices his father and he was the best actor in the first film and he steals the show yet again in this sequel. I can't tell who voiced who when it comes to the rest of the cast but i still found them all to be good as well. The direction is every bit as good as the first film if not even better. I really liked the 3-D animation this film everything is moving so fast that at times the film feels so energized during the flying and fight sequences it's like a jolt. All the elements of a good animated motion picture are present it has good pacing, fun sequences, and a nice cast to top it all off. I give How to Train Your Dragon 2 a four out of five.",

And Drago may be a better villian than that giant queen bee dragon, Drago has this weird ass yell that he does while he spins a javelin. And also when he dies, there's no body and he basically just falls. But the soundtrack is amazing And the stakes are high, and once again, hiccup and toothless, their relationship is the best part about the movie. So, not perfect but as it's own movie, it's great.",

The movie starts off with a dragon race as Stoick , the chief cheers for his future daughter in law, Astrid. Hiccup is away with Toothless, they share an adorable scene together and you can see why they are the best buddies. Astrid visits Hiccup and learns about his father asking him to take the responsibility of the village and his people by taking over as the Chief. As Hiccup ponders where his destiny lies, he comes across someone he never dreamed of meeting.The villain here is an evil dragon master, Drago who plans to take over the island of Berk. What ensues is a great battle of the good vs evil between Hiccup, the noble dragon master and Drago who is merciless and believes in taking over by force.There is a heart-breaking scene between Hiccup and Toothless when their friendship is put to a test. Toothless displays utmost loyalty and Hiccup shows a great deal of courage.The characters are all well sketched and get you hooting and laughing through out the movie. The epic battle between the dragons is a visual treat.Overall, it is a wonderful movie and a must watch for all animated movie lovers!!",

The animation keeps getting better, I'm always surprised about that but this movie is jaw dropping for that. And 3D, I'm not a fan, but this movie, needs to be watched once in 3D. Better than the first in so many ways. Voice acting and the script, top it, but those were short little blurps so not big. Watching it, you walk out of the theatre wishing it was 2 years later so you can watch the third. Movie of the year, and this movie puts a real high bar on great sequels and technology. What are you waiting for, go out and see this movie this weekend. I promise you won't be disappointed.",

The original characters have the same quintessential essence but the new characters introduced are equally interesting and awesome.The story, oh the story ! Dreamworks, thou art mine favorite animation studio. The story escalated gradually into an epic appreciated by everyone who saw it. It will bring out every emotion one possesses into light and will tear out your heart from your chest. Of course if that doesn't melt you, John Powell's symphony & music will. There is something for everyone, including teenage girls as hiccup looks a little dreamy. The story also expands on various fronts.A well deserved end to such a great movie.",

            "review_title": "Simply stunning!",
            "content": "Simply put, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the reason I go to the movies. In a story that is much darker and more grown up than the first entry, Hiccup and Toothless both go down a road of transformation that is as emotional as it is thrilling. The world is bigger and the dragons are exponentially more magical. Especially Toothless, who is officially one of the greatest computer generated creations of all time. His mannerisms and emotions are equal parts of any number of animals, yet he still feels like a creature that you could find if only you looked hard enough. Also of note is John Powell's score, which soars just as high as it did in the previous installment. It's majestic and beautiful in a way that can only be described as breathtaking. DreamWorks Animation seems to be in the business of churning out family friendly sequels that exist to retread what worked in the previous film and not trying much new. But make no mistake, HTTYD2 is much more akin to The Empire Strikes Back or The Dark Knight than it is Ice Age 2 or Madagascar 2. This is a new story with new characters who are faced with some tough decisions that have consequences. I can't wait to see where this series goes from here and how then end up capping off this trilogy but Dean DeBlois and Co. have set the bar very, very high with this entry. How To Train Your Dragon 2 gets my highest recommendation, as it's absolutely a must see movie for the family as well as for anyone that is still young at heart.",

It's a little darker (though there are humorous moments scattered throughout it), and if you're looking for the goofiness from the first movie then you might be disappointed. Personally, I really enjoyed this one. Possibly even more than the first.

In my opinion, the film had a fluent story throughout and did in fact include more of the book which was very nice to see. When friends asked me about seeing this film how did you feel and i said in the exact words \"A Roller-coaster Of Emotion\" and that is so what it is.<---------------------This Paragraph Contains Huge Spoilers-------------------------> You get to feel what \"Hiccup\" feels with the bond he has with \"Toothless\" and it was nice to see \"Toothless\" defy the Alphas control at the end because that showed true friendship and it even touched me in a sense. <---------------------This Paragraph Contains Huge Spoilers-------------------------> Another introduction in this movie is \"Valka\" Hiccups mother which is an interesting move for the movies because it gives a back story not only on this film but the one prior to it, and its nice to see that him and his mother love the same thing and that is \"Dragons\", and you get to see their incredible relationship develop even more throughout the movie.<---------------------This Paragraph Contains Huge Spoilers------------------------> And then there's the crank in the works that i did not see coming and that was \"Stoicks Death\" this scene was very intense and very dark for your usual family animation film, but with this scene came the realisation that Hiccup was meant to be a Chief. Stoicks send of was an incredibly moving scene and brought tears to my eyes, the way they used traditional viking send offs was incredible and you really could feel the emotion of that scene. <---------------------This Paragraph Contains Huge Spoilers-------------------------> And lastly there is the antagonist \"Drago Bloodvist\" and might i say he is a very good antagonist as well, he gives the film its darkness and reality and even more so its brutality. Drago like Valka gives this film and the film prior more of a back story due to his and Stoicks meeting which ended up in flames. He one of the two characters in the film has an alpha and seeks to control all dragons for complete control over humans. And his alpha ends up having complete control.<---------------------This Paragraph Contains Huge Spoilers-------------------------> The last part of the film is probably the most powerful part of the movie and that is the retrieval on Toothless and taking back Berk from the control of Drago and \"Hell Yes!!!!\" that is such a badass part of the film.In a conclusion, this film packs a punch of emotion that will touch all audiences, and i highly recommend that you go and see this film because it is unlike any animation you have ever seen. The film was absolutely incredible and such an incredible feat for DreamWorks Animation, and i cannot wait to see the next \"How To Train Your Dragon\".",

Having seen the Dreamworks Dragons series as well as the first movie(multiple times), I believe I do justice in saying that this was a very apt culmination to the great build up. The emotions are more personal as all characters are grown up and allow the young adult generation to identify ideals such as sacrifice, leadership and love. At the same time, the maturity is shown only in glimpses to keep the realm still limited to childhood thereby keeping its younger audience spellbound. The decision to include such grand dragons and to include the lost hero like feeling in Hiccup gave the drama a very Arthur-esque touch. The bond between him and Toothless seems stronger than ever and is given ample screen time with enough ups and downs and the desire to perform that daring maneuver with perfection lasts till the end with a cliffhanger. While the last movie was about Hiccup changing others' views about dragons here he grows suddenly into responsibilities of a leader and is thrust in danger to lead his clan from its worst threat ever. Coming to the phoenix theme as we have seen in Harry Potter, Gladiator and Spartacus, the ultimate hero rises from the ashes of his loved ones. The resemblance is not lost here( for details watch the movie). But at the same time this serves a dual purpose as he also gains a new mission in life and finally understands his purpose. The finale of the whole extravaganza is not in hindsight. With an able captain at the helm a new script can maybe make this series a very successful trilogy.",

They elaborated on how the lives of the characters changed and how Burk adapted to this new age of dragon training.We also see a huge expansion of story, both in the world and with the characters. We see a whole backstory to Hiccup's mother and more story with his father. Through this we are introduced to how large the world is as Hiccup travels far from home. He finds his mother in a natural dragon sanctuary and there he learns a bit more dragon lore, like the concept of alphas. More breeds of dragons are introduced as well.Now that Hiccup & friends have become familiar with their dragons, they're able to do more, which resulted in a lot of action, as well as the opportunity to introduce a villain that causes a great climactic battle. With more action came more emotion as well. Going back to the mom, there were a few emotional scenes relating to her reunions. There was also a very impactful moment between Hiccup and Toothless when Hiccup was trying to snap his dragon out of the trance he was in, further enforcing the deep bond they share.",

This gave me an excellent viewpoint (with the first fresh in my mind) to rate the second film.The second film, after the critical success of the first, is what you would expect - bigger, louder, faster and with excellent attention to detail. Various positive aspects from the first film continue throughout the second - most notably the stunning visual effects, the personality of the dragons, and the charm of the characters.In addition to this the film makers also went down the route of creating a story and a setting more vast than the first, which was primarily contained within the village of Berk - this time, the heroes and their dragons branch out from their homeland to discover some disturbing developments far beyond their town borders.I thought that, for the most part, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' succeeded in creating a story that was large enough and vibrant enough to outdo the original in the series. Being set 5 years into the future the characters were older but more mature, new characters were interesting and the action sequences were also excellent. Continuing from the first, the score was second to none.The one area that the sequel couldn't live up to the original in was it's charm and emotion. It is clear that the film presented more of Toothless' cute side and tried to create emotional connections through the use of new characters, however in my opinion the second movie in the series fell slightly short in being able to recreate the beauty and simplicity of the story in the first film. I also thought that some of the sequences in the second film didn't quite hit the level of the first.All in all 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is a great film - it achieves a new level of visual beauty through the vibrancy of the locations and characters (dragons), and contains more action and slightly less depth than the quirky first film of the series.",

The ending just seemed so rushed out and lazy. It's like the people who wrote the script ran out of stuff to write. I was expecting a lot more from the sequel of one of my favorite films but I didn't quite get it. The rushed ending left me quite disappointed. But in general it was a great movie for adults, teens and kids alike. I would recommend it for everyone who is a fan of How To Train Your Dragon 1 and who knows, maybe it will work out for them better than it did for me. Well, for anyone who is going to watch the movie after my review, good luck and have a great time!",

More mature ambiance and surprisingly fun battle. I love Stoick and I hate what happened to him. Toothless is adorable as usual. Valka is beyond my expectation, glad she didn't turn into clich\u00e9 animation character that would actually kill the movie. Alpha's fight too short, I would really love to watch more of it. Overall, a fine movie for the holiday with your kids. So much worthy than any other kids-flick this week.",

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the rare animated sequel that both goes deeper and is just as exciting as the original. The story takes place some years after the events in How to Train Your Dragon, the kid characters notably having matured to about their mid-teenage phase, and notably more experienced in their flying-dragons trade. From the beginning, it accepts the cooperation between Viking and dragon, flying and diving through the air, and we never doubt the logic of it.As the characters are more mature, so is, appropriately, the story, being more complex and darker than the original, without ever feeling like it's trying too hard to accomplish that. Hiccup and his loyal dragon Toothless are back, doing more impressive feats, going further and further from their home, exploring beautiful new environments and encountering new things, some friendly and many not. Our other Vikings and giant flying lizards in all their varieties (and solid voice work) are back from the original, and we see some new ones, including terrific sinister villain. But I hold back on telling too much, for to give much beyond the premise, and early scenes of discovery, would be a disservice to viewers coming to see it.This is an exhilarating, creative, and gorgeous piece of work, with hardly a dull moment to be found. It's not quite a perfect or near perfect animated film, with some tired humor and a bit of a rushed ending. Still it's one of DreamWorks' best efforts to date, so definitely see it.",

This movie further explores more about dragons and the family history of protagonist. The movie ,unlike other sequels, adds charm of its prequel and further develops the story of \"How to train your dragon\" in a very beautiful way. After watching the prequel, I did had lot of expectations with this movie, and it simply went way ahead of these expectations. The story starts with Hiccup learning new tricks along with his friend Toothless and discovering new lands. the interaction shown between Hiccup and Toothless is like nothing. The film beautifully portraits an ideal friendship. As the movies proceeds Hiccups discovers a mysterious cave of thousands of dragons and a dragon rider(whose identity is a mystery) and all the action begins. The story has full doze of thriller, action, excitement and emotions, which are further enhanced when watched in 3D. The way story develops is just awesome. The bursts of action, along with pinch of humour just makes an already perfect storyline even better. This shows how well movie was directed. Even though it may look like a \"children movie\" like other animated, like other animated movies, but I assure you that of whatever age you are you will love this movie. This is film in its finest. It's not a movies for some quick money, but a way to communicate to viewers what it really means to selfless, caring as a friend and a hero, all the things that we had aspire to be. In my views this movies is just perfect.",

I loved the first one, it was a sweet children's film filled with adventure and love, had excellent humorous moments and a brilliant story with brilliant morals. How to Train Your Dragon 2 has all that, but is much more mature for older audiences and much more intense in the adventure department for young ones.

Like many, I was concerned when i heard they were making a sequel to HTTYD. However, I was not disappointed, and if you liked the first movie, you won't be disappointed either.HTTYD2 was expertly crafted. The animation is impeccable, and the soundtrack matches the movie perfectly. The story was crafted in such a way as to be full of action and drama, while still maintaining that endearing touch that made me love the first movie.HTTYD2 is more emotionally charged than the first movie. The story line is somewhat darker, though not oppressively so. The movie has matured along with the characters, it seems. In addition, the action scenes are more intense and may not be suitable for younger children.That being said, I think that Dreamworks really outdid themselves with this movie!

            "review_title": "Lacks the originality and charm of its predecessor.",
            "content": "This sequel is a huge disappointment. The main problem lies with the narrative. While the original endeared viewers by eschewing the obvious and common narrative of good-versus-evil, encouraging people to be more understanding of others and finding nonviolent solutions to longstanding conflicts, the sequel instead revels in violence both to establish the plot and resolve the final conflict.To quench any moral qualms a viewer might have after internalizing the message of the first movie, the second one focuses its action on a suitably hateable, mean-looking, rough-sounding cardboard cut-out of a villain (boringly named Drago) that wears his intent to dominate and destroy on his sleeve.Visually, the movie looks just as stunning as its predecessor, but often the visuals don't match the narrative, as if there was little coordination between the script writers and the animation team. For example, the movie opens with a beautiful overhead shot of the gorgeous Viking settlement, Berk. \"It may not look like much\", Hiccup's voice-over comments without sarcasm. Doesn't look like much, really? Are we watching the same scene?More serious is the disconnect between narrative and visuals in the depiction of violence. In the movie's second act, two major characters (one dragon, one human) die violently in battle, but without any trace of blood. In fact, despite the extensive battle scenes, there are no visible injuries of any kind in this movie (excepting a broken tusk, and of course some fully-healed stumps). I understand that this is supposed to be a kid's movie, so obviously the animators didn't want to go all-out on the blood and gore, but it also feels wrong to make violent conflict look so inconsequential. Again, there seems to be a disconnect between the writers, who play up the violence for dramatic reasons, and animators, who tone it down to avoid scaring the children.The final confrontation between the villain's Alpha dragon and the hero's Toothless is similarly jarring. Visually, the Alpha looks like a hulking beast, thousands of times larger than any of the regular dragons, likely able to demolish Berk with a single charge. However, the plot dictates that Toothless will now defeat the Alpha, and thus this giant dragon does nothing but stand still and growl ineffectually. \"Fiiiight!\" the villain yells desperately, as he realizes his downfall approaches, and for once I sympathize.All in all, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is not a terrible movie, but it's so unoriginal that it's basically interchangeable with any of DreamWorks second tier works.",

I'd completely forgotten it was coming out Friday, so both of us, ecstatic, decided on that movie.I went in expecting a great film.I came out blown away.I can honestly say I've never seen a sequel better than it's predecessor, but How To Train Your Dragon 2 does nothing but improve and top the first one.The music was the best I've heard in a very long time. The story introduced so many things that was simply another piece of master storytelling. The relationships in the movie, especially Toothless' and Hiccup's, were written to their absolute strongest.After all the films I've seen, all the shows I've watched, all the books I've read, I have never come across a friendship stronger than Hiccup's and Toothless'. The way they write that relationship is just . . . it's never been done before.The story itself is actually pretty simple and actually a really short story, but it's a story you could tell the writer fell in love with. And he brought this story to the best it can absolutely be. The villain was chilling, the characters' outcomes were emotional, and the climax will completely shake your soul.I have no complaints.

More action-packed and thrill-seeking than it's predecessor, it soars high above the standard sequel expectations and takes its place as both standing alone from the first movie and enhancing it.One of the things I respect most about this series is the elegant storytelling. It transcends the usual methods of communicating information to the audience and brings beautiful, raw emotion into the story. These movies tell the tale of probably the most powerful friendship I have ever seen, and the bond between Hiccup and Toothless is largely formed without words, so nothing unnecessary or cheesy is thrust in.Unlike so many family movies, with which I can always diffuse the suspense with the reminder that everything is no doubt going to return,a-OK to the G-rated status quo by the time the credits roll, the How to Train Your Dragon movies are filled with a sense of consequence and danger that cannot be denied. The emotions are beautiful, heart- wrenching, bittersweet and laugh-out-loud humorous, leaving you feeling, like any movie should, as if the characters are friends you've known for ages.Like the original, the flight scenes are breathtaking, but taken up several notches by improved technology. It was meant to be \"filmed\" like a live action movie, and you can definitely tell, with the gorgeous, moody lighting and camera angles. I just can't describe how much of a joy this movie is to look at. I mean... textures, oceans, ice, clouds, DRAGONS, flames, explosions, inventions! All rendered in reverent detail, not to mention the way that we see it! You'll leave feeling like you've actually been on a dragon. It's brilliant, and with everything that's going on, you simply have to see it multiple times to get the full effect. Dreamworks has spared no expense.The relationships between the our favorite Vikings and dragons have blossomed and it's very easy to get sucked into the struggles, sorrows and triumphs of these beautiful characters.I give it a 9/10 only because my 10/10 is reserved for my personal favorite, the first movie, which is equally incredible but in very different ways.",

I was sitting in the movie raptured at the start but at the end i just couldn't avoid a thought that came to my mind which went something like- \"meh..\"I think if they had spent a little less time showcasing the carefree dragon frolicking and spent some more time strengthening the action scenes it would have been a far better movie.

I love how they aged the characters up, I feel like this is so rarely done in animation. It really gave us a chance to grow with them in a way. I feel like there is SO much story to tell about this universe and these characters. The characters are so well written that its hard not to fall in love with them. And don't get me started on the beautiful animation. The attention to the littlest detail is amazing. Little things that didn't need to be animated to move the story along were done so masterfully. You could see even the most minute of emotion animated into the characters eyes, or the smallest wince, or a pencil twirl, its completely amazing. Every time I watch the movie, I find some other little detail to be amazed at. The animators did such a great job, that its almost hard to believe that these aren't real actors in a real place that can really exist. Bottom line, I walked out of the theater the first time wanting more. I wanted more of this universe and these characters. It made me go back and re-watch the first movie a bazillion more times. It made me buy the DVDs for the series and watch all 40 episodes in earnest, just to get another glimpse into the world.

And though there's no glaringly obvious way to fault How to Train Your Dragon 2, (the animation was top notch, the creature design was fun and not completely uninspired, the voice acting was above acceptable and the storyline was enjoyable in a tidy beginning-middle-end kind of way) but it had neither the wonderment of the first film nor did it invoke the passion of more harshly-rated franchises.In the way that some movies you love despite knowing they're awful, I can't say that I love How to Train Your Dragon 2 despite being quite sure it is good.

It is a movie for children, the father may have been left badly injured, stay in unconscious until Hippo won the battle and so his mother could have cared father hippo or else he may have been disabled as was hippo and so there was no problem that hippo was leader of the Vikings I was sad that Toothless remain as a murderer, many children cried about it including me I suggest the writer if the sequence continues to try to correct that mistake, the idea of \u200b\u200bthe movie is to motivate and entertain children and adults we like this kind of movie so beautiful.

            "content": "The original How to Train Your Dragon is a film that didn't quite make it onto my radar when it was released in theaters in 2010. Coming from Dreamworks Animation and featuring a cast of voice actors that didn't really pique my interest, the film just looked like another pale Pixar imitation. However, when I finally discovered it after its home video release, it was a revelation that filled a much-needed void in my movie- watching catalog that I hadn't even realized was missing: a pure and full-hearted family adventure.Needless to say, I hold that film in extremely high regard and have endlessly pushed it on all friends and family who have not seen it. But How to Train Your Dragon was almost perfectly complete in what it was, so the potential for a sequel to sully this underrated gem seemed very high. Rest easy though, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is an amazing film that has matured with its characters while delivering on almost all elements needed for a sequel to outshine its predecessor.One of the extremely smart moves made by returning writer/director Dean DeBlois was to take a page from the Harry Potter franchise by aging up its characters with each new installment. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and all his crew are full-on raging hormone teenagers, complete with early facial stubble and hopeless crushes on their female mates. Rather than waste a movie slowly developing the main romance, the film wisely starts out with Hiccup and Astrid (America Ferrara) already an item, comfortable in their adorable relationship.Things get moving quickly when Hiccup, instead of accepting his now aging gray-bearded father Stoick's (Gerard Butler) offer to let him take over as chief, stumbles upon an island that houses unfriendly dragon trappers fronted by Eret (Game of Thrones' Kit Harington). After a brief altercation, Eret lets slip that their leader Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou) is coming for all the dragon riders so he can kidnap and add the happily integrated dragons of Berk into his ever-growing dragon army. Through his quest to warn Berk and peacefully achieve a truce between Stoick and Drago (who have a history), Hiccup encounters a mysterious woman named Valka (Cate Blanchett) with knowledge of dragons beyond even his own.The story has plenty of twists and turns, and surprisingly goes to a few dark places that most family films normally do not tread. While this sequel definitely has a darker Empire Strikes Back feel to it, the film doesn't completely lose the wonder and adventure that made the first one so irresistible. The flying sequences are exhilarating, and Hiccup's extremely clever flight armor suit is one of the coolest things in movies this year. His relationship with Toothless is also the core of the film, and if you've ever owned a pet you can't help but have your heart melt whenever they interact. Toothless just may be the one of the best non-speaking characters in modern film history, and that's a true testament to the impressive work the animators did on this one. The Night Fury dragon is so expressive with his face and body language to a degree that he almost always steals the scene. Additionally, the landscapes are absolutely breathtaking, especially when paired with the vibrant impressive designs of thousands of dragons. Audiences will need to buckle up for the unrivaled visual feast with this Oscar-worthy output from the animation team.The voice cast all do exceptional work, especially Jay Baruchel, who takes his portrayal of Hiccup up a notch with this coming-of-age version when compared to his ongoing work in the Dragons animated series. Gerard Butler will most likely have the most memorable role - he's given some really great material here and shines more than ever, bringing love, warmth and confidence as the steadfast chief of Berk. The enigmatic Valka is brought to earthy life by Cate Blanchett, but the real star of her performance is the grace and beauty of the character designs and her animation. When Valka's on the move you can't take her eyes off her, not to mention she has the most jaw-dropping introduction in the film. Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, TJ Miller and Christopher Mintz-Plasse all return to their respective roles, but are relegated to very minor spots for shaky comedic relief, while Djimon Hounsou is visceral and intimidating as Drago and brings as much weight as possible to a somewhat thin villain. On the other hand, Kit Harington has more personality and charisma than he has ever had on Game of Thrones as a welcome younger addition to the cast with his wayward dragon trapper Eret.How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a fantastic sequel that dares to go darker and more complex with its family fare. Emotions run high, the action is intense and the characters and events all have weight. You won't find a more beautifully animated film this year and very rarely does a franchise get a follow-up of this quality. Some of the humor and subplots flat out don't work, and there are probably too many characters to juggle in one film, but this one is still well worth every bit of your summer dollars.",

            "content": "Watching an animation movie in the cinema is always a challenge. It's always difficult to get my friends to sit in the theater, because there is a widespread misconception among people nowadays that these movies are especially made for children. But this is not true of course. For example if we put all the Pixar movies or some productions by Dreamworks and Disney under the microscope, than we can certainly say (even with the eyes an adult) that we really liked that!The situation is the same with How to train your dragon 2. At first glance the movie might seems to has been made for children under the age of 12. Buti f we are determined about watching the whole thing, we could certainly realize that plentiful adult content is stuffed in it too. Fortunately the movie doesn't try to feed us with the so over-hyped, usual and stereotypical \u0084love conquers all\" slogan. Instead of that, it tries to put other basic and important human values at the canter, such as the significance of unity, cooperation vs betrayal, ties of friendship, belonging somewhere, how to convince an other man about your opinion by the arguments of reason, etc. The particular strengths of the film, is that these things are never been said directly by any character, we can sense the hidden massages by their actions and dialogues. So the movie was not made for a specific age group, but it has the ability to target all the consumers, regardless of age. Both children and adults would definitely find their own little favorite and lovable moments. The film is a perfect sequel of the first part. Even the opening scene stars the movie very pleasantly: Hiccup riding his dragon equipped with its mechanic device (in order to be able to being controlled) meanwhile they discovering more an more new areas where they haven't had the opportunity to get before (without dragons). For me it had a little funny effect, that all the vikings take piggyback rides on their own dragons, but the animations have been drawn so nicely and accurately, that the sight was absolutely said to be correct and acceptable. Let's speaking of sight! The imagery of the film is fantastic! In today's world, when almost every little need of the consumers are satisfied to the extent, that put their threshold almost above the clouds, it difficult to show them something on which their eyes can stuck. However, in this film the wonderful landscapes, beautifully created characters, the creatively choreographed flying scenes are each tore my chin down to the ground. It was a long time ago that an animated film has been able to take such an advantage of the technology, which it was made from.The first part of the movie in 2010 has become one of my favorite animated movie, that made me very curious about the sequel. Has it worthed waiting for so long? I can not really decide. The film is excellent as a sequel, perfectly continues the main elements of the first one. Those who haven't seen the first part, won't be able to understand all the essence of the interaction between the characters. But if we talking about characters, I must mention one thing: personally I couldn't wait to see Hiccup's next adventure, that how he will pick up the fight against the majority's will, what further discussions he'll has to take with his father, and what kind of further relationship he will keep with the other youngsters, who we got to know from the first movie. But unfortunately I had the feeling that they've tried to make the movie so monumental, that the characters have become a bit superficially developed. Hiccup and his father were the focal point of the first movie along with the night-fury of course. Here, however, the characters in the supporting roles were somehow more interesting for me. For example, I loved listening to our pudgy friend as he was saying all the nerd things about the beasts, or as the other kid was always being about saying or doing something bad-ass in order to impress one of the female members of the crew. But Hiccup wasn't so engrossing character like in the first movie, pity for him\u0085Somehow I couldn't really care about the villain of the movie either as a I should have. We get a brief background story about why he's become so evil, but somehow he just seemed so impersonal to me. He doesn't have any engrossing feature, that could have drawn my attention to him, because he just has kept yelling and shouting and waving a stick with his thick arm.I had a bit deja vu feeling by the prospect of the colossus dragon (called the alpha). But when an other one climbed to the screen from the depth of the villain's army, than I just sat in the theater totally confused. Why they wanted to copy this element so violently from the first movie? This was not one of the great features why so many people has become infatuated with the prequel. Maybe I'm the only one who sees it as a problem, but I didn't really like that huge bastard in the first movie either (I don't know why).Overall, the film is able to provide great fun for everyone, and your age doesn't matter! It has some funny parts, serious points of interest, sentimental scenes, and all of these are spiced with great imaginary. For me it was not as great experience as its predecessor, but nevertheless i't gifted me with a really good 1,5 hour.Rating 7/10",

This movie is worth your money. The only thing you maybe felt disappointed (if you expect big) is probably it has the same formula with the first one. But hey it's animation, you didn't expect a surprising and crazy storyline, but rather the process into it that makes this movie beautiful. I watched it at father's day, and i didn't expect that it really touches a son and dad relationship. There's this scene which is really heartbreaking, and you should watch it yourself.

Instead of keeping things light-hearted, fun with an overall show of friendship, How to Train Your Dragon 2 goes much deeper in character exploration than the first. Diving into the depths of the bonds of friendship, love and loyalty.This is a movie that can touch the hearts of both young and old alike. It has been a while since there has been such an emotionally driven animation. The acts of love and friendship coupled with a majestic score and beautiful animation go hand in hand in order for Hiccup and Toothless take you on on a journey you will not soon forget.The How to Train Your Dragon series is fast becoming one of the top animation series of all time.

Starting with the perks, this picture has many - most notably the stunning visual effects; right from the opening sequence the movie draws you in, instantly capturing your attention and maintaining it through a spellbinding display of flawless animation. There's simply so much to look at, that a dazzling score to accompany the wonderful flying sequences would (and in parts does) provide non-stop entertainment for a substantial duration of time. However a wisely selected soundtrack overlaying fantastic visual art is only part of the battle, with the primary drawback of HTTYD2 providing an explanation as to why Pixar are considered the masters of animation as opposed to Dreamworks. Pixar understands that story is key. They understand that likable characters engaging in interesting dialogue catering to both children and adults alike is essential in the process of achieving something special. HTTYD offered a step in the right direction, however the sequel offers little progression in an already limited story line, and the overly child-friendly scripting only makes the characters feel washed up and overused. Judged on its own, this picture is an entertaining one-time watch. However when the inevitable comparison with better films of a similar genre does happen, it'll be forgotten before you can say toothless.",

Still there are several sub plots and continuing quirks and jokes that add real depth to the film that I have never seen a DreamWorks animation manage to pull of with such gusto.It deserves far more attention than it has thus far received as I dare say it rivals Frozen in the quality of it's story and surpasses it in the quality of its animation.",

            "content": "A sequel never exceeds its predecessor....before this film I would have believed that until my dying day. Sequels are always a stepping stone from the first film this is believed by most sequel directors. They want to create the same effect as the first film but create it to a new, higher level. They want you to fall in love with the same characters all over again; enjoy the music whether it's from the same composer like in how to train to your dragon 2 or from a different composer like in the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels. Luckily for how to train your dragon 2 they had the same incredible crew they had in the first film such as producer Bonnie Arnold and director Dean Deblois. The first how to train your dragon came out in 2010 and was a big success. It was nominated for 2 Oscars, winning 20 awards and getting a worldwide gross of $500,000,000 on a budget of \u00a3165,000,000. How to train your dragon 2 came out 4 years later due to its intricate animation and its incredible actors whose schedules needed to be revolved around. Personally it feels like I have been waiting centuries to see Hiccup and Toothless back on the big screen. 4 years is a long time to lose connection with the characters and with the scenery but the second I heard the words \"This is Berk.\" in the beginning of this film. I was 13 again at Christmas watching How to train your dragon and crying at the scene where Hiccup, Toothless and Astrid were flying through the clouds. The cinematography; the music; the voices; the animation; the scripting. Truthfully I am struggling to find a simple flaw within this film. It gave me the exact feeling of How to train your dragon only better, stronger; A LOT more emotion. I absolutely adore this film and I am not the only one who thinks this, Chicago times reviewer Bill Zwecker states that how to train your dragon 2 is a \"superbly crafted sequel.\" OK where to begin? I know this is an animated film but the camera work amazes me to no end. The opening establishing shot of Berk zooming in on these tiny, seemingly insignificant details and then scoping out to show the characters we follow for the next few hours. It's intricate and ore-inspiring. Truthfully I don't know how the animators made Berk feel like it was real. Like it truly existed. The shots and the detail were that good. The scripting was flawless. I haven't actually read the book but I imagine many of the lines were stolen from Cressida Cowell. The scripting was realistic and funny and made you empathise with the characters as well as laugh along with them. It did however have some cheesy, apple pie-ish lines which were somewhat similar to How to train your dragon 1 such as \"stop being so stoick, Stoick!\" But there's nothing wrong with cheesy, right? The best scene in fact in the film was probably the cheesiest one. Hiccup, (Jay Baruchel) Gobber, (Craig Ferguson) Toothless, Stoick, (Gerard Butler) and new character Valka (Cate Blanchett) who is in fact Hiccup's mother and Stoick's wife are all together and Stoick begins to sing and it's incredible to see such a strong almost sociopathic character start singing just to cheer up Valka. The song he sings is a song the two of them share and is special to them. (And apparently to Gobber as he joins in) At first Valka seems to not appreciate the gesture but then begins to sing along and throughout this scene we see medium and close up shots of Hiccup smiling as he has a family again and you see Gobber make him dance and the music gets louder and the lighting gets brighter giving this great sense of optimism and hope and makes us as an audience know that everything is going to be okay. I know I wasn't the only one crying happy tears during this scene. It was amazing and gave me the exact same feel as the first one only more hopeful. Now for the score. I am a huge fan of film soundtracks. My favourites include Treasure planet, (2002) Jurassic Park (1993) and ET. (1982) For me a good soundtrack is something that stays in your head despite no lyrics. It just gets stuck in your head and a few hours later you end up humming it randomly. The score affects so much in a film. It makes the audience feel something. It makes them feel connected emotionally to the characters and the settings and the story. Most composers use the score simply to tell the audience how to feel at every point in the film. Truthfully that is a mistake, sure suspenseful long, deep notes in a horror work to get the audience petrified that a bad guy with a chainsaw is hiding out of sight behind a tree, but the audience know how to feel, you see a character you love depressed you feel depressed. Music should simply be used as an essence as a way to make the audience memorise what is going on. John Powell does this flawlessly. I fell in love with this soundtrack in the first film. I have 3 CDs at home. The how to train your dragon soundtrack is one. The music is amazing. I cry each time I hear it (happy tears of course) and when I hear the same tracks in this film and then the same tracks edited to give them an extra flair. I absolutely love it. Okay I am going to end it here. I loved this film. The second I stepped out of the cinema I could've turned right back around and watched it again and would have still felt the same emotions I did the first time. This film is intricate, amazing, funny and wonderful to watch.",

You know those parts where everything slows down for the WOW 3D moment? This film is riddled with those and it's a big problem for those who can't watch in 3D. There are entire scenes that should be epic but are dull and strange because they are *supposed* to be wowing you in 3D - except they're not. They're just almost slot-mo, unimpressive and distracting. They also make the pace of the film really weird. For 2D viewers you can expect to spend 2 minutes looking at somebodies back, several 2 minute intervals looking at a dragon tilting its head at an odd angle so that you can be unimpressed by its non-3D tusk and many other such interruptions to your viewing pleasure.This film was made to be seen in 3D. If you have astigmatism, a lazy eye or, like us, couldn't get tickets then save your time and money and go see something else. I wish I had!The story was fine, I think, but we had trouble being immersed in it because of the pacing issue and I found myself becoming bored.",

It is still one of my top four animated films (Incredibles, Kung Fu Panda and Spirited Away are the others.)It was the first film that managed to make 3D work so well that it took my breath away. I watched it at the cinema with my four year old daughter and we both spent most of the film on the edge of our seats. I am happy to report that the sequel is just as bright, colourful, funny and exciting as the first. But, most importantly, just like the first film, it doesn't seem to know that it is a cartoon. The voice work and the animation combine to give us a real acting experience from a fantastic cast, and it transitions neatly between teenage angst and non- stop action. If I have any criticisms they are all about the story; the film does suffer a little from the sequel-disease of unnecessary happenings in desperate bid to ensure old ground is not tread. This film doesn't benefit from the sheer unexpected charisma of the first film but it does tick all the boxes, and is very enjoyable for it.",

            "content": "Hot off the critical and box office success that was How To Train Your Dragon, Dreamworks wasted little time in announcing a trilogy, and that second installment landed among us last summer.Let me preface this by saying that I did not have the best experience leading up to this film. The marketing was inconsistent, starting with a fantastic teaser, which was followed by a terrible trailer. Terrible in the sense that it spoiled what I thought must have been a major plot point. Honestly, it was a crazy decision to include some of the details that they did. I was hoping to be proved wrong by the actual film, and that is was a piece of genius double bluff marketing. Unfortunately not.The original How To Train Your Dragon was truly brilliant, and if the sequel even just matched the efforts of 4 years ago they would be doing well. It had a lot to live up to, and had already lost some of my favour in the build up.At the end of the day it does fall short of the first film, and also short of the usual standard of animation in the past couple of years (terrifically high). How To Train Your Dragon 2 lacked that surprise spark that makes so many animation films wonderful for adults as well as children. It is not difficult to make an entertaining kids film. The Smurfs series is an example of a production made purely for children with no regard for their guardians. How To Train Your Dragon 2 is miles better than the Smurfs, but the fact of the matter is that I found myself constantly being drawn out of the film by inconsistencies and illogic.From dialogue that purely exists to expose the plot and a few convenient plot twists, one could feel constantly reminded that they were watching a film in dark room rather than inhibiting a world for 2 hours. Harsh maybe, but these are the perils of setting such high standards for yourself. There was a romance plot thread that didn't seem to know what to do with itself. It existed and didn't really justify the time given to it over the course of the film. The stakes were also raised, but the more personal story of last time worked better than the grander scale afforded this time.But as far as negatives go, it rather does stop there. The animation is stellar, and the one area in which the first film is surpassed is the sense of scale you get with these dragons. It's very difficult to portray size realistically past a certain level, but the combination of animation and sound really brings these multi-ton dragons to life. The animation is used really well too. When you are given the gift of being able to stretch and morph things in any way you want, you really should use it. The comical dragons showed extent of how animation should be used. It's also funny enough, not as funny as the first film, but still contains a laugh here and there. The problem is that all the highlights of the film are the individual jokes and spectacles rather than the complete package. It has most of what is required in animation for the standard level of quality, but is let down by mediocre storytelling. The glue which holds everything together is missing, and all the pieces were so beautiful too!Read more at rabsi1.weebly.com/film/",

            "content": "Somehow, they managed to take everything that made the first movie so magical - and just throw it out of the window. The first movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. Sure, they could have picked a better title that would not give away from the very start that, well, they'll be training dragons. But that aside, the story of a village of vikings struggling against an onslaught of dragons, and, despite everything he's been taught, a boy and a dragon becoming best friends and changing the world together, sticking up for each other, is magical and simply grand. The sequel throws away the magic. Violence is abound. Toothless is portrayed as feeble-minded and dangerous. I have no idea what they were going for, and what kind of message they are trying to send.Harmless example: Hiccup is surrounded by dragons and the dragon rider leader. Toothless gets dropped in. The dragon rider waves, and all dragons threateningly open their mouths, revealing fire. Toothless immediately stands in front of Hiccup, and shields him with his tail - great. That's friendship right there. Now the dragon rider approaches, waves, and in the next moment Toothless rolls on the ground in glee, completely subdued. Is that supposed to tell me anything in particular about their relationship? Even if you stretch it reeeal far and claim that the dragon rider \"spoke\" to Toothless - it sure didn't take a lot to leave himself and Hiccup completely unprotected. Next example - yup, the death scene that everyone else complains about too. Within the blink of an eye Toothless becomes completely controlled by the Alpha (after Draco announces it, no less). Words aren't getting through, and in the next moment he fires at Stoick, killing him in an instant. Was that part of the plot really necessary? Should that show me a particularly deep friendship between Toothless and Hiccup, or a special bond that no one outside can touch? Never mind the fact that he did actually mean to kill Hiccup - essentially his best friend for many years. To me, it felt that this part was more of a \"gotcha\" from the writers, as if they were saying \"Hah, did you think his words would be coming through? Well, gotcha!!\"In return however, Hiccup gets a second chance to get through to Toothless - without any imminent danger, all while the villain is grinning and waiting for Hiccup to make his move. And boy, does he rejoice when he gets through (\"Atta boyyy, that's iiit!\"). The death of his father is forgotten, and he gets crowned chief by the elder, complete with painting his face akin to The Lion King.They throw you another curve-ball at the end - just when you think \"okay, that's gotta be it\" - nop. The big bad Alpha freezes Hiccup in ice. \"Haha, did you think it was done? We gotcha again!\" But whoops, turns out Toothless protected him, so he gets out without a scratch, and now, after aaaaall this talk about \"peace and friendship\" the Alpha gets walloped like there is no tomorrow until its tusks break off - and that's finally it then. What exactly is supposed to be magic about that again?The entire movie is basically about who's controlling the dragons. The Alpha controls most dragons. Everyone controls Toothless - except Hiccup. The dragon rider waves her hand to make Toothless flop on the floor like a good doggy while Hiccup's presumably still in peril, she presses Toothless' buttons to make him sprout extra fins, Draco barely needs to show effort to get Toothless on his side -- and that's the pair that's supposed to have the deepest and most special bond among all of the characters?!\nThe magic from the first movie - that dragons are mysterious creatures with their own minds and notion of friendship is nothing but an empty shell here. The movie paints them as weak-minded, simply acting under whoever's the Alpha at the moment, and easily controlled by anyone who knows how to wave their hands in the right way.Contrast that to the first movie - yes, the dragons were bringing that huge dragon food - but it is made clear that they were tyrannized, and acted out of fear. Case in point, when they don't bring enough food, they get eaten. Nothing of that is necessary in this sequel - the Alpha just needs to make its eyes dance, and bamm, all the dragons follow its every command - not because of fear, but because of, you know, just because. Mind control, whee.On the plus side: good animation, good graphic effects, long. But that alone doesn't make a movie. Zootopia is animated better, with better graphic effects, and yet I'd say HTTYD 1 has a stronger message. I really don't want to bash sequels. I hope that the third part in 2019 brings back the magic from the first part. Judging by how much they aged, Toothless and Hiccup have been together for a decade, and they've been each others best friends for that long. Think of what that means. If I want pure action with a bunch of deaths I'd watch Aliens. This sequel tried to be everything - love, romance, action, drama, separation, loss, reunion - and diluted its core values with it. And that is a huge shame.I'd rate it a 4/10. It has its moments, but overall there is little to relive and to rewatch. Story-wise it's definitely a step down from the first part - which is also reflected on metareview sites. Please make part 3 good, at least.",

            "content": "This sequel is not as good as i tought it would be,i remember being hyped for it in 2014 and when i watched i was not that impressed. This movie puts the war with dragons aside to foccus in a dragon riders vs dragon trappers war,the dragons are not relevant to the plot anymore,they are only used in key moments. Characters like Astrid and Stoic are put aside to foccus on new characters like Eret and Valka,these new characters are cool but there was way too much foccus on them. The movie have a subplot of Valka being Hiccup's long lost mom,who survived and lived with dragons,this subplot feels forced because she tries to impress Hiccup with her knowledge about dragons,as if she wants to make him forgive her for abandoning him,the fact that he forgives her very easily makes this subplot feels very stupid,and then there is the reunion of Valka and Stoic to create more drama,and Stoic also forgives her very easily(sigh). The villain Drago is very bland,there is a cool backstory of him losing his arm because a Dragon attacked him,and it made him develop hatred towards dragons,but despite this cool backstory he is not very interesting. Interestingly enough originally Valka was going to be the villain,and it makes more sense within the context of the story, Drago was going to be the villain of the third movie,that's why he feels so out of place in this movie. The lack of foccus in the dragons and the excessive foccus in Hiccup's family makes the movie disappointing. On the other hand the flight scenes and the action scenes are amazing to watch. The movie should have foccused more in developing Drago,it would have made the climax more satisfying,but it was very meh,i dindn't cared about Drago at all. This sequel is not bad,it's just not as good as the first one.",

I saw the first film and was impressed, but I was skeptical that the sequel would be anything other than a cheap and quick way to cash in a bit extra from the love of the first one. But my oh my was I mistaken.From the very start of the film, you're gripped with the film's highly unique style; even after having seen it in action in the first How to Train your Dragon, I was still blown back by the visuals. And then, you're quickly taken with a plot that takes it time to unravel, with dialogue and characters that sound absurdly close to card-board cut-outs but never once become them. The brilliance of the writing ensures that there is never a scene that feels out of place, never a line that seems unnecessary or even out of character. I was particularly fond of Hiccup, someone who I am amazed again and again that I don't find insufferable. Toothless, it goes without saying, is portrayed fantastically; a mix between a cat and dog with wings. And the final sequence is truly heartwarming.Without even losing a beat, the plot brings in new elements, new characters and revamps old ones, all of which are thought out really well, particularly the Dragon Thief. And yet, all of them hang onto the zany and hilarious humor that the first film brought with it.But, like all amazing works of art, the flaws stand all the brighter with such a terrific rest. The villain is not as defined not as interesting as I would have liked, there's a rather long sequence near the end which seems a tiny bit odd and a handful of other things. That said, many other viewers of this film have disagreed with my issues and pointed to other parts of the film, so there's good odds you won't mind; I know I didn't care while I was watching.Overall, you're missing out if you haven't seen this film, because it really is fantastic.",

            "content": "Five years have passed since the events of the first movie and we're already thrown into how much Berk has changed since then and how much more of a community it feels with the presence of dragons. Things such as Dragon Racing at Berk are fun to watch and it's nice to see all the different ways in which dragons have come to use and how everyone has become adapted to being around them. Hiccup's new inventions were very cool; kudos to the filmmakers for coming up with those very nifty ideas.One of the things that struck me at first was how beautiful the film looked; the visuals and animation were vastly improved on the first and characters, dragons and scenery looked and felt more alive than ever. There's a lot of attention to detail such as small character quirks and Toothless playing about in the background with other dragons. That being said though, having dragons pop in and out of frame in the background is overdone by just a touch and distracts from important dialogue and events occurring in the foreground.The introduction of Hiccup's mother in the movie feels a little too rushed; I thought that maybe she would have been brought in in the third film. Furthermore, the little mention of Hiccup's mother earlier on in the film takes away from the surprise of the reveal. However, it's nice to see the two finally get to bond, Hiccup discovering that he takes a lot from his mother, and the reunion with the whole family, when Stoick stumbles across his wife, is very heartwarming indeed. \"You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.\" - this may or may not have brought a tear to my eye...The moment when the film begins to lose its balance, and almost ejects you from the immersion is when Drago Bludvist, the antagonist, is given very little build-up, despite the mystery surrounding the character at the beginning of the story, and is suddenly seen launching an attack on the dragon home inhabited by Valka, Hiccup's mother. The remainder of the film at this point feels rushed, as if the filmmakers realised they'd forgotten about the threat they'd introduced at the start of the film. I wasn't entirely convinced that Drago was a menacing villain, despite his plans and actions in the film, and the filmmakers hit a bit of a sour note on making the antagonist black, something a little clich\u00e9 in animated films and just a little bit racist too.The battle at this point in the movie feels a little too reminiscent of the final battle in the first installment, making it hard not to draw comparisons between the two. Stoick's death was emotional but I expected a greater reaction from everyone else, especially Hiccup and Valka as they'd just lost the chance of being reunited as a family. Having Stoick killed off and Valka there to 'take his place' as a parent for Hiccup just seemed a little too convenient. I felt a little disappointed with the climax and ending; though it regarded more the connection between Toothless and Hiccup, the final battle at Berk was a little too short for my liking. Other than Hiccup becoming chieftain and taking his father's mantle, the ending just makes it feel like not much had happened, that there wasn't much of a lesson to learn and that there was little difference between the beginning and end events of the film.Though I don't mind the emphasis put on the relationship between Hiccup, his mother and his father, I feel that other characters weren't developed enough and that some of them were merely there for comic relief. The changes made to Astrid felt a little off; yes, you can tell that it's meant to be the same Astrid from the first film and yes, five years have passed but the character's appearance and characterisation is softened and a little watered down from the strong character that she was in the predecessor. It felt like she was only there to be the established 'love interest' who we don't really get to learn much more about. Eret, the dragon trapper and a new character to the series, was one of the only other characters who had sufficient development and subsequently had believable motivations.How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a good film and is worth the watch, carrying a lot of heart and is guaranteed to make you smile, laugh and maybe even break into tears but the sequel loses its footing with a story that rushes itself in its second half and fails to develop characters as it did with its predecessor.",

Especially Valka, she abandoned her family to protect dragons. We can see her fear by her endless explanation when she saw Stock. She expected Stoick's anger maybe that's what she felt guilty for 20 years. However what Stoick said was not blame, the words are \"You are as beautiful as the day I lost you\" which contained all the missing. For him, she must be the most beautiful woman in the world, in his heart.We can always blame someones, but we can also be generous to them.After so many years, what i remembered is just how kind, beautiful you are, I will never blame you because I love you.",

Words are less to narrate the stunning movie creation.love,friendship,joy,laughter,sorrow,fear,bravery and vice versa.Last but not the list it has a hidden message unlike other animated movies it tries to tell something..

It boasts the requisite stellar visuals and talented returning voice cast, that alone gives it six stars. The way the story progresses in such a natural, satisfying way that doesn't feel forced yields two more. (So far we're at eight.) The emotional beats work on so many levels. Whether it's watching Valka reunite with Hiccup and later Stoick or the sacrifice and funeral of the latter, you're made of stone if you don't tear up even just a little bit. Just saying. I give it one more for that. (Now we're at nine stars.) And now for the most important ingredient that yields the tenth and final star. (Insert drum-roll here.) TOOTHLESS IS SO ADORABLE! HE'S JUST SO CUTE! Okay, in all seriousness, while Toothless is easily responsible for some of the first six stars, the tenth star has gotta be given for John Powell's amazing score. Every track makes each scene feel exciting, (Dragon Racing, Battle of the Bewilderbeast) wondrous, (Together We Map The World, Flying With Mother) dark, (Meet Drago, Alpha Comes To Berk) emotional, (Stoick's Ship) and even satisfying. (Two New Alphas.) All this comes together to create an excellent experience that's worth re-visiting.",

Among the several 'handicapped' protagonists I have come across over the years, Hiccup & Toothless are by far the only ones who do not garner even the tiniest bit of sympathy over their handicap, flaunting it all the way through. Elsewhere, with handicapped leads, their handicap mostly balances out their amazingness: either their intelligence, niceness, brilliance, or just to increase the attention. On the contrary, for Hiccup & Toothless, despite their matching missing leg & tail, the handicap, if anything, only adds to their amazingness and uniqueness, though you nearly forget about it at most times. Although the storyline for How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a bit 'grown-up' than its predecessor, it still is a pleasant couple of hours for every age group. A big thanks for such attention to detail, brilliant colors & above all, the voice cast. Also, very few movies manage to deliver it a second time through. However, this movie certainly delivers to it by improving on the smallest of details and all new add-ons that complement those present. A solid 8-8.5. Dreamworks does it again with the new mature & confident...err Hiccup!",

With a touching story, amazing animation, deft direction and spot-on voice casting, you certainly cannot go wrong with this one. With the welcome additions of the talents of Cate Blanchett (who provides us with one of the poignant scenes to be witnessed in recent movies, with Gerard Butler's Stoick ), Djimon Hounsou and Kit Harrington (Game of Thrones' Jon Snow), the dragons take this movie to heights, the likes of 'Cars' can only watch in envy.Here is my word for it - This one is a near master-piece, OK, change of stance, a real masterpiece.

            "content": "So as the title suggests, each Sunday in my house is labelled 'Animated Sunday'. It just seems, at least to me, that Sundays were made for films of the animated variety. Before the working week once again begins I want to get lost in a funny, uplifting and animated fantasy.So this Sunday was How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014). After doing the first film last week and thoroughly enjoying it my girlfriend and I decided that it was time for the second instalment.For those of you that don't know, How To Train Your Dragon is about Vikings and dragons. They have been battling for as long as they can remember, then one day a boy comes along who bonds with the most feared dragon. They strike up an immediate bond and work to change the way in which Vikings and dragons can co-exist.The second instalment sees both species living side-by-side until a man called Drago (Djimon Hounsou) comes along with a dragon army and tries to take all the dragons and kill the Viking tribe.The first thing I noticed was that it was bigger than the last film. Not just in the size of the alpha dragons (who were terrifyingly huge by the way) but the sheer scale of the film was bigger. There were more dragons, more fighting and more expansive scenery which all added to the sense of it being bigger than its predecessor.I, as I'm sure most people did, really liked all of the characters in the film, even the bad guy was so bad he was impressive. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a funny character, partnered with Jay's voice made for a quirky, funny and extremely likable lead. All of Hiccup's friends are also very entertaining and add some funny moments to the film's more serious parts.Cate Blanchett and Kit Harington joined the cast for the second film as Hiccup's long lost mother Valka and the lovable rogue Eret. Having Kit added to the cast in a film about dragons had to include at least one nod to Game of Thrones, and it did. One of the girls turned to Kit's character Eret and said 'you know nothing', an obvious nod to Kit's character Jon Snow in Game of Thrones who is told that often by his lover. That drew a laugh from me and I turned to my girlfriend, as I'm sure many people did when watching it, and said 'well maybe now he will believe dragons are real' to which I was the only one who laughed, as usual.But again I think the best aspect of the film was the scale of it and especially the size of the alpha dragons. They were massive and made me regret not seeing them on the big screen, which would have truly been something to behold.So all in all it was a good film, I enjoyed it as much as the first and liked the new characters that were added. I hear there is a third film in the pipeline so I am sure I will be making the trip to see it in all its big screen splendour.",

Plus, the voice acting was excellent.With that being said, i think it's sequel delivers on everything the first one did and at the same time manages to surpass it on every level. The characters get more developed, the CGI is improved, the action is more present throughout.

While it seems many found Frozen to be the best title of the year, I doubt that will stand for long once word of the brilliance this movie has to offer gets out. This movie expands significantly on the first title, as How to Train your Dragon gave you an intriguing emotional ride where the viewer was able to experience a broad set of emotions, this sequel expands on that and strengthens each emotion on the table. Happy moments are happier, but Pixar was not afraid to take a risk. Most movies of this sort are somewhat tame, and while not expressly violent or obscene, How to Train Your Dragon 2 made sure to give the viewers an element of realism as things don't always turn out the way you might hope. . I would 10/10 recommend viewing this movie to audiences of all ages. It is entertaining, intriguing, fun, cheerful, and full. It's just a full film. It lacks in no area, and I truly regard it as one of the best children targeted films in the last, perhaps 5 years minimally.",

The cast was again fantastic and brought their A-game to this. I also liked to see the improvement of animation between the first and this movie. Some truly beautiful shots made me gasp at what animation can do and for a second made me think it was live-action. The sound design in this movie is perfect and I think fits with the world. The music, maybe not being as iconic as the first, still was beautiful and hit in all the right moments. Once again I found myself cooing over toothless and how adorable he is.

During the lockdown, however, I wanted to find several animated films that I had not seen, including this saga. When I saw the first one I was amazed by its beauty (you will also find my review). But the second managed, I don't know how, to do much better. This sequel cleverly continues the first film setting it years later when Hiccup and Toothless are now grown up. The tone of this film, generally speaking, is dark, like Toy Story 3. And I really like animated films with dark tones. The relationship between the two protagonists undergoes a notable evolution which becomes very mature. The villain is one of my favorites at Dreamworks: he is very evil. I liked one of his scenes in particular, as well as one of the most moving: when Drago takes control thanks to his Toothless alpha and goes so that he kills Hiccup. The father, however, saves the blow and dies. Moreover, although he had always traveled by ship, on that occasion he rides Toothless to make Hiccup feel even worse. The twists are not lacking and they are unpredictable. The animations are spectacular and gorgeous to look at. The characters are all nice and well developed. The film is simply fantastic: a masterpiece for sure. With a well thought-out storyline and great characters, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is absolutely a movie worth watching.",

I have some issues however with the characters. Valka is just forgotten in the 3rd act and I feel like her coming back to Berk should have been impactful, Drago just stands around and yells and is just forgettable, the teenage vikings are so unfunny and annoying, Astrid is kind of out of character with her being reckless and her and the teenage vikings don't receive any consequences for them leading Drago and his army to where Hiccup as it was their fault. Even Toothless is just a side character until the 3rd act. These flaws however don't ruin the movie and is still a great sequel despite being the weakest of this phenomenal trilogy.",

There were some things that they simply couldn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d in a sequel that I knew were going to bother me again. Sure enough, the exaggerated Scottish accents only from the older generation are still there for no good reason. Jay Baruchel is still a horrible choice for any vocal role, and he continues to make Hiccup sound as ridiculous as his name. There are other things that I find dumb in the films (like the bumbling best friends and the weird versatility of sheep) but the voice work is what always stands out as the worst. Despite the flaws this film inherited from its predecessor, I found How to Train Your Dragon 2 to be a big improvement story-wise. Where the first film felt like a clich\u00e9-filled story I\u2019d seen countless times before, this one had something new to offer. I like the idea of this Viking nation that has made peace with dragons struggling to convince other nations that they are harmless creatures. It makes sense that, as they improved their mode of transportation, they would be able to reach out further and influence people all around. I also appreciated that this film introduced a number of different sides on the dragon issue, from those who want them to be entirely free to those who want to use them for their own evil desires. I think they play a little fast and loose when they start to retcon the character history, and it certainly telegraphs the big reveal that comes halfway through, but I didn\u2019t mind because I had little emotional attachment to the world from the first film. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a decent adventure story, and it connected with me on an emotional level that I didn\u2019t expect. I almost cried once, which is much more than I can say about the first chapter in the Hiccup-Toothless story.",

Whether it\u00e2(TM)s a big action scene or just a shot of the landscape, it all looks great. The story is quite good. It doesn\u00e2(TM)t do anything overly surprising, but it hits all the right beats. There is a lot of emotion here between Hiccup\u00e2(TM)s reunion with his mother to the death of his father. It goes further than expected in that aspect. Baruchel (Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III) continues to do a good job in the role. He has a unique voice that actually fits perfectly for the character. The rest of the returning voice cast does very well, but the highlights of the new additions were Cate Blanchett (Valka) and Kit Harrington (Eret). I loved the big battle scene where the good guys ultimately lose. It\u00e2(TM)s the high point of the movie and features some really cool moments. It makes the villain come across as a true threat.\n\nWeaknesses: Some of the comedy misses the mark. Kristen Wiig (Ruffnut) and TJ Miller (Tuffnut) are both funny actors, but the stuff involving their characters never hit. They aren\u00e2(TM)t big characters, but they\u00e2(TM)re meant to be funny and it doesn\u00e2(TM)t work. As noted, the big battle is the highlight so the third act that comes after it feels lackluster. It needed to be bigger to follow what we had just witnessed.\n\nOverall: This would be a truly special animated film with a better final 15 minutes. It still does more than enough to be great and is about on par with the first installment.",

How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a fun filled animated action fantasy film with an emotional inspiring story, beautiful animation, and visually exciting action. The film does have another inspiring story to tell while packing an emotional punch with the characters. Hiccup (jay Baruchel) has caused a change in his Viking tribe. Now, they are riding dragons once they learned to train them. They have a sporting event with riders and their dragons using sheep as a ball to toss in a basket. Stoick (Gerard Butler) has wanted to train Hiccup to follow his footsteps in being a leader for their tribe someday. Hiccup is prematurely not wanting to take that responsibility yet. Hiccup is flying to new territory. He discovers another tribe that was demolished by some unknown new dragon which Eret (Kit Harrington) blames any dragon riders to be responsible. Hiccup soon discovers his mother Valka (Cate Blanchett). Who is living in an area filled with dragons. Which she is trying to protect them against a warlord Drago (Djimon Hounsou). Who wants to raise a dragon army for his own power. There are new fun characters that you meet. And also a menacing villain Drago. And the dragon he raises which is known as the Alpha is a gigantic monstrous beast that looks kind of scary. The animation in the film is beautifully done. The landscapes, the action sequences are fantastic. I did feel like the movie did have a slower paced plot than the original movie. But it does not the stop film from being good. Overall, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a good film. The visuals and animation is beautiful and great. The action is exciting and thrilling. The plot is a little slower but it does travel into new territories with the characters and packs an emotional punch this time.",

And they did but replaced it with a slightly less cringe romance. I wouldn't even call it to romance it was more harassment if anything. I have no idea how the last movie got a higher rating on Rotten Tomatoes than this one. One minor plot hole or I guess you would rather call it a visual anachronism was at the start of the movie when he was gliding with a wingsuit, it would've been impossible. As the wings are supposed to be fully attached to the body - with no gaps between them - then you can physically start gliding. The opening scene could've been improved. I wish it started with Hiccups because of his first scene because that was excellent and tremendous.\n\nThe twist felt predictable, not in this movie but some sort of movie in the future from the first one. As we had no mention of her in the first one. The only reason I liked it was that they made it so her and Hiccups' father bonded with each other. It gave us a connection to both of them so it could make an attempt to an emotional ending - it would've worked if they made the moment where he died and the ending, shorter. The dragons were way more entertaining. Instead of having fire breathing for every cool looking dragons, they created more abilities. Such as ice breath, telepathy, and turning into a wheel of fire. It made the final fight scene much more exciting and intense. The villain's origin was not good. There was hardly any.\n\nThe cinematography was exceptional. The giant dragon felt the same as number one, but with two fighting each other. Also, that fight between them was so lazy and used death as a plot device. If you look in the background they are just touching each other's tusks. The score felt too loud and I could just make out the characters talking. The guy with the tattooed 'beard' was a very bad character. And was just there for a helping hand to repair the films plot holes. The film is better than the last but still isn't as immeasurable as Toy Story.",

No relearning the same lessons as the first film, no rehashing of plot lines--the twist was great and the resolution for the separation is very touching. If I had one complaint it might be that Drogo is a bit of a generic villain? But that's not too important, he's a means to an end and everything else in this film is likeable and fun to watch. It answers some of the main questions from the first film and how the whole dragon system works, and each character gets nice little moments to shine. A well crafted film overall.\n\nBut as a nitpick for the trailers: good god Dreamworks, don't spoil such major things! I get that the mother-figure isn't a core plot point and a rather minor reveal all things considered, but still! It would have been nice to see that in the film rather than a trailer straight up telling me it! Please try to be less spoilery for the 3rd installment, eh?",

For a sequel that everyone loved which was a box office success, this movie seems to have been forgotten quickly. No matter, the third movie is still coming soon. I don't really have much to say about this sequel. Just that it was a really amazing movie, that's all. Shame I can't be bothered to watch the Cartoon Network and later Netflix series since about 90% of the Netflix/DreamWorks shows look like cash grabs and I stopped watching Nickelodeon 2 years ago. Ah well, at least I've learned to be patient. When the third movie arrives, it'll have arrived. Interesting plot, characters and story make this movie good. Could I be more blatant about how spectacular this movie was? Let's hope the third movie remains as great as the first two.",

            "content": "In many ways, particularly in terms of technical elements, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is as good as its predecessor. Once again, the film is beautifully animated, and this time around actually surpasses the first film in the amount of detail in the animation. DreamWorks utilizes brand new animation technology for this sequel, and it certainly shows: every strand of hair on each character and even the smallest scales on each dragon are so clear and detailed. The cinematography (in which Roger Deakins was a visual consultant) once again captures all of the adventure, especially the aerial scenes beautifully, and John Powell's score is once again absolutely mesmerizing.\n\nThe one place where it just can't live up to its predecessor, however, is in the story. How to Train Your Dragon was effective in its simplicity, but the sequel amps things up with a more complex story with a lot of darker elements. Not to say that the story doesn't work - it certainly has a lot of hard-hitting moments and isn't afraid to make some very permanent decisions - but a lot of it feels detrimental overall. The new characters don't have a lot of the depth that they should: new allies and villains have their motivations and little else, which is kind of disappointing. It's also paced awkwardly, with some of the aforementioned hard-hitting scenes getting breezed over in order to keep the story rolling. It's a movie largely targeted at children and families, so it sort of necessitates that kind of story structure, but perhaps a good 10-15 minutes would make this story flow a bit better.\n\nIt's definitely an entertaining movie that anyone who enjoyed the first film can enjoy, and the animation is definitely top notch, but it's a bit of a step down in the story department.",

It was actually pretty good. But holy crap was this more fun.\nThis film now has Hiccup traveling to new worlds with his Knight-rider dragon Toothless to find more dragons to keep safe. He is meant to be the new chief but doesn't want the position that badly because he doesn't know what kind of person he is. Among his travels he upsets a Dragon snatcher who is capturing as many as he can for Jargo Bloodfist. Hiccup meets his mother and brings his family back together to stop Jargo from controlling all the dragons.\nThese films in particular are interesting kids films that I'm pretty sure any kid would like to see, if and when the third film does come which I'm pretty sure it will, it will probably be the best of the trilogy because this is actually based on a series of books the first book of the same name.\nThe movie is more engaging and fun then the first, it exceeded my expectations, I wasn't looking forward to this either like I said word of mouth made me change my mind so I had to see what all the fuss was about.\nJay Baruchel is voicing Hiccup once again and delightfully so, I don't any other voice would fit the character. Gerard Butler voices his father and he was the best actor in the first film and he steals the show yet again in this sequel. I can't tell who voiced who when it comes to the rest of the cast but i still found them all to be good as well.\nThe direction is every bit as good as the first film if not even better. I really liked the 3-D animation this film everything is moving so fast that at times the film feels so energized during the flying and fight sequences it's like a jolt.\nAll the elements of a good animated motion picture are present it has good pacing, fun sequences, and a nice cast to top it all off. I give How to Train Your Dragon 2 a four out of five.",

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a big movie - even epic.\n\nWhere most animated movies these days are mousy and small, this one has a giant canvas with a visual sweep that reminds you of The Lion King and Finding Nemo. It's a fun movie to behold. The animation makes the sky into a living, breathing place without boundaries. The animators have taken the simple idea of flying through the air and made it into a roller coaster of visual delight. That's a relief in the age of TV-style directing where filmmakers think that everything has to be shot in tight close-ups. The skies here are limitless, cloud strewn and dotted with dragons of all sizes and shapes.\n\nThe story picks up five years later as Hiccup (voiced again by Jay Baruchel) and his Viking community of Berk have embraced dragons and turned dragon flying into a sport. They've even taken to racing one another in a Quidditch-style sport involving live sheep. Hiccup is now is a little taller, his face a little longer - though reasonably, in five years he should have started a beard. He loves the sport of flying dragons, but it is clear that his mind is elsewhere. He wants to explore the world beyond Berk to see what's out there. So, he and dragon pal Toothless head off to find unexplored territories. What they find isn't exactly new ground, but a new problem. There are pirates out there whose intentions are deadly, and whose boss is even deadlier. Not to give too much away, but let's just say these guys are building a fearsome dragon army, and not for racing.\n\nThe story is kind of beside the point. It's your standard bad-guy-wants-to-use-his-army-to-rule-the-world plot, the narrative has an heir of predictability but that doesn't mean isn't full of surprises. The best moment comes early in the film when Hiccup is flying home at dusk on the back of Toothless above a landscape of clouds. Off to his right, a wraith-like figure emerges from the clouds wrapped in bandages. It's a ghastly sight, wrapped in warrior garb with spines protruding from its head. Until we learn its identity, it is reasonable to think that it is a visitor from the land of the dead. What makes this moment so breathtaking is how unexpectedly it happens.\n\nThe identity of this being will not be revealed here except to say that it opens up some of Hiccup's familial identity. It's a subplot buried in a very PC story that preaches that the best way to train an animal is to gently understand it. The movie's villain wouldn't agree. His name is Drago (voiced by Djimon Hounsou) and he is rumored to be a fearsome warrior with thousands of dragons at his disposal. There is a very effective build-up to Drago on par with Keyser Soze. He is spoken about long before we see him, hidden in shadows and legend. When we see him though he's a bit of a disappointment. He looks like a caveman and seems made up mostly of scars, sweat, hair and anger management issues. His personality is all grumbles and threats. Does he have a life of his own?\n\nThere are some nice touches in the film involving the relationship between Hiccup and his village chief father Stoick (Gerard Butler) that leads to a development that is really unexpected. Yet, it might be nice to tie up Hiccup's relationship with his girlfriend Astrid. She's kind of in this movie for support - maybe in the second sequel we'll get the romance.\n\nWhat shortcomings this movie has story-wise is overcome by the visual inventiveness. The animators have pulled out all the stops to create dragons of every scope and size. Some dragons are as big a basketball while others are the size of a stadium. Drago has one beast at his disposal called The Alpha that could tussle with Godzilla.\n\nNow the million dollar question - will kids enjoy it? The answer: most definitely yes. There's enough visual delight here to engage their imagination and not insult their intelligent. It's not as creative as The LEGO Movie but they definitely won't be bored by it. This is the kind of movie that is a treat for the eyes as well as the heart.",

Regardless, the movie strikes a nice tone between the dark and comical elements (I mean how many kids movies have the balls to still kill off main characters these days?).  It's much darker than the first, although less focused in meaning.  Call me cynical, but I feel the villain straight forward as a man named Drago seemed kind of generic and predictable (I was possibly hoping maybe the mom attacked in retaliation for not believing her about dragons, not sure why I was expecting something that dark but maybe I'm just thinking the plot twist is too predictable (Star Trek: Into Darkness, The Dark Knight Rises, etc.)).  Still a lot of the CGI fights are fun if sort of generic.  In a way, I'd compare this to Brave but I'm not sure why one has a higher RT score.",

An excellent actress, her voice provided a new emotional level to the film that almost brought me to tears at some points. That's when you know a kids movie is worth watching; when it makes you feel something.\nThis may sound odd, but I loved the action in this movie. There is just something about dragons fighting that is awesome, especially within this film, the variety of dragons they have is mind blowing. Also the little symbol he has is reminiscent of the sigil of House Targaryen- not sure if they did that on purpose.\nThis is one of the best animation movie sequels that I can think of, besides from Toy Story 2/3. Can you think of something better? Maybe you could think of one, but it's pretty rare for a good animated sequel to exist. I mean, think about some examples of the terrible ones, it's not hard e.g. Cars 2. So for this movie to be great, is miraculous. \nLaughs, action, emotions, dragons. If you want to see any of those things, this is the movie to see. It may not compare to the best of Pixar and Studio Ghibli (Howl's, Grave of the Fireflies, Spirited Away etc) but this is still worth paying for to see.",

The sequel *looks* very impressive - there have obviously been major strides forward in computer animation technology between the two - but as a *film* I found it rather lacking. There are not just one but several stretches where nothing very much happens for several minutes at a time. The plot meanders irritatingly. Characters behave in ways that make no sense whatever once you know who they are and what their agenda is. Some of the \"rules\" about dragons and the way the world works that were established in the first film are ignored; other rules are established early in this film and then suddenly ignored again later on when it suits the demands of the script.\n\nThe most troubling aspect is the theme of peace vs violence. Earlier in the film, the hero, Hiccup, is determined, despite most people telling him he is wrong, to try to make peace with the villain. He sticks to his convictions, in the same way as he did in the first film, but there's a crucial difference: in the first film, he is ultimately proved right - dragons indeed turn out to be essentially friendly creatures rather than vicious killers, and it becomes obvious that both sides (humans and dragons) have been driven by fear rather than malice. In the end the village is almost wiped out because people don't listen to Hiccup's message, but eventually everything works out happily. It's a very positive message: overcome fear and distrust and things will work out well.\n\nBut this time round Hiccup is shown to be entirely wrong, and lives are lost because he is trying to make peace. The message is very clear: if you try to appease foreign aggression, people will die; instead you need to defend yourself as vigorously as possible and attack your enemy pre-emptively. \n\nWhat makes all this excruciatingly uncomfortable is that villain is the only character in the whole film who isn't white. He's voiced by Djimon Honsou, a black actor, and given an accent very different from all the others; and his appearance strongly suggests someone of african or arab origin. By the end of the film I felt as if I had been watching a propaganda piece made by neo-conservatives to justify the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. I really don't want to be told that pre-emptive violence is the best solution, and that attempts to settle things peacefully just get people killed; doubly not in a movie aimed at children.",

            "content": "'How to Train Your Dragon 2' came four years after the first film premiered  in theaters in March 2010 to rave reviews and a surprisingly abundant bag of cash. I admit to you that i loved the first 'How to Train Your Dragon' very much. It was cute, the vocal work and designs were excellent and the animation was beautiful. I looked forward to seeing the sequel to this sleeper hit. \n\nThe story takes a time-jump of five years and follows a 20 year old Hiccup (Voiced again by Jay Baruchal) and his dragon Toothless and the rest of the characters from the past film including Astrid (Now Hiccup's girlfriend) as Hiccup seeks to map out the rest of the land. While out adventuring, Hiccup uncovers a group of dragon trappers led by newcomer Eret, son of Eret (Voiced by 'Game of Thrones' Kit Harrington) who tells Hiccup of his leader; a villianous dragon hunter named Drago Bludvist  who seeks to take over the world with his dragon army. Along the way Hiccup must grasp with the discovery of his mom (Voiced by Cate Blanchett) who was thought to have been long since deceased.  \n\n'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is  different from the first film in many aspects, its more mature and defined. The character designs are sharper and fuller as is the story.  The script looks to move away from the cuteness and light nature of the first film and evolve into something along the lines of 'Toy Story 3'. \n\n'How to Train Your Dragon 2'  losses most of its cuteness to give way to a film that is mroe about growing up and discovery and adventure and loss... The film  features much more emotionl depth then that of the first film. It'll leave you sad at a few moments - that i can say to you. \n\n'How to Train Your Dragon 2' succeeds in becoming something new and different from the first film, but there was something lost between that five year jump. I believe that due to the growth and maturation of the lead characters, the jokes began to transition from the funny antics of Toothless and Hiccup into something else. Now we must rely on the side characters to give us a laugh now and then. The problem with that is the fact that the side characters are not main.  We see way lesser of the side characters then that of Hiccup and Toothless and as such we recieve less oppurtunities for jokes to be expressed.   I must note that these jokes that were presented didn't all work. There is one particular recurring joke that concerns a friend of Hiccup's named Ruffnut, sister to Tuffnut (Voiced by Kristian Wiig and T.J Miller respectively ) who falls for Eret, son of Eret, while two other friends, Fishlegs and Snotloat (Voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill)who both compete for her attention and affection from that of Eret. This was not that funny in my opinion, but i'm sure it will amuse the younger kids. \n\nThe animation in this movie is so jawdroppingly gorgous that i had to pause the film several times just to take it all in. The animation of the characters is so breathtakingly advanced and expressive that i contiually repeated the word 'Wow' at every moment a character spoke. The individual facial features are more detailed in that you can see much more. The skin is less smooth and has more tecture to it, the hair is less clumpy and you can see many individual strands...  i swear i could feel exactly what the characters were feeling just by looking at their eyes! \n\nAll and all, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is superior to the first film in the terms of animation and emotional depth and development but i still can't shake off the general lack of cuteness and abundance of jokes that made the first film so successful. However, in the end i except that with a five year gap between the first and second film, we are bound to lose something and in this case it was that. B   4/25/15",

The host, Neil Patrick also said the same thing during the 2015 Oscars. But in the digital world, slight change in the title makes random in order. I mean on the computer and web world, it won't show in order. Even sometime it might get lost in a vast number of other titles if they dare to chance the first word in the title for a sequel. Other than that they are not stupid as many people think. That's why they highlighted 'Dragon' boldly than the rest of the words.\n\nThis part two was not much different to its first. The story continues five years after Hiccup recovers from his injury. He and his pet, Toothless discovers a new land during the survey for the map. So their's adventure begins, but end in a trouble and forces all his people from the town to involve and fight against the rising evil force that tries to conquer them all.\n\nLike I always say, those days are gone, now animated movies are for all ages. This was a very nicely and carefully written screenplay, did not fail to deliver. Very close to the impact the first movie made, but due to simplicity it stayed a couple of steps behind. Developed well with a bit of suspense, thrill and entertainment. Nothing more we could have asked, a perfect follow-up and hoping to explore beyond lot more in the upcoming movies in this series. Four years gap between the movies is a nice idea and fine breathing space for this franchise fan. A movie must be seen by animation fans, especially if you have already seen the first then don't miss it. \n\n8/10",

It is everything that a sequel should be.\n\nThe heroic Viking Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his faithful dragon Toothless must protect the peace-- and save the future of men and dragons from the power-hungry Drago (Djimon Hounsou). \n\nThere is nothing to say about the animation except the fact that it is beautiful in every way. With all the bright colors, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a lot of fun. Like it's predecessor, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is not like other animated films. Most animated films nowadays are either boring, uninteresting, or rely on cliches. And How to Train Your Dragon 2 does not do that. The voice cast is just as good as the animation. There is Kit Harington, Cate Blanchett, and Djimon Hounsou (who I just mention) who are just as good as the cast in the previous film.\n\nThe film is way more emotional than it's predecessor. Like it's predecessor, I felt the emotional impact unlike most films today. I felt a lot of sympathy for the characters especially when one of the characters die (spoiler!).\n\nWhat makes How to Train Your Dragon 2 more exciting than it's predecessor is the action. It is more thrilling, more intense, and more adventurous than the first movie. Even though I didn't see this in 3D, it is still very exciting.\n\nOverall, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a film that kids and adults to see. Not only it was one of the best films of 2014 but it is the best animated film that came out of 2014. And yes, it is better than The Lego Movie but hey it is my opinion. I do recommend that everyone including the kiddies to see this film. Also, see the first one too. It is just as great as this one.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed the first How to Train Your Dragon film, and was looking forward to this one. It definitely lives up to the first film and delivers just about everything you would want out of it. It maybe a little dark and intense for younger kids, but as an adult I appreciated the fact that the movie had real stakes and consequences in its story.\n\nThe film picks up five years after the first film ended, with the young viking Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) having successfully taught the people of his village that dragons, despite their fearsome appearance, are actually just like dogs in their behavior and can live harmoniously with people. This new peace and stability is threatened, however, by a mysterious villain bent on enslaving dragons and using them to conquer others. Naturally, it's up to Hiccup and his dragon Toothless to save the day.\n\nAt this point in animated film history, it seems redundant to say that a big-budget CGI movie looks great: the Pixar movies all look terrific, and this one is about on par with them, especially in terms of its environments. Roger Deakins, the famous cinematographer who shoots almost everything for the Coen brothers and many other excellent-looking films besides, is listed as a \"visual consultant\" on both How to Train Your Dragon movies; I would be interested to know what exactly his role entailed, given that he works with live-action usually. In any event, the movie does look terrific, and the action sequences are really well staged. The voice work by Baruchel, Cate Blanchett, and Gerard Butler is excellent, and I appreciated how Djimon Hounsou just made his character scream ferociously to control dragons. My main issue with the film, which tells a fairly conventional story but tells it well, is that its relentlessly fast pace leaves little time for developing supporting characters. I find that as I grow older, I appreciate more and more deliberately-paced films, such as many of Hayao Miyazaki's works, which allow us to just get comfortable in the world of a fantastical story before setting off into adventure. While the fast pace does keep this movie engaging and exciting, I can't help but feel a little more quiet time with the characters early on would have made me like it even more. Still, that's not a major criticism, especially given that the movie's primary audience is kids. For what it is, this is still a totally successful movie.",

Emotion, comedy, and action isn't like other sequels.\n\nThough the comedy isn't really that much as Big Hero 6, it's just as funny. The romantic connection between Hiccup and Astrid is wonderful.\n\nStoick and Valka's song in the film tells the commitment of husband and wife, as they are, despite being separated for 20 years.\n\nI cried when [SPOILERS!!!!!!] Stoick died, and when he was sent off cremated in a wooden ship. I didn't see that coming, and it was very emotional for me that a father dies. This, unlike Mufasa's death in The Lion King, is the 'blink and you miss it' kind of death, but just as emotional. This is a worthy contender to Big Hero 6 and The LEGO Movie.\n\nOverall Rating: 9.0/10",

But considering the amount of people praising the shot out of this movie I got to say that I was really disappointed. To be honest this movie wasn't very good. Honestly I think that it's one of the most overrated movies ever made. I'm not saying that this movie is awful, there's so good qualities but there's also bad ones. The movies animation is great, it's smooth, and great to look at. The parts with the dragons is great. The score is also pretty good, I didn't think it was amazing but solid nonetheless. However that's where my compliments end. My biggest problem with the movie is the characters, I didn't give a shit about any of them. The voice acting wasn't convincing either. That very fact is the movies downfall because it tries to make you care about the characters so badly and I just couldn't. Even with the action and animation, I found the movie to be quite boring. One thing that was also poor about the movie was its villain, the villain was so undeveloped that I didn't find him a threat at all. In all I didn't like this movie, to be honest the movie is really forgettable, the movie isn't horrible but I can't get behind the acclaim that the movie gets. I'll give it a 5/10",

Once again we have a visually vibrant animated adventure which once more has a glittering display of arctic landscapes (and again another villain of the \"frozen\" variety--this time a new Northern dragon spews out a breath that turns out deadly icicles from the trajectory of its mouth). The story is very family oriented, including a reunion with Hiccup's mother and a rousing tribute to the best virtues of his dad. While it seems to have everything going for it, 'Dragon...2' trades fast-action scenes in from the former film;s stellar snappy dialogue, keenly drawn characterization, and the on-edge advantage that the underdog may falter and keep us on the edge of our seats. Perhaps unfairly, great expectations may bring inevitable disappointment, there's still no reason to skip this episode (and the box office receipts tell us there will be a 'Dragon...3,' but keep your hopes low for this flick--even if it remains a top contender for a \"Best Animated Film Oscar,\" which will seem more of a delayed response to the truly superb original film.",

Set 5 years after the events of the first film, the people of the Viking village of Berk have made peace with the dragons, and even using them in sporting events. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) spends a lot of time with his dragon Toothless, and they use their time exploring new territories. Until they and Astrid (America Ferrera) discover dragon trapper Eret (Kit Harington), capturing dragons for his boss Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou), a vicious war lord. Hiccup's father Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler) says Drago cannot be reasoned with, but Hiccup and Toothless set out to try anyways, and they come across the reclusive dragon trainer Valka (Cate Blanchett), who is Hiccup's mother. It's very well made, and it looks like DreamWorks Animation have found the perfect franchise to succeed the well worn Shrek films. It has some brilliant visual details throughout, and it has a good sense of humour as well, as well as some serious emotion going on, but the dragons on display is the icing on the cake.",

            "content": "\"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is visually inspiring but otherwise flat.  After the success of the first film, a sequel was inevitable.  I will give the writers credit for making some bold decisions involving the fate of a few characters, but the effect is lost due to the uneventful first half of the movie.  My temptation to quit on this overly-family-friendly-story was only tempered by the interesting design of the different dragons.  Disney has mastered the art of creating family-friendly films whose story and character development appeal to all age groups but I couldn't see anybody over the age of ten being thrilled by the first half of the story.  I've always taken issue with the casting of Jay Baruchel as Hiccup (his whiney voice is much better suited as a character voice, not a lead animated character that we have to hear for the entirety of the film) so the film definitely started off on the wrong foot, but it's the lack of direction that just kills it for me.  Creating a dark emotional moment only works with the correct setup, and this film plunged into it without taking the time to make sure it would resonate.  As in the first film, I find Toothless to be the only memorable character.  The story centers on Hiccup and Stoick and I'd be hard pressed to even remember the name of any other character, let alone cite a character transformation or explain their importance to the story.  How many characters can you name from \"The Lion King,\" an animated film that came out 21 years ago?  Now, how many characters can you name from \"How to Train Your Dragon 2,\" a film that I watched two days ago?  For as bad as the story is, the animation is that great.  The sensation of the POV dragon-riding shots, the creativity of the different breeds (?), and that animation of the ice were all stunning.  If \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" wins the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, it will be clear that it is for its visual graphics and not the film as a whole.",

The animation is great, and they manage to imbue the dragons with a lot of personality just through visuals, and while the textures aren't quite up to Pixar/Disney level (the ice here compared to Frozen is lacking a bit), it's still very beautiful, and - especially in the fight scenes -- very fluid and dynamic. That said, I did find the story itself rather predictable, and it it relies on a few too many cliches and expository sequences. That's not to say it's bad -- far from it -- it just lacked that spark that drew me into the original. Still, there's enough humour and humanity for the adults, and I think those kids 6-7 and up (there are a few scary scenes, and one dark one, that give me pause for those younger) will love it.",

With a musical score to match the first one's genius and a terrific storyline, How to train your dragon 2 was definitely the best animated film this year! A must see and an epic film for all the family to enjoy!",

The storyline was well put together and the different characters were a joy to watch. Hiccup and his dragon, Toothless, has to fight against some evil doers to save the dragon race. With the help of his close friends and his parents, the battle gets really intense and they manage to lose some close friends along the way. There is definitely something for everyone in this film, and the animation looks impressive. The director also added some emotional scenes, which actually touched me, and you can't help but feel for the sweat dragons who get hypnotised by a evil dragon who is controlled by Drago. Anyway, I personally preferred this to the first movie and I can't wait to see what they do with Hiccup and his travelling companion. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nI'm obviously not alone with thinking that this movie was a great watch because of the box office success. The first movie was more to make but this movie has nearly doubled the first movies profit, which must please the people at Dreamworks. Anyway, the voices used in this movie were well chosen by the director and the action scenes had a lot of attention to detail. The relationships between the characters is what makes you care what happens to the individuals, which is what surprised me about movie, and there are some great twists which keep the movie fresh and interesting. I think you can tell that I enjoyed this film so give it a try, even if your an adult without kids.\n\nBudget: $145million\nWorldwide Gross: $619million (WOW!)\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/comedy movies about the journey of Hiccup and Toothless who battle to save the dragon race against the evil Drago. 7/10",

            "content": "\"A SOARING ACHIEVEMENT IN ANIMATION & FILM\"\n\nAt the end of the original How To Train Your Dragon I was an emotional mess.  I was so moved by the story of Hiccup and his dragon Toothless. However, I figured that was it.  One beautiful movie and on to something else... NO!  I was so wrong and thank god for that!  But I was cautious going in.  Sequels often drop the ball and even ruin the original.  But I'm happy to tell you that not only does HTTYD2 prove sequels can be good, it also proves they can be better!   This is one superb film in every way and fans of the original won't be disappointed.  \n\nYou can't ignore the magic and wonderment of this movie.  Superb direction, flawless animation, a terrific voice cast, jaw dropping aerial action, and like the first movie there is heart in every moment.  Every character is so detailed, thought out, and expertly crafted to be a meaningful part of the film it makes you wonder how the movie didn't wind up being hours longer?  These filmmakers know what they are doing and they are doing it so well it's almost annoying.  Like, who are they trying to impress?  Oh Me, that's right.  Well consider me impressed!\n\nThe movie has matured with its audience as well.  Several years have passed between the two films and the characters are older so they deal with more grown up drama and that comes through in an all too pleasing dark manner.  They aren't kids anymore and their world is under a real devastating threat.  Lives are lost, others saved, and many changed in the film.  I stopped trying to count the number of times I cried because it was too distracting... so I think I just cried straight through the last half of the movie.  No joke.  I mean yeah I'm a sap, but holy hell was it powerful; powerful, beautiful, and very touching.  Toy Story 3 tore me up, but HTTYD2 left me in pieces.\n\nWhat is also really great about this sequel is that it stands alone as a whole, not as a part one of a two part sequel.  The movie has a clear-cut beginning and end and the ride is beyond engaging and it's downright thrilling!  The movie is clearly aware of its potential and uses the spectacle of flight in a most effective way.  I got dizzy at times as the 3D universe of HTTYD2 became so real I found myself moving and turning in my seat, grabbing for something to hang onto.  \n\nThe movie is pure wonder and will make you laugh, cry, and cheer.  One character even comes out and if you don't already know who it is I won't ruin it for you, but it's a moment that left me speechless.  DreamWorks really proved to the world that they aren't afraid to have a gay character in their kids films and that's really powerful to me.  Dragon 2 has pushed the envelope so far I can't wait to see what they bring to us with the 3rd and final film in the trilogy.  I'm sure they will not disappoint!  \n\nFINAL SCORE = 5/5 Bear Paws\n\nWest Fisher\n\nMovieBears.com, Las Vegas\n\nNevada Film Critics Society\n\nThe International Academy of Film & Television\n\nwest@moviebears.com",

            "content": "Hot off the critical and box office success that was How To Train Your Dragon, Dreamworks wasted little time in announcing a trilogy, and that second installment landed among us last summer.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I did not have the best experience leading up to this film. The marketing was inconsistent, starting with a fantastic teaser, which was followed by a terrible trailer. Terrible in the sense that it spoiled what I thought must have been a major plot point. Honestly, it was a crazy decision to include some of the details that they did. I was hoping to be proven wrong by the actual film, and that is was a piece of genius double bluff marketing. Unfortunately not.\n\nThe original How To Train Your Dragon was truly brilliant, and if the sequel even just matched the efforts of 4 years ago they would be doing well. It had a lot to live up to, and had already lost some of my favour in the build up.\n\nAt the end of the day it does fall short of the first film, and also short of the usual standard of animation in the past couple of years (terrifically high). How To Train Your Dragon 2 lacked that surprise spark that makes so many animation films wonderful for adults as well as children. It is not difficult to make an entertaining kids film. The Smurfs series is an example of a production made purely for children with no regard for their guardians. How To Train Your Dragon 2 is miles better than the Smurfs, but the fact of the matter is that I found myself constantly being drawn out of the film by inconsistencies and illogic.\n\nFrom dialogue that purely exists to expose the plot and a few convenient plot twists, one could feel constantly reminded that they were watching a film in dark room rather than inhibiting a world for 2 hours. Harsh maybe, but these are the perils of setting such high standards for yourself. There was a romance plot thread that didn't seem to know what to do with itself. It existed and didn't really justify the time given to it over the course of the film. The stakes were also raised, but the more personal story of last time worked better than the grander scale afforded this time.\n\nBut as far as negatives go, it rather does stop there. The animation is stellar, and the one area in which the first film is surpassed is the sense of scale you get with these dragons. It's very difficult to portray size realistically past a certain level, but the combination of animation and sound really brings these multi-ton dragons to life. The animation is used really well too. When you are given the gift of being able to stretch and morph things in any way you want, you really should use it. The comical dragons showed extent of how animation should be used. It's also funny enough, not as funny as the first film, but still contains a laugh here and there. \n\nThe problem is that all the highlights of the film are the individual jokes and spectacles rather than the complete package. It has most of what is required in animation for the standard level of quality, but is let down by subpar storytelling. The glue which holds everything together is missing, and all the pieces were so beautiful too!\n\nCoda: The promise was there, but this is ultimately a subpar effort from Dreamworks. The battle scenes are worth the entry ticket alone though.\n\nRead more at rabsi1.weebly.com/film/",

I actually really enjoyed the movie (not nearly as much as the first) up until that TOTALLY STUPID ENDING!!!",

            "content": "Starring: Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Cate Blanchett, and America Ferrera\nDirected By: Dean DeBlois\nWritten By: Dean DeBlois\nRated: PG\n\nBased on the book series \"How To Train Your Dragon\" by Cressida Cowell\n5 years after the events of the first film, the viking village of Berk has fully embraced living with dragons and making them a part of their lives. Hiccup is restless and longs to explore the growing world with his dragon Toothless, but his father Stoick thinks it's time for him to take over as chief of Berk. The arrival of the warlord Drago and a mysterious dragon rider, who is sabotaging his dragon catchers put a stop to their plans as war seems to be on the horizon. With the help of his friends and their dragons, Hiccup must try to prevent it and save Berk.\n\nThe first HTTYD was an instant favorite of mine. Fun characters, dragons that felt like they were real animals, and amazing 3D all made for the best family film of 2010. So when I heard of the sequel I was both excited and skeptical. Knowing Dreamworks' history of chugging out cash grabbing sequels made me a little anxious about whether this would turn into one of those. Thankfully, that turned out not to be the case, but it still ended up falling short of the first one.\n\nThere's some good voice work from the cast and I enjoy Jay Baruchel's as Hiccup, even though I know a couple of people who can't stand his voice. He spends most of his time conversing with a character that doesn't talk back but you instantly buy the relationship between him and Toothless.\nGerard Butler, Cate Blanchett, and Craig Ferguson are about the only cast members who actually sound like Vikings and are fun to listen to whenever they get to interact with each other.\nDjimon Hounsou and Kit Harrington were the standouts as the villain Drago and the dragon trapper Eret. They're new characters and are right away, easily memorable.\nJonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, T.J. Miller and Kirsten Wiig all return as the other dragon riders, but they are downplayed a lot in this and are mostly just there with little else to do. You could take them out of the movie and it wouldn't make much difference. It's a bit of a disappointment because they were fun amusing characters in the first and were a great contrast to Hiccup. America Ferrara gets to do a little bit more than the others and at least served a purpose.\n\nThe movie goes for a darker tone then the first one and is an admirable idea, but there is never anything really funny to break up the seriousness. There are a couple of cute moments in the background with the dragons but that's about it. Snoutlout and Fishlegs competing over Ruffnut gets old fast and felt like it came out of nowhere, but it does manage to have a somewhat humorous conclusion.\nSPOILER WARNING (unless you saw the trailer that is). The reveal that the mysterious dragon rider is Hiccup's mother shouldn't have been given away in the trailer. If they had left it to be revealed for the first time in the film then that would have been huge and a great moment. Not really film ending, but a disappointing choice on the studio's part, especially since the director was going for an Empire Strikes Back feel for this film. END SPOILER.\nAnother big disappointment I had, was the 3D (I saw both Dragon movies in RealD 3D). While the first one had lots of amazing flight scenes that made you feel like you were flying right alongside Toothless and the other dragons, the 3D here never felt as engrossing. There's a decent scene towards the beginning, but it always cut away just as it was starting to pull me in. If you see this, the 3D is a pass.\nThere are a few good moments, like a song between a pair of characters that are reconnecting and a pretty sweet battle preceding the finale fight. Toothless is still an amazing character and the animators do a fantastic job of bringing him to life despite him never saying a word.\nIt's not as horrendous as say the Madagascar or Shrek sequels and I will still see the third one when it comes out, I will just be less excited for it. Without much humor and the fact that it drags terribly (I was surprised when I got out that is was less than two hours when it felt like three) I'm not sure kids will enjoy this one, much less their parents. I'd say it's a rental if you are a Dragon fan.\n\n6 Reels Out of 10\n\n\"Drago Bludvist is a mad man!\"\n\"I'll bloody HIS fist with my FACE if he tries to take my dragon!\"",

I enjoyed the first one a lot more but looking at the critics score and the audience score obviously I am in the minority. Please read this review with a grain of salt. \n\nThe beginning of the film looked fantastic. The animators at Dreamworks really outdid themselves this time. The colors and the characters were very vibrant and visually pleasing throughout the whole movie. I thought the story line was interesting but there were a few instances in the film that I thought were unnecessary. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is very dark. They have a lot more death in it that didn't seem like it was all that necessary for the plot. When someone dies in a film, I believe it should in someway help drive the story. I did not feel that was the case for this. A lot of the darker scenes that had death in them were reconciled within 10-15 minutes of them happening. To me, I just didn't see the point of them dying. At the end I wasn't happy and I wasn't sad. I just felt ok and that is why I gave this a middle score of 3 stars. It is a well written story and the script was done well. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys animated films. Especially if they enjoyed the first one.",

In the scene were hiccup is at war the bad guy I'm sorry but I forget the villain name so I will say villain when the villain is trying with the ice dragon to get toothless to kill hiccup the dad... Tissue HE DIES I'm not joking people he dose to keep his son alive I Didn't NOT expect that coming maybe because dream works didn't want this character any more so in the next HTTYD to have mum time I think that good and bad because it was a weird death because of toothless eyes sorry but that what made it weird what good about it is he dyed for a good reason \n\n3)  trailers on trailers at dreamworks don't work out do they I think because of the low box office they didn't go we'll for the first weekend I think because of advertising I did not see a trailer on tv lucky I was on iTube and look at all the trailer it was ok but the trailer dose not give a good trailer \n\nHTTYD 2 is getting a 4/5 stars",

A little on the long side, but still emotionally powerful with twists in the plot that are equally heartbreaking and surprising; if you were a fan of the first movie you should love this one too. The action sequences are still exciting and the characters are still very interesting, and it will be fascinating to see where the writers go from here in developing this series considering how beloved it has become.",

            "content": "I had no intention of seeing How To Train Your Dragon 2 if being honest, I only went because I was asked, usually I plan what movies I want to see and usually I have a reason to want to see them, could be because of the director, writer actor or occasionally even the story may be the actual drawing card, why I had no intention of seeing HTTYD2 was simply I couldn't remember the 1st film. What I did remember was a boy and a dragon and a bunch of Vikings and that was about it. So when I was asked if I wanted to see the film with a work college and her husband yesterday evening at first I thought to myself\n\"If you're paying sure!\" ( not that they did :P)\nThinking a little more on it and actually remembered a Facebook friend going to a preview screening, saying how much he enjoyed it, I thought again and thought why not. It's animated which I love and its dragons which I love again, what did I have to lose?!?\nHonestly I had no idea what I was in for, wasn't sure if it was going to be a musical, wasn't sure of the new story, wasn't sure of anything.... As the film started a gorgeous animation style filled the screen, big detail, big colours, and the biggest surprise for me was hearing Jonsi from Sigur Ros singing the across the opening credits. Very life like features on the both the human characters and the animal characters as well It actually blew me away, straight off I was very impressed.\nSo the story is set in a Viking era where the world is still being discovered, The Vikings of a little township called Berk have learnt to live with their earlier enemy: Dragon. Dragon and human are now best friends and go everywhere and do everything together. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his pet Dragon Toothless a very rare Night Fury Dragon that shoots lighting balls instead of fire, are the very best of friends, Hiccup and Toothless apparently had some kind of altercation in the first film (I'm guessing, but don't recall) where both were maimed by each other and since then have become inseparable. While out one day mapping the world Hiccup and Toothless discover an unusual ice formation, whilst investigating the ice sculpture the duo find a group of Vikings who are in fact Dragon hunters. Night Furies being so rare is obviously the find of a lifetime and so the Hunters set their sights on capturing Toothless and his rider and return them to their leader Drago Bloodfist who for some unknown reason is capturing Dragons to use in his army. Hiccup flies back to Berk to warn his father the Chief, who instantly closes up the town and attempts to hide the Dragons away from the impending attack. Hiccup disobeys his father and flies off to confront this evil Dragon hunter Drago Bloodfist to get him to change his mind, whilst flying about Hiccup and Toothless are captured by another mysterious being known as Valka, who takes them to a Dragon refuge where the Alpha Dragon resides and protects his fellow species... \nBy this stage I was so enthralled in the film, I had finally figured out who the voice actor was of Hiccup (couldn't get Christian Slater out of my mind even though I knew it wasn't him) was and just sat on the edge of my seat as the story opened up even further. Not going to go any further into the story you'll just have to watch it to find out.\nPretty big cast as well a lot of well-known voice actors: as well as Jay Baruchel there is Gerard Butler, America Ferrera, Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kristen Wiig, Cate Blanchett and a multitude of other great actors who make this film work so well. They all work so well together, I loved the banter between the characters it really made the film so much bigger. Make sure you stay for the credits too, some amazing artwork plays behind the credits as Jonsi plays once again.\nSo what I wish they did differently was maybe a little explanation of the previous film, they gave hints throughout of the first film but not enough. Maybe they should have included some flashbacks or something, just something to explain exactly what happened and why the main characters were maimed, why Toothless can only fly with a rider and not on his own. Other than those two things I loved the film, loved the story even though it was about 4 stories being told at once that never really met anywhere it still worked. I loved the drama, I loved the action, I loved the characters but most of all I loved the Dragons, they were so realistic in their behaviors, even when they weren't the main focus on the screen seeing them behaving like actual pets playing in the background, having a chase or play fighting just being a usual household pet made this so wonderful and enjoyable.\nRecommend this one for everyone, only thing I would say is if you can, watch the first film How To Train Your Dragon before seeing the sequel especially if you haven't seen it already. It's not going to be a huge impact if you don't, the film works so well it's not at all necessary. So grab your kids or steal some for 2 hours and make your way to the cinema to see this amazing film.\nHow To Train Your Dragon 2 deserves 4/5 BanShee Screams and does anyone know where I can get me a Dragon? I really want one now.\nX\n#HTTYD2",
