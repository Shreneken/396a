            "content": "Ivan's Childhood, Andrei Tarkovsky's first substantial feature as director (he previously made a short of the Killers, and a 45 minute student film), is a near-masterpiece of adolescence shredded to pieces in subjective perception. It's set in world war 2, with 12 year old Ivan's family killed by the Nazis and his alliance with the Russian soldiers as a scout able to sneak past into small spaces more to do with vengeance than real patriotism. By the time we see him he's a torn figure, someone who at 12 looks and acts like he's already come of age, by force, and that this deep down has left him in a disparaging state of mind, pushing it away through temper (he won't go to military school, he tells his superiors), and only with the slightest escape through dreams. But in these dreams he's also tormented by his past, in fragments that hint to the psychological trauma through abstractions, of a splash of water hitting across the dead body of his mother while Ivan is at the bottom of a well, or in the natural and happy surroundings of a truck carrying fruits. One sees in this the only spots of innocence left in Ivan's life, the pinnacle (and one of Tarkovsky's most breathtaking scenes ever filmed) the final dream on the beach with Ivan and his sister running along the sand. In this nature, smiling faces, the filtering of the background of the forest, Ivan's Childhood is starkly incredible.The 'real' world as depicted, to be sure, is jagged, torn apart, in dark marshes and forests and with trenches dug for a long while and flares and cannon fire always in the air. It seems almost not to be entirely real, or as real as should be 100% truthful to battlefronts. But it's also, for the most part (sometimes it shifts to the adult soldiers like Kholin and Galtzev), through Ivan's point of view, and so this world around him that is ripped to shreds and bullet-strewn and deadened is amplified a little. There's a curious, evocative scene where Ivan, left alone in a dark floor of a house with a flashlight, goes around looking at the messages scribbled frantically as final notes from partisans, and it veers in-between dream and reality, where it could go either way depending on Ivan's mental state, as fragile as his physical condition. He finally bursts into tears, exhausted. It's this wild meddling with what Ivan sees or experiences or thinks and secretly fears through his would-be tough exterior that makes him so compelling and heartbreaking, as played by Kolya Burlyayev with a sharp level of bravery- not even Jean-Pierre Leaud was this absorbing, albeit on different dramatic terrain.It's a given that it was not Tarkovsky's project to start with, and, ala Kubrick and Spartacus, came in after a director had been let go to finish the picture. While it is remarkable to see how Tarkovsky does make it his vision, and quite an ambitious one considering how expansive the production design gets and the technical daring taken with his director of photography Vadim Yusov, and how there's a fresh and often original (eg dream scenes, placement of the camera, the scene in the post-war house looking at the records of the departed) perspective that no one else would have given it, there are small parts of the story that could have been dealt with a little better, edited, or cut out altogether. The character of Masha (played practically with one expression- practically cause of the moment after she is kissed- on her face) is a little unnecessary, or rather more of a means for Tarkovsky to practice some technical ideas in the forest scene, which really leads nowhere, and how her reemergence later in the film also doesn't serve much of a purpose. Maybe there's a point to be made about women in the army at the time, as she's an object of desire less much of an effective nurse, but when seeing her scenes (which aren't bad exactly) one wants to get back to Ivan and the central plot.But, as mentioned, one has to know that as a Tarkovsky picture what doesn't work doesn't matter so much as what does, and Ivan's Childhood is often staggering in its depiction of the brutality on the mind and consciousness, not just through Ivan but through his adult counterparts, and about how in a time when life can be taken away in an instant, almost without a sound, clinging to a past, however surreal, is all that can matter. There's truths reached about the devastation of war on the young, and those who care for them, that wouldn't be in a more naturalistic setting, and it's Tarkovsky's triumph that he steers it into the realm of a consistent, poetic nightmare narrative.",

            "content": "\"Childhood of Ivan\" is not only about Ivan's life but it stands as a symbol for the many Russian lives shattered by the war. This is an elliptical film, that is, it doesn't reveal everything - it suggests.\"Childhood of Ivan\" requires the use of your brain and imagination, but it is in no way a difficult film. Once you accept not understanding everything right now, just relax and follow the images and sounds and you are ready for the \"Childhood of Ivan\". As I said before the film uses many ellipses to show Ivan's fractured life - he plays in the fields, his mother calls him and smiles; a water well, he stares down at the water and his mother stands beside him and tells a story about the stars; we hear a gun shot, someone lying on the grass; Ivan is wading through a swamp to reach a soviet army unit.The war is not shown at all - it is suggested. We only see the enemy soldiers once for a brief moment. And two hanged men is all there is to denounce the carnage of the war. The rest is suggested by unfinished speeches, by faces where pain is followed right after by the desire to live and be happy......Ivan's memories: His mother, his sister and their games, the beach, the sea and the rain, his captivity - his life, a broken life. Nothing remained for him in life but to fight - to fight against the enemy that had taken everything from him.I repeat that \"Childhood of Ivan\" is not a partisan film, it doesn't try to demonize the adversaries. I would call it much more an intimist film, somewhat in the vein of \"Les Jeux Interdits\", but Ivan's childhood was over after the horrors he had to go through; his only way to survive as a human being was to fight the horror that had crippled his life, while the children of \"Les Jeux Interdits\" went on with their children games in spite of the war. France, because of her fast surrender, was preserved from the butchery inflicted on the Soviet Union.I recommend this film to everyone who wants to see a paradoxically sad, beautiful, reflexive and passionate film.",

            "content": "Tarkovsky appeared dismissive of this, his first feature, saying it was the sort of project dreamed up in film school pool halls. It was not a film he himself instigated, but it cannot for a moment be described as uncommitted or pedestrian. It most closely resembles some of the other 'names' in purely artistic cinema of the day in terms of formal style, Tarkovsky having not at that point worked out his own unique and so far inimitable 'style', if that's the right word. The dream sequence with the apples, though brilliantly done, seems derivative. He never used optical flourishes like that again.Tarkovsky believed a great deal of editing for the audience was vulgar and inimitable to great art, but this film is quite structured and conventional compared to his later slower and arguably more obscure works. The key performance comes from Ivan himself, a fine effort from one so young, and indeed Tarkovsky used him again in the bell section of Andrei Rublev; although he used rather harsh methods to get the performance he wanted in that case. Obviously influenced by Dreyer, you see the beginnings of Andrei's obsession with water and it's reflective calm around more tempestuous events. His use of black and white stock in terms of lighting is exemplary.The film's title is ironic as Ivan does not have a childhood, but the films majestic and moving final shot suggests that Ivan does receive a kind of immortality beyond the bleak finality of his discovered photo in Berlin, that the Russian spirit itself cannot be stifled and will ultimately run free.",

            "content": "And not just as a feature film debut, but Ivan's Childhood is a truly great film in its own right, and perhaps the most accessible of Tarkovsky's films(being his shortest and briskest). Tarkovsky is not at his absolute best here in the sense that his style was still settling and he went on to even better things(Andrei Rublev gets my vote as the greatest Soviet film ever made). This may sound like a knock but it isn't, even when Tarkovsky is not at his finest he is much better than most other directors when not at their best and Ivan's Childhood is still beautifully directed, up there with one of the better feature film directorial debuts.Tarkovsky's films are among the most visually beautiful I've ever seen and Ivan's Childhood is not an exception. The cinematography from Vadim Yusov is gorgeous and evokes chills, there is a dream-like quality to it but also a hard-edged realism. The use of landscapes is wonderfully Expressionistic, making the real-life sequences even more hard-hitting. The music score is haunting and the film is written in a thought-provoking way that wrenches the gut and breaks the heart. It isn't a Tarkovsky film without memorable scenes and images and Ivan's Childhood has those certainly, the dream sequences make the film(i.e. Ivan and his sister on the apple cart in the rain) but standing out too are the magical birch forest scene, the emotionally harrowing scene in the dark house and especially one of the most heart-breakingly powerful endings ever. What's remarkable is that while the story sounds simple, there are several characteristic Tarkovsky themes for so early on his career and when it comes to mood Ivan's Childhood works amazingly.Furthermore the story of Ivan's Childhood is incredibly touching, the childhood scenes are the epitome of innocence in a heartfelt, sometimes entertaining and charming way and in complete contrast(without feeling like two different films) the effect of the war and combat is both grotesque and poetic. The characters are interesting and vibrantly portrayed, although Masha is a little one-note for my tastes, Ivan is a compellingly real character who is easy to identify with from the get go. The acting is very good, outstanding in fact in the case of Nikolai(Kolya) Burlylaev who gives one of the best child performances I've ever seen on film. Overall, for a directorial/feature film debut Ivan's Childhood is incredible and as an overall film it's near-masterpiece quality. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "The first full-length feature film by the great Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky caused a sensation when it was released and shown at Venice Film Festival in 1962 where it won the Golden Lion. The world had not seen such a powerful motion picture about war and what it does to the youngest and weakest - the children. It is a bleak, haunting and horrifying portrait of lost innocence and the childhood that was interrupted the very day the boy's family was murdered. Although Ivan survived physically, he was changed forever, not a boy but a man who looked in the eye of triumphant death and horror. The film introduces young Nikolai (Kolya) Burlyaev in the fascinating performance as Ivan. \"Ivan's Childhood\" is a screen adaptation of the story by a Russian writer Vladimir Bogomolov \"Ivan\" which is a fiction story but it is based on the real facts. Millions young boys and girls perished during the endless days, months, and years of the worst war of the last century. Bogomolov fought as a soldier during the WWII. He was only 15 years old but he had forged his papers - added two years, dropped from his school and joined the Army. He had been seriously wounded three times but survived and finished the war in Berlin - the 19 year old soldier with six medals for courage and heroism. He was a very good writer and I love his books \"Moment of Truth\" (\"In the August of 1944\"), and \"Zosya\" that were also adapted to very good movies in Russia.",

            "content": "(***** out of *****)Ivan's Childhood is Tarkovsky's debut feature film about a 12 year old boy who volunteers to fight in the front lines against the German invasion because his family where murdered by Nazis. His size and height make him the perfect spy for the Russians as he slides his way across muck and swamp to bring back vital information about the German offence that no other man can achieve. At the same time his commanding officers object to this boy being used as a tool of war but have no control over the matter because of Ivan's convictions to bring down those that killed his parents.\nShot in beautiful monochrome the camera never ceases to capture nature, religion, dreams and love - all of which are major elements in any Tarkovsky film. This motion picture is one of the most stunning independent movies you will ever see.Sometimes Ivan cries like the child he is but this is not because of the burden of war but because he can not do what he wants most - to avenge the death of his family. Other times he is like a General in the making - standing up to his commanders, spitting orders back at them, making other soldiers look pale in comparison and walking into the fray without any fear attached. The dichotomy of his fractured personality is evident the most when he is alone. One moment he is dreaming of his mother, the next he is stalking the ghost of a Nazi murderer in the room where he sleeps (which is one of the most disturbing scenes in this film).The final sequence in the ruins of Berlin fully brings home the impact of the film's premise. This is a story about Ivan's Childhood and that is exactly what you get. Heart wrenching from the first frame to the last and never equalled. To think this was all made in 1962!  Shocking cinema at its very best.",

            "content": "IVAN'S CHILDHOOD is a masterful black and white work in which Andrei Tarkovsky demonstrates a complete command of stylistic improvisation, visual experimentation and complex use of symbolism. It is no less than astonishing that this is his first film. The story is a fairly simple tale of a young boy who wants to continue as a dangerous scout on the Russian front during the last days of WWII much to the dismay of the Soviet staff. The director employs an elliptical narrative which oscillates between an inner, dream-like vision, and actual events. Segments of the film are often introduced with extreme closeups which, at first, are difficult to recognize or understand. However, each scene is composed with the utmost attention to detail, and I don't think many paintings are created with this degree of clinical precision. Compositions begin stark and finely etched, and then seem to explode with meaning after the introduction of light and shadow. Although the film is set within the War Genre, the movie examines how war destroys the innocence of childhood. This masterwork contrasts the difference between an idyllic past where childhood should exist, and the brutal, warlike landscape of the front-lines. IVAN'S CHILDHOOD is a triumph of complex mood and nuanced style, and is truly one of the greats.",

            "content": "I have seen several very remarkable Russian films about World War II. Considering how badly the nation was decimated, it's not surprising that their films have a strong sense of sadness and sentiment. My favorite of these is \"Ballad of a Soldier\", but \"The Cranes are Flying\" and \"Ivan's Childhood\" are also amazingly good.\"Ivan's Childhood\" is about a boy who was left orphaned during the German invasion of his country. He is eventually found by the Russian army and he becomes a spy for them. Soon, he becomes a top spy--able to sneak back and forth across the lines and report back about the German movements--hardly noticed since he's a very small boy. But the Russian officers are adamant--no matter how valuable he's become, the boy MUST have a chance at a normal childhood. So they try repeatedly to send him to safety--and again and again he escapes and continues working for the war effort. Where all this goes is profoundly sad--but also, in an odd way, exceptionally artistic and lyrical. Andrey Tarkovskiy did an amazing job here--directing his first, and perhaps best, film. A few of the great film techniques is the way they showed Ivan's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, the nice use of flashbacks and the emotions in the film. Well worth seeing--but certainly NOT a feel-good film--which makes sense because the war was so wasteful and brutal.By the way, an odd thing about the translation of the film with English subtitles. Instead of the word 'sir', soldiers address their superiors as 'your majesty'!",

Overall the film is an example of directorial excellence, from a very simple story Tarkovsky is able to build a larger history with obvious references to christianity.

            "content": "Like most films of Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, My Name is Ivan (a.k.a. Ivan's Childhood), reaches out to the spirit within us. Based on a short story titled \"Ivan\" by the Russian author Vladimir Bogomolov, My Name is Ivan is a bleak but deeply moving film about a 12-year old boy whose parents and sister were killed by the Germans and is now a scout (spy) for a Red Army battalion. Alternating between idyllic dreams of childhood, nightmares of revenge, and scenes of war devastation, Tarkovsky creates a uniquely personal exploration of the effects of war on the mind and spirit.\nMy Name is Ivan is set on the eastern front during World War II. Ivan's (Nikolai Burleyayev) size allows him to slip behind enemy lines and obtain vital strategic information about German positions for the Russians. Burleyayev, who later portrayed Boriska in the bell sequence in Andrei Rublev, gives a truly amazing performance as young Ivan. As the film opens, Ivan wakes up jarringly from a poetic dream of his mother and finds himself in the attic of an empty windmill. Dodging enemy fire, he swims across a muddy swamp to reach a Russian bunker where the ranking officer, Lieutenant Galtsev (Yevgeni Zharikov), questions his credentials.\nIvan is short-tempered and speaks to the Russian commanders with bravado unusual for someone of his age. The officers, however, take an interest in Ivan's welfare and provide him with love and protection. When they plan to send him to a military school, Ivan demands to be sent back to the front, seeking to revenge his parent's death. Unable to persuade his superiors, Ivan runs away but finds only desolation and returns to camp. Despite the officers' objections, Ivan is sent on another covert operation.Tarkovsky shows us war but without bombs or glory or battle scenes -- only the suffering spirit of a child devastated by loss. As the film progresses, it becomes more and more an internal map of Ivan's mind. Haunted by the demons of approaching death, he seems to become emotionally inert. Tarkovsky said about the film (as quoted in amazon.com): \"I attempted to analyze the condition of a person who is being affected by war. When personality is disintegrating then we have the collapse of the logical development, especially when we are dealing with the personality of a child. I always conceptualized Ivan as a destroyed personality pushed by the war from the normal axis of development.\" Though an early film, Ivan presages Tarkovsky's later work with the use of hallucinatory camera work and very long takes where nothing happens for several minutes. Using dream sequences of normal life juxtaposed with mud-splattered reality, the film is suffused with an air of melancholy and longing. In a memorable dream sequence (supposedly lifted from Dovzhenko's \"Earth\") Ivan and his sister ride in a cart loaded with apples, in the words of Gregory Pearce, \"reawakens within us the longing for the lost purity of childhood\". This is one casualty of war not counted in the statistics.",

From a directorial standpoint, Ivan's Childhood is Tarkovsky's weakest film. It does not contain the kinds of things we associate with Tarkosky the auteur. If I had seen this when it first appeared, I would have definitely been impressed with it. But with Andrei Rublev, Tarkovsky created one of the best films ever made, a label that Ivan's Childhood is not likely to ever receive. Still, it is a great film with several great scenes. The problem is that Tarkovsky took this film over from another director. He didn't plan it. His major contributions were the several dream sequences, which are the best parts of the film (especially the one where Ivan and his sister are riding in the back of an apple truck when it is raining). Besides these dream sequences, there are several other good sequences and at least one other great one (the scene I refer to here is the one in the birch forest with Masha).

            "content": "A war film that is gritty and yet sheer poetry on the screen. There are so many visually stunning shots in Ivan's Childhood that I was often simply awestruck. The film delivers a message of national pride for the Soviets having defeated the Germans, but does it in such an unconventional way stylistically, and highlights the brutal human cost of the war in one of the simplest yet heart-wrenching ways possible, via an orphan (Nikolay Burlyaev in the titular role). He's not just any orphan, he's a tough 12 year old bent on revenge because his family has been killed, and he's taken up top-secret scouting missions for the army. Tarkovsky makes fantastic use of the contrast between dream/fantasy sequences and harsh reality, and even the latter is highly stylized, giving the film a lyrical, haunting feeling to it. He also did a great job in casting Burlyaev, who shows the range of innocence and joy in his dreams and surprises us with how hardnosed he is in reality. Valentina Malyavina is also quite striking as the young medical assistant, with her big, soulful eyes.Despite what is a fairly straightforward plot, the film can be a little disorienting at times, as Tarkovsky challenges us to fill in little gaps or interpret what we see, but it's never onerously so. He tells the story as a poet would, and gives us so many extraordinary images ... the dream sequence involving the well, with camera pointing upwards from beneath the water ... the birch forest with its endless trees, and that kissing scene (wow!) ... Ivan walking into a spiky circular phalanx of war ruins ... the sequence on the beach, with the game in which the children tellingly all fall down, and then Ivan running along the water with the little girl. He experiments with effects, camera angles, and even a couple of wonderful moments where the camera suddenly takes the dizzying point of view of a character. All of that makes the film dreamlike, but we also see devastation, and actual footage of some of the Nazi leaders and their families found after having committed suicide at the end of the war. There is such sadness here, and poignancy in the question \"will this be the last war on earth?\" Highly recommended, especially if you're new to Tarkovsky, since at 95 minutes the film has a concision and pace to it that many of his other films don't.",

            "content": "Born in Soviet Union, Andrei Tarkovsky was a master of world cinema. His production is compact but the range is vast: from historical epics to futuristic visions and movements of the human mind. Ivanovo detstvo or Ivan's Childhood was his first feature length film, which was based on a short story 'Ivan' by Vladimir Bogolomov, published a few years earlier. The portrayal of war from a child's perspective instantly proved the master's talent and his unique personality.The plot is quite difficult to summarize without getting into the details: the film builds on a series of episodes from the WWII. The protagonist is a 12-year-old boy, whose family has been killed by Germans. A group of Russian soldiers pick him up but when the boy refuses to leave and wants to take part in military actions; they're forced to keep him. The character of Ivan is built marginally: he is serious and smiles rather rarely, he lives a life which sadly has become quite normal for him - the concept of what is right and what is normal is totally twisted for him. At times he gets sudden aggressive bursts of hatred and moments of juvenile joy, when he forgets that he is a soldier.The poetic narrative of Ivan's Childhood is both classic and modern, Tarkovsky's style is strong, classical but on the other hand he modernizes cinematic poetry and creates something completely new and original. The film builds on many poetic contrasts: reality and fantasy, life and delusions, deserted dark areas and beautiful light birch forests. Dreams, fantasies and returning memories form pictures of the past, which are shown to us as the story goes on. As Tarkovsky realistically portrays the horrors of war, he paradoxically finds something poetic and beautiful in its all cruelty.Ivan's Childhood is a cruel and honest film. Does it portray the world where the point of no return has not yet been passed or one where there is no turning back. With regards to Tarkovsky's pessimism, obviously the latter. The story could've easily been juvenile and conventional but not in this case where Tarkovsky created an extremely original film about war in the eyes of a 12-year-old. Ivan's Childhood grows out to be a film, not just against war but against everything which turns us into something cruel, against everything which allows children to be exploited and let's them lose their innocence and childhood.",

            "content": "Tarkovsky's book about cinema (\"Sculpting in Time\") reveals its author's theoretical ability to be purely negative.  He's good at coming up with telling objections to opposing theories; but when it comes time to make positive assertions of his own, he doesn't do so and he doesn't candidly confess that he cannot do so; instead, he waffles.He argues persuasively that cutting doesn't have the importance others attach to it, and that no amount or style of editing can turn limp footage into exciting footage.  All very true.  So what IS cutting good for?  It's hard to tell, but I think Tarkovsky's short answer is \"nothing much\".  The only positive assertion he can make is that every shot (EVERY shot!) should be complete in itself.Many shots in \"Ivan's Childhood\" are, and are consequently hard to forget: the falling-in-a-dream shot at the beginning, the bomb in the well, all those images of the marshy forest (especially the shot of the flare travelling in a distant arc above it), that incomprehensible bit with the horse and the apples.  These images are hard to forget, but Tarkovsky's refusal to do anything - anything at all - with them, renders them pointless.  There's less point or internal unity to this film than there is to \"Fantasia\", which consists of seven semi-autonomous productions glued together, or \"Andrei Rublyov\", Tarkovsky's masterful second feature, in which (as with \"Fantasia\") the unit of meaning is the episode, not the individual image.Anothing \"Sculpting in Time\" says is that art's purpose (its only purpose) is to improve our souls and prepare them for the afterlife.  On these terms, is \"Ivan's Childhood\" successful?  Since Tarkovsky means his criteria to be taken literally, the answer is no; take them metaphorically, and it's hard to see what he's talking about.  But by sensible standards the film is a failure.  We have wonderful material (in a sense, the film is ALL wonderful material) sitting there waiting for someone to turn it into a film.",

It has been said about Tarkovsky, that he always made the same film over and over again, and although that is not quite fair, the visual imagination and poetry is the same in all of his films: the landscape of desolation with ruins and desertion, contrasted with explosions of poetry of tenderness, and these characteristics are perhaps here more evident than in any of his other films, his very first one. It is also one of his best stories, together with 'Solaris' (which was not his own) and his last film. It is the story of a twelve year old boy in the war who is already stuck in it, doesn't want to be sent to safety in a military school but insists on continuing risking his life as a scout against the wishes of his grown up friends among the militaries - there are two women in the film, one is his mother as he sees her in his dream sequences, a paradise in contrast to the hell on earth in the war, and the other is a soldier woman who is presence is almost equally lyrical, both connected with pristine nature. The story is devastating in its shocking conclusion, and you will not understand any meaning of the film until the end is clear.

            "content": "'Ivan's Childhood' is also known as 'My Name is Ivan' in the United States. It was the first feature film of the famed Soviet director, Andrei Tarkovsky, who took over the project from another young director after it was rejected for \"poor quality.\" Tarkovsky based the film on a short story by Vladimir Bogomolov, a very successful writer during the Soviet era. Supposedly, Bogomolov drew upon his experiences as a soldier in World War II but according to Wikipedia, some journalists believe that he never fought in the war and all his writings constitute a hoax!Tarkovsky immediately established a big reputation when he won awards at the Venice Film Festival as well as the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1962. Even Ingmar Bergman was quoted as saying that \"My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle. Suddenly, I found myself standing at the door of a room the keys of which had, until then, never been given to me. It was a room I had always wanted to enter and where he was moving freely and fully at ease.\" Not everyone was completely effusive about 'Ivan'. The NY Times critic at the time, Bosley Crowther stated, \"The one exception I take to this picture, which is based on a short story by Vladimir Bogpmolov, is that its structure is a bit too frail. Its emotional communication is too dependent on its impressionistic details.\"Indeed, it's the assorted palate of individual visual scenes that have drawn viewers to this film time and again. A good number stick in your mind (here are just a few): flashbacks of Ivan's mother and her subsequent demise; the dead soldiers on the other side of the river with the sign 'welcome'; Ivan being carried to bed by one of his soldier-protectors; the horses eating the apples; the soldier holding the nurse over the ravine; the graffiti of doomed partisans urging future viewers to \"take revenge\"; and the striking cinematography filmed on location in the marshlands near Kaniv at the Dnieper River.Despite all these great visuals, the film still doesn't work very well due to the weak script. Since the carnage of war is only suggested (which was obviously intentional on Tarkovsky's part not to show any overt clashes between Germans and Russians), he was forced to fall back on the conflict between the Soviet soldiers and their 12 year old charge, the jaded Ivan. Tarkovsky relies on the main conflict in which Ivan insists on continuing his activities as a scout as opposed to the Russian commanders, who insist that he be taken from the front lines and placed in military school. This tedious battle goes on for much too long until two soldiers, Kholin and Galtsev, who have befriended Ivan, decide to ferry him across the river and allow him safe passage into the forest, where he'll continue acting as a child soldier (Kholin and Galtsev meanwhile retrieve their two dead comrades under the tree).There's also a sub-plot that seems to go nowhere. Captain Kholin makes some aggressive moves on the Army Nurse Masha in the forest; you would figure that this might end up as some kind of sexual assault but nothing like that happens. The scene is probably there because simply focusing exclusively on the inert conflict between Ivan and the soldiers, cannot carry the entire narrative.The Ivan denouement is interesting because Tarkovsky uses archival footage from the Fall of Berlin. There are some disturbing images, particularly shots of the Goebbels' children, who were poisoned by their parents in Hitler's bunker days before Germany's official surrender. He uses this footage to work in a scene where one of Ivan's soldier friend discovers the boy's ultimate fate (executed by the Nazis, by beheading!).Ultimately, the message of a poor 12 year old orphan caught up in the horrors of war fails to have the shattering impact that most critics insist that it does. I can only surmise that many of these critics were so impressed by the dazzling virtuosity of a first time feature director's extraordinary visual competency, that any objective observations concerning plot, were lost. But there's simply not enough compelling conflict to keep this anti-war vehicle completely afloat. What's more, I understand the whole idea that Ivan's misguided thirst for revenge illustrates how war can affect an innocent child, in such a deleterious way. And of course his ultimate fate, is supposed to be quite tragic. But somehow I felt emotionally detached from Ivan probably because of the child's own detachment from reality. Tarkovsky's impressive impressionistic techniques at the same time leads to an emotional distancing. We see the dreamlike shot of Ivan's mother after she's killed but we never get to know who she is. Likewise her executioners. All we're left with is the emotionally detached Ivan and his enablers\u2014again not a big enough canvas for compelling drama.You might be interested in the fate of the actor who played Ivan-- Nikolay Burlyaev. Actually he's done quite well for himself: Since 1991, the founder and director of the Moscow Film Festival of Slavic and Orthodox Peoples and since 1996, founder and chairman of the International Association of Cinematographers of Slavic and Orthodox Peoples. One disturbing caveat according to Wikipedia: \"In March 2014 he signed a letter in support of the position of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.\"",

            "content": "Ivan (Nikolay Burlyaev) may be a tad less naive, but there's undeniably something of Come and See's Florya in his anger and his resourcefulness. Like Elem Klimov's devastating classic, there's a mouldy, naturalistic bleakness about Ivan's Childhood that does nothing to brighten the horror of World War II. Using a fractured narrative structure, Andrei Tarkovsky's first feature film concerns the titular orphan and his experiences as a scout on the Soviet Eastern Front.The film sidesteps the potential sentimentality of its premise (a definite risk given the presence of prominent father and brother figures) by using the situation to ask greater questions about the nature of war. When Ivan throws a tantrum when he's told by his commander that he's going to military school instead of the Front, we naturally question the boy's moral maturity, and his limited understanding of the hypocrisies and complexities of why men fight. And yet, by observing events unfold from Ivan's perspective, aren't we being made to ask such questions of ourselves? Do we really know better than him? With his family gone, and with his youthful eagerness and wanderlust, and his simple smallness, Ivan is more than qualified for his desired role. Hasn't he earned it? Fans of Solaris will instantly recognise Tarkovsky's ability to find the image that best depicts his characters' psychological state, without recourse to melodrama. \"Actors\" need not apply. Tarkovsky's eye is so exacting, so demanding, that it's like we're looking through some kind of x-ray vision, trained on the soul. And what soul there is to Tarkovsky: the last frames are the equal of those which close his elegiac science-fiction masterpiece.If ever one needs convincing of the difference between film as art and film as entertainment, perhaps Tarkovsky should be the first port of call. Not simply because a film like Ivan's Childhood (a perfect title, by the way) is so multi-layered, metaphorical, psychologically complex, eerie, strange and moving \u2013 but because all those ARTISTIC elements combine to form a highly ENTERTAINING film, thus making a nonsense of the notion that European \"art\" film exists to be admired but not enjoyed. Few film-makers can claim to have exploded such distinctions.",

This is director Andrei Tarkovsky's first film and is about Ivan who is an orphaned Russian pre-teen who is personally driven to do reconnaissance for his country during WWII. Many older soldiers are against him doing such dangerous work so why is he so compelled to put himself in harm's way? His backstory is told through feathered in flashbacks about various memories of his family that shines light on his intensions. The trouble for me was that the dialog, flashbacks and forward story progression are so disjointed that the effect doesn't work. There are several missing pieces from narrative that for me don't trigger thought, are too subtle, jarring and confusing. Not much of the dialog nor visuals advances the story effectively, from Ivan's perspective, and feels arbitrary. There is a second story of a female medical officer dealing with soldier advances which was actually more flushed out that Ivan's. On the plus side the cinematography was outstanding.",

The boy who spies behind Nazi lines is brave and stubborn, the fierce fighting spirit of the Soviets personified in this frail, wiry young body. His action is patriotic, but also a petulant vengeance Tarkovsky insinuates. The two army officials are different sides to it, the one calm and considerate, the other brass and boisterous. The woman that serenades them is almost an afterthought, a promise of love after the carnage.In other hands this would have been a simple crowdpleasing war drama, this is worthwhile because of how Tarkovsky makes cinema with these bare essentials. In his camera survives the legacy of Soviet film, Dovzchenko and Eisenstein. The camera that roams freely these rugged landscapes, the pensive closeups of hard faces lost in thought.Tarkovsky's personal mark to this legacy lies in how he wants to transcend this wartorn land and strife, the plaintive desire to enter into communion with worlds beyond the field of simply living and dying. Seeing around him he recognizes things which are not of this world, and which we can surmise only by the shadows and reflections they cast around us or inside of us. Dream realities within, shadows of the mind. Reflections of the divine without, cast on still waters ready, perhaps anxious to receive them. He captures these echoes and whispers in several shots, most poignantly for me in the recon flares that keep dropping from the sky in the distance, as though lighted matches tossed from celestial fire.He doesn't yet know how to pursue these visions or what they are, awe seems enough at this point. But it reveals a filmmaker biding time, ready to surrender himself over to God if only he would show his face. Few debuts are more cinematically accomplished than this.",

It pervades most scenes: the seemingly endless channel of water between the opposing sides, the huge birch trees stretching out as high and as far as the eye can see while also providing bunkers for the Russian forces. But nature's power is continually challenged by the great war going on around it and is ultimately defiled and devastated (like Ivan's, and the other young officers' innocence) - turning from green grasslands to mud and ashen trees.Reminded me of 'The Thin Red Line' in its use of the natural world war tries to ignore.

He wasn't supposed to be a part of such a cruel occurrence as war, but having lost parents, chose to help his companions-in-arms in risky and crucial way. In my opinion, Andrei Tarkovsky has made more an art house film than just a typical soviet military drama. We don't see cruel battles, we don't see divided by war love, we don't see a war itself after all. All we see is the consequences of the war in theirs different appearances. The objective of this movie is common - to show what gore and sorrow the war is holding. But Tarkovsky shows us this gore and sorrow in an interesting, unusual way, through the eyes of little boy, through his mind and dreams also. A black-and-white sharp and high-contrast shot adds definition and dramatic atmosphere to the picture. There are a lot of really frightening and inappropriate for children scenes in the movie shown by Tarkovsky in order to achieve necessary level of horror that war provides. So I think Andrei Tarkovsky made a great and strong film showing all horror and gore of war in a different style.

Nikolay Burlyaev is very effective in the lead role and the film is as sumptuously filmed as Tarkovsky's better known colour films. Right from the opening shot that magnificent pans up a tall tree, to spinning and angular shots as Ivan remembers what is to like to roam free, it is evident from early on that the film will be quite a visual ride - and indeed it is. Tarkovsky evens puts negative (inverted colours) stock to good use. Impressive as all this may be, 'Ivan's Childhood' is a bit of a bumpy ride. Valentina Malyavina is quite alluring as a character called Masha, however, all dramatic tension comes to a stand-still when the film randomly stops to concentrate on her walking in the woods for minutes on end. In fact, pretty much all the scenes without Burlyaev (give or take the final ending) feel very cut and dry. There are a lot of dialogue exchanges between the soldiers without Ivan in the room, which feels like a misstep since the film truly comes to life in both the moments when Ivan tries to act like a soldier himself and when Ivan remembers back to what life once was.",

            "content": "Many films have depicted the horrors of war and the loss of innocence that comes with it, but it's no coincidence that the very best tend to be viewed through the eyes of children. The big Hollywood productions tend to shy away from this angle for the simple fact that recent wars haven't been fought on their turf, leaving it to Europe and Asia to explore how war not only devastates the childhoods of youngsters, but destroys the development of their personality. Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky, making his feature debut, was keen to explore this idea in Ivan's Childhood, and the result was a work of art that can sit alongside the likes of Come and See and Grave of the Fireflies as one of the finest films to take this approach. We open in a dream, although we don't know it yet. Young Ivan Bondarev (Nikolay Burlyaev) is enjoying happier times with his mother as birdsong plays in the background. There's a huge noise, and the expression of Ivan's mother's face suddenly changes.We wake, with Ivan, from the dream and into the stark reality of life on the front during World War II. Ivan stumbles out of the windmill attic he's slept in and make his way across a battle-worn Soviet landscape, eventually reaching a swamp. Dodging enemy fire, the child makes it all the way across in near darkness, making contact with a small Russian platoon commanded by the young Lieutenant Galtsev (Evgeniy Zharikov). The brash and short-tempered Ivan insists that Galtsev contact headquarters to announce his arrival, while the inexperienced leader eyes the battered young soldier before him with curiosity. Eventually making the call, Galtsev is told by Lieutenant-Colonel Gryaznov (Nikolay Grinko) to give the boy a pen and paper so he can make his report on the positions of German soldiers, as well as giving Ivan a much-needed bath and hot meal. Having grown fond of Ivan, Gryaznov and his fellow soldiers aim to move him to military school, where he'll be safe from the fighting. But Ivan, after watching his family murdered before him, burns with the desire for revenge, revealing that if he is sent away he will only escape and join the local partisans.Like all of Tarkovsky's work, there isn't really a definitive plot driving Ivan's Childhood. Instead, Tarkovsky uses the characters and setting as a means to explore deeper themes, like war, fear, rage, loss and, of course, childhood. The film flicks between dreams and reality, often leaving the viewer unaware of which state they're in, as Ivan is spurred forward by the traumatic events he has endured. He is cynical and battle-hardened like the men around him, but he is still a boy, leaping into the arms of an officer and friend like a son greeting his returning father. As Ivan, Burlyaev is tasked with playing a character torn in half, often having to switch between the two sides of his personality in the very same scene. He pulls it off miraculously, cementing his place as one of the most powerful child performances of all time. Burlyaev is able to retain a youthful demeanour while possessing the look of someone much older and wiser, the most difficult feat faced by any young performer looking to play a child forced to grow up too fast by the adult world around him. At the end, Tarkovsky leaves us haunted by images of endless death and pointless savagery, making Ivan's Childhood one of the most devastating anti-war pictures ever made.",

Saying that, the determined Ivan and his mannerisms still convince me of this \"propaganda\" notion, and unfortunately it's kind of impossible not to see how blatant it feels and would be for any other country to tackle similar material. I greatly respect that the film itself actually has a sense of urgency and conflict about it, but of course the highlights would be how clever the atmosphere is depicted in such small things, be it a crashed aeroplane or a vivid message on the bunker wall (Or more famously wooden beams of a destroyed house looking as they've torn into the picture frame).Told in a non linear fashion with a few flashbacks, 12 year old Ivan Bondarev (A stunning performance by the young Nikolai Burlyayev) drifts between memories and reality as he races across War-torn landscapes and murky swamps to report to Russian soldiers. In a subplot many of these young soldiers find themselves in moments of self-gratification and unrequited love, and it is also revealed that Ivan has a burning desire to exact revenge on the German's after many personal loses.Tarkovsky's peculiar way of shooting water and natural surroundings starts here (With thanks to his regular Cinematographer Vadim Yusov), and it's as impressive here as it will be again and again. There is also a great deal of restraint when it comes to music that really helps in showing how empty the forests are around our protagonist. Whereas the original scripts ending drew criticism for a more uplifting scenario, I applaud that the films ending did not draw away from the cold realities of war, or the loss of more innocent times that will definitely stay in your mind for a long, long time to come.Final Verdict: \"Ivan's Childhood\", has received much praise from master film-makers. Whereas I feel the quality dips a little in the subplot, and lacks more of the deeper themes Tarkovsky is particularly renowned for. It certainly has enough of an impact that ranks as one of the best from this avant-garde director. 8/10.",

            "content": "\"Ivan's childhood\" was Tarkovsky's debut. It may be a rather conventional movie in his whole oeuvre, but the beginning of typical Tarkovsky feautures are already visible. There is stil a difference between dreamsequences and reality, but the dreamsequences are already there. The interpretation of these dreamsequences is rather subjective but some of them are stunningly beautiful. I think above all about the scene where a carriage full of apples keep losing them on the beach and horses are eating the fallen apples.In the Soviet Union films about the Second World War were popular. Initially the films were about Soviet heroes against Nazi monsters. In the Chroetrsjov period, war films became somewhat more nuanced and varied. The most famous exemple of this is without any doubt \"The cranes are flying\" (1957, Mikhail Kalatozov). \"Ivan's childhood\" is a (somewhat lesser known) example of this period of relative creative freedom in Soviet filmmaking. In this film the main character is not an adult Soviet soldier but a boy scout penetrating in enemy territory. In this respect it resembles \"Come and see\" (1985, Elem Klimov), also about the influence of war on a child. In comparison with this film \"Ivan's childhood\" has less violence and is a lot more philosophical.Another typical Tarkovsky element already visible in \"Ivan's childhood\" is the importance of the landscape for the mood of the film. The swamp seems to anticipate on the zone in \"Stalker\" (1979, Andrei Tarkovsky). The birch forrest on the other hand may be well inspired by \"Letter never sent\" (1960, Mikhail Kalatozov). In fact Tarkovsky tried to hire the cinematographer of this film (Sergey Urusevsky) for \"Ivan's childhood\". He dit not succeed, but the performance of Vadim Yusov (the cinematographer who did shoot the film) is worth of the highest praise.",

            "content": "Although My Name Is Ivan took place during World War II, it was actually made years after the war ended. The Russians suffered enormous casualties to the Germans in that war, and their animosity toward the Germans is clearly illustrated throughout the film. There are almost no Germans at all in the entire film, but the Germans as a group possess a very menacing presence, communicated by the Russians constant fear of an offensive.Ivan is a 12 year old boy whose mother, father, and sister have all been killed by the Nazis, and he is working as a scout for the Soviet army. It is made clear several times that Ivan is determined to seek revenge for the deaths of his family members, often seeming to refer to Hitler himself.One of the main messages of the film deals with the brutality of war and the fact that it is just as dangerous to women and children as it is to soldiers. War is an equal opportunity killer, and it almost possesses a physical presence by itself in this film. It is very impressive that My Name Is Ivan was so powerful in showing some of the horrors of war because there was almost no violence at all in the whole film.My Name Is Ivan concentrated mostly on showing an area and a group of people during a war but between battles. The damage caused by war is seen everywhere, and the effects that this damage has on the state of mind of the characters involved is almost overpowering. In this way, it seems that My Name Is Ivan is more of a 'consequences of war' film, rather than a traditional war film. It presents a view of war as a destructive machine that is on no one's side, and that is brutally violent toward anyone involved. There were celebrations in this film, but only the celebration of the end of the war. There were no winners, both sides of the battle suffered tremendous casualties and damage, and the way that the film ends suggests that the war itself was an exercise in futility that ended in nothing other than the relief that it was finally over.",

            "content": "Tarkovsky's legitimate first feature film, IVAN'S CHILDHOOD walked off with the Golden Lion in Venice, an honor shared with Valerio Zurlini's FAMILY PORTRAIT (1962). At the age of 30, Tarkovsky extraordinarily implements his stupefying aesthetic tack to the hilt, the film can sweep any new audience off their feet tout court, and sends out a biting anti-war message with soul- pulverizing poignancy.WWII, Eastern front, our hero is a 12-year-old scrawny Russian boy Ivan (Burlyaev), who is left bereft and hell-bent in his reconnaissance vocation urged by an inexorable impulse of avenging, the front-line is not a place for child, Colonel Gryaznov (Grinko) intends to send him to a military school (and adopt him when the war is over), but Ivan is already a fearless soldier in defiance of his gaunt figure, after having prematurely experienced a baptism of fire out of man-made atrocity, which entirely traumatizes his child-like innocence, there is no propaganda whitewashing in his characterization, he is brusque to his senior comrades, reckless in his intent to stay on, and holds a skeptical world-view jarringly incommensurate with his age. That is what war can afflict an innocent child, changes him into an anomaly. Ivan is pestered by dreams of his past, the ephemeral peaceful time with his mother (Tarkovsky's wife Irina) and his younger sister, both perished along with his father. Mesmerizing shots and distinct compositions bombard audience in glut: a slam-bang swooping take strafing not far off his mother; the diagonal angle is scintillatingly deployed to eviscerate the shambolic and dilapidated state of affairs; a striking framing gimmick magnificently transpires when Ivan and his mother gaping into a well, and the camera looks towards them from under, which generates an ineffably magical vision contends to be the tenderest moment in this war-torn living hell. Also unforgettable is the camera-work's sublime attribute of foregrounding its close-ups and often pensive portraiture, which plays up the supreme chiaroscuro, second to none in its expressiveness and legerdemain, like the haunting imagery of the marshland during the last mission of Ivan and his companions, the young Lieutenant Galtsev (Zharikov) and Captain Kholin (Zubkov). Tarkovsky doesn't even for once, avail himself of point-blank combat - the modus operandi of warfare movies to grant a direct outlook of thrill and terror, because in his insightful and humanistic philosophy, a more horrifying and excruciating scourge is the pervading trepidation hovering around before the blood-letting, it gnaws under one's skin but downright ineradicable, and progressively it becomes inimical to the soundness of mind. The plot is being expectedly downplayed in favor of its atmospheric richness. The sub-plot digression into Kholin's imprudent flirtation with a young army nurse Marsha (Malyavia) conveys a faint discomfiture of carpe diem expedient, a knock-on aftermath under such extreme circumstances. Ivan never reaches his adulthood, all he has is a stunted childhood that he could only embrace during his slumbers, Burlyaev remarkably liberates Ivan's unceremonious singularity with both acerbity and compassion, and, it goes without saying, everyone looks more stylishly stark under Tarkovsky's exquisite mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. A ground-breaking feature debut, IVAN'S CHILDHOOD wrestles gallantly with its unsettling subject and takes the risk to corroborate a somewhat inaccessible ideology in contrast with most patriotic offerings of its era, after all, what can a new viewer say after stumbling upon this time-tested masterwork? Just to be dazed and amazed!",

In one scene we see how the angry Ivan is disobedient to adults, in the next scene Ivan with tears in his eyes.Tarkovsky does a fantastic job portraying dreams (not as good as his later work, but still very immersive). Ivan sees the things that makes him happy in his dreams: his mother, his friends, him playing games, and him doing the unthinkable. While he's awake, he has to suffer. Not physical, but emotional.The director makes such a great balance between the dreams and the reality Ivan has to face.

            "content": "'Ivan's Childhood' was the Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky's first feature film. Tarkovsky became a filmmaker during a period in Russian history called 'Khrushchev Thaw' in the last 1950s. This was a period after Stalin's death when government control and censorship imposed on the artistic works was extensively lessened. The films that were made during Stalin's reign were mostly propaganda films which mainly focused on glorifying Communism. They also glorified war to some extent by underlining how important it is to give up everything you have including your life for the sake of your nation in a war. But during 'Khrushchev Thaw' with the easing of restrictions, new filmmakers including Tarkovsky started rising who wanted to make different films with newer approaches to storytelling. A whole series of films started being made where instead of glorifying war, filmmakers started to question the logic of fighting and these films also brutally depicted the devastating effects that war can have on the lives of the common people. 'Ivan's Childhood' is an example of a film which questioned war and had a sympathetic view of the people devastated by war.Tarkovsky is a true auteur of cinema. He had his own distinctive style of filmmaking which involved complex characters and complex narratives which defied cinematic conventions. He was probably one of the biggest proponents of subjectivity in cinema. Although 'Ivan's Childhood' does have some of the complexities which became a bigger part of his subsequent films, 'Ivan's Childhood' can actually be called one of his more accessible films.The primary theme of this film is the loss of youth and innocence due to the devastating effects of war. Ivan epitomises the common people and the youth of Russia and the whole world effectively. The first scene shows the ideal life that a child should have. We see an innocent and sweet Ivan running around tress and on the grasses, watching butterflies in bright sunlight and spending time with his mother. But this scene begins with a shot of a spider web in front of Ivan's face which gives a 3d effect to make the screen look almost broken. This signifies that while this should be his life, but it isn't. The very concept of his ideal life and childhood is broken. Then he wakes up from his dream and we see the dark and disturbing reality of his life. The grass is burnt due to the fire caused by bombs and explosives, the trees are barren and look like skeletal remains. The whole atmosphere is engulfed by dark smoke and there is shot of the sun getting covered by dark clouds as 'young' Ivan floats on a boat and tries to escape from the Germans. Without any dialogue, Tarkovsky managed to establish the theme of the whole film with the juxtaposition of these two contrasting scenes. A similar style was used by David Lynch in 'Blue Velvet' to depict the dark and disturbing underbelly beneath the ideal American dream. Tarkovsky used it to show the contrast between the ideal life and the real life during wartime. The real Ivan no longer has the innocence of youth, those traits have been replaced by a rough and abrasive exterior. He is now someone who has no hope and no aspirations. The only motive that drives him is to avenge the death of his family at the hands of the Germans. So he remains adamant about wanting to keep fighting and working as a scout in the war instead of choosing military school where the military officials want him to go as they genuinely became fond of Ivan and wanted him to leave the war and lead a normal life. There is a beautiful scene where Ivan comes across an old man whose house has been burnt down in the war and whose wife has been killed. This scene affectionately shows how war affects both the young and the old. The irony is while Ivan speaks like a mature hard man throughout the film, this old man speaks like an innocent child. He said he is looking for a nail, when Ivan finds one, he said it's not the one he is looking for. This beautiful dialogue shows how the man and everyone is looking for the 'nail' which is a metaphor for life before war, but no matter how much you try, you can never go back to it. We also from time to time go back to the dreams of Ivan where he is with his mother and his sister during happy times. This constant shift between his pre-war life and his life during war helps to intensify the disturbing nature of the stark realities of his real life.'Ivan's Childhood' really is a visual film. Visuals are used to convey a lot without any verbal exposition. However I still think that Tarkovsky was in the process of mastering his skills as a filmmaker and this is not a perfect film. There are a few rough edges. Some of the scenes during the last 30 minutes of the film didn't completely work for me. He made better and more accomplished films subsequently. There is a scene where Ivan rehearses his mission which I think could have been better. But the film ends beautifully when we go back to where the film started. We go back to the ideal life for Ivan. This can also be seen as an alternate reality where war didn't take anything away from Ivan. He is playing with other kids and his sister in the beach. He keeps running on and extends his arm trying to reach something or someone. This is a beautiful way to end a film which shows people and a country trying to find a way back from the devastation of the war, but just can't.",

            "content": "\"Ivanovo detstvo\" or \"Ivan's Childhood\" or \"The Youngest Spy\" is a Soviet movie from 1962, so this one is close to its 60th birthday, which says lot, but if I say that it was only made approximately 20 years after WWII, then you maybe get the message even better how old this is. The director (actually one of two directors) here is Andrei Tarkovsky and he is also one of the many writers working on the script here. Another would be Vladimir Bogomolov, who came up with the original story this film is based on. But the big name everybody sees here immediately is of course Tarkovsky's. He was around the age of 30 when he made this, so definitely one of his early career efforts, even if he wasn't a rookie anymore either at that point. He wwent on to color films later in his career, but this is still black-and-white. And he made films that were/are considerably longer, some around the three-hour mark even, but this one here barely makes it past the 1.5-hour mark. Which is actually good in my case because I have never been too big on Tarkovsky and felt some of his films dragged quite a bit because of the running time. Here it is tolerable. Then again, Tarkovsky is really hit-or-miss for many. Either they love his approach or he does absolutely nothing for them and I count myself among the latter having seen most of his famous films. There is still \"The Mirror\" that I will probably see next week, but then I have seen the majority, especially those with a rating of 8 and higher here on imdb. You can see from the ratings that many people really appreciated them. There is also awards recognition, but not really from America. This one here for example was extremely successful in Italy taking a big prize. So I already mentioned World War II earlier and in the title you can read the name Ivan, a boy who was born briefly before the war and now at the age of 12 is in the middle of it. Apparently, he is pretty influential and significant because the scene early on when he tells the Soviet guy to inform a high-profile commander where he is and that he is safe is pretty telling. The army dude does not take it seriously first at all, but still gives in eventually because of the boy's determination and also because the boy knows the names of high-profile Soviet army officials. Could it all be true? This was, like I said, surely among the more memorable moments, although I must say I had some doubts if it could be true that a boy plays such a massive role apparently. Another scene that stayed in the head for me was the lengthy one with the officer and Masha and how he is clearly wooing her, but she is hesitant. Maybe I found that one memorable because Masha was also physically the kind of girl I would be going for. She appeared later on two or three more times, but her great significance seemed gone and she was never as significant anyway as the officer in this scene I just mentioned. He is one of the leads, maybe as big of a lead as Iwan even.The actor is not alive anymore though. However, those actors who portrayed Masha and especially Ivan of course were very young back then and they are still alive today. Something that cannot be said about many other Tarkovsky films, also more recent ones. His narration and style is easy to identify, here is as well. I struggled with it because the structure is the exact opposite of clean to be honest. Makes it difficult for me to follow the action and plot and also to keep caring. Maybe just me though. Or certainly not just me, but I am positive many others have the same problem. But those who don't really love Tarkovsky's work(s). Anyway, this criticism also makes it difficult for me to really care as much as the end as I would have liked. The question there whether the boy was still alive or not was a crucial one and key for this movie probably, most likely the emotional highlight. Also in the negative sense because the way I understood it, he was not seen again. We cannot be 100% sure he is dead because we just find out what the soldier is finding out about what happened, but it seems unlikely he made it. One thing that implies this is what the German soldiers say. There are German WWII soldiers talking to each other on several occasions, so German language (my native language) is also crucial here and how they talk about killing the boy (not verbally) is among the most haunting moments of the movie. Also how they are talking about those they killed earlier and who we keep seeing in the water there to scare others away, although it felt slightly unrealistic that the Soviet protagonists ran exactly into those Germans who did this horrible act. Frequently, you have war films that do not take sides too much, but here it is very obvious that the Germans are depicted as evil. Also probably not too common that, at the same time, the evil barely gets killed. If at all. In the end, there is even a brief documentary part as we find out what happened to G\u00f6bbels and his many children and also two or three other things, but again, this mix was not really to my liking honestly, especially as the film continued immediately afterwards the way it was before. An unnecessary interruption desperately trying to add historic significance to me. Still, evenn if overall the weak is more frequent than the strong here for me, I will still end the review on a slightly positive note. The scene with the mother and the well was good (even if the mother's face was a bit repetitive, but I liked the stars reference there and also the almost poetic depiction of said quote in terms of light and dark. Visually, there is nothing wrong with this film at all. The explosions in the water from the bombs were also depicted hauntingly. Sadly, most of the other production aspects were not on par. That's why I give the overall outcome a thumbs-down here and do not recommend checking it out. It also felt pretty different to me sometimes compared to Tarkovsky's later works. You can definitely see change in his career and body of work as he was getting older and more experienced. If it is progress, well, that is up to you to decide. I say watch something else instead.",

Memories of a childhood that had been brutally destroyed oscillate between revenge, survival, courage in the swamps of the Volga River, resistance trenches and forests of the Siberian taiga under the Nazi German siege.With a poet's view of the war, Tarkovsky in the scorched earth scenario, leaves patriotism and military organization in the background to portray in the midst of chaos, the psychological and individual aspect of the characters. Red Army soldiers who find, care for and recruit Ivan, see the war with their own eyes, questions and needs.Ivan is a survivor without a family and destiny. Seized by the feeling of revolt, struggle and war are his only survival instinct, to be traced to death. The beauty in the nightmare, the poetry amid the chaos, the pains, dreams and memories of the purity tainted by mud and destruction make this film a psychological and artistic immersion in history in a great work of art. Certainly one of the greatest films about the world at war.",

There's a lot of the post-war destruction, that was very well shot as well, but no war action at all, if we don't consider the opening and near-the-ending sneaking around. The movie focuses of course on a child soldier, that is angry at Germans whom supposedly destroyed his family, and how he grows up, though his fate is tragic. This movie enlights on an aspect we don't really see of war in war movies, from a perspective and in a setting we don't really see often, and does it outstandingly.Yet I've put the lowest rating I gave to a Tarkovskij film. That's because it doesn't have that sort of thing other reviewers call \"Poetry\" Other Tarkovskij films have: even if I could enjoy this better than Nostalghia or Sacrifice, those film had much more messages to tell. But, still, I consider \"outstanding\" all the films I rate over 8.",

            "review_title": "A shattered childhood",
            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky landed his first major project {after his diploma film, 'The Steamroller and the Violin (1961)'} when original director Eduard Abalov was fired from the production, his work deemed unsatisfactory and unusable. Given that 'Ivan's Childhood (1962)' was initiated by other artists, one gets the sense that perhaps Tarkovsky's heart wasn't entirely in this one \u0096 it feels like a substantially less-personal film than 'Andrei Rublev (1969)' or 'Stalker (1979),' the other two I've seen so far. Nevertheless, I think I loved it even more than both of these. In his ability to establish mood, Tarkovsky was unsurpassed by any except perhaps Kubrick, boundless emotion communicated through a single beautifully-captured shot. The relatively straightforward narrative and themes of 'Ivan's Childhood' remove the nagging ambiguity of which the director was so very fond, allowing the viewer to simply immerse themselves in the overwhelming atmosphere. Perhaps it'll prove the least durable of Tarkovsky's efforts, but, for now, I have to say that I adored every moment.The loss of childhood innocence is a common motif in war-themed pictures, and seems particularly prevalent in Soviet cinema \u0096 for the finest example, look towards than Elem Klimov's harrowing 'Come and See (1985).' In this film, a close forerunner, Nikolay Burlyaev plays Ivan, a twelve-year-old orphan employed as a Russian spy on the Eastern Front. After his bright, idealistic childhood is yanked away by German soldiers, Ivan commits himself to the Soviet cause, refusing to attend school in favour of infiltrating enemy territory to gather strategic information. Stubborn and weary, he tramps cautiously through the clammy river swamps, keeping low to avoid detection. Even back in Russian territory, Ivan no longer bears any traits of the lively youth he once was. He resents the interference of adults, even those who tentatively regard him as an adopted son. The film's title, 'Ivan's Childhood,' notably refers only to the vivid flashbacks of Ivan's earlier years; from the moment his mother fell from a bullet, his childhood was over.It doesn't need saying that Tarkovsky's film is beautifully-shot \u0096 indeed, that would be an understatement. Vadim Yusov's cinematography is crisp, haunting and atmospheric, a truly marvellous effort from a photographer whose only previous experience was also on Tarkovsky's diploma work. 'Ivan's Childhood' contains little of the rampant brutality that made 'Come and See' such a traumatic, visceral experience, but instead achieves success through subtle contemplation, as was the director's style. Ivan's forever-shattered innocence is most startlingly recognised in the shadowy serenity of the river swamp, encroached only intermittently by the silent arc of an enemy flare. Ivan's wistful childhood memories are always basked in a radiant sunlit glow, but his present and future are confined only to the murky gloom of a marshland, or the cold walls of a military bunker. When the Russian base is faced with a German blitz, his only worry stems from the surreal realisation that he's not frightened in the slightest. An irreversibly corrupted mind and soul, Ivan marches onwards to his death.",

When the camera moves, it's an added bonus. Black as a barrel of gunpowder, slow and carefully considered, much of the film takes place in near-darkness, contrasting with the sun-drenched dream-scenes. Dream-sequence fans will find some gems here. There is also some curious quasi-religious imagery. Highlights include: the atmosphere evoked by the fizzing flares plopping into the marsh; the superb romance scene in the birch forest (stunning short-haired Russian woman in army uniform); the cascade of apples from the cart; the hand against the flame.

            "review_title": "Ivan's Childhood by Andrei Tarkovsky",
            "content": "If one were to break down a life span of a human into distinct phases, childhood would certainly be one of the most prominent phases of one's life. Andrei Tarkovsky has conveyed exactly the same message through his first feature, Ivan's Childhood. This is a beautiful rendition of the protagonist Ivan's childhood, a childhood that cannot be possibly recaptured in all its glory. The story has a non-linear plot and has a surreal and almost dreamlike representation of Ivan's memories and experiences. The traumatic experiences, especially those memories of Ivan's parents and sister murdered by German soldiers have a strong bearing on Ivan's mind, as he is fueled by the desire to take revenge against his perpetrators. The traumatic experiences have such a strong impression on his mind, that he no longer fears the strong possibility of death. He volunteers as a spy for the Russian Army, determined to find the light of the day against the injustices he has faced. Despite much hesitation by the generals at the Russian HQ against his enrollment initially, he manages to persuade the head-honchos at the Russian HQ to finally accept his services as a spy. Every frame in this film tries to weave a story. Tarkovsky's realist approach in terms of portrayal of childhood trauma is evident from his shot-taking. The realist approach juxtaposed with dream sequences and surreal representations of longing are the unique features of this film. Ivan, who is now on the forefront of the Russian platoon, on its mission to vanquish the German Army, finds himself of great help to the Russians due to his small size and agility. The vast barren landscapes and the war-torn areas portrayed in the film are nothing but an overt externalization of the people's memories and trauma in general, and Ivan's memories and trauma in specific. One of the most famous shots of the film is where Ivan is seen in the frame all alone with sharp spikes left behind after a war scene, all pointing towards Ivan, almost as if to indicate that the mind has entangled the poor boy and is trying to consume Ivan in whole. The ramshackle state of Ivan's mind has been beautifully externalized by swampy marshes portrayed in the film. The most interesting aspects of the film though are the initial and final dream sequences. The initial dream sequence shows how the free spirit of mind (in this case, Ivan's mind) can turn into his own adversary, by falsely implanting a happy thought that he might have shared with his mother. But the truth be told, the mind does not comprehend it to be a reality anymore, thereby taking evasive shape as a 'nightmare'. The never-ending possibility of the outcome of memories projected by the mind are portrayed by the long pine tree shown at the beginning of the film as the crane goes up to quite a substantial height to finally reveal the already tiny stature of Ivan. The final dream sequence, however, is on a contemplative note, where Ivan is seen running behind a small girl. It is probably a deliberate ploy adopted by Andrei Tarkovsky as it has the potential to convey many things at the same time. Longing, the desire to recollect one's lost childhood, lost fragments of a mind, a man chasing after his dreams or simply his desires. What is heart-wrenching though is the fact that Ivan dies without ever realizing or experiencing any of life's gifts. Also noteworthy is the inclusion of two other distinct dream sequences which refer to fragments of Ivan's memories, which Ivan particularly yearns for. Tarkovsky's obsession with incessant portrayal of nature is pretty evident, with focus predominantly on the various nuances of nature. Conscious decisions to use different faces on nature to represent different forms of human emotions is the forte of this masterpiece, which puts it in the same league as some of his later works, like Stalker and some of Bergman's and Kurosawa's films. Tarkovsky's portrayal of human emotions has defined a new style of film making, with many filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa and Ingmar Bergman acknowledging his style of contemplative film making. Persistent images of childhood resonate with the need or desire to familiarize with the deepest and darkest recesses of the mind. Hence, the images in this particular film are totally reminiscent of the hidden chambers of the various aspects of the mind which accentuate the need to empathize or sympathize with certain people or their lives' happenings.",

            "content": "Structured around three haunting dream sequences this departs from the conventions of the war film in being from a childs perspective, the action taking place during the lull between battles. Based on a source novel, it follows a 12 year old, orphaned by WWII, who operates as a scout behind enemy lines. Its difficult to read much of this film as other than symbolic. Take a dictionary of symbols with you when you watch it. Tarkovsky is saying through this film that even in the midst of death there is potential for new life and hope, such as the crashed plane in the form of the cross in the blasted battlefield. And that even in the midst of life, death is never far away. See the ending, maybe you ll agree! There's lots of religious imagery and allusions and itd be interesting to hear from someone with knowledge of the Russian Orthodox tradition has to say about it. The dream sequence with the well is really interesting, if you think about how the boy is positioned. Its as though the boy is both looking into and also up from, the well. There's a yearning in this film for reunification with the mother, of which the well is symbolic. Technically this film is extremely proficient. The opening credits sequence in the submerged forest is masterful. All of Tarkovskys tropes are there - the water, the fire. Check the scene early on when an exhausted Ivan is carried to bed by Lt Galtsev. There's a lovely moment of tenderness as the soldier, little more than a boy himself, lays the child to rest. The camera then pans across the brazier, the fire, and the water. This film exemplifies what can be termed Art Cinema, but it is a thoroughly engaging work which will appeal to anyone prepared to make a moderate effort with the subtitles. If you enjoy this I also recommend The Return 2003 and Come and See 1985.",

The highlight of the film is the astoundingly creative cinematography, with use of light and claustrophobic angles, it's full of kinetic energy that drives the film, shaping the surreal dreamscapes and jagged edges of the hyper-reality, with war scenes comparable to the scenes in Paths of Glory.

Crafted with composure and told with elegance, Ivan's Childhood is a poetic, poignant & heartbreaking portrait of lost innocence & poisoned souls.Firmly balancing tenderness with trauma and dreams of the past with nightmares of the present, the story is gripping when it is focused on the titular character's internal anguish & internalised pain which lend credible weight to his actions, behaviour & persona but loses its strength whenever it shifts to a subplot that adds nothing of value and serves no purpose in Ivan's journey.The desolate locations, elaborate set pieces, beautiful monochrome photography, smooth manoeuvring & excellent lighting work in tandem to uplift the film's imagery. And though the outward tone is bleak, there is a constant search for a human embrace. Performances are fine throughout, with Nikolai Burlyaev impressing the most in the eponymous role. However, none of it truly stimulates the senses.Overall, Ivan's Childhood lacks the polish & precision of better examples of its genre but for a debut feature, it is a promising effort. Brought to life with sincerity and honest in its depiction of the consequence of war, Tarkovsky's first film presents a fully-formed clarity in his vision & clear-headedness in his approach but whether he succeeds in evoking the desired emotions in his viewers is where we may have to agree to disagree.",

It's never a comfortable watch but a hugely rewarding one.There are number of excellent reviews posted up on Amazon, that it's difficult to know where to start, or to say anything different. I can therefore only add to the overall voice that champions this film of savage beauty.I don't have an HD TV, nor Blu Ray, but the incredibly sharp, startlingly detailed and full-toned black and white cinematography from Vadim Yusov allows you to feel every nuance, every detail. Ivan himself (Kolya Burlyaev), blue-eyed and fair headed looks striking. The cinematic feel is gently sweeping, eerie and faintly menacing, often at the same time is reminiscent of Bela Tarr's mystical films. As a photographer myself, I often admire many Russian director's eye for geometric composition and here, I'm very well catered for.Leaving the actual narrative aside, probably the most striking elements are Ivan's dreams. Ingmar Bergman also used this device very successfully and within Ivan's dreams, his childhood is re-lived, all too briefly. But, they are exquisitely beautifully composed scenes; the one with the apples and horses almost belies directional belief and the use of a back-projected negative film-stock against a positive one of Ivan is frankly amazing.Other folk will get different feelings and emotions - there are many elements that are of the highest order.

            "content": "Ivan's Childhood (1962) - [8/10]Ivan's Childhood (1962) was the directorial debut of Andrei Tarkovsky to mainstream cinema. This film is probably one of the greatest directorial debuts, as well as war films, in film history (Damien Chazelle with Whiplash (2014) and Orson Welles with Citizen Kane (1941) also are up there with really amazing first feature films). Ivan's Childhood (1962) is extremely interesting. It is not your typical war film, focusing on characters and their relationship with war; its effects on the human psyche. War strips away everything good in humanity. Children have to grow up. Adults have to fight. And the Earth weeps at the damage we sow across its face. Usually war films will focus on the \"action\" of war, the fighting, explosions, and death. Ivan's Childhood (1962) focuses on, not the \"action\", but the \"reaction\" of particular events. In some (if not most) instances the audience sees all the events leading up to a particular \"action\", but then the film cuts away, showcasing how this unseen event changed our characters. For the most part this technique really worked. There was only one or two instances where I felt the film would have been better if we saw this \"action\" because characters seemed to change a little too drastically without much mention of what \"happened\". But this film goes against mainstream war films' cliches and accomplishes something unique, original, and meaningful. Part of how it accomplishes this is through Andrei Tarkovsky's signature cinematography. Vadim Yusov worked with Tarkovsky on The Steamroller and the Violin (1961), so as Tarkovsky's own style developed, so did Yusov's relationship with him. The cinematography is breathtaking. There is so much symbolism between our characters (Ivan played by Nikolay Burlyaev, Kholin from Valentin Zubkov, Galtsev by Evgeniy Zharikov, and Katasonov from Stepan Krylov) and how this film is shot. At important moments, the camera would perform complex movements - long, sweeping, tracking shots - or it would stay completely still for a period of two minutes as the actors would bring this story to the screen. The diversity of different shots and when they're used is how filmmaking and cinematography should be. There should be a lot of meaning in everything, beginning with how you capture a scene. Tarkovsky and Yusov clearly believed this. Every type of shot is used, from close ups to beautiful wide shots. These shots are enhanced with how the scenes are staged, acted, and designed. The choice to film in black and white was a wise one (color film was accessible at this time, Tarkovsky had used color in The Steamroller and the Violin (1961) ), as it captured the contrast between light and darkness. That darkness encompasses a majority of the screen, truly showing how dark war is. It is contrasted with Ivan's childhood, filled with light and nature, so when the opening of the film jumps from joy to a depressing, war torn world, it works (Ivan's Childhood (1962) features an amazing opening). Tarkovsky oozes potential with this first film. Techniques he used in The Steamroller and the Violin (1961) were expanded upon and mastered. He began trying out new stylistic devices that became part of his signature with Ivan's Childhood (1962). He utilizes dream sequences that are entirely metaphoric, minimal edits, the dripping of water in the sound design, fire versus water imagery, and rich, symbolic, dialogue. This film is also very personal for Tarkovsky, and you can feel it. He grew up during WWII, much like Ivan did. He clearly feels that when war strikes, everyone's humanity, childhood, and sanity disappears. The most human moments a person can have are forced (the legendary trench kiss) unwillingly upon recipients with war. Our childhoods disappear, only but remnants of our past. Childhoods feel as if they were simply dreams of a time when everything was better, lighter, and happier. Children are forced to grow up, and in some cases mature faster than adults (Ivan is more tightly wound than most - if not all - the adults in this film and actually commands some of the adult characters what to do). The way humans are able to think is stolen. We are driven insane with war. Be it from revenge consuming our every thought (Ivan) or from the loss of everything material and spiritual (the man with the chicken), war steals the very thing that makes us human - our ability to think clearly. All of these ideas and more encompass this film. Tarkovsky influenced many other films with Ivan's Childhood (1962), most notably Come and See (1985) which pulls direct parallels from his first film. He was also influenced by many other filmmakers, Stanley Kubrick for example. There is a trench scene that quite resembles the many in Paths of Glory (1957), and it works. The best artists steal to make their art. Art that will consistently change over time, will be stolen from, and will change lives. Tarkovsky created a new type of war film with Ivan's Childhood (1962) and a new type of filmmaking. A sincere, poetic, and symbolic type of filmmaking. This film doesn't feel like a directorial debut. It already has a clear sense of style and storytelling. It's incredible. Tarkovsky started out extremely ambitious with his first feature film, and it payed off. Most directors would choose to play it safe. Make a film that would do well, but a film that isn't as unique or stylistic as other, established directors', films. This ambition and confidence paid off. Ivan's Childhood (1962) may not be a masterpiece, but it is made from a creator who is a soon-to-be master of filmmaking.",

            "content": "In the extensive genre of World War Two films this one separates itself in several ways. For one thing it depicts the tragic effects that war had on innocent children by concentrating on the experiences of Ivan, a preteen Soviet who has lost his parents to the Germans. Wars rob children of their youth, and often their lives. At best, in a case like Ivan's, war will leave bitterness and permanent psychological damage. Another defining characteristic of this film is that there are no pitched battle scenes, even though there is always a sense of danger. And we get a view of the war from the Russian side.This is a film that I appreciated quite a bit on an intellectual level, but my emotional response was never consonant with the tragic circumstances. Not sure why this was, maybe reading the subtitles got between me and the experience, even though I have not had that trouble with most foreign movies. Also, Ivan is so damaged and bitter that he has, understandably, lost all of the innocence of youth. You can lament the crushing circumstances that have made him what he is, but the emotional reaction is to the controlling factors rather than to Ivan as an individual. Where this film excels is in the black and white cinematography and the sound. In the presentation of memorable images Tarkovsky rivals Bergman at his best. Ivan's Dream sequences give us insights into his life before the war. Their brightness and lush foliage provide a stark contrast to the dark and somber world that Ivan lives in during the war. The musical score and sound are very effective - the scene in the birch forest with Masha and Kholin is a knock-out, both cinematically and aurally. This film causes us to consider the Soviet contribution to the outcome of WWII. The consensus estimate is that they lost over twenty million people, compared to less than a half million for the U.S. From most of what we see of WWII in the movies it is the U.S. that is portrayed as the prime force in the Allied victory, but the Russians can claim the victory with equal or greater authority.",

            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky made seven feature films over his life, and they are all assured works of an artist in full command of his craft. He started here, though, with Ivan's Childhood, a small film (his shortest by far) based on a novella that Tarkovsky himself didn't like that recalls Stanley Kubrick's first film that was far less artistically successful, Fear and Desire. Based in World War II with small casts of characters and an elegiac and dreamlike feel, both are the sorts of small first steps a master can take before moving on to bigger films. Seriously, though, this is much, much better than Fear and Desire.Sometimes just the mere placement of opening titles can tell you something about a film. The opening titles in Ivan's Childhood appear a few minutes into the film after we've seen two distinct scenes. The first is a dream from our titular character showing a tranquil and serene scene of life before the war. He was a child with a mother and a sister and everything was beautiful on that beach with his family. He wakes up, though, in a mill, dirty and harried, and he must cross a dangerous river from German occupied territory into Soviet territory. The crossing is filmed simply, but there's an ever present sense of danger as flares fall around the frame and the sound of gunfire fills the soundtrack. Then the titles appear announcing the title of the film: Ivan's Childhood. What defines the character's childhood is the disparity of his pre-war life, which he only remembers in dreams, and his current existence where he's a hardened former partisan and current scout for the regular army. This contrast is told purely through image and sound, without any supporting dialogue to point it out, and it holds for the film's first thirty minutes or so. The way this opening is told is ultimately rather affecting emotionally because we're asked to feel it, not to hear an explanation of it. It's the film at its best.And then I feel like the movie loses a bit. The focus moves off of Ivan and towards a small love triangle between Lieutenant Galtsev, Captain Kholin, and the pretty army nurse Masha. I think that this does end up fitting the overall theme of the film about the death of innocence in war, but we never get a really good ending to the subplot that would seem to justify it.The only person of any real advanced age in the film is Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, an older officer who looks on protecting Ivan as a son, but he's off being a general for most of the movie leaving the younger faced characters, especially Galtsev and Masha, to act as the adults in contrast to Ivan. However, Ivan is more the adult than Galtsev. When they're introduced to each other, after Ivan has returned from his mission, they're untrustworthy of each other, but it's Ivan who can order Galtsev around with his commanding tone, eventually getting what he wants from Galtsev without giving much of anything up. It doesn't help that Galtsev has a baby face that he keeps pristinely clean of any hair. So, we see all of these young people in the middle of certain death, trying to reclaim some kind of normalcy, most exemplified by the love triangle, while Ivan himself lets his dreams be his only escape. He's offered the chance to go back to the safer regions of Russia to attend military school, but he refuses, knowing his place is there on the front.That the war ends up claiming all innocence (except for Masha who just kind of disappears from the movie) with scars and death is the ultimate tragedy. Come and See by Elem Klimov, an ensuing Soviet film heavily inspired by Ivan's Childhood, took a similar course, showing the effects of war on youth, but while the later film obviously took the stand that the fight overall was just, this one never does. It feels like it's all a waste, like the Soviet people were fighting for nothing in the end. Considering that Tarkovsky would eventually leave the Soviet Union a few decades later to never return because of artistic financing and freedom issues, it might point to an underlying reality to Tarkovsky that the Soviet Union itself was never worth fighting for.A major reason this movie is remembered is its visuals, and they are richly deserving of praise. From the use of handheld cameras heavily influenced by the work of cinematographer Sergey Urusevsky in The Cranes are Flying by Mikhail Kalatozov to the use of inverted photography in one of the dream sequences to really stark compositions like in Ashes and Diamonds by Andrzej Wajda, the movie endeavors to be endlessly interesting to look at. The most visually striking elements overall are the use of strong exterior lights in interior spaces, creating beautiful streaks of light that illuminate the action inside, and the use of the forest in the scene between Masha and Kholin. The camera follows the two at eye level until Kholin holds Masha up over a small ravine where the camera descends into the ravine. When Kholin lets Masha stand on the other side after a stolen kiss, the camera returns to ground level and follows the action yet again. It's a wonderful move that just happens to occur in a scene that wish had been integrated into the overall picture a bit more.Ivan's Childhood is a good film from a great filmmaker, his first that shows real promise for his future. Oddly enough for his shortest feature film, I just think it's the one with the biggest problem with focus. What's there is never bad, not even close, but I just wish that it all flowed together more seamlessly.",

            "content": "IVAN'S CHILDHOOD, released in 1962, was Soviet director's Andrei Tarkovsky first feature film. An adaptation of a short story by Vladimir Bogomolov set in World War II, its protagonist is a 12 year-old orphan (Nikolai Burlyaev) on the Eastern Front whose small size allows him to scout German positions undetected. Ivan's missions have been useful to the army, but officers Lt. Col. Gryaznov (Nikolai Grinko), Capt. Kholin (Valentin Zubkov) and Lt. Galtsev (Evgeny Zharikov) would like very much to send him to a military academy to get him away from the front, especially as the final offensive against the Germans is imminent.The action in the film plays out between two of Ivan's ventures across the river Dniepr into German-held territory. It depicts the difficult life of the soldiers at the front and the destruction that war brought to the Soviet village whose damaged buildings now host the army. Ivan's back story is revealed elliptically through comments among the soldiers, dream sequences or flashbacks. A subplot involves Kholin's disturbing attempts to seduce Nurse Masha (Valentina Malyavina) and, in stark contrast to earlier Soviet treatments of the war, suggest that in wartime one's own fellow soldiers can just as dangerous as the enemy.As far as Tarkovsky films go, IVAN'S CHILDHOOD is still an immature work. You'll find nothing of the slow, almost ritualistic pacing that marks his later films, and this comes in at a compact 90 minutes. Still, a few shots (tracking shots of a wall, Ivan flipping through a book of religious art) seem like mature Tarkovsky in embryo, and the prominent use of religious iconography (crosses, fresco) is already here. Vadim Yusov's cinematography is memorable, with its several \"layers\" of view in certain shots, and the prominent framing of shots with broken timber beams that seem to hinder the characters. I was however very disappointed that at the end, the film segues into basically a Soviet anti-German propaganda film, complete with archival footage of the Soviet capture of Berlin. It is like some completely different filmmaker took over.",

His dark and moody and argumentative character seems so mature for his years, perfectly echoing the state of someone who has lived too much and grown up too soon. The flashbacks to his happy childhood of times with his family and playtime innocence contrast starkly with the sombre and spartan contemporary wartime scenes. The cinematography is excellent in showing these disparities between past and present; a light and bright memory with a grimy and grubby here and now.The editing is well paced, never allowing the flashbacks to halt the main action. Andrei Tarkovsky handles the main actors well, developing full and richly rounded characters. The final scenes are shocking and unexpected, mixing what looked like documentary footage with fictional shots to expose the horrors of German atrocities. The ending blows your mind, especially as you never see it coming.",

His family has been killed by the Germans, but we get dreamlike flashbacks of happier days that mainly include his mother (Irma Raush).The Russian soldiers he relates are primarily Lt.

There is not much \"action,\" the story focuses on the relationship between Ivan and the Russian soldiers and their desire to get him away from the front by sending him to a military school.

            "content": "Just at this very moment, that classic Jim Croce song starts playing in my head as I recall my screening of \"Ivan's Childhood\". Why is it that Tarkovsky, in nearly all of his films, has a wistfulness of the past, in a way that fogs his narratives so uniquely? After seeing \"Mirror\", I came to the conclusion that Tarkovsky is a cerebral artist, and much less of an actual filmmaker. For in that film, he used memories that nearly disjointed the entire piece, and eliminated the aspect of time and structure of narrative features. I thought of it, kind of like an Eisenstein montage of the recorded memory. So sitting down to \"Ivan's Childhood\", I fully expected it to be the same, as most filmmakers of his ilk don't stray from their artistic visions. What a surprise it was to know that the film displayed the best of Tarkovsky's creative vision, under the guise of what seemed to be a classic war picture. Ivan is such a wonderful character. He's a brave little boy, fighting for Russia in the midst of the worst times of WWII. The Nazi's were on the warpath, and everyone had to do their part in fighting to protect themselves from the ongoing threat of fascism. We know how hard Ivan can work to support his military, but he really doesn't want to be there. He'd rather go to sleep and dream of his mother, and the place of his childhood. We see visions of him and his mother, staring down upon a wishing well, or frolicking on a sunny beach. It's that longing sense of innocence and ignorance to the problems of the world. You might say that that's what all Europeans and Russians wished they could escape to during the atrocities of WWII. When it is revealed that his parents were taken away from him, thanks to the evils of the Nazi army, it is clear that this is war he has to fight, regardless of how badly he never wanted to be apart of it. WWII has sucked him in. There is no better understanding of this then the opening scene and long take of him emerging himself into a murky lake as he swims to his military base. The river overtakes him completely, as the main titles appear on screen. Tarkovsky is clearly trying to say something here. He's saying that there is no escape from war, and it forces you deep into the grimy depths of it. Even in the many scenes where he stays in the underground room, it seems even more apparent that he's trapped. Foreboding is the writings of German prisoners on the wall that warn of eventual death.The other characters of the film seem to be just as trapped as poor Ivan. For example, we see another Russian in the army, Captain Kholin, who romances a young Russian army nurse, during an assignment in the woods. The way he lifts her off of the ground and kisses her passionately as his legs splay over a short ditch in the ground seems like a silent cry for help. Even the most ardent of soldiers are desperate to escape this terror of a war. For just a fleeting moment, he wanted someone to fall in love with. When tensions are this high, do you blame him? Wouldn't you rather hold on to a beautiful woman, tight, instead of fighting in a world war? The ending of the picture is quite interesting, and many have analyzed its significance. Some have said that it is a flashback, but I have a different take on it. In retrospect, I thought of this final scene as Ivan making it to heaven, which consists of the happy times of his past. There is just something so touching about the final scene, that despite knowing that Ivan has been killed during war, he must have reached the place of his childhood in the end. He always found comfort in remembering the good times of his youth, and perhaps, let's say, he was sent back there to relive those days forever. The shot of the dead tree on the beach might just prove my point. The dead tree might be a symbol of passing on to the other side, in the midst of all the happiness that we see in the final scene. I genuinely feel, for certain, that Ivan went to heaven, and his memories are heaven to him. \"Ivan's Childhood\" is a sad story, but an excellent film by Tarkovsky, as he uses his exceptional talent of memories to convey loss and rejuvenation. There's a spirit to a Tarkovsky movie, despite having such a grim exterior. His movies are about life and death, and how we all must cope about our balancing act between the two. Sometimes, all we have is our past to help comfort us about our present.",

He yearns to be with his mother, it is obvious from the numerous poetic dream sequences that we are subjected to. The film revolves around Ivan, an orphaned boy who works as a spy for the Russian army against the Nazi troops during the WWII, and officials of the army who don't wish for him to endanger his life as a spy anymore. The film is in black and white and has some beautiful visual imagery. The cast comprises of a bunch of very good looking people. There's an interesting love triangle in the film - between two Army officials (Kholin and Ghaltsev) and a demure medical officer (Masha). War movies never engross me too much, but Ivan's Childhood has been an exception. Perhaps so because of the element of innocence brought to the film because of a child, Ivan.",
