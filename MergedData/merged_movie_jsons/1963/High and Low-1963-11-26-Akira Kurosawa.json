            "content": "High and Low, like Yojimbo and Throne of Blood, combines elements to create something special while seeming rather routine- while Yojimbo seems like a bad-ass samurai flick, it has the ingredients of a western and satire, and Throne of Blood is a rather faithful, strange adaptation of Macbeth in the guise of a warlord/samurai tale, High and Low does a similar method. Akira Kurosawa, a filmmaker who gets film buff's ears lit up at the mere mention of him, can usually be counted on to keep a film interesting even if it may not be entertaining to some of the crowd that likes a section of his movies or another (there's usually a split between his samurai/medieval tales and epics, and his dramas about the tragedies of ordinary people). Here he finds a middle ground- the story is taken from a hard-boiled detective novel, the kind you could probably buy for a quarter or fifty cents in the old days- as he tells of two stories interconnected at the hip, both with detail a commercial Hollywood director would brush off. The first is of businessman Gondo (Toshiro Mifune, with his usual bravura presence, but with enough nuanced and quiet moments for two movies), who is about to close a deal to get the shoe company he's worked for for years, when he gets a phone call. There's been a kidnapping- not his son, but his chauffeur's by default. Backed into a corner without options, he gets together 30 million he really can't afford, and gives it to the kidnapper(s). The police, meanwhile, are not about to give up, and start digging for clues with an in-depth investigation that goes to probe every possibility: the chauffeur's son used as a partial witness with drawings; a car; a trolly car; all this leads to nothing and everything, leading to a third act that's as riveting as the first two.Although the acting by everyone involved, cop characters included (Tatsuya Nakadai and Yutaka Sada are surprisingly good, the later even with limited screen time), Kurosawa keeps the film deliberately paced. Another director (more modern perhaps, but maybe not) might cut to the chase quicker, cutting past most of the investigation details, and even the emotional high-points in the first act. But Kurosawa is as interested in the nature and details of what the police do as he is with the compositions, which are constructed and framed as only an artist would do. The film creates a superb juxtaposition as well- Mifune's Gondo is enraged about what will happen with his money, but his morals stand above everything in his business affairs. Meanwhile, the cops here aren't cruel and unforgiving, but professionals trying to crack a case that the audience can hang onto. And then when the \"seedy\" underbelly of the city comes into view, it's looked on with at least some compassion by Kurosawa, and it's not too over-the-top.If all your looking for is thrill after thrill, like in Sanjuro or even Hidden Fortress, look elsewhere- the violence, by the way, is kept to a low level for this one (it'd even be quite suitable for kids, if they don't mind the subtitles and quintessential intensity in the Japanese style of film acting). But for tight, often gripping suspense in the IL' 'whodunit' mystery tale, this is a keeper. Manipulative, perhaps, yet in the hands of a master it's an exemplary deal. And, in the end, it even provides a sad, existential kind of conclusion as good and evil become blurred as the kidnapper looks through glass at the disillusioned Gondo. It's one of the great endings in world cinema. A+",

            "content": "This is one of those rare movies I had to watch twice to catch all the meaning and beauty of its construction, that is how sleek and polished this film is. The storyline is deceptively simple -- a businessman named Gondo is about to take control of the company he's worked in for years when he's told his son's been kidnapped.  It turns out the kidnappers got his chauffeur's son by mistake, but they still want him to pay the ransom.  If he does, he will be financially ruined.  If he doesn't, he will be reviled.  Which will he choose?  This makes up the first half of the movie, culminating in a breathtaking scene on one of Japan's bullet trains.  The second half is the police search for the kidnapper/murderer and how a case is built that will take him to the gallows.Now this sounds like your typical cop thriller, the type Hollywood churns out with one hand tied behind its back, but Kurosawa makes it into a meditation on honor and decency, and on how one's choices can lead one to Heaven or to Hell in little steps that seem to be taking you nowhere.  Gondo is an honorable man who worked hard to built himself a life of wealth and power.  This is no small feat, considering Japan is not known as a society where one can easily change one's station in life, so this adds to his dilemma; he will not only lose his fortune, he will also lose his hard-gained power and respect in the business community, all for a child that is not even his.  And not only will he lose but his own wife and son will, as well.  But to NOT pay the ransom means he will lose everything in him that is human and decent, and his wife and son will suffer from that, too.This is a big deal -- not just in Japanese society but in the world as a whole.  It doesn't matter if you live in Nepal or Kenya or Argentina or New York City, when faced with the choice of losing your position in your society or losing your soul, which would you choose?  And would you still make that choice knowing that even if the cops catch the bad guy, it will make no difference in your own circumstances?  Just a glance at some of the recent stock scandals gives you a good idea of where most people fall in their choices.  And even Ed McBain, upon whose novel this movie is based, knew how hard it would be to give up your world for your spirit; his businessman refuses to pay the ransom.To me, this movie is Kurosawa at his best and most subtle.  Every shot is composed and measured and done just right.  Not all films have to have bombs exploding and chase scenes and people going \"Boo!\" to affect you; sometimes just a man riding on a train en route to what he knows will be a catastrophe to him and his world is enough to make you thank the heavens for a story well told.",

            "content": "\"High and Low\" is one of those deceptive detective-thrillers that sneak in under your radar and grab you from behind with their storytelling magic. It's proof positive of Kurosawa's mastery of film and all its imagery.The story was adapted from an Ed McBain \"87th Precinct\" novel, \"King's Ransom\", and is really very simple. A successful businessman (Mr. Gondo) in the middle of a major deal is told his son has been kidnapped. All concerns about money fly out the window...until Gondo learns it was actually his chauffeur's son who was taken by mistake. Doesn't matter; the kidnapper still wants him to pay the ransom, even though it will bankrupt him. Will Gondo destroy his standing in the business world to save the life of a child that is not even his? Or will he just leave it to the police and fate to determine whether the child lives or dies? This makes up the first half of the film.The second half deals with the search for the kidnapper and his accomplices, and it does not shy away from showing how dull and grueling good police work is. Step by step, the cops narrow their field of suspects and build their evidence to link their prey to murder as well as the kidnapping, meaning he would face execution. This makes up the second half of the film.It helps to know that in the original story, the businessman refuses to pay the ransom but does help the police track down the kidnappers. It also helps to understand that in Japan, working your way up from making shoes and satchels by hand to being in a position where you could wind up owning the company is a HUGE accomplishment in a caste driven society. It means he is due additional respect, and this is what Gondo faces losing if he pays the ransom, which is far more important than the fact that he will be driven into bankruptcy. From the first scene through an amazingly exciting section on a bullet train to the ending moments between Gondo and the kidnapper, Kurosawa shows exactly why he is a master of cinema. To take what is basically an episode of \"Law and Order\" and make it into a meditation on the meaning of life and evil is not something just any film school twit could do.To me, the best moment on a human level comes when Gondo descends the stairs the morning after the kidnapping to explain to the police why he cannot pay the ransom for a child not even his. You can see the man realizing he is allowing himself go to hell in order to protect his family and station in life, and Toshiro Mifune underplays it beautifully...and Kurosawa lets it just simply happen. Wonderful.THIS is the movie Mel Gibson's \"Ransom\" wishes it had been. something real and human and meaningful instead of merely kick-ass.Ten out of ten stars.",

            "content": "Up till now I've only seen Toshiro Mifune in Kurosawa's samurai movies, so it was kind of comical to see and hear him in this film when he stated \"Shoes are my life\". It just struck me as rather funny, but then, almost on a dime, Mifune's character Kingo Gondo reacted to his young son playing cowboys with a friend by stating that in a tense situation, \"Man must kill or be killed\". That had to be a subliminal rationale for Gondo's decision to wrest control of his National Shoe Company away from the owner and executive board. Borrowing against everything he owned, he was about to make a business deal that would have set him up for life.The first half of this movie sets up a moral dilemma for Gondo after a kidnapping gone awry puts him in the position of having to come up with a thirty million yen ransom, not for his own son, but for the son of his chauffeur. Without having knowledge of the Japanese mindset, I had trouble understanding why Gondo would have refused to pay the ransom if it meant his son's friend might be faced with death at the hands of a maniacal kidnapper. Granted, we had insight on the strings Gondo had to pull in order to put together the takeover plan for his company, but to my mind, the scales were balanced in favor of saving the kid. It was interesting to see how it was Gondo's wife and chauffeur who appealed to his better nature and not the police detectives assigned to the kidnapping case. Chief Inspector Tokura (Tatsuya Nakadai) remained emotionally detached during these confrontations, which struck me as somewhat odd.What's also intriguing is how the film switches gears in the second half after the ransom demand is finally met, and the police begin their work to solve the crime and capture the kidnapper. The forensic work of the detectives is quite significant in scope, taking into account such features as train schedules, landscape, locations of phone booths near Gondo's home, and the recollections of the young kidnap victim who was released after the ransom was paid. Having identified the perpetrator however, I was left stymied as to why the detective team failed to make an immediate move on Ginjiro Takeuchi (Tsutomu Yamazaki) when they had a chance more than once on the street. Since the apprehension was eventually made at a hideout location identified by Tokura, it didn't make sense to me why the police waited, other than as a concession to the script. Nothing of significance occurred with the kidnap suspect to suggest the cops should have delayed.The final sequence in which Takeuchi requested a face to face meeting with Gondo reminded me of a similar scene in the 1938 film \"Angels With Dirty Faces\". Only in that movie, Cagney's Rocky Sullivan went 'yellow' at the request of his childhood friend Father Jerry, whereas Takeuchi transformed from an arrogant and smug wise guy into that of a cowardly punk in the face of execution for the murder of his two associates in the kidnapping case. Except for Gondo appearing at the meeting with Takeuchi, the disappearance of Mifune's character in the second half of the story almost made it feel like one is watching a different movie.",

            "content": "\"High and Low\" could be considered two movies.  The first, \"High\" takes place in Kingo Gondo's (Mifune's) hilltop mansion.  The crime occurs and what follows in the next hour is one of the most meticulous and brilliantly constructed film segments I have ever seen!  The first half of the film could almost be considered theatre.  It is static and deceptively simple but.....so intense!  The ensemble acting is superb with Mifune a stand out as usual!  Connecting these two movies is the train sequence.  After the calculated intensity of the first part this scene comes at you like a sledgehammer!  These four or five minutes are magnificent!  So very exciting and so very quick it leaves you drained when it ends!  \"Low\" begins with the hunt for the criminal.  Only \"Stray Dog\" comes closer to capturing the cop's decent into hell.  This last part of the film is fast and furious.  We are no longer an observer.  We have become part of the chase.  First, we know who the criminal is.  The police do not know and what follows is a fascinating puzzle being put together before our eyes!  The last scene in the film is unexpected, deeply disturbing and left me numb and staring at the TV screen after the film had ended.

            "content": "While I've seen HIGH AND LOW referred to as a \"film noir,\" a \"detective drama,\" a \"riveting game of cat-and-mouse,\" and so on into infinity, I think those terms tend to underestimate some very great films (such as this and Kubrick's THE KILLING) and attempts to place them within boundaries over which the expanse of a few powerful films such as these spill.Indeed HIGH AND LOW is a story involving some familiar techniques from film noir; the detective story; and the hunter-and-hunted storyline, but it surpasses so many films that might be included in a list of fine films noires.  It, in true Kurosawa style (one which Stanley Kubrick matched blow-for-blow, seeming to complement one another in their stunning gifts to the cinema), stands as a fable showing the differences and tensions which the coexistance of different classes creates.Gondo, the rich on high, receives torment from those who live below him, being literally perched upon a hill, overlooking the city in a feudalistic way, in which the king's palace gazes down upon the serfs below.  As the kidnapper says, \"it's hot as hell down here.  But you wouldn't know that, you have air conditioning.\"  Thus we see the parallels pile upon each other: it is about class warfare but also shows the differences between heaven and hell; and Gondo makes both a descent and ascent simultaneously.The plot is simple, but the truth is complicated, and I won't go into it here, but take my word as it stands: this is an amazing piece of film. See it now or regret it!  Every Kurosawa film is sublime.",

            "content": "Kingo Gondo is a wealthy executive at the National Shoes company in Yokohama. He aims to make affordable, sturdy footwear for the masses. His co-workers opt instead for those of the cheap, low-quality variety that will wear easily, meaning they will need to be replaced often. In secret, Gondo organizes a leveraged buyout of the company, mortgaging all he has to afford it. However, just before he makes the deal, the son of his chauffeur is kidnapped and held for ransom. It's clear the kidnappers intended to kidnap Gondo's child, and he feels just as responsible as if they had. Will the police- led by the capable Inspector Tokura- be able to find the child and solve the extortion plot before it's too late?Loosely based on Ed McBain's novel 'King's Ransom,' Akira Kurosawa's 'High and Low' is a powerful police procedural that will keep viewers' attentions held rapt from start to finish. With a screenplay by Kurosawa, Hideo Oguni, Ry\u00fbz\u00f4 Kikushima and Eijir\u00f4 Hisaita, the film examines many themes in an eloquent manner, including those of honor and morality. It also paints a picture of then-contemporary Yokohama as a city built upon an endemic inequality between the classes, and shows how easily the disenfranchised and impecunious can fall into a life of crime.'High and Low' is a tense thriller that feels most authentic. Kurosawa shows us with precision the minutia that the police engage in, how they build their case and begin scavenging the city for clues to the kidnapping. Slowly, but steadily, headway is made, and Kurosawa doesn't rush the procedural process of the investigation. This is not to say the film is in any way slow-moving or drawn out, because the opposite is the case: 'High and Low' rockets along at a brisk pace, feeling all too short at 143 minutes; if anything.The film reunites Kurosawa with cinematographers Asakazu Nakai and Takao Sait\u00f4, whose camera-work and shot construction is mightily impressive. 'High and Low' has an assured visual style, and the utilization of shadows is most striking. There is one instance of color being used in the film, which is to great effect; while the remainder of the black and white cinematography is rich and textured. Though he made some beautiful looking pictures in his time, the naturalism and style with which 'High and Low' is captured makes it a standout in Kurosawa's filmography.As do the terrific, power-house performances from his cast. His second-to-last collaboration with the incomparable Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, here his original muse stars as Gondo, giving a masterful performance of much restraint. Mifune creates in Gondo an initially fastidious character, whose evolution over the course of the film feels both authentic and subtle. Often, when one thinks of Kurosawa and Mifune, the Samurai pictures spring first to mind; though their work together here is just as impactful and entertaining as any of those earlier films.Co-starring as Inspector Tokura is Kurosawa's second muse, the great Tatsuya Nakadai. Always a commanding presence on screen, he plays Tokura as a charming, determined detective who will do anything to catch his man. Though he has less emotional volubility to exhibit in the role, Nakadai performs just as strongly as Mifune; and neither man overshadows the other. Additionally, in a small but pivotal role stars Tsutomu Yamazaki, who showcases much depth and range, leaving a lasting impression on the viewer.Thrilling from beginning to end, Akira Kurosawa's 'High and Low' is a brilliant piece of film noir, featuring an interesting examination of class at its center. Boasting stunning cinematography, as well as strong performances from all in the cast, there is little fault one can find with it. If you haven't seen it before, and you're a fan of police procedurals, they look no further: for 'High and Low' is a masterpiece of the genre.",

            "content": "Toshiro Mifune is a businessman in a Japan that is on the brink of the Economic Miracle of the Sixties.  He is an honest man who loves his job as a shoe factory exec and is in a battle for corporate control against a pack of hyenas.  He has mortgaged and borrowed and scraped to raise the money for a surprise coup when his son is kidnapped.  But there is a major plot twist: it is not HIS son that was taken but his son's playmate, the chauffeur's kid and the ransom demanded is astronomical.  If he pays he will lose everything he has worked so hard for, but can he just sacrifice the chauffeur's child because it is not his?  From here on High and Low (perhaps better translated as Heaven and Hell) is a police procedural based on an Ed McBain 87th precinct story.Watching this film I had a rare, almost unique, experience.  I saw it on a fairly screen tv, letterboxed, in a darkened room.  All the preceding conditions helped contribute to put me into an objective/subjective middle ground where I had the feeling of looking through a special visor that allowed me to see the world by means of an almost perfect film as if through the eyes of a cinematic genius who is in total command of his artistic means and in total command of his subject matter.  I think the key to this experience is that while High and Low is interesting as human drama, it is yet peculiarly uninvolving emotionally but very involving cinematically. These distances are important in Kurosawa's films (he is high on my list of top ten directors but after Welles).  In IKIRU you probably could not be more deeply involved emotionally, while in RAN there is nothing but relentless distance.I think a good companion film to watch with this would be Kurosawa's earlier, looser, but much more individually tense, police film STRAY DOG (this time Mifune is the cop)",

            "content": "Too often when people talk about Akira Kurasawa, they emphasize the samurai movies he made so much that the average film buff might incorrectly assumed that's all he did. In fact, most of his films were NOT about the samurai culture, but about modern Japan.Among the best of these non-samurai movies are Ikiru, Scandal, The Bad Sleep Well and this film. High And Low is set in contemporary Japan and it's the story of a kidnapping. The first half of the film centers mostly on the Toshiro Mifune character and the impact of the kidnapping on him. It seems the kidnappers accidentally kidnapped the chauffeur's son and not the one belonging to corporate big-shot Mifune. He struggles with whether or not to pay the extremely high ransom, as it will likely bankrupt him and his family. This dilemma is handled very well. The second half of the film is centered on the forensics and police footwork done to try to bring the perpetrators to justice.Particularly outstanding in this film is the pacing. Some might consider it to be a bit slow, but I loved how they fused a human drama with the step-by-step police work (similar to a Law And Order episode in how it unfolds, but in even greater detail and attention to realism). The acting is also top-notch, though it is not a \"Toshiro Mifune\" movie per se, as he barely appears in the second half of the film. Instead, it's an ensemble film starring many actors you might recognize from previous Kurasawa flicks.I saw this on a Criterion DVD. The picture quality was absolutely PERFECT--like the print was just made yesterday. However, it was very disappointing to see that this DVD had NO EXTRAS!!!

Especially affecting are the police detectives, whose proletarian roots contrast sharply with the cold insensitivity of the powerful corporate executives.

But unlike Welles, he moved away from flamboyance and in this film moves into actual meditation after the fashion of Eric Rohmer. What we have is a long (by conventional standards) decomposition of a painting. Greenaway would later use this idea in `Draughtsman's Contract.'The first part of the film is the presentation of the painting: several characters in a room -- Gondo, his wife, his assistant, his driver, and several policemen who we yet know little about. This section is very technical visually with the camera composing every conceivable combination of these people in this room. This is _not_ like `Rope,' where the intent was to confine the film itself. Here we use the space as a device to frame the images, that's all.This section of the film is a complex painting like say Vermeer, but we have the luxury of seeing it in all its possibilities. Once we have exhausted these possibilities, we have a short section which triggers the decomposition of characters. The train introduces motion and extent that we live with for the remainder.Then the decomposition proper. The participants in the painting struggle with logic and clues to understand what it all means. In turn, we discover something about each of the individuals that constituted the initial tableau. There are no extraordinary people or events here and I presume that's the point. The solution to the crime is simply that someone else saw the same tableau through the windows and didn't like/understand it. The `viewing' of the film takes place on four levels: that of us the audience, that of the examining police, that of the voyeur kidnapper, and that of the `public' through the popular media. It is `Rashomon' folded into itself.This is somewhat challenging, but worth it: durable yet stylish.",

            "content": "HIGH AND LOW is one of the excellent contemporary thrillers that Akira Kurosawa made during the peak of his career. Unfortunately it's a sub-genre that seems mostly forgotten about today, passed over in favour of Kurosawa's well-renowned samurai movies. It's a shame because these films often have just as much to offer.HIGH AND LOW tells a detailed, lengthy story about a kidnapping and subsequent police investigation. It's a long and slow-moving film but one which rewards close submersion into the storyline and narrative. Toshiro Mifune is cast against type playing a hard-headed shoe factory boss whose son is kidnapped for ransom. However, the kidnapper gets his kids mixed up and accidentally kidnaps the chauffeur's son instead.What follows is tense, well-shot and superbly acted, as are the majority of the director's films. Mifune gives a bullishly realistic turn as the proud factory boss but it's Tatsuya Nakadai who really shines as the smooth detective brought in to solve the case. Watch out for Kurosawa regular Takashi Shimura in the minor role of the police chief. Essentially HIGH AND LOW is a film in two parts, and the original Japanese title - HEAVEN AND HELL - gives some idea of Kurosawa's thematic ideas. Watching these characters descend into a literal and figurative Hell makes for unmissable cinema.",

            "review_title": "Morality as a choice-driven virtue, not a duty...",
            "content": "\"High and Low\" is Akira Kurosawa's unsung masterpiece, it's strikingly similar to \"Straw Dog\" in its meticulous depiction of police procedural and the indirect canvas it offers for an exploration of Japan's social strata in the mid-sixties, from the highest layers to the lowest depths, presenting in painstaking precision the cohabitation between the upper and lower classes, made of protocoled compliance and officious defiance. It's one of the few modern dramas directed by the Master, as if his usual period \"Samurai\" movies wouldn't fit the social significance he's aiming at.To understand that, one should get to Kurosawa's vision of humanism, only a virtue if the character has a choice. In his Jidageiki movies, samurai or warriors lived under a code so strict that their bravery was closer to the realms of duty than genuine heroism. Only until his masterpieces in color, Kurosawa could portray characters the viewers could both admire and relate to, from the petty criminal played by Tatsuya Nakadai, charged to impersonate a lord in \"Kagemusha\" to the greedy and ambitious sons in \"Ran\", Kurosawa was never better as painting the flaws of humanity with a firm but forgiving hand and this is why \"Rashomon\" is such a milestone, it offered a new vision of characterization, not relying on personalities' actions but on their perception by or resonance on other people's live. Kurosawa is perhaps to cinema both an Einstein and a Sartre, bringing relativity and existentialism.We're good or we're bad by choice not by duty.This is why there always comes a point in his dramas when a flawed character chooses his destiny and this is why it never worked better than in movies set in the contemporary world such as \"Drunken Angel\" and \"Ikiru\" and even more in police procedurals like \"Stray Dog\" because these film offered a panoramic view on a Japanese society devoid of such codes of honor as the Bushido, so socially broad and ethically uncertain that it became the arena where the forces of evil and good, greed and generosity, calculations and disinterest, confronted each other. \"High and Low\" is the culmination of that introspection through one of the most painful choices ever forced upon a man, so vital to the film's emotional backbone that it needed a twenty-minute set-up. The opening is a remarkable exercise in exposition all in detail in concision as if Kurosawa was already experimenting in his directing style the same rigor applied by the detectives in charge of the case.The residence of Mr.Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is located at the top of a hill offering a panoramic view on the lowest parts, it's vast, well-furnished, his boy has a cowboy disguise and plays with the chauffeur's son, which means that he's rich enough to be a chauffeur. Gondo is a no-nonsense self-made-man and one of the stockholders of a huge national shoe company and is coerced by his associates to make a move against the president whose old-fashioned views are incompatible with their visions of profitability, making lesser shoes but with higher profits. Gondo refuses the deal but what we take for a proof of integrity is contradicted by his plan, he bought enough stock to lead the company alone, which forced him to mortgage his house and twenty years of social ladder climbing; it's a fool-proof make-it-or-break. One phone-call later, he learns that his son has been kidnapped for a ransom of 30 million yens, we expect Gondo to pay, but that would be too easy, there's a catch in that plot.If not the best or the most iconic Kurosawa, \"High and Low\" has certainly the greatest premise, the boy was the chauffeur's son, the two kids had switched disguises. The cops come, the chauffeur keeps quiet until he hears his son and then begs his boss to do something. The kidnapper realizes his mistake (which makes sense since there's no reason the son would pretend to be Gondo's) but the dilemma is all the same, either Gondo pays and jeopardizes his future or he lets the kid die. That's the equation. We know a man like Gondo will be likely to pay, it's interesting however to watch him examin his own conscience under the tacit observance of the police officer played by Nakadai. At that point of the review, I don't want to spoil much of the film because it is one to experience, and on three levels: the ethical dilemma, the police investigation and the social documentary on Japan in the 60s where the absorption of the Western way of life went at the expenses of the ancient codes.While the first part is set completely in Gondo's house, a fitting bridge sequence makes the transition to the investigation that will structure the entire second part, with tracing calls, interrogation, tailings, facial composites and all the archetypes. Gondo is absent for the most part but we feel his presence from the efforts displayed by the public opinion, the chauffeur, his son and the police. Such a fruitful zeal couldn't have been possible if the right choice wasn't made; which raises a challenging question: is it always a matter of doing your job or is morality the true driver or people's actions? Had Gondo made the wrong choice, his public and private aura would've been destroyed, his decision was moral and ethical but let's not pretend it wasn't also practical. Still, maybe it's because Gondo climbed so high that he could have a full view on the low he could sink, materially or symbolically.And when the investigation leads us to the criminal, we realizes he'd jus offered us the perfect counter-example as man who was so low that he saw the highest spot reached by Gondo with envy and jealousy instead of climbing his way to the top. Indeed \"High and Low\" is a captivating immersion into the heights humanity can raise itself above and the lowest lows it can plunge in... and it's a terrific cop thriller!",

            "content": "Possible SpoilersA film of expert and scrupulous construction, High and Low demonstrates how a gifted filmmaker can control the structure of a film to enhance tension and narrative suspense. This film came at the zenith of Kurosawa's career and his skill is apparent in every shot; it is the work of a man who possesses complete mastery of his craft, and the movie is a masterpiece of 'constructional' film. Externally High and Low is about a kidnapping case, but as the title suggests, it is also about paradox, and relationship between polar opposites. The film can be enjoyed at both levels, either as a suspenseful police procedural, or as a meditation on opposite and similar existences. Because Kuroswa intertwines both, the film is extremely engaging. As in Ikiru, Kurosawa forces the viewer to abstain from empathizing with the characters, and it is through this method that the viewer can learn from them and appreciate the situations they exist in. One of the few films to create suspense through structure, High and Low deserves special notice. It is in this aspect that Kurosawa's expertise really shows. As in Ikiru, High and Low is broken into separate parts. The first trimester takes place entirely in a living room. The angled shots, intense close-ups, unchanging setting, and the viewers anticipations all contribute to an acute suspense that culminates in one of the most powerful transitions to ever take place in film. The transition scene occurs one a train, and the sense of motion and speed allow the viewer to experience tension and excitement merely through change in setting and suggestion of motion. Once the suspense is resolved the movie takes the form of a detective story, as the kidnapping culprit is sought after. The procedure is very interesting and the methods and processes of the detectives easily intrigue the viewer. The discovery of the culprit is accomplished through a brilliant sequence of editing, in which Kurosawa demonstrates his skills with one of the most fluid and seamless series of cuts in filmic history. Afterwards the detectives pursue the criminal and the film reaches conclusion with his capture. As always Kurosawa's shot composition is gorgeous, but in High and Low it also serves to support Kurosawa's affirmations about man. High angles and low shots combine with intense close-ups to elevate tension and remind the viewer of the films ever-present motifs. As previously stated the editing is worthy of special notice. The acting is superb, but not as prominent or vital to the film as others of Kurosawa. Sound is used carefully and successfully, and dialogue is minimal but effective. High and Low must be seen by Kurosawa devotees and fans of well-crafted cinema.",

            "content": "In the late 50s and early 60s Kurosawa's pictures began to get increasingly pessimistic and depersonalised. High and Low pretty much represents the peak of this trend, a film noir every bit as cynical and universal in its condemnations as Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly or Orson Welles' Touch of Evil.Kurosawa's style is sometimes hard to categorise, because he was always adapting it to suit the story. Here, we get very contrasting styles within the one film, which is informally divided into three \"acts\". The first, set in millionaire Gondo's mansion is composed in whites and lights, with few cuts or close-ups. The middle section, in which the detectives track down the kidnapper, is constructed with point-by-point technicality, and a sense of urgency with short scenes and plenty of cross-cuts. The final act is the titular \"low\" \u0096 a look at Tokyo's seedy underbelly, with low key lighting, agonising close-ups and awkward angles.This structure is perhaps where the problems of High and Low lie. It's occasionally uneven and doesn't flow well as a whole. The first act is the best - a tight, confined drama like Hitchcock's Rope. Kurosawa's handling of his characters' emotional turmoil is expertly choreographed in the placement of actors and cameras \u0096 for example, you often have everyone looking in opposite directions as if unable to face each other. The middle section has some good tension to it, but is a little too technical and formulaic. The final act looks great, but that is its very problem. There is so much going on \u0096 particularly in the sleazy nightclub \u0096 that you end up caught up focusing on all the background details rather than the actual plot. It's great as a kind of realist expose, but doesn't sit well in a thriller.The biggest trouble with the structure of High and Low is that we never really get to grips with any of the characters. There is no consistent hero or anti-hero, no single individual whose eyes we see the story through. The businessman played by Mifune is the closest thing we have to a protagonist, but he is all but dropped from the storyline after the first hour. There is not much depth to the detective characters. The kidnapper is a complex character but the focus on him is constantly shifting.While certain aspects of the picture seem really well thought out, others simply appear to be nothing more than Kurosawa going through familiar motions. Like his previous noir-ish thriller Stray Dog (1949) High and Low takes place during a heat wave, but this is not so fully emphasised as in the earlier picture and so has little real effect. Kurosawa returns to his theme of blurring social status (the chauffeur's boy being mistaken for Gondo's son despite their differing \"values\" reminds me of the disguised princess in Hidden Fortress or Mifune's wannabe-Samurai in Seven Samurai), but any emotional depth is stifled under the picture's tone of selfishness and sleaze.High and Low's score seems deliberately weird and minimalist, and perhaps just a bit too simplistic. There is great sound design though, particularly the eerie distant noises of the city as heard from Gondo's house. This is one of High and Low's best features, and its interesting to note the picture was made around the same time as Hitchcock's The Birds, which experimentally uses a sound design of bird noises in place of a musical score.Like some of Hitchcock's thrillers, High and Low is gripping when watched for the first time, but loses its appeal on repeated viewings. Kurosawa was to follow it up with Red Beard, which is heavy-handedly optimistic and humanist, perhaps to make up for the cynicism of its predecessors. Red Beard and High and Low are my two least favourite Kurosawa pictures and for me this was a real low point in his career, where his message making got in the way of his ability to tell a good story.",

Before he can do this he gets word that his son has been kidnapped and he has no problem exchanging his money for the life of his son. However, things change when it turns out the kidnappers actually took his chauffeur's son instead. This is another incredibly impressive film for director Akira Kurosawa who certainly knows how to tell a story and get every bit of suspense out of it . The first two hours of this movie is a pure masterpiece, although for me it started to slag during the final twenty-minutes. The pay off to the film really didn't work for me and I'd also add that the whole Dope Alley sequence didn't work either. That still doesn't mean people shouldn't check out this film because the first two hours among some of the most suspenseful moments I've seen from any thriller. The way Kurosawa constructs the action and dialogue sequence is masterfully done and this includes the opening sequence where the father is playing the businessman and laying down certain morals on how a company should make its products. It's even more interested seeing how his morals come into play when he thinks it's his son who has been kidnapped and how those morals change when he finds out it's someone else's. Even more interesting in this first hour are how the police are more interested in the father who has the money instead of the father who's son is actually missing. I think there's a strong message of greed and its evils but also the differences between how the rich and poor can go about such tense situations. The second hour, dealing with the police looking for the kidnapper, is just as interesting, although not as suspenseful. I thought the structure of how the police would do their job was even more interesting because of one of the first sequences where we see all the detectives gathered in a room and talking about the evidence they have gathered in their small parts of the case. Kurosawa's direction is masterful throughout but the performances also deserve a lot of credit. I become more and more obsessed with Mifune each and every time I see him and there's no doubt he's one of the greatest actors to have every appeared in a movie. The way he shows the anger, grief and confusion of his situation is just a marvel to watch and he kept pushing it further and further as the situation continued to grow. Tatsuya Nakadai, Jyoke Kagawa, Tatsuya Mihashi and the rest of the supporting cast are very impressive as well. There's one scene where the detectives turn their backs on Mifune, which had me wondering if it was a homage to 12 ANGRY MEN. Either way, this is an incredibly well made movie that certainly ranks as one of the greatest thrillers out there even with the weak final sequence.",

This leaves him with a moral dilemma, as he really needs the money to conclude a very important business deal.Written and directed by Akira Kurosawa, High and Low is superb.

Incredibly engaging as you follow the police chase down their leads.That alone would have made this a 10/10, but the greatness of this movie doesn't end there. We have the moral dilemma the businessman must face: whether to pay to have his chauffeur's son released or use the money to conclude the business deal of a lifetime (with the added incentive that, if the deal doesn't go ahead, his career is over).

Maybe I miss something.Anyway, High and Low is the first Akira Kurosawa film I've watched. Kurosawa is probably one of the most critically acclaimed japanese directors of all time, and this is one of his most highly regarded films.It tells the story of Gondo, a wealthy executive that tries to take over the shoe company in which he's an executive, National Shoes. He mortgaged everything in order to be able to by enough shares to vote his rivals out, but the night before the deal is closed - his chauffeur's son get kidnapped. The kidnapper calls and demands a ransom of 30 million yen (which, if paid, can cost Gondo his deal and make him lose his job) , or else - the kid dies. The first half of this film is about the dillema and its consequences, and the second half follows the police in their search for the kidnapper.I do like some things about this film. The cinematography is quite decent, and it gives everything weight during the first half and urgency during the final act. I like some subtle ideas that were communicated to the viewer throughout the film (\"all we got is time\", and later the watch in the living room - if you got it you got it), and the kidnapper has interesting personality and motives. The score isn't bad either, and I do like almost everything about the final act. The cinematography there is definitely in its peak for this film, and the story kept me interested throughout it all. The final scene is really great and thought-provoking too. The score is pretty abstract, but it feels very on-point as well.BUT. I just didn't feel it throughout the whole film. I didn't have this spark, this click with the film. Especially during the search for the kidnapper, I feel like this movie can be quite exhausting. Not bad, just a bit slow. It's like those mind-battles in Death Note - it wasn't SUPER boring, but yet, at times, it was exhausting to watch.So, yeah, maybe it doesn't feel that based, but these are my thoughts and feelings, and I did watch the film twice before writing the review, just in case I've missed something, and I do thing that I understand it and its moral take pretty well, but yet, the pacing around the middle of this film brings it down a little for me.

            "content": "As the title suggests, High and Low deals a lot with class structure and it's finite importance.  This film seems to say that there are times when financial success must be set aside for the compassionate preservation of endangered human life. Kingo Gondo is a high powered executive in a prestigious Japanese shoe company, and he is approached by a group of other executives who have a plan to produce different shoes that would bring in more profits. Gondo refuses, because the proposed shoes are cheaply made and fall apart easily. He kicks them out of his house and, very soon after, he gets a call saying that his son has been kidnapped for ransom. It turns out that the kidnappers accidentally kidnapped his chauffeur's son, yet they still demand the ransom.(spoilers) Gondo has borrowed money on everything he owns (including his beautiful house), so that he can buy enough stock to own National Shoes, the company for which he works. He has compiled 50 million yen, and the kidnapper is demanding 30 million yen, an amount that will ruin Gondo's chance to own National Shoes, and will also cost him virtually everything that he owns. At first he refused to pay because it would ruin him and his family, but realizing that he would be hated by the whole country for not paying, he arranges to pay the ransom, and Shinichi, the boy who was kidnapped, is returned. Shinichi's retrieval is followed by an elaborate investigation into the kidnapping case, and the kidnapper is eventually captured and given the death sentence because, in addition to the kidnapping, he also killed three people, two of whom were accomplices in the kidnapping itself.There is also some excellent characterization in high and Low, as is usually the case with Kurosawa's work. Kenjiro Ishiyama, the stocky, bald-headed detective, for example, isa very developed character. When we first see him, he is at Gondo's house, participating in the investigation. It almost seems that he is just a character to fill a place as an investigator, but we later learn a lot more about him. First of all, in a later scene where he is in a car with another investigator, he mentions that Gondo is a nice enough guy, even though he didn't like him when they first met. He said that he can't stand these rich people who feel like they are better than other people, but in this scene it he suggests that he has changed his mind about that. We are able to learn a bit more about him as an individual this way, but it is the scene in which Shinichi is recovered that we really see a new side of him. After the briefcases with the money are thrown out of the train, Shinichi is left by the tracks and the kidnappers take the money and flee. When Gondo and the investigators arrive to retrieve Shinichi, it is Ishiyama who, although briefly, breaks into tears upon his safe recovery. This adds a whole new level to his character that was not seen before.Kurosawa's films are also quite often peppered with examples of irony that are significant to the meaning of the film, and High and Low is clearly no exception. 1.)\tGondo fears that if he pays the ransom, he will be ruined financially and professionally, yet when he does pay it, he becomes a national hero and soon has control over a different (although smaller) shoe company which is sure to succeed because of his skyrocketing popularity. \n2.)If Gondo pays the ransom, he will lose all power in National Shoes, yet when actually preparing to pay, it is his shoemaking skills that come in handy to insert a tracking device in the cases which are to carry the money.\n3.) As mentioned above, the tough, bald-headed detective, who didn't even like Gondo at first, is the one to break into tears when Shinichi is safely retrieved. Kurosawa employs a very subtle filmmaking technique in High and Low, but it was very different from his technique in Kagemusha and Ran. Here, there were many more cuts and there was a lot more motion with the camera, but this was all done in a realistic way, he did not use the camera to alter reality to any real extent. For example, there are numerous panning shots that take place in Gondo's home, but these are mainly just to follow characters as they move about. Another good example is the camerawork that is taken on the train. As they are looking out the window, there are very shaky point of view shots that are very realistic because the investigators are trying to photograph the kidnappers from the train, and this shakiness is what it would look like in real life. Unlike Ran and Kagemusha, High and Low has a very romantic ending. As a matter of fact, most of the film is pretty highly romanticized. Three kidnappers kidnap Shinichi, they get the ransom, Gondo is glorified for his tremendous act of humanity, one kidnapper kills the other two to keep the money himself, Shinichi is returned safely, the kidnapper is eventually caught and sufficiently punished, and Gondo even gets back the vast majority of the ransom money. In the end, the kidnapper gets the death sentence, Gondo gets his money back, and Shinichi is returned safely to his father. This ending is not entirely realistic, but it is a feel good ending that is put on the movie in order to emphasize the various important messages that were communicated throughout the film. Indeed, this seems to be the only way that Kurosawa, as the director, intruded into the story to make his point, which is a characteristic of his subtle genius.",

The single-set scenery is both atmospheric and epic, and the cinematography is as ever exceptional. While Kurasawa's direction is one of his more subtle overall directorial jobs, it never undermines the riveting and tense feel of the always compelling story. The score is suitably haunting, and Toshiro Mifune's lead performance is very brooding.All in all, a superb film and one of Kurasawa's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I hope no one is put off by the fact that this was directed by Akira Kurosawa and has Japanese subtitles. Kurosawa, true, directed some atmospheric stuff. Who can forget the ghost scene in \"Throne of Blood\"? But for all that, his films always packed a commercial wallop.This one will keep you in your seat with your eyes open. It's anything but artsy. What with the overwrought style of acting -- the pacing, the gritting of teeth, the outraged shouting, the sly sneaking about on crowded streets -- this particular atmosphere practically crackles with tension.The opening third introduces us to Toshiro Mifune, the self-made millionaire, who has secretly borrowed all the money he can to buy a controlling interest in National Shoes so that he can make quality products. Naturally the Board of Directors want to make junk shoes and turn a profit -- period. Mifune is not an especially generous or likable guy. He's honest and fair but gruff with his family and employees.Then -- chaos. Some kidnappers have taken his six-year-old son and are demanding 30M yen, which is to say everything that Mifune owns or has borrowed. So far the usual kidnap-for-ransom formula is followed: put the money in unmarked bills in two satchels, don't contact the police, wait for further instructions, and so forth. Mifune immediately agrees but, as is also part of the formula, he contacts the police who sneak into his house and record the calls he gets from the evildoers. We've seen this before, of course, will Glenn Ford or Mel Gibson doing the honors.Then it turns more interesting. By mistake, the kidnappers have taken, not Mifune's son, but that of his devoted chauffeur, who's been a lifelong playmate of Mifune's own boy. A call from the kidnappers confirms the accident but still demands the money.Now what? Should Mifune go broke and reduce him and his family to a state of poverty? In order to save the life of a boy who isn't his own? Interesting dilemma. It's easy for the viewer to say, yes, pay the two dollars. But suppose we were in Mifune's shoes? Wouldn't we be in a state of trichotillomania, caught between Kant's hypothetical imperatives (what's in it for me?) and his categorical imperatives (what's the right thing to do?)? Someone brought that word, trichotillomania, to my attention and I just threw it in for the hell of it. It means a compulsion to pull one's hair out. I'd have had to wait two or three more lifetimes for such an opportunity.Okay. I don't suppose it's necessary to spell out what Mifune decides. He gulps and eats it.That's the first third of the movie, and it's not uninteresting. But then the pace picks up immediately. The miscreants are really clever and manage to outwit the police during the exchange of money and child. But the cops are no dopes either, and we get a rather longish story of their tracking the criminal. It reminded me less of the kind of detective work we see in the kinds of movies sometimes called \"noirs,\" with Humphrey Bogart or Clint Eastwood on the trail, than it did of \"Day of the Jackal,\" made with a European cast and crew. And maybe Fritz Lang's \"M\".Nice scenes aboard one of the famous Bullet Trains. The tempo drops a bit when the now-busted Mifune drops from sight and the police begin trailing the chief suspect. There's a lot of slinking around in sleazy juke joints and junkie alleys and at times I was a little lost about just what was going on. I had to wait for the police report to bring me up to date.The ending, although dramatic enough, was something of a let-down too. I was waiting for the malefactor to turn out to be Mifune's estranged younger brother or something. It had been pointed out more than once that the motive was not just pecuniary but a personal desire to torment Mifune. Instead, though, it was resolved as a matter of complex status envy, with a stranger on the other end.I suppose, though, that that's what the title is meant to reflect -- the difference between the enormously wealthy and the druggies and burn-outs on the louche streets. The symbolism, if that's what it is, is realized concretely in the distinction between Mifune's mansion high on a hill and the shabby apartment of the kidnapper below, stifling in the heat and industrial smog.Kurosawa admitted that he didn't provide many answers in his movies but that the same question seemed to run through his work: Why can't people be happy? He was in a good position to ask, since he evidently suffered from a major mood disorder.",

            "review_title": "Masterful first hour, but then the film gets thrown out the window...",
            "content": "**SPOILERS**As I began watching this movie, I was glued to it from the very start. The situation which was set up was a masterful one: a man kidnaps a child whom he believes to be the son of a rich businessman, but who actually turns out to be the son of the businessman's servant. The kidnapper still insists on getting the money from the businessman. The ransom equals much, much more than the businessman can afford. So what are his choices? He can either pay the ransom and become poor, or he could indirectly kill a young child and be forever blameworthy in the eyes of the public, his associates, his son, his wife, and, most importantly, in his own eyes. This businessman, Gondo, played masterfully by Toshiro Mifune, undisputedly one of the best film actors of all time, struggles with his decision, and I struggled with him. And every second of the film for the first hour or so is extremely intense until...SPOILERS!!!the kidnappers return the child after they get the money. After this, there are only a few great Kurosawa touches at the edges of a very conventional detective vs criminal film. There is nothing at all new in this part of the plot, which lasts for at least 60% of the film's running time. In fact, the detective work is so poorly conceived and written. Half the time they're skipping over the most obvious leads, and the other half of the time they're following leads that would have in reality been impossible to figure out. One of my very favorite television shows is Hawaii Five-0, and there were several kidnapping episodes in that series. This detective story, filmed by one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, does not even touch the most lame-brained Five-0 episode ever produced.And it is an utter shame that Kurosawa, one of the world's greatest directors, wasted his time on this trite and moronic plotline. His films show us again and again philosophical problems of the greatest degree. For goodness' sake, take a look at Rashomon! Has there been a more deeply philosophical film made? And _High and Low_ has this sort of depth of philosophy in it, too. It is just relegated to right field where it hardly ever comes into play. The title of the film itself refers to the difference between the wealthy and the poor. The kidnapper is poor, and he loathes the rich man, Gondo, so he attempts to switch places with him on the social ladder. And there is a very powerful final scene where the kidnapper demands to meet with Gondo before he is put to death. Here the kidnapper confronts Gondo and tells him why he did it. It is a great moment, but it is difficult to feel anything for his situation. He hardly appears in the film until half-way through, and he only appears for any long period of time in the last half an hour of the film. He should have permeated the entire film, and the detectives should have been given more of a back seat. Perhaps the kidnapper should have been even with Gondo. But even Gondo misses out on half the film!NO MORE SPOILERS!!!I would still tell any fan of the director's to see this film, but it is truly a disappointment for someone of such great talents. Rashomon! The Seven Samurai! Yojimbo! Ran! Kagemusha! Yume! High and Low does not belong on this list. 7/10.",

            "content": "Eternally to be one of the very best police films or procedurals of any kind ever to be seen, High and Low attains its title's suggestion of social tangents by bouncing on restless, loud rock n' roll, unremittingly scooping waste on Schubert's Trout quintet, and deepening the highest point of its murder investigation with the counterpoint of the mechanical, repetitive style and beat of early swing music on a radio performance of It's Now or Never.When all is said and done, this stroke of enthrallingly gritty vision, Kurosawa's 23 film, has several climaxes, as it is a thriller richly encompassed by feather-ruffling tautness and bolting releases. It is the result of film noir put in the hands of a master who is only reaching to the bottom of the pile.A man seemingly street smart by the grace of parables of Greek mythology, unanchored in a drug-soaked urban decay steered by its night spots, the perpetually sunglassed villain has nurtured a perverse preoccupation. He lusts to echo the scalded anarchy of Japan's nethermost fundaments back into the face of the most flourishing man he can strike. His object overhead: an autodidactic footwear tycoon, Gondo, the immutable thorn in the undersides of the National Shoes company.As indented by Toshiro Mifune in a performance that, to an American audience translates into shameless eating of the scenery but from a distance is deeply felt, Gondo may live in the inscrutable, time-honored house on the hill, a thoroughly reduced mansion that appears, from inside and out, to look egotistically down on the consummate city beneath it, but he prevails as a man embedded in an inglorious, hands-on history. \"Shoes carry the weight of the whole body,\" Gondo belows early on, criticizing the tacky pumps his profits-over-quality corporate partners aim to market. A prosperous official with one foot in the past, Gondo by this time thinks he's one step ahead: He's engineered a way to overtake the company takeover his partners are about to try.What Gondo doesn't expect is a plot to kidnap his son and command a devastating ransom. The plan creeps into effect, but when the frame hits a small hitch, our villain's henchmen accidentally seizing Gondo's chauffeur's son instead, he still orders the ransom, turning an ethical catch-22 in motion. Should Gondo pay the ransom and save a child that isn't his, at the cost of losing his company and heavily-mortgaged home? Or forgo the chauffeur's child and salvage his status, high on that hill, while his benumbed spiritual self falls hard and fast into the mirror-world underneath it?In High and Low's screw-tightening first hour, Gondo, a crew of dedicated cops and Kurosawa's anamorphic lens, stay fastened in the mansion's living room, handling the kidnapper's phoned-in orders. It's a breathtaking chapter, built on a deafeningly silent soundtrack and laborious variations of group and individual compositions, mixing two-shots and seven-shots into glacial fractions and numerically exhausted collective portraiture. But once it branches into its procedural second act, the film's real crops unfurl. Compositions of groups of men in motion interchange with comprehensively particularized sequences of evidence examination. And Gondo's allegorical castle in the sky, once seen from the villain's angle, begins to adopt expressionistic dimensions. Evidence escalates, characters and trajectories adjust, and ultimately an startling defilement of crimson-pink smoke flags a chance into the abyss, receiving us as Kurosawa's camera descends into act three.Feast your eyes, finally, on the Low: a degraded vice exchange filled with bickering sailors and cat-eyed whores, obliterated heroin freaks and undercover cops. In this devolved slum, talk is futile and disorder reigns sovereign, and in all of Kurosawa's film-making, there is nothing else quite so bawdy or deranged. The vindications are here, if pounded in a climax, as becomes the film's abrupt about-faces of circumstance and dignified downfalls, cloaked in clear display somewhere soundly before the end.",

            "content": "This film has quickly become one of my favorites of Akira Kurosawa's filmography, the realistic and slow approach to solving the kidnapping case, and the authentic police work. There's so many things Kurosawa does right in this film, pure brilliance. High and Low is about an executive of a Yokohama shoe company who becomes a victim of extortion when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped by mistake and held for ransom. But it's so much more than that, because of the themes Kurosawa used in the film, High and Low dissects its characters through a diptych construction, involving its audience in a wealth of human drama to contemplate Kurosawa's most prevalent, lingering questions about humanity and the factors that prevent us from relating to one another.Although the first-half's tight, enclosed structure demonstrated Kurosawa's visual ingenuity with elegant close-quarters blocking, the second half finds his production shooting in cramped police conference rooms and on location in shady nightclubs and slums. The director's handheld cameras take to crowded city streets teeming with everyday citizens, yakuza gang members, drug dealers, and prostitutes. I have to admit, many things surprised me with this movie, the cinematography and editing being one of them. The whole production of High and Low is impressive and quite remarkable, making it one of Akira Kurosawa's best films. I stand by that.Kurosawa included cameos by many of his popular stock performers, making its star-studded cast one of the film's best-remembered highlights. But the main cast has names like Toshiro Mifune and Tatsuya Nakadai giving one of their best performances. But also Kyoko Kagawa, Tatsuya Mihashi, Kenjiro Ishiyama, Isao Kimura and Tsutomu Yamazaki. Whilst Kenjiro Ishiyama isn't anything mind blowing, his performance is a joy to watch and his character is thus memorable. But Toshiro Mifune and Tatsuya Nakadai are alone a reason to watch this brilliant crime film.Rewatching this film is something I thought of doing in a couple of years time but it only took a few months because of a friend wanting to watch it. It holds up quite well on repeating watchings, the direction and writing still holds up. It's\nIn Japan, High and Low was widely praised as a masterpiece and earned around $1.3 million to become the highest-grossing film of 1963. Almost 60 years later, I can say that it remains a masterpiece. It's extremely slow paced and I think it wouldn't be made in the same way today. Though the slow pacing, High and Low is suspenseful from start to finish, the suspension and tension keeps you on the edge of your seat. Akira Kurosawa's brilliant filmmaking and writing, King's Ransom was the right book to adapt, it very much feels like it was made for him to adapt.",

            "content": "In Akira Kurosawa's HIGH AND LOW, a drawn-out, monochromatic (save one key scene with the lurid smoke) contemporary crime drama clocks in at 2 hours and 23 minutes, the story can be roughly divided into two parts, in the first half, Kurosawa forcibly broaches an existentialist moral conundrum to Kingo Gondo (Mifune, not unexpectedly brings forth the urgency and telling ambivalence to the fore), an executive of a major shoe company called National Shoes, just when he is ready to implement his clandestine leveraged buyout plan to gain control of the company against his rebarbative and avaricious fellow members of the board, who manifestly advocate manufacturing shoddy shoes in order to lower the cost and bring more financial gain, he receives an extortion call which claims that his son is being kidnapped, and he must pay a colossus amount of money in cash, which basically is all his saving including the mortgaged capitals for the buyout. But subsequently, it transpires that the kidnapper has mistakenly kidnapped the son of his chauffeur Aoki (Sada), instead of his son, so he immediately seeks the assistance of the police force, lead by detective Tokura (Nakadai, charismatic, naturalistic and occasionally amusing), and believes that the abductor will release the kid after realizing his mistake. Nevertheless, the abductor perversely insists that the extortion is still on, and hangs Kingo out to dry: will he be willing to pay the ransom to save a kid whom he is not related? Especially, when the outcome will strip him of his position in the company, all the savings and put the family in heavy debt. Kurosawa beautifully orchestrates a nexus of theatrical tableaux vivants inside his hill-top residence perfectly in line with film's wide-screen capacity, to accentuate Kingo's testing oscillation: Aoki pleads abjectly to save his son, Kingo's wife Reiko (Kagawa) also takes Aoki's side, urges him to pay the ransom since she thinks they are completely responsible for the kidnap, but Kingo obdurately refuses to compromise, until the next morning, a sudden epiphany precipitates him to make the right decision and then the story swerves briskly into the action of delivering the ransom, neatly fashioned with an ingenious wheeze on a moving train to make the transaction. After that point, the film slowly shifts its focus from the Gondos to a forensic exposition of police procedural to track down the perpetrators, led by Tokura and his subordinates: detective Arai (Kimura) and Bos'n' (Ishiyama). The devil is always in the details, and it needs strenuous collective endeavor to spot it, Kurosawa doesn't flinch from laying out all the circumstantial steps of the investigation in front of audience, interlaced with extensive cutaways to explicate the process, it is amazingly engrossing because you are also in tandem investing yourself into combing through minute information and threads, without any narrative elision to spoil the fun, a feat rarely maneuvered with such scope of realism in films, neither before nor after. Before long, two dead accomplices are discovered and the film decisively discards its whodunit myth, then unexpectedly weaves a shrewd scheme into the plot, to inveigle the culprit to aggravate his wrongdoings (a trenchant point that extortion is under-punished in Japan's penal system), also entering the picture is the leverage of public opinion and collaboration with media, the latter flouts its wonted negative standing and for once, functions as an entity with conscience and flexibility.Finally, en route to the belated arrest, HIGH AND LOW takes a detour firstly into a nightclub mixed with foreigners and locals, then to the startling home-turf of drug addicts (peppered with strangely wry sketches of plainclothes trying to mingle with the zombie-alike, against a very impressionist setting), where it touches the lowest ground as an astute social commentary shedding lights on both polarities, \"Heaven and Hell\", the literal translation of its Japanese title.The film ends with a heightened juxtaposition of Kingo and the perturbed kidnapper in the prison, a mirrored vis-\u00e0-vis communication between the high and the low, then the film divulges the motive behind the crime: hatred springing from the disproportionate gap between rich and poor, but Kurosawa is too savvy to flog the dead horse, so in his usual flourish, he leaves the revelation at once surprising and rationalized, well done, again, maestro!",

Rewarding? Beyond that. It's about seeing a peerless master at work, seeing perfection with one's own eyes.And how shocking, radical, effortless, entertaining is this film! We spend the first 40 minutes inside Gondo's house, basically in a few rooms, and Kurosawa dances around the characters who fill the space. Some move, some stay quiet and still, sometimes the camera moves around them. Forget about the petty 180-degree rule and instead embrace how we are led to examine space from every possible angle.It would fit any postmodern work with ease, but Kurosawa goes further. He makes radical things seem so simple and effective that he utilizes them in subtly in films that exude tension and entertainment. The counterpoint between the first 40 minutes and the short scene on the train, bursting with energy, is breathtaking. Really breathtaking, and in its immediacy amongst the most fervent filmmaking I know of. Then we are presented with a puzzle in the long and wonderful scene at the police station where the police force recount all the clues so far, one by one. Then, slowly, the puzzle becomes complete, and we are offered more wondrous filmmaking scene after scene. The wordless paroxysm of movement in the nightclub, the visit to the \"drug alley\", the reflections of the nighttime city lights on the surface of the car. The final confrontation in the very end. I don't think I'll ever get over this film, the silent, patient mastery Kurosawa exhibits in every single frame.This is high art, something that film at its best can be. At its best, film becomes a kind of a meditative, silent corner to which one may retreat, and to which I return time and again for strengthening.

            "content": "Perhaps I had been too well-prepared for this movie, but it was a big disappointment when I finally got a chance to view it on DVD.Let me address several aspects of the film individually (***WARNING! Spoilers Ahead!!***):PLOT: Frankly, there is very little plot.  And what plot there is has very little suspense. In a nutshell, a businessman is engaged in a tricky financial transaction involving the purchase of some stock.  By coincidence, a kidnapper targets his son, but mistakenly kidnaps the businessman's chauffeur's son instead.  The businessman decides to use the money he had intended for the stock purchase to ransom the chauffeur's son and the boy is recovered unharmed.  The rest of the movie explores how the kidnapper is identified and tracked by the police.  When the kidnapper is captured (after a very lengthy surveillance), the majority of the money is returned to the businessman, but not until it is too late to do him any good and the deal falls through.  However, the businessman procures another position and seems to be doing just fine at the end of the movie.MORALITY:  Much has been made of the decisions the businessman makes and the burdens he has to bear.  I don't get it, though.  People lose out in business all the time.  In fact, the businessman doesn't really seem that much worse off than he was at the beginning of the film.  In fact, he almost seems happy that he will now have his own business that he can grow and make shoes the way HE wants to make them. Except for a few peripheral dead people (Kurosawa does not apparently have a lot of concern for drug addicts, either) the movie has a basically happy ending.HONOR:  Sorry, don't get this.  Yes, the businessman acts out of honor and a sense of decency.  Wouldn't you?  It's not as if he suffers very much for it when all is said and done.  And the other businessmen DO act like sharks. That's what a lot of businessmen do.  These guys are no different than the vast majority of businessmen around the world.  I should be surprised or dismayed by their attitudes and actions?SUSPENSE:  None...zero...nada.  You just don't care.  The police, for example, take over an hour of screen time to follow the suspected kidnapper. While it's true that the kidnapper is able to commit a murder while under surveillance, he never even seems to suspect that he might be under surveillance.  He doesn't try to re-establish contact with the businessman. He doesn't try to kidnap anyone else.  Heck, he doesn't even seem that concerned about what might happen to him.  And as for the businessman...well, he seems pretty serene about the whole thing.  In fact, the film seems to want to lead you to believe that the businessman's competitors might be behind the kidnapping, but then it quickly shows you that they are not.  I was more inclined to suspect that the businessman might have some strange motive for engineering the kidnapping, but that's not the case, either.  The police?  Well, they find the suspect fairly quickly and then just follow him all over town.  COMPOSITION/CINEMATOGRAPHY: OK, Kurosawa gets a few points here, but the staging is very obtrusive and almost yells at you, \"Hey!  Look where I've put the characters!  They're in a symbolic physical relationship.\"SYMBOLISM: Let me break this gently...lawns still have to be mowed and some men like the time that it provides them to be in solitude.(***End of spoilers!***)This is NOT Ed McBain meets Kurosawa. This is Joe Friday meets William Wyler.Not recommended.  Wish I could, based on Kurosawa's other fine works, but this movie is apparently too subtle for my jaded tastes.",

            "content": "\"... and so, they covet a lifestyle that is unattainable in their current state...\"\n-- John AlexanderThis is a film of great insight that gives us one of Toshiro Mifune's finest performances as Kingo Gondo. He is planning to move up in the corporate world, and has put all his chips on a calculated power play that should put him at the head of the conference table. However, fate takes a hand and deals him a card that threatens to flush the future for him and his family down the toilet. Soon, in a sedate living room, we find Kingo Gondo dealing with the dynamics of a dilemma with his wife and colleagues in a very personal way. Nothing less than the gain of the whole world at the loss of his soul suddenly becomes his meditation.We start at the top with this film, loosely based as it is on the 1959 novel KING'S RANSOM by Ed McBain, and as Orson Welles might quip, work our way down into the seedy underbelly of Yokohama and it's nightlife. Descending from Gondo's hilltop mansion and his struggles of conscience with his wife Reiko, as played by Kyoko Kagawa, we shuttle quickly through a tale of two sons and mistaken identity, while the pace is cunningly accelerated to a rendezvous with kidnappers on a bullet train that leads both to ruination and redemption for Kingo Gondo. The lead character walks an ethical tightrope with great anguish only to arrive unexpectedly at a destination of moral victory against all odds. It is at this moment when Gondo, with some reservation and reluctance, puts the welfare of others before personal interest and ambition, that the narrative shifts gears as the wheels of justice grind into a hair-raising police procedural. At this point, the chase is on for an unknown criminal and his cohorts.Now we are treated to a squad of detectives and criminologists ferreting out leads and clues with the closest attention to technical minutiae and the finer points of crime detection. This shift in focus and emphasis from the committing of the crime to its suspenseful, reticulated resolution and the capture and punishment of the mastermind involved demonstrates and reveals as well Kurosawa at the peak of his powers and a master of the craft of complication. We somehow are fast forwarded out of a tale where the weighing of moral values is the tantamount concern, into an evolving, nail biting thriller where around every corner we find a new piece of evidence that takes us ever deeper into the mental machinations of the prime perpetrator himself. This is still a story driven by character, but now it is determined more by the skillful, professional actions of the police detectives than by the emotions of the victims themselves. Kenjiro Ishiyama as Chief Detective 'Bos'n Tagushi and Detective Nakao as played by Takeshi Kato are among the many fine actors who create this breakneck sense of rapid fire detection. I watched with an ever heightening sense of anticipation as the hunters traced out every diabolical strand to their prey.I particularly loved it when the trail leads through a sleazy nightclub nearing the capture of the perpetrator. Here the low lit space is pulsing with the rising energy of frenzy in a party atmosphere, and the pace is accelerating even more to its ultimate resolution. This sense of catharsis or discharge of tension into festive free energy was exhilarating to experience. It spoke of masterful dramatic development where every minor point was properly considered and developed. The whole system of the story was throbbing with the full release of its potential as a cinema classic.When Gondo finally confronts Tsutomu Yamazaki as Ginjir\u00f4 Takeuchi, the Chief Mastermind of crimes against him and even his accomplices, it is a chilling moment. At first Ginjiro feigns a stoicism he does not possess. He speaks with longing envy about the house high above on the hilltop he would see on hot summer nights while he sweated in the sweltering heat down below. Now with nothing but death ahead awaiting him, we watch his reserve slowly crumble as his emotions overwhelm him in the same way that his covetousness for a state beyond his own drove him to seek personal gain beyond the limits of his own moral compass. Here Kurosawa takes us beyond the desire for retribution to a place where we truly feel a fellow human being's suffering as part of our own, and this in the end is the greatness of High and Low.",

            "content": "There are many reasons why I don't fancy japanese movies and the most famous person in its cinema industry, Mr Akira Kurosawa, but there are way more reasons not to pay any attention to that fact. I've heard lots of favorable reviews and pleasant words about Kurosawa since I just started getting into the world of movies over 20 years ago and it took me almost as much to watch the first one of his works - \"Seven samurai\" (1954) which I found pretty boring at times, considering its length of over 3 hours, but very entertaining nonetheless. After that I knew where most of the Hollywood directors took the inspiration for their big budget ensemble cast blockbuster movies throughout the years - it was Kurosawa they were trying to copy and pay homage to. After a streak of less impressive movies of his I've discovered \"The hidden fortress\" (1958) which saw the director take a somewhat different approach and the comedy direction he had chosen I liked in an instant but once again it was overly long - the fact that didn't allow me to enjoy the movie at its fullest.With this masterpiece I am concluding my acquaintance with Akira Kurosawa's pictures and who would have thought this would turn out to be his best in my opinion. \"High and low\" (which in a more literal translation means \"heaven and hell\") is yet again long, 2 hours and 23 minutes but it doesn't seem to be long one bit this time. Why? Because everything falls into place and step by step leads the narrative to the ending very smoothly.I was relieved to see Kurosawa finally move forward, further from samurai movies he was notoriously known for before and it surely played its hand this time. The story revolves around a self-made man and the choice he had to make to either give up everything he's got or save a little boy's life - and it was only half of the movie; the other half is a well thought out detective story that considers every aspect of the crime committed and observes every little detail in search of the criminal.This movie is not only the best example of a police procedural but of a drama also and it should be remembered as such for many generations to come.",

            "content": "Great film, and one of the most interesting crime dramas I've seen. Part of the reason for that is Kurosawa's brilliant craftsmanship, and part of it is in how different the various segments of this movie are from one another, despite them all fitting together so well. The opening scenes feature a shoe executive (Toshiro Mifune) facing the ethical dilemma of making a ransom decision, since the stakes are so high for him. It's a sequence that is elongated, as some of the others that follow are, but this allows the angst to build, with the tension palpable in the body language of everyone around him, as they turn away, their gazes averted.The police investigation which follows is methodical as all leads are explored, and I don't know enough to say how much of this was new, but it does seem at least a little bit of it was influential to the genre. The camerawork and energy on the bullet train is fantastic. As straight as this film is played, there are a few wildcards in the deck, like the chauffer's father, who we sense will lead us somewhere dark while looking into things himself, but we're not sure what. Eventually we get to the chaos of a bar scene, with the crowd (including some Americans) doing the twist, a scene that is so wild visually that I could just eat it up. The scene in \"Dope Alley\", with the addicts milling listlessly and yet ominously around like zombies, and the villain (Tsutomu Yamazaki) wearing sunglasses which demonically reflect the light, is also very memorable. As strong as Mifune is in a restrained performance for him, Yamazaki is brilliant, especially in that final scene.The film is a crime drama but in a minor key, it has a nice little statement about the class divide, the \"high\" and \"low\" in society. The corporate executives are for the most part cutthroat backstabbers who would like to cut the quality of their product to have it wear out more quickly so that they can make more money. The rich who loan the main character money show absolutely no mercy in pressing him for it despite what he's going through. Meanwhile, people who live down in the poor area below around a swampy area that looks straight out of \"Drunken Angel,\" look up at his mansion practically gleaming up on the hill. The message is wonderfully subtle, and is about exercising a little humanity - making a great sacrifice even if it's someone else's son who is at risk, remembering one's humbler days even after one has \"made it,\" and spreading society's wealth more evenly across its populace so that the seeds of hatred are not sown. I love this little extra layer on top of everything else Kurosawa gives us. It's an intelligent, very satisfying film.",

Life, with its unpredictable exercise, gives us from time to time against the sword and the wall and we are in complex situations when making a decision. It is as if they entered our room, fully available, Charlize Theron and Scarlett Johansson, and you could see the dilemma of choosing one of the two to stay with you. Something like that, but with a profound moral crossroads, is what Mr Gondo passes, one of the National Shoe executives who, about to become the largest shareholder of the company, is pressured by the unusual fact that, by kidnapping his young son is kidnapped, wrongly, the his driver 's son... and now 30 million yen to return the boy. Motivated by the kidnapping victim was the son of a friend, Akira Kurosawa gained access to novel Makubein Edo (pseudonym of Evan Hunter) decided to tell, in more detail, the difficult crossroads and clash of strong feelings, which often occur after a insucess of this type. Weigh the morale and commitment to life, weighing the capital they got even with effort, in part, has been the result of a dowry; weigh the friendship and loyalty of an employee; weighs the position that you are about to acquire and pride that keep calling you; weigh the image you have, if you let a boy be murdered; weigh the situation impersonation \"casual\" that saved your child being the victim of kidnapping; weighs the noble sentiments of Reiko, the wife, who immediately choose life over any money in the world... A burden is placed upon the shoulders of a man who only want a better life with dignity serving customers of your company. But, teachers say: \"The greater the challenge, the more significant will be the triumph\". Many consciences are mobilized and then the police force takes charge of this case that moved to Japan and Kurosawa recreates the deep feeling and narrative vigor that already has plenty of demonstrations. The photograph, in this setting almost neorealist and packed full of shadows, makes clear the dark picture which develops this issue on a case of kidnapping for extortion.The music, again focused on the West, is already common feature in the dramas of Japanese director urbanites, quite attracted to this side of our planet, and insurance, hoping to connect your movies with that great power that has represented Hollywood... which will ultimately get. \"TENGOKU TO JIGOKU\" is a brilliant police exercise and is also a drama that, in any case, I think, leave us indifferent.

High and Low, in a way, was quite different from other Akira Kurosawa films i saw. Apparently, it may look a crime drama or Police procedural drama is the best word but somewhere the latest look given to entire narrative makes it different from other Kurosawa films. Mostly his films lied in period, ancient theories of pride and honour, history so High And Low being a completely modest film was a pleasant surprise for me. And may be that's why I found it thrilling and engaging even though the real thrill or suspense elements were not high. Some people called it a 'Hitchcock type Film' but i don't remember Hitchcock making something organically tensed like this (except for 'The Wrong Man'). Don't get me wrong but Hitchcock was almost done by 1960 with his popular thrillers and he was more concerned towards making dramatic and systematic thrillers with the use of Background music, plotting and accidental stuff whereas Kurosawa was more curved towards realistic tones of filmmaking. High and Low picks up quickly in the beginning and keeps the audience engage for next 2 hours until it loses the speed somewhere in the pre climax when ugly Drug Universe is shown. Except for that part, there are no loo breaks in the film. I literally had no complaints from the film untill the very predictable and trying to be honourable climax appeared. I sensed it 15 minutes ago and this is not done if i am finding the conclusion already. Rest be assured, the cast is Fantastic, screenplay is engaging and pacy, background score is decent, storyline drives smoothly and Direction is perfect. Legendary Kurosawa doesn't disappoint even with his Modern saga of moral but one or two things he definitely missed.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Gondo is about to complete a corporate takeover of a large company, having acquired all the funds by placing everything he owns on the line. That is all placed on standby as a kidnapper calls asking for a ransom for his kidnapped son. He immediately agrees - what is money compared to his own flesh and blood? But the kidnapper has kidnapped the wrong boy, not Gondo's, but the son of his lowly chauffeur, Aoki. Suddenly all eyes turn back to Gondo. A moral dilemma for the ages - is this boy worth the same ransom? In High and Low, Kurosawa tackles how capitalism has a tendency to transform citizens, to elevate some and shunt off others, to create a breeding ground where morality and integrity are often brushed aside for material gain.As the title dictates, Kurosawa takes us from High to Low. The first third of the film takes place in Gondo's luxury, high-rise apartment, where in one wide shot towers over the rest of the town like a heavenly paradise. Here where we witness Kurosawa's mastery of the frame, his breathtaking blocking and composition. He does not need to push in for a close-up - the master shot reveals every character's actions and reactions in relation to each other. When that fateful ring of the phone sounds, they all flock to its source. Later, as they consider the moral dilemma of Gondo, Kurosawa arranges each body around and behind him, staging their surrounding of the figure theatrically, their eyes staring, judging. When he angrily refuses to bow to the whims of the kidnapper, Mifune walks across the frame and out of the group, facing away and shielding himself from their judgement, taking an eternity to even meet the eyes of Aoki. Yutaka Sadaias is the lowly chauffeur, who talks less with dialogue but with his body language, the way his profile seems to be ever drooping in misery and fear, staring at his shoes like he is unworthy to participate in the discussion on his own son's life. In the silence he slowly approaches Gondo, who swiftly walks away from him (but their eyes do meet for a split second, unavoidable), and then the camera pans ever so slightly and literally pushes Aoki out of the frame as though he is irrelevant. Then we have the middle, where the police procedural element takes over. We have the thrill of the cash drop-off on a speeding train, those repeated flashes of the boy and his captor, straining but unable to be discerned. And we have the first inkling of change from Gondo - symbolically he sits himself onto the ground (which is where he began) and uses his old tricks of the trade to help the police prepare the cases. Without this little segment it would be too easy for the officers to despise him (remembering that they too are living in the shadow of Gondo's wealth) but they begin to admire and respect his dedication, and in a stroke of poetic justice, so too does the public. We have the long meeting of the police where each part of the ongoing investigation is recapped in very fine detail. This has been criticised as slow and expository, completely negating the building tension, but it actually holds a much more important task. Interspersed with these updates are flashbacks showing the various officers interacting with the common folk - Kurosawa uses this as a way of slowly exploring the roots of the community and what makes it tick on. And so Gondo too follows suit, slowly losing his corporate mask, descending into menial housework, and in one poignant scene, wandering the streets he used to belong to, and gazing through the window at a small display of shoes. His roots. And then in the low we have where the kidnapper Takeuchi operates, in the slums where beggars and drug addicts flock to, and the frenetic, sweaty nightclubs where it becomes so easy to lose a tailed suspect. The way Kurosawa has engineering the movement of that scene is nothing more than marvellous - Takeuchi slipping in and out of the deep focus layers of the crowd, only briefly visible by his dark spectacles and the one red carnation, and the POV of the police trying desperately to keep track of him. And then as he wades through the slums to purchase heroin, we have a frightening scene where he approaches one particular addict. It is filmed from behind a window opening so we are mere helpless spectators, and Kurosawa has somehow perfected the lighting setup so the reflective surfaces of his glasses catch the key light in a way that lights up his eyes in the darkness like he is a panther in the night, slowly stalking his way towards the addict. It is breathtakingly terrifying and the first real moment where we come to terms with him being able to kidnap and threaten an innocent child (perhaps a tiny flaw being the newspapers segments which slightly dull the power of his eventual appearance). What we have here is a moral masterpiece woven into a crime story. In the beginning Gondo is haughty and proud - his company means the world to him, and he would not even think of humouring the kidnapper to throw it all away. But as he is pressured into paying the ransom he begins his slow descent down from heaven to hell (hence the original title) and realises that all he wants to do is make shoes his way. Though they are worlds apart Takeuchi has also begun the film in the same way, but has not changed by the end - wallowing in his pride, wanting no pity, still bitter about the state of affairs that forces him to glance at Gondo's high-rise heaven each day. But he is the one to commit the moral transgression, and he is the one to be punished for it.",

But I knew the film \"High and Low\" already and therefore I was very curious to read the novel \"King's Ransom\" on which the movie is based. Though McBain is usually brilliant in his genre, Kurosawa outdid him with the film. Kurosawa saw the unused potential of the story and made decisive changes which turns the whole story into something very unique and spellbinding, while the book followed a more conventional path.At the beginning the film sticks rather close to the setup (except for the usual McBain sex hints and talk), even the trade, shoes, remains the same. But once the crime is introduced, he digresses in an essential way and opens the story to new and very deep insights. (I don't say more, so not to take the plot away for others who have not seen the film or read the book. And I don't need to check \"Spoiler Alert.\")In short, the book is good but the film is great!

It is almost underwhelming, but it is powerful.Akira Kurosawa teams up again with Toshir\u00f4 Mifune to make a film that has Japanese honor and American roots.Those that have seen Ransom know the basics of this film. Those familiar with Ed McBain and his 87th Precinct stories also know the basics as this was based on his work King's Ransom.This film is so good that Mike Nichols will be directing a remake using a David Mamet script that was originally commissioned by Martin Scorsese in 1999.The performance by Mifune of a high executive that worked his way up from the bottom and standing to lose everything is magnificent. He is ably assisted by great performances by Ky\u00f4ko Kagawa, who plays his wife and was in the superb film Shall we dansu?, a much better film than the American remake; and by Tatsuya Nakadai (Yojimbo, Sanjuro, The Sword of Doom) as the police detective after the kidnapper.The police work was as good as anything you would see on \"Law & Order.\" It was exciting and methodical and successful, as you would expect.This is a superb film and probably close to Kurosawa's best work.",

In only one part of the film, however, do we find that exciting and dynamic camera-work and editing which so distinguished his earlier film noir, STRAY DOG (1949, see my review), and that is in the action which takes place aboard a train. The early part of this kidnap drama is somewhat stagey because it is confined to the house of Toshiro Mifune, who plays a rich tycoon beset on all sides with scheming business competitors, and at a crucial point in his life when he has just put his house and everything he has in hock to borrow millions to buy a controlling share interest in his company, his son is suddenly kidnapped. Or so they think. In fact, it turns out that it is really his chauffeur's son who has been kidnapped because the two boys had been playing together and had switched clothes. The rest of the film largely concerns a depiction of the brilliant detection techniques used by the police to try to find the kidnapper and the boy, which is astonishing to watch. It is a real 'needle in a haystack' situation, and I don't know who is cleverer, the Japanese police or Kurosawa.",

            "content": "High and Low is one of the few widely acclaimed Akira Kurosawa films which don't tell stories about samurais. But even then, Kurosawa's mark is apparent in every frame of this tremendous movie. A hard working businessman named Gondo faces a huge morality test when a kidnapper kidnaps the son of his chauffeur. If he pays the huge ransom demanded, he will lose everything in his life which he has worked very hard to earn, on the other hand, if he refuses to pay the money, he will forever remain guilty in his own eyes and lose his humanity. The first half of this film primarily takes place in Gondo's top notch modern building which stands elevated from the rest of the city on top of a hill, making it visible to all the average city dwellers. The second half is more of a procedural account of the gritty and relentless police work in the heart of the city and in the dirty streets to catch the kidnapper. So the first half is the High, while the second half is the Low.The acting is good all across the board. Mifune and Nakadai deserve a special mention. Akira Kurosawa does not leave any stone unturned in making the police work in the 2nd half of the film seem as realistic as possible. We follow the police force in their attempt to bring down the criminal in a steady step by step process. The cinematography in a particular train sequence is absolutely masterful. The camera moves at the frantic pace of the train, but we see everything that we need to. The main theme of the film is the inequality that clearly exists between the haves and the have-nots in our society. The morality involved in making the humane choice and being selfless is also a critical aspect of High and Low.In a nutshell, this is a movie which on the surface is a procedural crime drama, but beneath its surface it is a commentary on the inequality in everyday society. An enthralling watch from start to finish.",

It can be enjoyed on several levels: as a classic police procedural, or for the complex moral issues involved in businessman Toshiro Mifune's decision whether or not to gamble a fortune by paying a kidnapper who mistakenly stole his chauffeur's young son instead of his own. The film begins slowly, confined to Mifune's luxury home perched high above the city, but opens up with (literally) the speed of a bullet train as the deadline for payment nears. The second half follows a long, methodical accumulation of evidence leading to a riveting manhunt, with police pursuing their quarry through the blighted warrens of Yokohama's underworld.

            "content": "\"This film brought awareness and somewhat changed laws when it came to child kidnapping in Japan, and is easily one of Kurosawa's finest outside of his period dramas\". If I could end this review with just that statement I would be very happy, for those who have seen the movie know exactly what I'm talking about.Based on the 1959 Novel \"King's Ransom\" by author Ed McBain (How amazing and American is that for a name), the first half all takes place in a living room. Shoe executive Kingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune), who was about to craftily claim a decent position within his line of business, must soon carefully consider his next possible choices to not give in to anonymous demands from a phone caller who has abducted a child as a means of leverage. The next half is a police procedural's nightmare lead by another fantastic actor and Kurosawa regular Tatsuya Nakadai, to find this elusive caller in hopes of discovering how and why these events started in the first place.The two things that will sell you immediately is Toshiro Mifune's incredible performance, the other is the pacing and dialogue which is crafted so well never has the nature of a situation been so apparent. The directions in which the narrative takes never falter as they progress, and the camera-work by Kurosawa is easily one of the sharpest of his Black and White movie era. Whilst this all leads to an \"anti-climactic\" situation of sorts, the simplicity of the surprises and revelations lead to one of those movies that leaves a deep impression of just how meaningless and out of hand such a situation becomes (The Western title \"High and Low\" refers to Gondo's house upon the hill overlooking the slums of a city, the movies exact title \"Tengoku to Jigoku\", literally means \"Heaven and Hell\").Final Verdict: Impeccably crafted, almost endlessly re-watchable and influenced countless crime drama we see on Television today. It certainly stood for something for its time, and presents a scenario where unfortunately none of our characters can seem to find any middle ground. 10/10.",

            "review_title": "Some specific comparisons of High and Low with McBain's King's Ransom",
            "content": "It's been mentioned several times that the film High and Low is based on the Ed McBain novel 'King's Ransom'. I've recently read the book, and watched the film again, so I thought I would write something about the specific differences and similarities between the two. In fact, they start out almost identically, but then veer quite widely apart.In both, we have the rich, self-made, hard-charging shoe company executive ('Douglas King' vs. 'Kingo Gondo') who, because of a conflict with other directors of his firm, engineers a behind-the-scenes financial coup in which he corners a majority interest in the company's shares. In order to do this, he has had to secretly borrow and mortgage himself to the hilt --- almost every penny he has is invested in this bold bid for power. At the moment of consummation, however, he receives a telephone call saying his son has been kidnapped, in response to which he immediately pledges the money he has just accumulated, knowing full-well it means personal ruin for him. In both stories, it turns out the kidnapper has snatched the wrong boy, taking the chauffeur's son instead. In both, King/Gondo's first reaction is relief, followed by a furious refusal to pay. And in both, it is his wife who functions as the voice of conscience, telling him that even though it is not his son, he still must pay.But from this point on we start to see quite marked differences.In King's Ransom, there is a trio of kidnappers, two men and a woman --- low-life semi-professional criminals who have teamed up and committed the crime solely for the money: they have no particular personal grudge against King. In High and Low, by contrast, the crime is committed by a pathological loner, a medical intern at a nearby hospital, who becomes obsessed with the class differences which keep him in his low-paid and squalid 'hell', while Mr Gondo lives in the splendor and comfort of his 'heavenly' mansion on the hills above. This kidnapper, Takeuchi, does have two accomplices, but they are completely nameless and faceless tools: people he uses for his purposes, then discards --- both are heroin addicts he has picked up off the streets of Yokohama, and, using his medical knowledge and access to heroin, arranges their death by overdose after their work is done.In King's Ransom, Douglas King resolutely refuses to pay the ransom, but instead helps the police catch the main kidnapper. The boy is released during this process, but only because the other kidnappers have quarrelled amongst themselves and given away their location. As a result, King is able to complete his stock transaction and win control of the shoe company, in effect having his cake and eating it too.By contrast, in High and Low, Gondo reluctantly agrees to pay the ransom, thereby securing the safe release of the boy, but the kidnapper remains at large. The remainder of the film details the police detective work, unaided by Gondo, which leads to the arrest of the kidnapper (not before he kills off his accomplices, however). The fact that Gondo has paid the ransom leads to the failure of his stock deal, the collapse of his finances, eviction from his house, and the loss of his possessions.There is a twist in the tail of both stories, but quite different in each case : Despite the fact that Gondo is ruined, the police, through dogged detective work, recover most of his money and, with public sympathy, he is able to start again, opening his own small shoe business. In a sense, he is now 'his own man' in a way that he never was before. The kidnapper Takeuchi, on the other hand, is unrepentant, and goes to the gallows (for he is given the death penalty) mocking and cursing Gondo.In King's Ransom, by comparison, it is strongly implied that King's refusal to pay the ransom means that his 'come-uppance' and self-reckoning are yet to come: that his cold and selfish view of the world will one day have to change. Ironically, it is one of the kidnappers --- the woman --- who has a moral conversion, displaying an admirable humanity in attempting to be kind to the kidnapped boy, trying to help him escape, and, in the end, intentionally betraying the whereabouts of the boy to the police. And as with Gondo, this moral conversion is rewarded : the kidnapped boy refuses to give evidence against the kidnapper who was kind to him, allowing her and her husband to escape across the border.All in all, one would have to say that, despite being an adaptation, High and Low is the tighter, more polished, and more sophisticated rendering. The McBain story seems somewhat unbalanced and dated by comparison.",

            "content": "I guess that it is impossible for some directors to be separated from the film they are most associated with. John Ford did films like THE GRAPES OF WRATH and HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY and THE LOST PATROL and THE INFORMER. But people love to discuss his magnificent westerns. Hitchcock is always associated with suspense and mystery...and with reason his best films being in those genres. But he did do (for better or worse) MR. AND MRS. SMITH (the original one) and WALTZES FROM VIENNA and RICH AND STRANGE. Maybe Howard Hawks was the only great director who actually jumped effortlessly from one type of film to another: adventure like ONLY ANGEL HAVE WINGS) to western (RED RIVER) to social comedy (BRINGING UP BABY or the 1952 MONKEY BUSINESS) to musicals (GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDS. Add to these the great Japanese director Akiro Kurasawa. To the West he is best recalled for all his \"samurai\" films like RASHOMON, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, YOJIMBO, all the way to his \"King Lear\" story RAN. But most of his films were set in the modern world from World War II Japan to post World War II, prosperous Japan. And (to me) his best one is this wonderful film noir, HIGH AND LOW.Toshiro Mifune, taken away from the age of the samurai and the real Bushido code, is now an intelligent shoe manufacturing executive. The company he works for has great potential, but is badly run. He is planning a coup against the leadership to take it over and transform it into the giant firm it can be. He has a huge sum of money ready to do this (including a mortgage loan on his home). Unfortunately while Mifune plans his scheme, another person has a scheme too. A social misfit with intelligence, he is determined to make his own kind of killing - a kidnap scheme. And, as luck or misfortune would have it, he turns his attention on Mifune's household. He decides to kidnap Mifune's son using two stooges to carry out the kidnap (he chooses them well - they are both drug addicts, so he can control them). Mifune is at home when he learns the bad news that his son is missing and feared kidnapped. He faces his terrified wife and the police who are trying to piece together what they can. Already they have gotten contacted about the huge ransom that is demanded. Mifune is ready to sacrifice his dreams of economic triumph, when all of a sudden everyone is surprised to see his son come into the house. How's this possible? Then they learn: the little boy changed his clothes with his friend the son of the family chauffeur. It is the chauffeur's son who has been kidnapped!Of course, to the chauffeur, and the police, this is just as horrifying (more so, truth be told, to the chauffeur). Mifune's wife (Kyoko Kagana) is very sympathetic too (after all, she just suffered the same horrors until her boy turned up). But all of a sudden Mifune cools down. To the consternation of everyone he is less than fully interested in paying any ransom. After all it's not his kid.Of course pressure by the cops and his wife force him to cooperate. It just doesn't look good if he doesn't. So his dreams of owning the shoe company is gone now (or at least put off). And the boy is returned, to the happiness of the chauffeur and his wife. But the money is now in the hands of the kidnappers.The first half of the film is occupied by the events leading to the delivery of the ransom and the release of the little boy. The second half follows the police investigation (handled by Tatsuya Nakadai as the police Lieutenant), who follows the clues until he finds the two associates, murdered by drug overdoses. And then the events leading to finding the mastermind...and what happens afterward.I won't go into the final scenes, except that the last one is a fascinating study in emotional collapse. You can't forget it once you see it...and it will not give anyone any emotional satisfaction.Oddly enough, a few years after this 1963 film was made, a similar kidnapping occurred in Great Britain. Rupert Murdoch, then starting the construction of his media empire, had left Australia and begun his British papers. He was already creating a splash when two brothers named Hussein decided to kidnap Mrs. Murdoch (the then Mrs. Murdoch) and hold her for ransom. They followed her itinerary, and knew that on a particular day she used one of the cars belonging to Murdoch's newspaper to get some chores done. They followed it, and stopped it and took the passenger out and sped away. Only, by some weird chance, Mrs. Murdoch was not the passenger. She had decided to change her itinerary that day. A Mrs. Murial McKay (pronounced McKai) was in the car - the wife of one of Murdoch's chief editors. She was never found alive again. The Hussein Brothers never said what happened to her - and both spent many years in prison for kidnapping. But most people felt they probably deserved sentences for killing the poor woman.",

            "content": "Kurosawa's 1963 noir classic 'High and Low' presents a classic kidnapping tale with a twist. Gondo, (Toshiro Mifune) an executive at the National Shoe Company is having problems with his fellow executives at work. They are insisting that they should start making shoes at a lower cost (and therefore lower quality) while Gondo, having served 30 years with the company wants to continue to make quality shoes at a slightly higher price. They threaten to join forces in a coup to force him out of the company unless he complies with their directives. What they didn't realize is that Gondo had been spending the last couple of months securing 50 million yen by mortgaging everything he owns in order to buy a controlling share of stock. Just hours before making this deal, Gondo and his wife receive the distressing news that their son has been kidnapped, and is being held for a 30 million ransom. When their son turns up mere minutes after the phone call, it is soon realized that it wasn't their son that was kidnapped, but their houseman's young son instead, and Gondo has to choose between personal and financial ruin, and saving the life of the young boy.'High and Low' is a phenomenal story and is laden with unfathomable conflicts. Mifune, who is always fantastic, is the sheer personification of the main conflict \u0096 he uses his entire body and voice as a vessel to express the torture of his decision process. 'High and Low' is also a great Noirish thriller that never lets us forget that we need to figure out who facilitated this crime. The discovery process is more thorough and exacting than most films of the genre, and as a result is completely fascinating. The film almost plays out like an episode of 'Law and Order' in that we receive the setup, the action, and then the police take over in their hunt for the kidnapper, an event that call to mind the words 'needle' and 'haystack'.Kurosawa is obviously best known for his period pieces, but 'High and Low' is a modern-day film that is filmed in an exquisite and sharply contrasting black and white. After seeing the film, I was left with the question I seem to think of every time I see a Kurosawa film, 'Can he actually make a bad or even mediocre film?' 8/10.--Shelly",

I admire many of Kurosawa's techniques but I don't connect. High and Low is the first of his modern day films I've seen since Ikiru many years ago and although they're as respected but not as popular as his samurai films, I think I've found the niche where I love Kurosawa. The first hour is set in one place, boasting a riveting moral dilemma ripe for the textbooks. It's a fascinating psychological study to watch how protagonist Mr. Gondo's behaviour differs between the threat of holding his son hostage to the actual threat of holding an employee's son hostage, thanks to Toshiro Mifune's great performance. No matter what way the character plays it from there, the damage is already done and his vulnerability is revealed. It kind of makes you glad you aren't rich. This first half is ready for a stage adaptation and I wish it was the whole film as it relieves the tension mid-way. The rest of the film is a police procedural following the investigation to catch the extortionist. It's interesting and engaging but not quite as compelling. The film would have benefited from not skipping round its ensemble too much, especially after committing to Mr. Gondo at first so much. I would have also liked to have known more about the antagonist's motivation outside of a case of class jealousy, but I guess that was the point that the film was trying to illustrate. High and Low is still an essential entry in Kurosawa's canon, one that set the bar and foundation for cop thrillers to come.8/10",

            "content": "Like its title, 'High and Low (1963)' is a film of two halves. The first, set in an air-conditioned hilltop house overlooking the city, is almost like a stage play, its single location and limited cast making the most out of the intensity surrounding its inciting incident. The second, set amidst the sweaty streets of the city itself, opens up considerably, following a meticulous police investigation that eventually culminates in a sequence that leans further into horror than you'd ever expect. Though the initial protagonist is almost entirely absent in the second movement, the picture doesn't lose any of its momentum, naturally evolving rather than morphing into something else altogether. The genres, or at least approaches, of the two halves are arguably entirely different, but they feed into each other in a natural way that compounds their necessity. The piece is surprisingly compelling given how much of it focuses on dry detective work, including the detailed listing of evidence and pain-staking stakeouts that span what almost feels like tens of minutes. Kurosawa is a great director, with his excellent use of blocking being especially noticeable. This is the first non-period piece of his I've seen and it's every bit as successful as his potentially more iconic work. Both of its halves are almost equally compelling, and its construction is generally great overall. Mifune is as good as ever, his angry growling remaining as effortlessly epic as it ever has been. There is also a really strong sense of still-relevant theme underlying the entire affair. The final scene, which I won't spoil, is a nice bit of denouement that's usually omitted in this type of older movie. Ultimately, this is an entertaining and interesting affair that takes its time but uses it wisely. It's pretty great.",

            "content": "Exceeding all expectations and scoring high marks in all departments of filmmaking, High and Low is a masterly directed, ingeniously scripted & expertly executed police procedural crime drama that approaches its subject matter in a thoroughly investigative fashion, and presents Akira Kurosawa at the top of his game.The story follows a wealthy shoe company executive who becomes a victim of extortion. Having mortgaged his entire savings on another deal, he finds his morality challenged and contemplates whether to risk all that he owns by paying the ransom or put his other plan into action that would secure his family's future.Directed by Akira Kurosawa, High and Low at first appeared to be completely different from what it eventually ended up being, and is skilfully steered by the master storyteller. Every move is carefully envisioned, every segment is illustrated in exhaustive detail & every twist is cleverly placed within the narrative as Kurosawa takes a very calculative & methodical approach to bring this story to life.There is rarely any instance when the film steps on the wrong foot. Be it the build-up, ideal pacing, smooth & controlled operation of camera, immaculate editing or the entire investigation process, every single aspect works in harmony with each other, and plays an important role in enriching the overall experience and making the drama much more immersive, engaging & impactful.Coming to the performances, Toshir\u00f4 Mifune plays the wealthy executive faced with moral dilemma when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped, and delivers a very restrained performance. However it still carries an intensity that overshadows the inputs of others sharing the screen with him. Tatsuya Nakadai is in as Chief Detective Tokura, and his input is most compelling of all while the remaining cast play their roles sincerely.On an overall scale, High and Low is one of the best police procedural crime dramas that deserves to be ranked amongst Akira Kurosawa's most accomplished works. A masterpiece of first-rate storytelling & top-notch craftsmanship that finds its creator in complete control of his craft, it is a gripping, entertaining & immensely satisfying cinema that only gets better as the plot progresses. An unexpectedly memorable cinematic experience, High and Low is one classic I have no hesitation in recommending it to every film lover out there.",

            "content": "More readily remembered for his stunning work in the action/samurai genre, famed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa proved multiple times throughout his career that he was happy to tackle subjects and features well outside of what would appear to be his usual repertoire.Films like detective noir Stray Dog, drama Ikiru and this hard-boiled thriller High and Low, showcase an artist that was constantly looking to push himself and his talents to deliver thoughtful and timeless pieces of cinematic entertainment.Not as frequently spoken about in the mainstream when topics of Kurowsawa come up for discussion, High and Low is a black and white masterpiece of sweat inducing tension and intrigue as the masterful director gives us what appears to be three films in one, as we follow the initial extortion, exchange and hunt of the perpetrator that has held Toshir\u00f4 Mifune's wealthy businessman Kingo Gondo to ransom when they kidnap his chauffeurs young son and demand a mutli-million dollar fee to return him safely.Tackling subjects of the class divide between the poor and the rich and also just entertainingly a search far and wide for answers to the mysterious crime, High and Low is first and foremost a pulse-pounding affair that mixes hefty dialogue lead scenes with set pieces that still feel incredibly staged, especially an integral bullet train sequence around the half way mark of the film.You wouldn't say High and Low features great character depth or even memorably individuals as such, even if Mifune is great as the hard to gage Gondo and Tatsuya Nakadai makes his mark as the hard working lead inspector Chief Detective Tokura, a man with whom Gondo doesn't always seem to share a great affection with, but it is in most instances a gripping affair that refuses to take the easy route as Kurosawa remains headstrong in offering a unique and no doubt genre changing example of the genre.Many of the police procedurals we have seen in times since High and Low's release, from The French Connection, Prisoners through to Zodiac all feel as though they owe elements of their being to this film, that whilst not perfect, is still one of the most finely tuned detective pieces one could hope to see.Another unique and special addition to the film is the way in which Kurosawa shoots its Japanese set back drop, with the industrial side of the city through to the slums of criminal activity about as far away from his rural samurai masterpieces as you would get but feeling absolutely as alive and vibrant with character and even in one stunning instant, color.Final Say -You may not remember the characters or emotional beats as fondly as the rest of the film but High and Low remains a benchmark police drama that is both thrilling and layered. A worthy classic from a master a cinema showcasing his wide reaching talents.4 chimney's out of 5",

            "content": "Tengoku to jigoku (1963), directed by Akira Kurosawa, was shown in the U.S. with the title High and Low. The film stars Toshir\u00f4 Mifune as Kingo Gondo, an executive of a shoe corporation. He is in the midst of a desperate financial struggle within the company. Suddenly, he receives a phone call that his son has been kidnapped for ransom. Then it turns out that it isn't his son--it's his chauffeur's son. Of course, Gondo is willing to sacrifice everything for his son's safety. But why should he sacrifice his fortune and his future for someone else's son? That is the moral dilemma of the film.In many ways High and Low is a police procedural. (It's actually based on a book by Ed McBain.) However, the brilliant Kurosawa touch lifts it above a simple police drama. There's a breathtaking scene on a bullet train, and an incredible scene in \"Dope Alley.\" (Dope Alley is the location where addicts go to shoot up and--sometimes--die. It's a ghastly place, and Kurosawa makes us see that all too well.) The movie co-stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Chief Detective Tokura, Ky\u00f4ko Kagawa as Reiko Gondo, Kingo's wife, and Tsutomu Yamazaki as the kidnapper. (I noticed that, after the kidnapping, Reiko changed from traditional Japanese dress to Western dress. I think that's symbolic of her transformation from a submissive wife to someone who has a strong will and a strong conscience.)The final scene of the film is unexpected, and I consider it the work of a master. The movie is worth seeing for that scene alone.We saw High and Low at the refurbished Dryden Theatre in Rochester, NY. It is as ideal a venue to see a film as you can find anywhere. All movies work better on a large screen in an auditorium with first-rate projection capabilities. However, High and Low will work well enough on the small screen. If you haven't seen it, you need to see it. Find it and watch it.",

Though the setup is extremely deliberate, the film really picks up with the feverish pursuit of the criminal, with some laudable acting all around. Kurosawa deftly touches upon the economic divisions within Japan at the time as well as the sociological ills (heroine) facing the youth at the time. While Kurosawa's labored pedantry sometimes works against it, this is solidly directed/acted picture and a great nod to the film noir of the 1940s and 50s.

Somehow, this manages to be utterly riveting - take the scene about 75 minutes in where progress for each part of the investigation is presented by different policeman in a vast meeting - see completely absorbing. Few would have the courage to stick with this level of detail.

            "content": "!!SPOILERS GALORE!!Tengoku to Jigoku ('High & Low', or more correctly, 'Heaven & Hell') is a remarkable expression of the Taoist elements of Shintoism and Zen; the concept that nothing can exist without an opposite (represented by the 'taiji', or 'yin-yang' symbol.) There are many obvious allusions to this, most notably the living conditions of Gondo and the kidnapper - Gondo, high on the hill in affluent air conditioned comfort (Heaven) and the kidnapper, deep within the heat of the city amidst drugs and squalor.'High & Low' can also describe the significant elements that drug use plays in the film... To get too high is to get completely low (again, 'Heaven & Hell' most certainly applies.) Gondo's home is very bright and filled with windows, while the kidnapper lives in a very dark apartment, again a significant contrast.Gondo's gut-wrenching decision to pay or not pay the ransom for his chauffeur's child. To keep the money for himself would mean he would be able to take control of his company, but there would be no honor in that. There are several wonderful shots at the beginning of the film while they are trying to decide what to do where Gondo and the chauffeur are on opposite sides of the room facing away from each other, and another standout shot where the family is gathered on one side, the police gathered on the other, and Gondo is sitting in the dead center trying to decide what to do.Since there would be no honor in gaining control of the company if it meant even the risk of killing a child, he really has no choice, even though he puts it off as long as possible. Once he has made up his mind, there is no going back, even though it certainly means his ruin. The auctioneers tagging his furniture while they discuss their plans are particularly noticeable - could this be considered honorable? And yet Gondo pays no attention.The visual of Gondo mowing his own yard says more than any words. He accepts his decision totally, and all that it means. Even though the vast amount of the money is retrieved, his debt would still be greater. He certainly does not end up in a good financial state, but he ends up in an honorable one (running his own small shoe company with the values he cherished.)The actions of his fellow executives are almost as contemptible as those of the kidnapper. They are willing to take control of the company no matter what the cost, even dragging Gondo's personal assistant along with them. In the end, the 'old man' (only referred to in the film, never seen) would have retained control of his company, but the combination of the bad publicity associated with Gondo's situation and the cheap shoes the other executives were pushing to produce would almost certainly have resulted in the ultimate ruin of the company.I found the ending of the film unsettling and somewhat unsatisfying. The kidnapper essentially demands to see Gondo to simply gloat about the fact that he's not afraid of dying because he was able to ruin a rich man... and yet he ends up breaking down predictably. Gondo sits emotionless - there is no happy ending, there is only the fact that Gondo's life is going to continue and the kidnapper's is not. In the end, Gondo maintains his honor while the kidnapper is dragged out of the room in a shameful display (clearly afraid of dying despite his boasting.)The most satisfying part of the movie (for me) is how quickly they go from capturing the kidnapper to the execution of his sentence. If only that sort of swift justice was a reality, at least as an American.A wonderful film that any fan of Kurosawa or fine film noir should not miss. It is true, there are no samurai in this film, but it is still pure Akira Kurosawa.",

            "review_title": "Tricky",
            "content": "This is a mixture of two film genres that end up complimenting each other rather perfectly. The main character disappears from half the movie, and yet it still works. This is one of Kurosawa's most experimental films, and it's couched in seemingly straightforward styles of storytelling, a character drama and a police procedural that are both kept fairly separate and yet intertwine together expertly at the same time.The film begins with an informal business meeting in the house of Kingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune), a director of the National Shoe Company, with three other directors who want him to go in on a plan to push out the \"old man\" who owns a plurality of the stock by coming together. The problem is that Gondo does not like their plans for the future, using cheaper materials to make less reliable shoes, and he's turning everything around on everyone else. He's been secretly purchasing stock from other stockholders for a few years, putting everything he owns up as collateral for the necessary loans in order to reach 47%, which would outstrip the combined 46% of the three other directors with the old man. He has secured the last piece to this puzzle that very night, ready to send his right-hand man, Kawanashi (Tatsuya Mihashi), to Osaka with a check for fifty-million yen that very night.Things suddenly turn south when Gondo receives a call from a mysterious young man proclaiming that he has kidnapped Gondo's son. It's quickly discovered that the kidnapper had taken the wrong child, instead picking up the young son, Shinichi (Masahiko Shimizu), of Gondo's driver, Aoki (Yutaka Sada). This changes nothing of the kidnapper's plans, though. He has a child, and he's going to get thirty-million yen from Gonda no matter what. So begins Gondo's moral dilemma. It's not his son. It is his money. He's on the verge of taking control of his company to follow through on his own vision for how it should be run. Does he have a moral responsibility to not only spend a fortune saving a child who is not his but to also destroy his own professional, and potentially personal, life?He calls the police, and so begins the police procedural element. However, it doesn't take over just yet. The first hour of this film takes place almost entirely in the single large living room of Gondo's high rise house, overlooking the slums of Tokyo below. It becomes obvious that phone calls are coming from below in the slums and that the kidnapper can see into the house. Hiding the presence of the police, headed by Inspector Tokura (Tatsuya Nakadai), Gondo works through his moral dilemma while Aoki remains mostly a background figure.It's been obvious from Kurosawa's first film that one of his great strengths was his visual acumen, and High and Low represents an interesting challenge, a replication of his efforts in The Lower Depths. He's constantly placing his camera in different parts of the room, filming sets of actors to fill the 2.35:1 widescreen frame, and nowhere is this more interesting than in the treatment of Aoki. About halfway through this long series of events in Gondo's house, Aoki seemingly disappears from the conversation about his son, but he does not disappear from the frame. He's often in the exact middle of the frame, cowering in the background as Gondo speaks with Tokura and the other policemen about what's going on, and Aoki ends up just almost crawling out of frame.Gondo's goodness of character eventually wins out, and he organizes a drop to get Shinichi on an express train out of Tokyo. The police go along, but the kidnapper was smart and got him to make the exchange on the outside of the speeding train, leaving the money and forcing Gondo and the police to go back from the next station to pick up Shinichi, who is safe and sound. Gondo's money is gone, his efforts to purchase National Shoe are over, and his creditors now need to be repaid.This is where the police procedural completely takes over. With the child returned but Gondo on the verge of ruin, the police take up the cause of the man who paid a fortune to save another man's child as a crusade, especially when the press get a taste of the story and trumpet Gondo as a hero that National Shoe, in its continued efforts to push him out, are treating maliciously. This combination of the intricate look at evidence from the phone calls, Shinichi's memory, and the surrounding area with no one ever forgetting why they are doing what they are doing is what helps give the procedural elements a surprising emotional weight. It's not just following the details of a hard to crack case, it's following the details of a case that we are emotionally invested in.And that case really is intricate. Small details from phone calls lead to a specific type of railcar. Shinichi's memory leads to a specific seaside town where he was kept. A stolen car leads to a fish market. A remote cabin leads to searches for heroin, and it all ends up leading to Ginjiro Takeuchi (Tsutomu Yamazaki), a medical intern. The capture of him is an extended pursuit sequence that is remarkably tense as it drags out with Ginjiro leading the police around Tokyo with the police wanting to pin as much as possible on him to give him the maximum sentence.There are a couple of interesting things about Takeuchi that I want to mention. The first is that we're introduced to him relatively early, right about the time that the exchange takes place. We see him, but we don't really know anything about him. He never talks to himself about what he's doing in order to give the audience a helping hand. He's largely silent when he's on screen. The other thing is that there's a confrontation with Gondo that is the last scene in the film. Gondo has resigned himself to his new life of rebuilding from scratch, and he's visiting Takeuchi in prison. The two end up being a mirror of each other to a certain degree, in much the same way that happened in Stray Dog. Gondo started his professional life as an apprentice in National Shoe, working hard over 30 years to get to the point where he could conceivably take complete control of the company. Takeuchi, in contrast, is a medical intern, similar to how Gondo began, and he harbored ill will against Gondo simply because he owned the house above the slum, leading to the kidnapping. He also insists on not explaining himself, an interesting contrast to movies like Drunken Angel or Ikiru where people gathered to discuss a character at the end.What's most interesting to me about the film overall is the mixture of film genres and how well Kurosawa pulls it off. The procedural really gets deep into the weeds of how police work operates, and Mifune disappears from the film for over an hour. And yet, it never feels disconnected from what came before it. It is a procedural enhanced by the strong character work that started the film, leading to a surprisingly quiet denouement, anchored by a small and intricate performance by Mifune.This is another example of primo entertainment from Kurosawa. Penetrating deeply into the minds of characters while telling an intricate story at the same time, High and Low is one of Kurosawa's best films.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa created a worldwide reputation with his historical samurai films, in result of that many people tend to forget the fact that Kurosawa made several films set in their present time. Tengoku to jigoku is one of them. It's often translated as High and Low, but I prefer the title Heaven and Hell, it's much more accurate. Heaven and Hell is a story about a businessman who faces a moral dilemma.Kingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is a wealthy shoe manufacturer, who works in a big company, National Shoes. He plans to take over the whole company from his business partners. His plan perishes when his son gets kidnapped. Gondo is willing to pay the ransom, when he finds out that the kidnappers have made a mistake and kidnapped the wrong boy, the son of Gondo's chauffeur, Aoki (Yutaka Sada) . Should Kingo Gondo still pay the ransom and endanger his career? Heaven and Hell has got many layers and it can be interpreted with many different ways. It's narratively divided into two parts: Heaven and Hell. In Heaven, in the skyscrapers the dialog and the editing is very calm, everything is functional. Even Kurosawa's takes are slow and systematic. Then in Hell, in the slum everything is the opposite. The editing is fast-paced and everything is in confusion. Kurosawa's takes are quick and his narrative is chaotic & nervous.Heaven and Hell has unnecessarily been left in the shadows of Kurosawa's epic samurai masterpieces. In my opinion this is another masterpiece by him. Among its artistry it achieves to be the most entertaining & exciting crime thriller ever made. Especially the police investigation scenes are done brilliantly. Not to mention the amazing acting of it.Akira Kurosawa used his two main actors, Takashi Shimura (Ikiru, Rashomon) as the chief of the investigation section and Toshiro Mifune (Seven Samurai, Yojimbo) as Kingo Gondo. Kurosawa is famous for combining Japanese culture with the western world's. Heaven and Hell doesn't diverge from others in this. For instance Heaven and Hell is slightly based on an American novel by Ed McBain.Heaven and Hell deals with Kurosawa's familiar themes: Justice, evil, good, glory, humanity and morality. It is a moral study, but it also shows the themes of good and evil on different layers, in the business interests as it does in the slum. There truly are Heavens and Hells in our world. In the beginning Kurosawa challenges us to think what is the right thing for Gondo to do, Mr. Gondo gets the sympathy of the media and the sympathy of the audience. But eventually we start to think who actually are the real victims. For example, the girl the kidnapper kills, while testing the clean drug. In spite of this the police still is more interested in getting Gondo's money back. In hell people just die and no one cares. I was powerfully affected by the motive of Heaven and Hell. The curtain. It repeats in the film several times. In the beginning the curtain is the thing that makes it possible for the police to investigate this case. When the final scene comes and we see the curtain descending in front of Gondo's face, one can't do anything but get the shivers. The reflection of Gondo's face is also very powerful, it refers to the theme of good and evil. As this all happens we hear nothing but the kidnapper screaming. This stands as one of the greatest cinematic endings ever.The way how Akira Kurosawa deals with humanity in this is perfect. He achieves to create new humane experiences for us. I think no one has made as many masterpieces as he has. Heaven and Hell challenges us to observe and think. To look at our own morality. Can the world where some people live in heaven and some in hell be even close to justice? Would the police have helped Gondo as much if he was a middle-class worker? In addition to Heaven and Hell's artistry, it achieves to be more entertaining and exciting than any Hollywood crime film. The best crime thriller ever made, no doubt. It studies the true nature of justice while showing the good and evil in our world. It is a philosophical moral study. But even if you don't enjoy art I would recommend this to you, since it is one of the most exciting films I've ever seen.\"Your house looked like heaven, high up there. That's how I began to hate you. \"",

            "content": "I profess I simply like Kurosawa's sword epics better, but there is no denying the power and skill of his modern-day works as well. They may be less popular, but they are still brilliantly crafted and amazing displays. I am, once again, blown away.In the first few minutes, quite a lot happens. Some political leveraging between owners of a corporation leads to one man, Gondo, putting everything he owns in the hopes to maintain the tradition and craftsmanship necessary to supply well-designed and comfortable shoes for the women of Japan. Unfortunately, his desperate bid, a suspenseful industrial drama in its own right, is immediately followed by the worst luck: someone has kidnapped his driver's child, and is holding the child for ransom from Gondo. Now Gondo must lose everything to save the child and the police must put everything into capturing the kidnapper.High and Low, I think, refers to the highs and the lows of society, and Gondo's position there. Most of Kurosawa's modern-day films deal with the problems of capitalism and bureaucracy in post-War Japan, and this is much the case, though this time the sympathies are a little more complex than a general favoritism towards the lower class. Gondo is a heroic character because he came from working-class culture, and the kidnapper acts completely out of envy for his position (both in society and literally on the hill above the poor tenant-buildings of the city). The police also have to search high and low for the badguy, because he turns out to be a conspicuously devious and intelligent person--and all the more dangerous for it.Truly this movie will keep you riveted to the end. And I must warn you, it's a particularly dark ending. Kurosawa has never shied away from letting the story end on a rather bleak note (see The Lower Depths for a particularly nasty one), but this ending goes beyond bleak to downright disturbing. And it's powerful to behold. Highly recommended! --PolarisDiB",

            "content": "HIGH AND LOW isn't often ranked as the best Kurosawa project, but it sure is my personal favorite. That surprises me a bit. I tend to prefer Kurosawa's period movies to his contemporary dramas and yet HIGH AND LOW is the one I return to the most. Its treasures are inexhaustible, not to be discovered on a single viewing: the characterizations, the acting, the camerawork, the social themes. And the ending must surely rank among the finest in cinema history. Just as the last shot of CITY LIGHTS always makes me weep, the final shot of HIGH AND LOW, with the condemned kidnapper screaming before the police wrench him away, leaving Gondo and the audience in sudden, dreadful silence, always leaves me similarly dumbstruck.HIGH AND LOW is often compared to Hitchcock's work. I definitely see the similarities in terms of suspense and pacing. However, Kurosawa is certainly more of a humanist than Hitchcock. Despite the thrills and dark humor, the protagonist's victory is decidedly pyrrhic (as opposed to the source novel where the wealthy businessman refuses to pay the ransom full-stop and is, to put it mildly, a macho jerk lacking Gondo's sorrowful sense that he has damned himself). Kurosawa puts soul into what could have been a routine police procedural, making the original title \"Heaven and Hell\" all the more fitting.",

            "content": "Apparently, one of the sources of this film (besides the Ed McBain novel on which it is based)is Kurosawa's love of film noir. Particularly in the last half of the movie, we get a spectacular display of the visual vocabulary of noir--particularly in the Dope Alley sequence--that would earn an approving nod from John Alton.However, the particular fascination of this film--and make not mistake, it is fascinating--is the way in which Kurosawa, like a virtuoso pianist going from classical to romantic to atonal, rings changes on many different genres. Yes, we have the police procedural--but there are several others. The first hour of the film is essentially one set, and extraordinarily stagy--setting up at least two different themes, one the corporate boardroom drama (like a film like Executive Suite), the other an almost Ibseneque drama of moral responsibility--should Gondo pay the ransom even though it is not his son--, which in turn becomes played out with changes in the interactions with Aoki, the chauffeur, Gondo, the executive (Toshiro Mifune), and Shinichi, the chauffeur's son.One we are launched into the investigation, and a very good one it is too, rivaling the great French gangster films of the 50s and the Warner films of the 40s, we are not done with variations. The boardroom drama plays out in the background, and comes together with the main story line and themes of moral responsibility (and even some political commentary)in the final scene between Gondo and Ginjiro Takeuchi (Tsutomu Yamazaki), the kidnapper and killer.Finally, we are reminded of one of the roots of film noir, German Expressionism, as the detectives shadow Takeuchi as he buys heroin to (he thinks) finish off his accomplices. The shadows of Dr. Caligari are not far away here, nor when Takeuchi descends into madness in the final scene.All in all, a fine film on every level and particularly rewarding to the film buff with an interest in visual style. Highly recommended. (The only reason it's not a 10 is that there are some better.)",

            "review_title": "Masterpiece",
            "content": "High And Low (Tengoku To Jigoku; literally Heaven And Hell) is a film that is so perfect in every detail it shows how utterly silly similar Hollywood takes on the matter are, and were: think Ron Howard's and Mel Gibson's silly 1996 flick Ransom, or any of Alfred Hitchcock's crime dramas from the 1950s or 1960s. Yes, critics often resort to the copout that Hitchcock was not deep, but technically was great. True, to a degree, but one need only watch the rail car sequence in this film to see how staid, old fashioned, conservative, and utterly quaint Hitchcock's ideas on crime were. The truth is that Hitchcock really had no idea what drove criminals. Kurosawa did. To the Englishman, crimes were Freudian impelled, and committed by people with manifest things wrong with them. The claim he made was one merely had to be adept at spotting such things. Kurosawa shows that crime (as it does in reality) emerges from complex and obscure things. Its evildoers are often manifestly plain and their reasons never discernible. What drives High And Low to such greatness is that, even after all is revealed, the criminal apprehended, and the film at an end, the viewer is still pondering- in the best sense, and still unable to grasp how and why such a thing occurred. Yet, the film only gets to that point after peerless artistic and technical means.The peerless screenplay was written by Kurosawa, Eijir\u00f4 Hisaita, Ryuzo Kikushima, and Hideo Oguni, adapted from the 1959 pulp novel King's Ransom. The book was written by Ed McBain, pseudonym for Evan Hunter, which was the adopted name of Salvatore Albert Lombino. Using a variety of pen names, McBain penned pulp crime books that were three or four levels below Mickey Spillane. As Hunter, he wrote The Blackboard Jungle and the screen adaptation for Hitchcock's The Birds- probably the best film the great profile ever made. In short, under whatever guise, Hunter was no budding John Steinbeck. This makes the adaptation by Hisaita all the more impressive, for, while I never read the novel the film is derived from, as a youth I read a few McBain books and, even then, saw they were cardboard- both character- and plot-wise. Most criticisms of the film claim that, aside from the basic premise, the two works deviate greatly. One can thus likely (according to Occam's Razor) attribute the positives in this 143 minute (but swift paced) long film to the work of Hisaita and company, not McBain....Overall, High And Low is a great film, whose Americanized, like Vittorio De Sica's Ladri Di Biciclette; whose title has historically been mistranslated as The Bicycle Thief rather than Bicycle Thieves, it is a fortuitous gaffe, for the 'wrong' translated title is far more evocative and less strident than its literal translation. The film's exploration and criticisms of social aspects of times and places past is timeless and the film shows how a great artist can mine true cosmic depth out of the must mundane of propositions that lesser artists make hackwork out of, such as Reiko's banal query: 'What good is success if you lose your humanity?' The real tragedy of this film is not what occurs within its frame, but that even such banalities are not asked today in the modern world of film-making, much less extrapolated upon in such a proud and grand way. Akira Kurosawa was a giant of cinema, and world art, in general; a man whose output will be seen, centuries hence, the way Shakespeare's and Goya's are today, but that gigantism was built upon and borne by the desire to explore even the minutest moments of the human condition- not in a weepy, bleeding heart liberal sort of way, but in a deep, penetrating way that celebrated the best part of the human being: his intellect. In today's dumbed down Politically Correct society, such films are not only not made, but not even contemplated. When the history of turn of the millennium cinema is finally written, one of the key questions asked will be what happened to the basic striving for high art? Why did it become gauche to want to excel, and to want to treat an audience with respect? Of course, the film asks these same sorts of queries (along with the more banal ones it subverts) in regards to its lead character's professions, which only shows how great art recapitulates itself again and again, regardless of the changing circumstances of history, while bad art is entombed by its stolidity. Great artists know this, and, while glaring at his own reflection, at film's end, one senses a more peaceable Kingo Gondo knows it, too. Or, at least we hope he does. That we do says as much of Kurosawa as it does of us and our newer times.",

In fact, each sequence (however mundane) seems to have something striking in it, that one surprising dash of colour is glorious, and I'll be seeing the kidnapper emerging from the foliage in those gleaming specs in my nightmares.It certainly could be a little shorter - and the heavy-handed final scene seems to be cracking a nut with a sledgehammer but it was far and away above my lofty expectations even.

            "review_title": "More than a detective story",
            "content": "There is much going on in this movie. The brilliantly constructed detective story plot is woven and relies on an analysis on the growing social divide in Japan. These are the two main tensions that propel the action forward but there is no cheap simplification of the conflict between the classes. At a time when the country was gearing up to become the major industrial power that it would later achieve, the movie provides a lead whose wealth, while considerable, is imperiled.All this serves as the background to the fascinating dilemma with which Gondo is faced: should he give up on all he was worked for his entire life for the sake of a child that is not even his. The moral issue is presented in sober tones that make it all the more pressing. Doing what is right cuts across the social spectrum and in this 'High and Low' escapes the danger of being a clich\u00e9 of the good hearted poor against the evil rich. The staggering difference in terms of wealth is brought home mostly through solid cinematography that needs only contrast the cesspool around which cluster dilapidated houses to the hill upon which the mansion is poised. One thing that should be mentioned is that large interiors are extremely rare in Tokyo.From this perspective the title 'Tengoku to jigoku' (literally 'Heaven and Hell') can be seen in this juxtaposition of privileged and underprivileged but this is a multi-layered layer. The title also fits the state of mind that results from a pacified and tormented conscience respectively. The terse but loaded ending adds more strength and subtlety to the character study. Kurosawa matches some of his favorite actors to assure that the acting is top notch.The intrigue that supports this complex portrait of a society and individual responsibility is a police investigation that is also original. At one point filming is used to garner evidence in something of a shout out to the technical advances in the art of making movies by shooting from a moving train. And all this delivered with Kurosawa's genius of crafting masterpieces that make one think even as they are entertaining.",

Businessmen talking about women's shoes is hardly a premise to an exciting Kurosawa thriller and starring the brooding Toshiro Mifune...Yet, one is taken in and kept quietly involved as the kidnapper makes contact, gets the wrong youngster and the subsequent police investigation. Other reviewers have detailed all the twists and turns, so I'll keep mine to something simpler. After half an hour we are fully involved with police procedure, their professionalism and attitudes a distant cry to all those U.S thrillers where the cops just have to cut corners and be maverick oddballs.Mifune is an understatement of diminished anguish as he jostles with conscience and business, especially compared with his usual aggressive samurai characterisations.The film really picks up when it goes out into other parts of Japan by the Bullet Train and as the money is dropped, the pace and scale of the action is upped. It's all fascinating and the culmination set in the heroin dens and seedy Tokyo bars have us cranked up and set for the conclusion.High and Low is a complex and fascinating crime thriller, shown in widescreen, gritty black and white.

            "content": "If you want to know what pure genius looks like then watch a Kurosawa film. The genius of his career spans its entire length. His films from the 50's are just as amazing as his films from the 80's. And the films that fall right between these two poles, like High and Low, are all too incredible as well. High and Low is about Mr. Gondo, a high strung business man who is preparing to take over the largest shoe corporation in the world by secretly buying stock. Everything is going according to plan until an unforeseen thorn pierces Mr. Gondo's side. His chauffeur's son is kidnapped and demands a ransom that would ruin Mr. Gondo's plan, and thus, his livelihood. So the question is raised: could you pay a kidnapper's ransom for someone you hardly even know? High and Low excellently hones in on this psychologically straining question and makes this film into an intense dialogue heavy thriller.Kurosawa does something risky yet cinematically awesome in High and Low, the likes of which we would never see in a mainstream film. He sets the entire first hour of the film in the confines of Mr. Gondo's apartment as he, his wife, his chauffeur, and the police discuss how they are going to resolve this situation. This single setting gives a much more troubling and claustrophobic feel to the whole situation, drawing us into the action very well. And of course Kurosawa's camera movement is brilliantly haunting as it quietly moves about the apartment, capturing the intensity and anxiety that fill the air. In all of his films Kurosawa was able to capture the art of artistic storytelling so well and High and Low is a fantastic example of it.After Mr. Gondo pays the ransom and his chauffeur's son is returned the second half of the film becomes a detective story as the police set out on an elaborate hunt to find the kidnapper and return Mr. Gondo's money. Much of the investigation is explained through heavy dialogue, including a fifteen minute scene in the police station where everybody explains what they've done for the investigation and what the next steps will be. Then the rest of the film is a thrilling investigation to find the kidnapper and bring him to justice.I have to admit that I didn't enjoy the second half of the film nearly as much as the first. The police investigation seems clich\u00e9 and unoriginal, but it is really quite revolutionary. Not many films detailed such elaborate investigations before this and so obviously Kurosawa had a major impact on the genre, taking it to these new extremes. But I've come to the conclusion that I'm of a cinematic generation that enjoys new and highly original films more. I have undying respect for what a film like High and Low did for filmmaking and I'm going to hold it in high regards, but personal preference is going to make me enjoy a film that expands on what Kurosawa did more. But I still loved High and Low because it is a work of art and it does tell an incredible story that delves into psychological aspects rarely explored before this.High and Low is a truly incredible film and, like many Kurosawa films, is an unsung hero of cinema, influencing filmmaking like no other director has. I'm not sure that Kurosawa was capable of making a bad film and if he was I haven't seen it yet. High and Low is another one of his darkly revolutionary tales that has played a major role in making cinema into what it is today.",

I have seen a lot of his samurai films and period pieces he did over his brilliant career. This is the first, modern day (1963), crime drama of his, that I have seen. I saw this the first time, about 30 years ago, but recently brought it back out and it is still as good as it was then. Not only are his samurai films great, but apparently, so are his crime-dramas. High and Low (1963), is a riveting film, about saving a life at he cost of your own. It is set in the Japanese city of Yokohama, which is a port town, with plenty of hillsides overlooking the bay.Toshiro Mifune gives an excellent performance as Kingo Gondo, a businessman, who gambles on a hostile takeover of the designer shoe company he works for. He is being extorted out of 30 million yen, when kidnappers accidently kidnap his chauffeur, Aoki's (Yutaka Sada), son, after trying to kidnap his son. The 30 million yen is the ransom and if Gondo pays it, it will ruin him into poverty. The most riveting part of the film is the meticulous way the Japanese police detectives, piece-by-piece, conduct the investigation. The assemblage of different detective teams, that are assigned to important points of the case, is cleverly informational, which adds to your attention, increasing the desire to see the film to the end. It is, mid-20th century, sleuthing at its best.Kurosawa is able to utilize the camera just like he does in his samurai movies. Instead of exploring wide-open spaces, like deserts, mountains or forests, he is able to do the same thing with cityscapes and even inside Gondo's expensive hillside condominium. He is able to frame his shots, by using actor placement or composition utilizing furniture in the room. The widescreen feel emphasizes the size of Gondo's home. It emphasizes his rich, luxurious lifestyle and why he is a target of kidnappers. Kurosawa's directing style, his editing skills, all highlight this really great story about honor and team-work.8.8 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

Having been a craftsman, Gondo wants to make sure that National Shoe will continue to make quality, well-made shoes. His fellow executives want to save money by switching to cheaply-made products that will fall apart soon. Gondo has engineered a plan to take over the company to maintain the shoe-crafting quality. To implement his plan, Gondo has mortgaged his entire fortune, including his large house that sits on top of a hill (the \"High\" in the title).Right in the middle of all this, Takeuchi Ginjiro, a very angry medical intern, has engineered his own plan. He plans to kidnap Gondo's young son, Jun, and demand a huge ransom. The kidnapping is performed and Takeuchi makes the call to Gondo. The amount demanded is such that it would completely ruin Gondo if he were to pay it. He would even lose his large house, and would most likely lose his job and income. Gondo is willing to do this for his own son. However, it turns out that the kidnappers have made a mistake. They have kidnapped Shinichi, the son of Gondo's chauffeur, who is a widower of very modest means. The moral dilemma poses itself: will Gondo sacrifice his entire fortune to save the son of his chauffeur? I don't want to \"spoil\" the film for viewers with the answer. However, there are many aspects that can be discussed without putting in a \"spoiler.\" The \"High\" refers to Gondo's mansion, perched upon a high hill. It also refers to Gondo's position as a wealthy company executive. On the surface, the \"Low\" refers to the slums where poor people and drug-addicts inhabit and where the kidnapper lives and most likely comes from.However, as it turns out, the \"Low\" can also refer to Gondo and his background. During the discussion about how to handle the kidnapping, he reminds his wife about how he had been born of poor and humble origins and has had to work his way up the National Shoe hierarchy by his own efforts. Gondo's background is a factor that can go well over the heads of Western viewers who aren't very familiar with Japanese culture, history, and sociology. In order to understand it, some historical aspects must be studied. The craft of shoe-making, along with other crafts involving leather has been a traditional occupation of the burakumin (outcast) sector of the population.The burakumin, as a people (and as a political/cultural issue) come from the feudal class system, where there were samurai, farmers, artisans, and merchants. There were also two different outcast categories: hinin (\"non-human\"), and eta (\"abundant filth\"). The hinin were involved in begging, street-entertaining, and related occupations. The eta were involved in dealing with butchery, handling the dead, and making leather objects and implements (related to dead animal carcasses). People in these outcast classes were considered inferior, not quite human, ritually impure. They were forced to live in segregated neighborhoods and defer to the \"normal human beings\" around them. Killing an eta or a hinin was not considered a crime because they weren't considered to be \"people.\" During the Meiji restoration, the classes were abolished. The former outcasts were supposed to be welcomed into regular society as \"new commoners.\" Instead of being \"abundant filth\" or \"non-human,\" they were referred to as \"burakumin\" (\"hamlet people\"). However, the discrimination and violence against these people continued and continues to this current day. As the years went by, the scorn and discrimination has become hidden, unmentioned, and kept out of view. Some people have said that they don't even know what a \"burakumin\" is, other than something that relates entirely to historical times. However, there have been secret (now-illegal) lists kept of suspected burakumin families, so that companies and marriage brokers could consult these lists and avoid hiring or marrying a person from this \"outcast\" class. There have been writings and studies circulated that burakumin run most of the violent yakuza gangs and that they even \"cause AIDS.\" Now we get back to the film, HIGH AND LOW. Even though this factor isn't explicitly mentioned, it is strongly implied that Gondo Kingo, the self-made shoe-craftsman who has risen to executive, is a member of the burakumin. He started life as a shoe-maker, a leather craftsman. In Japan, very few people who are not burakumin would enter these leather-crafting professions. No one in the film mentions the burakumin, no one calls Gondo a \"burakumin\" or \"dirty eta\" to his face -- or even openly behind his back. No one would dare. However, one can plainly see a divide between Gondo and the other executives during the entire film. So though Gondo represents the \"high\", he also represents the \"low.\" There is a parallel implication that Takeuchi (the kidnapper), though coming from humble origins, is not a burakumin. So though he is the \"low\", he is also the \"high\" compared to Gondo. There are so many ironies that run through this film.I found this film to be quite compelling. If nothing else, the film is a quality \"police procedural.\" However, it is far more than that. The film addresses issues of individual moral choices as opposed to materialism. It also addresses issues of class, in very subtle and ironic ways; class distinctions are far more complex than simplistic \"high/low\" concepts.",

The film is 2 hours and 23 minutes, so although I say the pacing is fast, it really isn't. You can really see Mifune's height in the movie. In the samurai films he towers but with this, he is a normal 5'9 guy. Trying to make the right decision, whether to save his family from blackmail, or save a little boy's life. Half of the movie is him trying to make his decision, with input from his wife, the investigators and many other characters. The other half of the movie is a film-japan-noir, (idea) trying to find the antagonist in a hay stack. The ride is beautiful, not much more to say. WATCH THIS MOVIE.

All this results in a fascinating drama with scenes that would make Hitchcock proud but the film goes even further through examination of classes and how the poor are largely ignored yet there is great sympathy for the rich. Mifune superbly demonstrates the inner conflict of his character's moral dilemma. Is it worth throwing away your hard earned fortune for a kid you barely know?

            "review_title": "Film Sense",
            "content": "Having seen ten films of akira kurosawa in succession, especially a few wide-screen black and white films, I really deeply realized that akira kurosawa's control of the picture information is how accurate and perfect, his consciousness of the film lens is how insurmountable, and his creation of the film sense is the peak.Watching akira kurosawa's films on the big screen always makes people have an impulse to scream, not for the plot, but for the fullness and depth of the shot. He almost does not allow the picture has nothing to do in any or destroy the existence of aesthetic feeling, on the other hand can always put the message he wanted to use the perfect way to fill the lens, the \"full\" does not mean that the excessive flood, it means that all the space within the frame of precise control, this is especially obvious in his handling of the group of play. For example, in \"chun thirty lang\", every time mitsuaki and other nine young warriors are painted at the same time, kurosawa can use the small scene while ensuring that everyone's expression and expression is completely presented, even when there is a foreground shade is also so. There is a scene in the small barn, the three boats are leaning against the frame in the foreground, the other nine people's faces are just all through the gap between the frames, what a delicate picture control!Watching kurosawa's group plays often reminds me of the Dutch group portraits of the 17th century, especially hals's: the intricate arrangement of the characters, the seemingly random but actually elaborate setting, the precise capture of the expression. But kurosawa's strong control of composition is not only reflected in static images, but also in dynamic scenes. In heaven and hell, for example, the first half of a large number of chamber plays, can only be described as genius. Kurosawa likes to arrange multiple characters into geometric shapes (especially triangles), but at the same time this geometric composition is not fixed, but is constantly changing as the actors move and the camera moves. In addition to the character itself, akira kurosawa and use all the external scene to create the geometry of composition: Windows, doors, the samurai's spear, quilt, fields and so on, the most frequently used, perhaps is Japanese pane and ZhangZi door, no more than that the shape of the attribute fit to participate in the geometrical composition of akira kurosawa. All of this, through his elaborate camera language, is internalized as part of the narrative.Akira kurosawa has a dedication to composition, a deep understanding of the motion of the camera, and a high awareness of the film frame. Akira kurosawa was very fond of placing characters at either end of the picture to highlight the border of the frame; Kurosawa was also particularly fond of using foreground shades or backgrounds to act as frames within frames. For akira kurosawa, the \"frame\" itself is a part of the camera language, representing the character's emotional alienation, fragmentation, confrontation, confusion, and so on. The comparison with hou hsiao-hsien's film is even more interesting. Hou hsiao-hsien's fixed position is well known by the public, and his films often feature scenes in which the characters are drawn and drawn again. For hou hsiao-hsien, what matters is not what happens in the camera frame, but what happens outside the frame. Kurosawa, on the other hand, is so deeply focused on the presence of the film, so deeply aware that what he has created is a world in a frame, and then pushes the world in the frame to the limit.Akira kurosawa was the favourite director in the BBC's 100 biggest non-english films of all time. Interestingly, none of the Japanese film critics voted for him. I don't think it's just a matter of avoiding suspicion. It's that kurosawa, for his cosmopolitan (or, more accurately, western) nature, is not really the best spokesman for Japanese cinema. Throughout akira kurosawa's films, his films contain the obvious western classic narrative. \"Seven samurai\", as well as his many samurai films are influenced by western films, \"chaos\" and \"the throne of blood\" text from Shakespeare, \"the kingdom of heaven and hell\" adapted from the western novels, \"born of desire\", \"rashomon\", \"red beard\", etc., are all can see the influence of western philosophy, existentialism, relativism, humanitarian... Although most of kurosawa's films are set in Japan, it is rare to see the kind of subtle, introversion that typifies the unique aesthetic and emotional expression of the Japanese: he is telling the story of the west in a Japanese shell.However, kurosawa is not a westerner after all, and the western classical narrative he followed is not new in today's post-modern context. So in my opinion, apart from a few classics, many of kurosawa's films are terrible to chew on at the story level, and especially fall into the habit of relying on lines and preaching in the later stages. But movies are not novels, and the reason that kurosawa's films are still classic and still worth watching again and again is not the story, but the lens that tells it. When you see the stunning composition, scheduling, and camera motion of kurosawa's films, you forget the story and become completely immersed in the world of the frame. This may be the uniqueness of a movie that is often talked about but always difficult to define: the \"cinematic feel\"",

The images populate the widescreen frame like a pressure cooker that is ready to blow up. And in High and Low, blow up they do!The opening action is entirely set in Gondo's claustrophobic luxurious house, high up in the hill above the city, overlooking its industrial slums. High and Low tells the story of powerhouse shoe executive Kingo Gondo (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune) battling the greedy board of directors to see what direction the company is going, as he resists their scheme to make a shoddy shoe to buildup profits. On the eve of pulling off the big coup of taking over the company-a proposition that throws him in hock down to his own furniture, he's hit by a huge ransom demand, with a twist -- the kidnapper mistakenly takes, not his own son, but his chauffeur's. Paying the ransom will ruin him financially; not paying it will ruin him as a human being. As Gondo struggles with his dilemma, the movie acquires an almost allegorical profundity, while Gondo is forced to decide between the life of an innocent and fealty to an abstract code. The second half of the film changes moods considerably, as it moves outdoors into the bustling and tawdry metropolitan area and becomes a police procedural film; it becomes nail-biting as it follows through on the money exchange and the manhunt for the kidnappers. As Gondo, Mifune sheds his samurai garb to play the modern-day millionaire in a suit and tie and conveys all the terrible rage of his ambition as well as the indestructible germ of compassion that lives inside him with remarkable effortlessness. But the real hero of the movie is Akira Kurosawa, who weaves together character study, social commentary and police procedure and combines what might have been a whole series of movies for another, lesser director. Nothing compares to the experience of watching a movie where every scene, every sequence, every shot are alive with confidence in the medium. Your complaints with Kurosawa (if any) would dissolve in the backwash of pure film pleasure High and Low offers, as you're introduced once again to the master.",

Working from Eijiro Hisaita's screenplay, based on a novel by Evan Hunter, Kurosawa crafted one of the most meticulous and influential police procedurals in film.The incomparable Toshiro Mifune plays Kingo Gondo, a rich executive of the National Shoe Company. Faced with a restructuring by other executives that would see the quality of their products drastically reduced in order to increase profits, Gondo secretly arranges to buy out the majority of the company's stock and successfully take it over. In order to do so, however, he must mortgage everything he owns. On the evening he is to complete the take over, a call comes to tell Gondo that his son has been kidnapped. He demands a ransom, one which will bankrupt Gondo and end his planned takeover of the company. Willing to pay that price for his son, miraculously the boy walks into the house unaware of anything that has just happened. The kidnappers have made a mistake; they have taken his chauffeur's son. Gondo is now faced with a moral dilemma: Does he pay the ransom and lose out on his company to save the life of another man's child or play hardball? What i have described thus far is the first of two parts in High and Low. It is no spoiler to divulge that Gondo chooses to spend all he owns to save the boy, culminating in a marvelous exchange sequence on a train. This scene was carbon copied in other films, notably Along Came a Spider.The second part of the film is a marvelous police procedural following the hunt for the kidnappers in an attempt to get back the noble Gondo's money. His plan to takeover the company has been revealed, and now with no money he's been fired. Kurosawa was obviously inspired by American crime films, particularly the films of Jules Dassin (The Naked City). He weaves clever ideas placed to out the kidnappers early on, then dives into the pavement pounding difficulty of catching a criminal in a bustling city.Kurosawa crafted his crime thriller so meticulously, planned so carefully, and leads us towards moral conclusions only to subtly pulling the rug out from under us in the final scene. He has one of the most prolific and impressive resumes in film, delivering everything from swashbuckling samurai epics to touching human dramas, and here to hard boiled crime fiction. This was of course not Kurosawa's first foray into the genre - His Stray Dog and Drunken Angel are also excellent films, though High and Low is likely the best.Praises to Kurosawa aside, Toshiro Mifune as well must be applauded. He carried many of Kurosawa's best films. His brooding presence in High and Low is one of the high points. Mifune is able express so much simply by sitting and staring.As far as police prodecurals go, High and Low is one of the best. It's high quality film-making has raised it above the majority of the films it was inspired by. For example, while obviously inspired by The Naked City, a great example of police procedure while not necessarily a great film, High and Low doesn't miss a beat and achieves a whole other level.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's High + Low is an intriguing film that is well thought out, but a tad clumsily executed. The work is divided into two distinct parts, one of which is the tale of Kingo Gondo (Mifune) who is faced with a tremendously difficult decision. A child has been kidnapped, and now the abductor is demanding a great deal of money from him as ransom - money that Gondo himself is in need of in order to stay in business. It ultimately comes down to a classic moral decision: to keep one's money or sacrifice it for the sake of others. Gondo (SPOILER) chooses the latter.The second half of the film, although it continues that plot of the first, is in fact quite different. This is simply because Gondo plays little to no role in it; this is frustrating, for he is the character who we've become involved with and whom we expect the drama to revolve. In place of him, we are abruptly introduced to the kidnapper who is now biding his time in fear of getting caught. The police slowly but surely hunt down every lead to him - which often take them into the 'lowest' parts of humanity - until they finally (SPOILER) catch him.While the film has a great multitude of finally staged scenes - the dropping of the money from the bullet train, the high tension and claustrophobia of Gondo's house, and the drug trade at the bar - he clumsy execution ultimately comes from its being divided into two halves; particularly when the second half does not focus on the character of the first. The fundamental problem with this method is that it creates two narrative arches, and in effect, two movies: we see Gondo's difficult decision and its resolution, there's one film, and then we see the cool depravity of the kidnapper and the police hunt for him which results in his (SPOILER) capture, there's the second.Kurosawa is - being the master filmmaker he is - aware of what he is doing, and what he wants to do is to contrast the high (Gondo) and the low (the kidnapper). This is the fundamental theme of the movie; Gondo, in his house on the hill (a kind of Heaven), makes the morally right decision, and is thus to be commended. The kidnapper, living in the lower city amongst druggies (an unquestionable hell, perfectly represented by the extended bar scene), makes the wrong decision, and thus must suffer punishment. Kurosawa in many of his films makes this distinction between the good men and the bad men, and that though we may sympathize and empathize with the wicked, they are nonetheless different from us and are to be punished.High And Low is a film to be watched for its variety of fascinating visuals, and more especially, the depth and complexity of its philosophy.

            "content": "The movie begins at Kingo Gondo's hilltop mansion in the city of Tokyo. Kingo Gondo is an executive at National Shoes. The board of directors approach him to gain his support to vote out the existing chairman of the firm and also try to lure Gondo by offering him a post. Gondo, who's been in the trade for 30 years refuses to collude with them and rubbishes the idea of making cheaper and lesser durable, yet stylish footwear. After the not-so-gentle men leave, Gondo brings to the notice of his wife and his loyal assistant that he had a plan of taking over the company and that he had raised 50 million yen by mortgaging his property and it would really be a dream come true. Gondo receives an anonymous phone call saying his son had been kidnapped and the kidnapper demands 30 million yen as ransom. Gondo calls the police and explains the situation. The police tap his phone and try to trace the calls, in vain. After contemplating overnight, Gondo refuses to pay ransom as it would shatter his dreams of the owning the company where he started his career as an intern. His wife, the chauffeur and the police convince him that he'd certainly lose his image as a gentleman when people get to know of this and convince him that he has to pay up the cash which would later be reclaimed by the police once they arrest the culprit. The kidnapper asks Gondo to take the second bullet train that leaves Tokyo in the morning and wait for further instructions. The clever kidnapper asks Gondo to make sure no two notes are in succession. Gondo places chemicals that emit a stench when thrown in water or give out pink fumes when burnt, along with the cash in the briefcases . Gondo, aboard the train, receives a call from the kidnapper asking him to drop off the briefcases in which he had kept the cash at a bridge, after which he could come and pick up the boy. He does as instructed.After the boy is safely brought back home, the police start their investigation. They step up the pace at which the case is solved by assigning every man enlisted work for the sake of the nobleman Mr.Gondo. They gather several clues that \"could\" lead to the kidnapper. They follow every single lead painstakingly. The boy recollects the roads on which the kidnapper drew him by the car, a stolen Toyopet. Once the police reach the villa in which the boy was ensconced, they find out the accomplice had died of Heroin over-dosage. Narcotics wing reports that the Heroin was too pure to be smuggled and the purity level of the heroin was the reason for their death. Just as the police assume they had lost all the leads to the kidnapper, they cleverly modify the press statement and publish that they had found out one of the notes that was given to the kidnapper as ransom; that it was spent by the accomplice. They retrieve and reproduce a note that was left behind by the dead and send it to the kidnapper, who they trace was an Intern at the Internal Medicine department in a nearby hospital after seeing pink fumes arise from an incinerator chimney. The kidnapper gets the heroin and tests it on an addict at the Dope Alley and goes to the villa only to get busted by the cops. The police deliver the cash to Gondo, but the bank seeking the mortgaged money shows up first and seal all the articles in his house for auction. The kidnapper gets capital punishment. The movie bluntly ends with the conversation between Gondo, despite facing the man who deliberately ruined his life maintains his composure, and the kidnapper, who goes crazy and doesn't reveal his real intentions behind the kidnap.Akira Kurosawa has shown yet again that only a great director can put words to action. I was just amazed by the way in which the expressions on the face of Gondo's wife change were captured in a single frame. Kurosawa has created the character Gondo as a hard-working, short-tempered and too kind-hearted to inflict pain on others, be it his chauffeur or his factory workers. Kurosawa has shown what simplicity and hard work actually mean through Gondo- how he was willing to \"start all over again\" and \"wouldn't mind to live in poverty\". Toshiro Mifune has done justice to the character by giving it his best.",

That time I was stunned with the last scene so much that I could not help sitting with the same pose with the protagonist, acted by Mifune Toshiro.Then 44 years later, I saw it again, after having many experiences and knowledge such as politic struggle in company, as a resident of Yokohama, the locale of the movie.Much more than the first time, when I was in adolescent age, I could fully enjoy it as Kurosawa's masterpiece entertainment movie. From the beginning to the end, it keeps excitement and unpredictability; the quality of screenplay, which applies to all movies of Kurosawa, is outstanding this time too.Compared to the reality and elaborateness of detective story part, however, the performances of company executives in the company politic struggle is more like a manga than reality. The plot is well made, but perhaps, the biggest problem is that Mifune is not good at such delicate and complicated politics performance.",

            "content": "So what do you get when you combine one of the finest directors who ever lived, Japans most charismatic actor and a terrific Ed McBain influenced storyline? Sometimes a dream line-up can let you down, especially if you watch a movie with high expectations, but this movie certainly did it for me.The plot is so damned clever I'm astonished that Hollywood hasn't tried to remake it - after all, they've remade nearly everything else Kurosawa did, several times over. The plot has been expertly summarized by others here, but suffice to say its clever, convoluted, and packed with great ideas. It is masterfully executed by Kurosawa. The opening sequence, all shot in one room in a beautiful house overlooking a grim industrial city is brilliant. It moves from here to a train scene that even Hitchcock couldn't match, then on to a police procedural and a gripping climax. And the ending is a lesson for so many film makers in how to round off a story in a satisfying manner, while leaving your head buzzing with ideas. The movie is long, but I wasn't bored for a second of it.As always with Kurosawa, the metaphors are heavy-handed - the repeated emphasis of the beautiful modernist house overlooking the hellish, slums and industrial areas below. But the film is not simpleminded, it has multiple layers, with brilliant repeated use of reflected surfaces (streetlights on car windows, flowers on mirrored sunglasses, faces superimposed on a prison visitors window) to emphasize the story.A feature that many overlook is the scene where Mifune sits and works on the bag, telling everyone that he started out as a humble shoemaker. In Japanese society any leather-worker belongs to the Burakumin - the lowest strata of society. So his character is not just a hard working blue collar boy who made good, he is completely self made, someone who has transcended his origins - which doubles the irony of the hatred felt for him by the jealous sociopathic medical student who tries to destroy him.Another point that impresses me about Kurosawa is the way he creates a physical geography in his movies. Virtually all directors select and create sets to simply illustrate a particular scene for effect. But Kurosawa stitches his scenes together in such a way that we understand the physical geography of the area the film covers. In Seven Samurai he painstakingly set out the geography of the village, showing us in intimate detail how it could be defended. In High and Low he uses brilliantly selected settings to show us clearly the physical proximity (and separation) of the good neighborhood from the grim poverty stricken city below - and furthermore how the police use scraps of the kidnapped child's memories and visual and audical clues to find out the kidnappers hideout. I can't think of any other film maker who has done this so successfully.Bottom line: This is a gripping, beautifully shot movie that blows away most contemporary thrillers. Unmissable.",

In the opening scene of the film, shot from above, the cityscape of yokohama, a city that has been devastated and rebuilt by earthquakes, wars, and twice, kurosawa's choice of location was not an accident. In the 1960s, Japan gradually began to recover its economy and bid farewell to the bitterness and depression of wartime life. Akira kurosawa began making a series of socially problematic films in the 1960s, echoing earlier films such as the wild dog and the drunken angel. After the opening credits, we came to the home of quan teng, a shoe company. The villa was fully western-style, luxurious and elegant, and equipped with modern electrical equipment (air conditioning was still an extremely rare item in Japanese society at that time). A low Angle shot from the top shows mitsuhiro mifuna, who plays kwon teng in a close-up. He is playing a business game with the company's directors. The other directors demand that the quality of the goods be reduced and the cost reduced, but kwon teng opposes this. In this scene, kwon teng comes to the floor-to-ceiling window of the living room and opens the glass door. At this moment, we find that the original scene at the beginning of the film is a subjective shot from this Angle. The contrast between \"high\" and \"low\" is clear.",

I thought the film was highly rated because its emphasis on crime investigation,or at least appears to be.The film is not about the investigation, it's about the moral value of a person which triumphs over class discrimination.Gondo is a director of a company, who comes from nothing and stands to gain almost everything, yet gave it all only to save someone from which he'll never gains any benefits from.Takeuchi is the exact copy of Gondo yet envies him and has let himself go down to the opposite path of Gondo, killing three people and kidnapping a children to get back at the world because he felt the world owed it to him.In the end, Takeuchi realized his own failure where as Gondo took the opportunity to start over doing things that he loves.It's a classic motive. The moral value of a person although might affected by their own class and their worldly possesion, has no final say on who he is at the end of the day.It's almost like this film is a counterargument for the Parasite (2019) film because in that movie, we can see how absolute power corrupts absolutely.

What I like most about this film--besides the gorgeous wide-angle compositions--is the deliberateness of it; Kurasowa never rushes as he follows the police tracking their quarry, a refreshing change of pace from the frenetic quality of so many movies today.",

After the ransom is paid, the detectives scramble to identify to kidnapper and promptly arrest him.Unlike Kurosawa's other adventures, High and Low feels more down to earth than his legendary samurai battles. But his deviation shows he is a successful filmmaker in multiple genres.The cinematography starts like the film Rear Window in which all of the suspense is conveyed within the confines of house overlooking a city. The threatening phone calls are enough to transform just another evening into a high-stakes emergency. Throughout the second half of the film, the cinematography is like a documentary, as of to make the story feel journalistic/news-worthy. However, the most convincing reason for the shaky-cam moments seems to be to simulate the sensation of being...high and low.My favorite scene was the ending confrontation. It felt like there was a lot to unpack with the hero and villain face-to-face for the first time. The kidnapper reveals scraps of his backstory to finally contextualize the mysterious kidnapping, while degenerating mentally. Neither of their faces are shown, just their reflections, possibly suggesting a sort of parallel between the two. It's really a scene worth rewatching.My only major question was why did the plot digress to explain the internal conflict within the shoe factory in detail? Maybe to cast suspicion on the coworkers; I don't know.",

Akiro Kurosawa always does what he does best and this is no exception. Let me take you through the plot without getting into any spoilers.The first half or so shows us the high of the movie where emotions of a group of people inside a household takes turmoils. Our protagonist specially, his wife, more importantly his driver and of course the right hand man. How naturally those \"meticulously to the point\", emotions pour out is the master's work. He on the other hand is extremely well complimented by the actors. This first part to me in incomparable to any like movie situation I have seen earlier. In here we are shown that a top business man at that exact point of his high business life where he can control all, is informed that his child has been kidnapped. The kidnapper asks for an unimaginable sum of money. This unimaginable sum is the key to his future business success. The twist is, the kidnapper made a mistake and took the child's look alike friend, the driver's son instead. And thus starts a drama so well conceded, words, will be not enough to describe. I cannot say any more without taking away any thrill you may get when seeing this, so.... See for yourself.The low is the second part. This period can be best described as a thorough police work to catch the criminal ever documented onto a movie screen. Nothing is dramatic here, just routine, yet awe- inspiring. I found out the low was the longer period of the movie but was unable to find which is the better of the two.In the end it all comes down to haves and haves not, as seen through the eyes of a common man. Yet, the question is, did the common man do what was required, to get to the category of the haves. You can answer that once you have seen this ....The newcomers here like Tsutomu Yamazaki had a flowering career ahead after this. Tatsuya Nakadai, the perfect actor, did perfectly, the job of chief police investigator and planner. Nothing is required to be said about Toshir\u00f4 Mifune. 10/10 is my verdict.",

Toshiro Mifune plays a shoe-company executive who ransoms his chauffeur's son, who was mistaken for his own son by the kidnapper. Mifune thus loses the capital he needs to beat back a cabal of greedy colleagues fed up with his refusal to cheapen their products to increase profits. Instead of taking control of his company, he loses everything. As his life unravels, the police launch a full-bore offensive to catch the kidnapper, even after the boy is recovered unharmed.

I loved the first 5 Kurosawa films I watched (with Seven Samurai and Ikiru being my top favorites), but now this takes the cake for being my new favorite Kurosawa film. With my favorite genre being crime thrillers, this one felt real special to me. Everything about it was just so brilliant and perfectly crafted, it blows my mind how Kurosawa had such an amazing consistency of the quality of his films, ranging from all genres. Kurosawa's main actor, Toshiro Mifune, absolutely killed it in this film, and only seeing in Samurai roles (Yojimbo, Seven Samurai) this was a pleasant surprise for me to see his acting range, because I've only seen him played samurai characters. I really felt for his character and the toll the main ransom took on him, his family, and his business. What I really loved about this film was the three episode structure in this film. The introduction with Mifune and the ransom, the second act with the detective work, and the final chase were all just great acts with incredible tension in each one. The dialogue in this movie was constantly engaging, elevated by fantastic performances by the whole cast. And the direction is nothing less than perfect by Kurosawa. Not as epic in scope compared to his Samurai films, but I loved seeing his expert framing of shots and staging of his characters in the city setting. The whole train sequence was done beautifully. What I also love in these Kurosawa films is the humor in these films, very witty and let's the audience relax especially because the films are so high of tension and drama. High and Low is now a new 10/10 in my list of films. Definitely check this film out if you love foreign cinema, crime thrillers, or just good cinema in general. I'm really excited to check out more of Kurosawa's non samurai work.",

The story may seem a bit predictable at first but Kurosawa swiftly turns it into a meaningful, immersive quest. Toshiro Mifune brings in his usual intensity and a unique sensitivity, unlike Kikuchiyo (Seven Samurai) or Yojimbo, that is so human. What an actor. Also a delight to watch Tatsuya Nakadai who mesmerised us in Harakiri, as the lead cop. He displays a calm, sincere demeanor and persists with the clever kindnapper's chase with inspiring sense of grounding - a great front end to the police procedures that we often don't see in such films. As a matter of fact, we often iconize bad policemen and disregard many who do their duties sincerely - because they simply followed the norm. On a side note - a bit surprised to see another great actor Takashi Shimura in a very small role. As usual, some scenes would stay with you for a long time - such as the comment made by a deputy policemen on the way Mifune's house appears so prominently on the hill and the scene of Mifune working in the garden after the boy was rescued. Of course, the intense ending scene and articulating the meaninglessness of everything we saw thus far, the fagility of our values and ideas of life. To me, the film felt better after I finished watching it - the reason could be that, it made me think about our life's pursuits, the conventions we hold so close to our heart...

The police procedural aspects are quite interesting, but mostly because they use methods that now seem old-fashioned and because they are Japanese policemen.However, I thoroughly enjoyed the second part of the film, with a lot of scenes filmed outdoors (shot on a train or driving around the seacoast). I thought the cinematography was beautiful and the scenes also provided a glimpse into Japan in the early sixties, including nightlife in Tokyo, with foreigners and 'trendy' Japanese people.

The legendary Toshiro Mifune plays a wealthy shoe manufacturer who gets involved in a complex kidnapping.  The pacing fits the narrative perfectly---\"Sanjuro,\" another Kurosawa film, seemed like it was longer and it was more than forty minutes shorter.  Watch \"Tengoku to jigoku\" and be captivated.",

High and Low has an amazing premise and philosophical dilemma at its core. It is shot with subtlety and nuance with expert blocking as if watching a play. the acting is superb with all the characters having strong motivations and with the audience easily being able to see what a certain character is thinking at any given time. The first two acts are magnificent but the third act has a long prolonged scene throughout the streets of Japan that feels tedious but the final scene more than makes up for it. The film is not for everyone but if you are a fan of Kurosawa's other work you should give it a watch to see a new side of the incredible director",

            "content": "I got interested in High and Low after hearing that Bong Joon-Ho was inspired by this film when making Parasite. And indeed, this was another great film about capitalism and class disparity. And like all effective critiques, High and Low simply provides a viewpoint and an observation, allowing the audience to find meaning from it. I enjoyed the subtle characterization of Gondo that breathed authenticity to the movie. The class conflict, in seemed, was not only in the main narrative but also within Gondo's mind: Gondo the poor shoe-making apprentice vs. the selfmade capitalist businessman. One noble and empathetic, but the other ruthless and daring.And here's a hot take: it turns out that an old master is, in fact, a master in his art. Through Kurosawa's directorial eye the movie comes to life like a choreographed stage play, at times supported by subtle but effective camera work. He positions every single actor just perfectly so that every frame outlines the events going on. Even the emotional states and the relationships of the characters are visually communicated through the blocking, and Kurosawa can do this whether there are 2 or 20 people on the screen. I honestly can't think of any other movie that uses the technique so well, if at all.The actors too, are all great. The characters in High and Low are molded from rather antiquated archetypes, such as the \"honorable nobleman\" or the \"tenderhearted housewife.\" Sometimes when I see such obvious archetypes I roll my eyes, but the acting brought these characters to life and injected much heart and drama into the story.The only issue I have with the movie is that somewhere in the middle, it sort of changes its tone. The first part is a tragic chamber drama and the second part is a police procedural noir. And while these chain of events make sense logically, it's like watching two separate movies, and the transition doesn't feel seamless. But this is probably a nitpick as I thoroughly enjoyed both parts anyway.",

As an adult, I have a strong affinity for the Ed McBain 87th Precinct police procedural novels.  I was astonished to see that the film was actually a very stylized adaptation of one of McBain's novel, \"A King's Ransom.\" Though the film plot and venue depart rather rapidly from McBain's story, the film sets itself apart as yet another masterpiece in the Kurosawa oeuvre.  Whereas McBain wrote his story in the truest of \"pulp fiction\" styles, the film is artistic, spare (compare with \"Seven Samurai\"), and deeply compelling.  Kurosawa's many collaborations with lead Toshiro Mifune have always been splendid examples of film craft.  This film, with its poignance and frequently scathing social commentary (\"haves\" vs. \"have nots\"), sits firmly in the pantheon of great (and highly underrated) filmmaking.",

            "content": "Kurosawa was known as a great humanist, and ethical questions clearly play a central role in each thread of the plot. Kingo Gondo (played by Toshiro Mifune) is a director on the board of a company called National Shoes. He is approached by three other directors, who want to overthrow the current president, and start producing a new line of shoes. Gondo agrees that the president is old-fashioned, but he rejects the shoes they show him as shoddily made. He ejects them from his house, only to get a phone call from a kidnapper who claims to have taken his son. His son turns up, but his friend the chauffeur's son is gone. Even after the kidnapper realizes his mistake, he insists that the ransom still be paid. Gondo had been planning to use the money to fight off the take-over bid, so the police immediately wonder if the other directors have orchestrated the kidnapping in order to deprive Gondo of the cash he needs to stop them. The chauffeur, Gondo's wife and the police are all reticent to put too much pressure on Gondo to pay the ransom, but it is clear he must make a choice: to save the boy or fend off the take-over.In the second half, the police investigation is driven on by their sympathy for Gondo and their desire to see the culprit punished for all of his crimes. There is also a class struggle subtext with Gondo living in a quiet mansion on a hill and the kidnapper in a tiny room below.The cast of High and Low was truly star-studded. Mifune, Takashi Shimura, Isao Kimura and Minoru Chiaki were among the Seven Samurai, and the lead detective here Tatsuya Nakadai had a leading role in both Sanjuro and Yojimbo. The kidnapper is played by Tsutomu Yamazaki who would go on to star in Juuzo Itami's Tampopo. Future Mito Komon lead Eijirou Touno even has a cameo as a factory worker.The film is in black and white, but Kurosawa has a wonderful eye for arresting visuals, and the story is tense and absorbing to the end.

So when I say it might not even crack the top five best films from Kurosawa, it's not a knock on this particular movie but a remark on how good the director's filmography is. \n\nThere's a lot to like about High and Low, first and foremost hinging much of the plot on a moral decision; you get to know these characters just enough to get a sense of their lifestyle, before the script dangles it all on a razor's edge, all the hopes and ambitions of one man's entire life suddenly are rendered insecure as his base morality is called into question. And subsequently, you get to see the relative fallout from his paradoxical choice; despite making the right call, the demands of conservative Japanese society end up resulting in real penalties for him regardless. But while the film could have been a tighter, perhaps more pointed classic if it were to focus only on Mifune's tortured Gondo, the script evolves into a pure investigative film, revealing the identity of the culprit but allowing the audience to take part in the series of incremental clues that gradually tighten the net around him in a pseudo-Hitchcockian manner. While that sort of dynamic could have easily slipped into 'a tale of two films', the direction keeps the plot grounded and appropriately interwoven, capped by some great ground-level shots of semiurban postwar Japan. \n\nWhile not as overtly philosophical as many of the period pieces that Kurosawa is most often associated with, High and Low still showcases much of the attention to detail that he is known for and gives a bit of depth to his more traditional subject matter, allowing him to work with pure thriller elements in addition to moral qualms.

I love how attentive and alert the camera work is. It makes everything seem much more thrilling and interesting than it really is. It's intriguing to watch how these plots between powerful people are concocted. They're literally just lounging around in Gondo's apartment plotting to overtake the company president. Gondo, the head of factory, seems to be getting a good deal, but you never know if the other three can turn around and blame him if anything goes south. I admire Gondo's virtuous values of honor, honesty and integrity towards the shoes his factory make. He's not willing to downgrade quality just so all the execs can put more money in their pockets, I respect that. Unbelievable how greedy and selfish those three execs are, saying that they will take Gondo out if he doesn't play ball. Wow, the is an incredibly captivating way to start the movie - full of intensity, tension and drama. It puts us right in the middle. The setup is impeccable. \n\nI love how Gondo's kids are playing outlaw vs. sheriff - perhaps foreshadowing how the events between Gondo and the execs are going to play out. Ok wow, my opinion of Gondo has kind of changed. He's risked everything, bet everything - something very dangerous and reckless - on this one business deal with someone who we don't even know yet. So cool seeing Nakadai as Chief Inspector Tokura. I feel like Kawanashi, Gondo's right hand man, might be somewhat involved or is going to be involved when he leaves to go to the airport, in the kidnapping that's taken place. I can't imagine how hard this whole situation for Gondo is. On one hand, he's got the money to pay for the kidnapper's ransom, but on the other hand it's the same money that he's going to use for the business opportunity. It's a very interesting situation because the child they kidnapped wasn't Gondo's, it was his helpers son, Aoki. So now this moral dilemma comes into play of will he or won't he save Aoki's son. I wonder what actions Gondo will take. Is he willing to sacrifice everything on saving someone else's child? \n\nHoly shit! Things get intense on the train. Duuuude, with all the passengers on the train and the hand held camera, it feels legit. Sooo good! Dude I can't believe he threw out 30 million yen out of the window without even knowing if they're going to keep their word! Ok this movie is fucking brilliant. The first half of the movie was all inside the apartment. Now we're traveling around, exploring adventuring. This is truly a pleasant surprise. I thought the whole movie was going to take place in the apartment. That shot of everyone watching the filmed footage that was taken on the train has great meme potential. What a great shot. I don't know how I knew, but I knew that they were going to show the pink smoke with actual color. That's crazy! That club scene with all the Americans and the funny black guy was so unexpected. Lol. That was pretty ballsy how they did the drug handoff right in the middle of the dance floor as they were dancing. That whole club scene really changed the mood of the entire movie at that point - sort of livening it up and adding some fun into it. Wow, that Dope Alley scene was pretty terrifying and quite sad. Seeing all those strung out addicts just looming around like zombies. Kind of scary. I'm glad justice was served in the end. What a powerful ending. That final performance from the guy who plays Takeuchi was so good. And the way he gets dragged off and the gate closes right on Gondo's face and all we see is his reflection was finale perfection. I liked how we get a glimpse into Takeuchi's backstory. It sort of solidifies why he did what he did. But at the same time it doesn't excuse him of the crimes he committed. The man was sociopathic and what he did was malicious and evil. \n\nThis is perhaps one of Kurosawa's most modern-looking movies he's ever made - and it looks outstanding! You can tell by the cinematography and how the story unfolds, that this is a brilliant movie. The whole journey Gondo goes through is a trial of morals, ethics and doing what's right. This movie proves that you don't have to film in dozens of different locations to make an exceptional film. If the writing is solid and the acting is true, that's all that matters. This is very similar to 12 Angry Men and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest where both take place within the same location for the majority of the movie, and both are masterpieces of cinema. The way Kurosawa used actors to kind of frame or block shots was so good. The lighting is subtle and underrated, you would never notice how exquisite it was if you weren't looking for it. Like the way Gondo is sitting in the background and all you can see is his silhouette. One of the most exemplary things about this movie is that you feel like you're there, in the middle of everything, taking part in everything that's going on. Every decision, every thought. This movie proves that not every rich person is a selfish greedy monster. The first half is all about getting Aoki's son back while the second half is the procedural detective work trying to nab the kidnapper and return the money. A brilliant detective thriller movie. It was a great ride, I wouldn't mind taking it again.",

Naturally, the desire to uphold his wealth and status force him into conflict with ruthless competitors and a disgruntled craven; If not for the flashy injection of American consumerism, the film could've easily been another one of Kurosawa's feudal epics.  An undeniably committed film; dutifully relevant today as a  spiritual predecessor to the greatest film of 2019.",

Sometimes the viewer can predict what's coming in the next moment. The corporate capitalist culture, where a guy is willing to let a kid die to cement his own ambitions and doesn't seem too ashamed of it, is depicted fully formed. The second half (so, 60%), out in Yokohama, is much free-er and much more interesting. The train scene is as good a piece of filmmaking as you'll ever see, and the dancehall scene is excellent too. \n\nThe performances are top-class throughout, though my favorite Shimura doesn't have enough of a role (whine, moan).",

Toshiro Mifune is off the charts in the early scenes as he shows a full range of emotions and you can feel the dilemma tugging at his heart. Then it shifts to the police and we get to watch one of the most thorough procedural dramas ever captured on film. You could legitimately run an entire police investigation with no experience if you used this film as a blueprint.

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is counted among the best directors in the world. Best known for Seven Samurai to American audiences, High and Low also deserves a lot more attention here. This is a film about a kidnapping, but it is hardly conventional. You think the film is heading in one way, only to veer off in a totally different direction. The film starts with the machinations of a business takeover, only to veer into a kidnapping story--and by the way, setting up the the best red herring ever seen on film. So now, you think the film is going to be about rescuing the child, but the child is recovered halfway through, and suddenly the film is a police procedural.\n\nMuch of the tension in the first half of the film is the result of the film veering off into a different direction. Businessman Kingo Gondo has just mortgaged everything he had in fund his takeover of National Shoes when he receives a phone call from the kidnapper demanding most of that money in return for his son. But then it turns out the kidnapper took the wrong child. Nevertheless, the kidnapper still demands the same ransom, setting up a fascinating moral dilemna for Gondo. It is one thing to break oneself for the return for your own child, but quite another to do it for someone else. The decision Gondo has to make is not easy, and the film does not hold back here. Gondo decides to pay the ransom, and as it turns out, it does break him. Though Gondo earns a great deal of public goodwill, goodwill doesn't pay the bills. Most of the ransom money is recovered, but too late to save Gondo. It's a moral theme we've seen before in Seven Samurai--the duty of the powerful toward the helpless, even at the cost of one's life or financial ruin. \n\nWhen the film turns to the police procedural, we get a reminder that police could solve crimes without relying on DNA testing. A lot of it is footwork, such as testing which phone booths have the best view of Gondo's living room. Science helps by leading the police to the accomplices, though too late. They amass enough evidence to convict the kidnapper, but the police use good old-fashioned trickery to also convict the kidnapper for murder. Interestingly enough, the police remain all too human here. They want to get the kidnapper for murder as well, but not because they cared about those victims, who were, after all, just drug addicts. That they were murdered doesn't really matter to them. They only have Gondo's suffering in view. The kidnapper, Takeuchi, was brilliant in the planning and execution of the kidnapping, but ultimately was no match for a police department focussed on bringing him in.\n\nTakeuchi's motivation is never fully spelled out, and this is to the film's credit. He had a hard life living under Gondo's hillside house, but Takeuchi apparently never knew Gondo personally. It seems that Gondo's house on the hill, overlooking the city like an overlord and having the comforts of wealth was enough to make Takeuchi hate him. But Takeuchi was a highly intelligent, extremely self-disciplined medical intern. A few years hence, and Takeuchi probably would have been as well off as Gondo. Gondo himself had followed that route, though in his case, he was helped by marrying rich. Nevertheless, Gondo and Takeuchi are in many ways the flip side of the same coin, a fact emphasized in the final scene where their conversation takes place with the reflection of the speaker superimposed on the other. \"Must we hate each other?\" Gondo asks. The question remains unanswered, but the social commentary inherent in the question speaks volumes.",

He has dedicated his life to National Shoe Company and is on the board of directors.  When three other members of the board of directors want to recruit him to vote an older man off the board to make cheaper shoes to reap more financial reward, Gondo rebuffs.  Gondo visualizes a quality shoe that would not return much profit in the short term but eventually in time, show great rewards while saving the company.  This angers the other members as they leave his house in anger.\nGondo then reveals to his wife and closest associate that he has slowly been buying stock in the National Shoe Company and has just mortgaged everything for 30 million yen to buy more, he would then have 48% of the company's stock.  But before he can carry out this plan he receives a phone call stating his son had been kidnapped and they are demanding that very same price.  Gondo is quick to want to pay the ransom to get his son back before he realizes that the kidnapper kidnapped his chauffeur's son instead and now he has reserves about paying the ransom.  Eventually after a lot of discussion and guilt he agrees and the kid is returned to his father.  \nThe first hour of the film all takes place inside one room in Gondo's large house before going to different locations around the city as the police, who feel bad for Gondo because he's now in debt, start to look for the kidnapper to bring him to justice.\nA masterfully told crime drama that moves quickly.",

In two wildly different acts the film manages to be both a complex morality tale and police-procedural thriller. \n\tThe first act watches like a domestic drama. We never leave Gondo's home, but it is in this seemingly claustrophobic setting that we witness Kurosawa's brilliant use of space and increasing adeptness with widescreen composition. Watch how he places his characters: the police passively observing as the chauffeur finally breaks down and begs Gondo to save his son; and Gondo backed into the far right of the screen, writhing against the window in the knowledge that the moral imperative of saving the child will ruin him; the frame is so packed with kinetic characterization that we seem to feel movement despite a static camera. \n\tIn act 2 we really start to move and are reminded of Kurosawa's masterful use of tracking shots to plunge into the unknown. Much like the penetration into the forests of \"Rashomon\" and \"Throne of Blood,\" the camera freely roams about a different type of jungle: the slums below Gondo's stately home as we follow the brilliantly systematic police force in their quest to find the villain. \n\tThe lack of unity and disparate stylistic approaches between the two halves of the film are set up by the title: \"High and Low.\" The disjunct nature of the film gives it it's charm but may also be the barrier that has kept the film from enjoying the same level of acclaim as Kurosawa's more stylistically unified works. This film is loaded: It's an examination of morality as well as a critique of individualism and ambition. It's a head-scratching whodunit and police-procedural potboiler, but above all it is endlessly entertaining.",

One of the handful of modern day films in his oeuvre, Tengoku to Jigoku is ripped from a police procedural by Ed McBain and is as exciting as any AK film gets.  The film breaks roughly into three parts:  1) a serious drama in which businessman Toshiro Mifune tries to defend his way of making shoes by gaining control of the company, in direct conflict with other scheming executives and his disloyal assistant, but is suddenly faced with the fact that he might have to pay all of the necessary funds as ransom when his chauffeur's son is kidnaped in place of his own son;  2) a fast-paced investigation by the entire police force led by Inspector Tetsuya Nakadai that eventually frees the boy and identifies the killer; 3) the final trap and capture of the killer, Tsutomo Yamazaki (later Goro in Tampopo), who stalks the seedy underbelly of Yokohama in mirrored shades.  Kurosawa stages it all in widescreen with some incredible compositions that make the most of the bigger canvass (including wide open landscapes as well as a bunch of cops cramming the screen).  As always, viewers are encouraged to see the drama not only from an objective outside perspective but also from the point of view of other characters who are party to the action (in this case, we see the police view of the actions taken by Gondo the shoe executive as well as hearing what the public thinks).

Interestingly, only the first hour deals with Mifune's businessman and the ransom. The rest is a police procedural as they hunt for the kidnapper. Mifune is unusually subdued here, particularly when coming to terms with the consequences of his choice. It fits well on him. Somehow you can see the fire restrained without ever feeling like it's lessened. His character is so good in fact that the film suffers when he is absent. A few more looks at how he deals with his situation would have helped immensely. Essentially the character study is good, the detective drama is good, but the combination is missing something. Anyway, a good film and one of Kurosawa's best. The flaws are minor ones and hardly ruin the film.",

Mr. Gondo finally resolves to make the payoff and then the police who have been advising him take it from there.

The social commentary is laid on pretty thick, but it never detracts from the plot.\n\nI will say, I enjoyed the first 50 minutes of the film more than the last half. It's very impressive since it almost all takes place within a single room.  It is also when the single most important decision in the film is made, and the emotional impact resonates through the rest of the film.  In addition, the long cuts must have been very difficult to shoot.  The cinematography is equally impressive, without a wasted space.  The second half is a pretty standard detective procedural, but still very well done and keeps you interested until the end with an especially eerie moment in an alley filled with heroin junkies.\n\nGoing back tot he social commentary, I'll finally add, that there's an important point made in a somewhat throwaway line that will probably be lost on a non-Japanese audience.  The Toshiro Mifune character mentions starting off early in a shoe factory and working his way up.  This means he'd have been working with leather, which gives him 'burakumin' (untouchable) status, making some of the moments, statements, and choices a little more poignant.",

It definitely made me consider just how different contemporary Hollywood filmmaking is from this though.  I easily imagined numerous surprise plot twists that could have fit into the storyline at various points over the course of the picture.  Storylines in this genre have become far more convoluted and complex over the subsequent decades.  However, there were definitely films of this era (not sure about from Japan) that had surprise twists.  I think it's more a Kurosawa trait than a Hollywood v. Japan trait, or even a past v. present trait.  Kurosawa isn't interested in a complex plot.  He simply wants to tell us like it is, in a straightforward and conventional manner.  He gives us a rather detailed view into the complex process of tracking down the villain.  I can think of few better (Zodiac would be one).",

I must admit I had high hopes for Yojimbo and Sanjuro, but I was sort of let down both times. They were both good movies but they weren't profound or psychologically thrilling, but High and Low exceeded all expectations I had. This mammoth achievement has great acting, a flawless script (adapted from an Ed McBain novel), and superb direction from Kurosawa. Toshiro Mifune is awesome as Kingo Gondo (gotta love that name), a man troubled by business affairs and a pesky kidnapper who wants 30 million from him. An excellent study of human morality and the extents to which we are value money. The film also feature a solid performance from Tatsuya Nakadai, a police officer trying to crack this case. The script is composed to such a high degree of perfection that it keeps you engaged from the beginning when Gondo says \"So what do you want?\" to the end which shows a very psychologically challenging and emotionally gripping scene. Kurosawa executes the script brilliantly with his pacing and his depiction of the city in wide screen format. The film reminds me a lot of Stray Dog and how interesting the relationship between a cop and a criminal is. This film tops Stray Dog though by a long shot. This is probably the best police procedural film I have seen. The entire movie is a thrill ride with a remarkable ending which is so genuine in it's exploration of human nature, desire, and social mentality that it is neither existential nor happy. Definitely something I'll be coming back to again and again for years.",

I think the movie should have tackled what the decision meant to Gondo more. Maybe even showing a fantasy sequence where he also turns down the ransom (or if really brave, make the ransom paying version be the fantasy). Instead of all of the procedural stuff trying to catch the kidnapper (which wasn't dramatic at all), it should have kept its focus on Gondo and made him perhaps regret his decision once he starts to lose everything. I know that wasn't the director's intent, but if I was able to remake it that's where I'd put the attention during the 2nd half, instead of the procedural stuff on the dramatically boring kidnapper.\n\nNote: I guess I'm looking at it through rose-tinted glasses; I'm sure all of the police procedural stuff was fresh and exciting at the time, but is now just average by-the-book procedure we've seen in movies 100 times.",

Mifune is great as usual, but he is easily matched by Tatsuya Nakadai and Tsutomu Yamazaki's acting, which is rare (Mifune almost always steals the show).

            "content": "Prior to seeign this, I was only familiar with Kurosawa's historical period piece epics. As it turns out, he made many contemporary films as well, this being one of them. This is an adaptation of a work by Ed McBain, who specialized noir fiction. This resulting adaptation is a westernized but Japanese take on film noir, and the results are pretty impressive. \n\nThe story concerns a wealthy industrialist who is planning on trying to buy out his company after disagreements on what direction the company should take. In order to do this, he has put up a considerable amoutn of money, even the mortgage to his home. A short time after a meeting with others bigwigs of his comany, his son goes missing, and he gets a call saying that his son has been kidnapped. It turns out however that the wrong kod was taken, and the caller has his chauffeur's son instead. What follows is a wonderful moral dilemma: either the man can pay the ransom, save the kid and lose everyhting else (his life depends on his job) or save his job and let a kid who isn't his be killed. \n\nOverall, this is a very tense film that not only works as a crime thriller, but also gives great insight into the contemporary (at the time) values of Japanese society and the innerworkings of Japanese law enforcement. This is a long film, and it really feels like two in one, with the first half devoted to dealing with the moral debate, and the second half being a police procedural that follows the efforts to track down the kidnapper and bring him to justice.\n\nThe film is mostly shot in wideshots, with a number of long takes. The beauty of all this is how well this works in getting the audience involved in the situations and really amping up the tension. After a while I barely even noticied that fair amoutns of time passed between cuts. When long takes don't bring attention to themselves, then you know this is a sign that the director is using them for the right reasons, and isn't trying to be a showoff. They actually have power and meaning here. Granted, this is Kurosawa we're talking about, but still. Aside from this though, the cinematography overall is quite well done and the black and white looks great and really adds to the atmosphere.\n\nThe acting is top notch. Long time Kurosawa collaborator Toshiro Mifune is wonderful as Kingo Gondo the conflicted industrialist. Tatsuya Nakadai is good as Inspector Tokura, and Tsutomu Yamazaki is suitably menacing as the kidnapper Ginji Takeuchi. The acting and cinematography aren't the only highlights though, as the whole film is just a real piece of work. It's got a compelling stoary that's well written and conceived, and it brings up some great issues and situations for the characters to deal with. You care about what happens and really get involved in things.\n\nThe only real issue I had is that the film is rather long and seemed to drag here and there at times. I didn't mind it too much because I was engrossed in the story, but yeah, I did start to get a bit fidgety, so it could have been tighter. All in all, this is some really good stuff. I give this a pretty solid recommendation.",

The second half of the film goes into great detail as it examines the ensuing police procedure as they dedicate all their workforce into finding the kidnapper. All this results in a fascinating drama with scenes that would make Hitchcock proud but the film goes even further through examination of classes and how the poor are largely ignored yet there is great sympathy for the rich. \r\n\r\nMifune superbly demonstrates the inner conflict of his character's moral dilemma.

Not that I wasn't aware of his ingenuity bt creations like Seven Samurai & Rashomon had a different quality abt them. Here Kurosawa gets right into the field which Hitchcock mastered over the years,The structural thrillers which owe it's grasp on the viewer due to the editing,deft camera work & razor sharp narration and turns it into a cinematic experience unmatched. \n\nThe movie opens up with Mifune switching on the lights of drawing room of his house and camera sweeps across to reveal what's going to be a setting for 1/3rd of the movie, shot through different angles. It's almost like a stage where characters enter & leave as tension builds up through story as well as visually. The significance of the house doesn't stop there as you'll know when at sm point a detective aftr observing the house, perched high, from the lower ground  remarks..\"That house gets to you...as if it's looking down upon us\".And when film ends you wd know the visual significance of the house.\n\nAnd then one of the best train sequences I hv seen in Cinema that comes right onto u out of nowhere and leads into an engrossing & elaborate third act constituting investigation process and ending in those dark slimy alleys with a mournful tone that cd easily hv inspired WKW's style.It doesn't end there as u expect bcz there comes that final shot in which in one stroke Kurosawa blasts the shallow judgemental world  and unveils the basic nature of crime as superbly as ever.\n\nI can go on & on blabbering and still won't be able to capture every detail.

It's proof positive of Kurosawa's mastery of film and all its imagery.\nThe story was adapted from an Ed McBain \"87th Precinct\" novel, \"King's Ransom\", and is really very simple. A successful businessman (Mr. Gondo) in the middle of a major deal is told his son has been kidnapped. All concerns about money fly out the window...until Gondo learns it was actually his chauffeur's son who was taken by mistake. Doesn't matter; the kidnapper still wants him to pay the ransom, even though it will bankrupt him. Will Gondo destroy his standing in the business world to save the life of a child that is not even his? Or will he just leave it to the police and fate to determine whether the child lives or dies? This makes up the first half of the film.\nThe second half deals with the search for the kidnapper and his accomplices, and it does not shy away from showing how dull and grueling good police work is. Step by step, the cops narrow their field of suspects and build their evidence to link their prey to murder as well as the kidnapping, meaning he would face execution. This makes up the second half of the film.\nIt helps to know that in the original story, the businessman refuses to pay the ransom but does help the police track down the kidnappers. It also helps to understand that in Japan, working your way up from making shoes and satchels by hand to being in a position where you could wind up owning the company is a HUGE accomplishment in a caste driven society. It means he is due additional respect, and this is what Gondo faces losing if he pays the ransom, which is far more important than the fact that he will be driven into bankruptcy.\nFrom the first scene through an amazingly exciting section on a bullet train to the ending moments between Gondo and the kidnapper, Kurosawa shows exactly why he is a master of cinema. To take what is basically an episode of \"Law and Order\" and make it into a meditation on the meaning of life and evil is not something just any film school twit could do.\nTo me, the best moment on a human level comes when Gondo descends the stairs the morning after the kidnapping to explain to the police why he cannot pay the ransom for a child not even his. You can see the man realizing he is allowing himself go to hell in order to protect his family and station in life, and Toshiro Mifune underplays it beautifully...and Kurosawa lets it just simply happen. Wonderful.\nTHIS is the movie Mel Gibson's \"Ransom\" wishes it had been. something real and human and meaningful instead of merely kick-ass. I was gripped by this film from start to end.",

The thing is Toshiro Mifune has such a powerful on screen presence, that when he disappears in the second half, the movie just sort of falters without him.  The movie is still good, but I enjoyed the segments in Gondo's house and how Gondo struggles with whether or not to pay the ransom.  It was actually a really interesting twist to the usual hostage movie.  And again, Toshiro has such a presence on screen, so while he may not be the best actor, you can't help but pay attention to ANYTHING he does.  And the actors who portray the detectives just don't have that presence, so when the movie's second half relies on these detectives, the movie's just not as good.  But as it stands, the movie is still very interesting and very smart piece of work.  I like the portrayal of the separation between the upper and lower class.  Visually, it's a very OBVIOUS metaphor with Gondo's house on top looking down at the poorer houses, but it's very effective and it creates a situation where it could be ANYONE who's trying to extort Gondo.  The last scene was also very strong, with the villain revealing his motivations.  Here's also the thing with this movie.  The ending, seems, to be flat because having been conditioned to expect ridiculous twists, you expect EVERY movie to have a twist.  So it's insanely refreshing (if such a thing makes sense when this movie is almost FIFTY years old) when you see a movie such as this, where the movie just ends.  There's no \"Hey...Gondo did this himself to raise his own standing with the public\", which was a theory I was throwing around.  It wouldn't have made one lick of sense, but it was a theory I was throwing around.  Just the way the main detective was like \"Let's do this for Mr. Gondo because he's suffering\" or variating statements.  He did this every couple of scenes, to the point where I thought Gondo himself did it.  But no, the story ends up making sense in the end.  No silliness.  Anyway, this may not be Kurosawa's finest film, it's still an excellent movie that I recommend.",

            "content": "A film of three thirds. The first third, taking up an hour or so, easily ranks among Kurosawa's best dramas. Toshiro Mifune dominates the screen, as always, but this time playing not a samurai or a cop but Mr. Gondo, a shoe salesman taking the biggest financial risk of his career. Taking out loans against his entire fortune, he plans to buy up the majority of his company and finally make the quality shoes he's been dreaming of for 30 years. Then the phone rings.\n\nAn anonymous kidnapper demands 30 million yen for the safe return of his son. Mifune breaks down and is willing to pay anything, giving up his entire fortune in the process. And then his son walks in. The kidnapper grabbed his Chauffeur's son instead, but still insists on 30 million yen. Gondo must decide whether to sacrifice himself for the safety of the boy. The tensions rise as each family member makes his or her case, but the final decision rests with Gondo alone.\n\nThe second portion can't possibly live up the the first, but it does a damn fine job of trying. After delivering the money, Mr Gondo mostly sits out the film as the police force desperately tries to recover the stolen money and catch the psychopath before he can get away clean. Among police procedurals, this hour ranks pretty highly. The clues slowly start to add up and narrow down the suspects, but not without a few setbacks along the way.\n\nThe third part takes up a mere twenty minutes and could use some trimming. The police discover the kidnapper among the internship at a local hospital, with a flat within sight of Gondo's mansion. They follow him to a nightclub hoping to catch the kidnapper buying a lethal dose of heroin to finish off his druggie accomplices. Several minutes from the nightclub could easily have been cut, but the final scene between Gondo and the intern makes the entire chase worth the wait. So much goes unsaid between the two men that I'm sure I missed something. The pure performance in this scene conveys so much that words couldn't. The motive is understood by both men but not stated bluntly. An excellent ending to yet another Kurosawa masterpiece!",

The title corresponds to the film's two halves (a catch-22 ransom situation and a police procedural), which are distinct yet form two halves of a hell of an impressive whole.  As usual, Kurosawa takes the material of the genre much, much further than most storytellers, and the result is a movie that still feels more original fifty years later than newer, much less ambitious work.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to tear apart bad and awful films, but much harder to praise in minute detail incredible films that have the power to deeply affect you.  A fair number of Kurosawa's films do that for me, as they exploit the tools of the medium to its fullest effect for a thrilling, moving experience that defies words.  One sequence in particular, the Junkie Alley scene (did Spike borrow a little bit from it for Jungle Fever?) is incredibly sad, moving, and yet Kurosawa doesn't give in to sentimentality and keeps his plot on track regardless.  To evoke such a feeling from the material rather than arrange the material to evoke the feeling, and to do it well, is what Kurosawa excels at, and one reason among many that amongst the venerated giants of filmmaking, he really was the real deal.\r\n\r\nYet still, I find myself hard pressed to describe this film at length, so I'll end the review as I began.

And, high or low, each socioeconomic tier bears its own special brand of misery.\n\n\"High and Low\" (or alternatively \"Heaven and Hell\") is certainly filmed well by Kurosawa; he visualizes the underlying themes beautifully. Example: The chauffeur, representative of the working class, is constantly haunched over, eyes groundward, a posture that drips with the emotions of helplessness and despair that Kurosawa wants to bear down so heavily upon viewers. \n\nBut a major portion of kudos is due to the underlying novel by Ed McBain. McBain authored well a lot of high drama, such as \"Blackboard Jungle\" as well as the screenplay for Hitchcock's \"The Birds.\" And it's that drama, as much as Kurosawa's camerawork, that is captivating viewers herein.\n\nThe film does play out in two very distinct acts, acts that feel as though they are almost two different films.\n\nAct I is inside the isolated, pinnacled home of wealthy shoe executive Mifune, as he wrestles with his dilemma, whether to complete his buyout of the shoe company, thereby saving his own job, be positioned to run the company as it ought be run, and preserve the workers and their jobs in the long-term. Or to use the money to pay the ransom for the kidnapped child not his own -  and to ruin himself and let the company fall in the process. Living high, you see, comes with the responsibilities of both modeling appropriate behavior for the rest of society ... as well as acting to ensure its preservation.\n\nAct II is excellent pure police procedural, clever work tracking down the kidnapper after the child safely returns home, peppered with occasional glances back at Mifune, to see how his Act I decision has affected him and his family. It is in this act that the viewer gets the up-close look-see at the sufferings and dilemmas of those who live at the other economic end of society. \n\nBy deep into Act II, viewers are almost sympathetic to the poverty of the kidnapper living in the slums below the windows of Mifune's mansion ... until the kidnapper takes a stroll down Yokohama's Heroin Alley, looking to victimize a nameless, souless, empty-eyed addict as part of his scheming. And by the time viewers walk down that alley with him, they will be finding it quite unclear as to who, of all of these characters, is really the worse off among them. \n\nWatching Mifune wrestle ... and coppers chip away at the crime ... is plenty tasty enough. But watching how those living high, low and inbetween stuggle to survive within their places in society, well that's really the best part of this feast.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Without reservation.",

This half is emotional, tense and personal while still maintaining a suspenseful vibe.

            "content": "Toshiro Mifune really shows his talents in High and Low.  He plays Kingo Gondo, a millionaire who is the executive of a shoe company.  The moment we see Gondo we feel his strength and importance.  Nothing is going to shake this man, he goes by his own rules and no one else's.  Unfortunately, that's just not the case when someone kidnaps his chauffeur's son, even though he meant to kidnap Gondo's son.  Kurosawa takes his time in each scene, building up the characters and the situations.  It really makes the two biggest payoffs feel well deserved.  The tension keeps building and building, but he never really lets his grasp from the audience loose.  Gondo has chosen to invest 50 million in stocks so that he can run the company and move things in a different direction.  He has risked everything for this opportunity.  When he first thinks his son has been kidnapped he freaks out and says he will raise the 30 million that has been requested and will take care of things, but the moment he finds out it's not his son he has to question whether or not it's worth paying the ransom.  I mean, it's everything he has worked for, and it's just the chauffeur's son, so is it really worth going broke for him?  He could keep the money and hope the kidnapper is just bluffing, or he can save the boy's life.  This is really the first time sociological questions come in to play, and they don't leave throughout the rest of the film.  We see that Gondo's home is placed at the top of a hill, and everyone below him is living close to poverty.  They have to look at that all the time, imagining what it would be like in that family's position.  It's really the physical division of rich and poor.  When Gondo says he can't give the money to save the boy his wife gets mad, but he points out to her that she has been rich and spoiled her whole life; she could never understand what she would be giving up by giving away that 30 million.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nReally, halfway through the film we get our first spoiler.  Gondo decides to pay the money, so he goes through everything and pays the kidnapper to get the boy back.  The majority of the rest of the film follows the police trying to find out who the kidnapper was, then getting him on charges that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life (or hang him).  I found this to be a little silly, but still entertaining, seeing as the group that is tailing the kidnapper go together in groups.  Maybe it's too many recent films, but wouldn't he have gotten suspicious pretty quick?  It really doesn't ruin the movie because you could come up with plenty of reasons.  Tailing the kidnapper leads the police through the poorer region of the same city that Gondo lives.  The club where he gets the drugs is crowded and hot.  Then there is a specific place that holds all the junkies.  In here we see a woman who is having withdrawals, and the kidnapper takes her to test the heroin to make sure it is pure enough to kill her.  I think the sickest part of this is seeing the police talk to each other like they know they are heading towards junkie central and they know they are about to head to a whore house.  They're poor, who cares?  The capture of the kidnapper is a little underwhelming, but that's because Kurosawa is saving the best punch for last.  Gondo is told the next day that the police retrieved the money except for 20,000 which was spent on the heroin, and while they are telling him the good news Gondo is getting all of his things repossessed.  He is embarrassed, but his family will make it.  The kidnapper requests to see Gondo and he agrees, and basically we discover that he did it simply because he was tired of looking at his nice house on the hill while everyone suffered.  During this scene there is a reflection on the mirror, pretty much showing that they are both feeling some of the same things; they are man, they are similar.  The kidnapper says the poor like to see the rich go through pain too.  I expected the kidnapper to be tied in with the men at the company who wanted Gondo out, so it was surprising to hear the connection wasn't there.  I think that's the strongest punch of them all.  Kurosawa leaves his audience thinking about sociological differences while entertaining them to no ends with a brilliantly crafted crime story.",

Our hero, who is planning on taking control over the shoe company he works for through some pretty slick negotiations, must put that plan on hold when his son is kidnapped for 30 million yen.  Then the plan is back on when he realizes the kidnapper made off with his chauffer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kid, not his own.  False alarm, guys.  Except here comes the morality bit (and the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest third) in that we have to ask how valuable the life of a human is.  Ten minutes ago, Mifune was ready to pay the ransom despite the fact it would bankrupt him.  But when the victim isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t his own flesh and blood, he starts to ease up.  Dramatics and interesting staging make the apartment where the entire first 42 minutes take place the best part, with Mifune being Mifune (but wearing a shirt this time) and the police assigned to the job trying to track the kidnapper via phone conversations.  The wheels start to come off when we shift to Mifune paying the ransom in a very clever train sequence.  After that, our focus is with the police trying to figure out who did this (we find out pretty quickly) and why (that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit tougher).  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be forgiven for thinking you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve wandered into a second movie on your DVD by mistake.  But then the last third starts and we follow the kidnapper through the drug-infested lower depths of Japanese culture in the 1960s (read: drugs, dancing and making drug deals while dancing).  What should be exciting and engaging is dull, repetitive and downright heavy handed on a symbolic level.  Kurosawa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than this, sure, but when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constantly reminded of the \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009clow\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the title (Mifune lives atop a hill, high above the poor citizens, the street-level drug-laced culture is a living hell, etc.), it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exactly thought provoking anymore.  Then again, this was adapted from a book I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read, so maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even worse in the book and Kurosawa smoothed out the blatant symbolism.  No idea.  But if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out to tear through all the Kurosawa-Mifune collaborations, this is one that can wait.",

In the beginning Kurosawa challenges us to think what is the right thing for Gondo to do, Mr. Gondo gets the sympathy of the media and the sympathy of the audience. But eventually we start to think who actually are the real victims. The way how Akira Kurosawa deals with humanity in this is perfect. He achieves to create new humane experiences for us. I think no one has made as many masterpieces as he has. High and Low challenges us to observe and think. To look at our own morality. Can the world where some people live in heaven and some in hell be even close to justice?

(It is loosely based on a book called \"King's Ransom,\" and \"High and Low\" later helped 'inspire' the Mel Gibson film \"Ransom.\") The basic premise is about Toshiro Mifune who plays an executive that has to choose between the ownership of his company or the life of his son.

While it's his own kid that is the intended target, the napped one ends up being the son of his driver. The kidnapper realizes this, but poses the same ransom regardless. Now the shoe exec has to decide to break his family or let the boy die. This hour is where I degraded my rating a bit. The dilemma is hardly an even trade and it seems false to build a dialogue around it, where all the exec's underlings can placate his wavering integrity.\r\n\r\nRegardless of his deceision, the police still get to spend the rest of the movie hunting for the kidnapper/maybe-child killer. This is where Kurosawa really excels. Remember, this is 1963 Japanese standards, so it's actually quite amazing to see actual footwork and logic carry the story out instead of the usual computer-simulation recreation of events. It doesn't delve into the family issues of the lead investigator; it doesn't feign some secret conspiracy sub-plot- it just goes by the numbers for a large group of men doing a job to piece clues together to single out a individual(s).\r\n\r\nThe direction and acting are very purposeful and exacting without getting over-flashy or stylinsh, for the most part. The exception to this comes when we follow a suspect through the drug dins of Japan to see how a rock and roll dance becomes a very romantic heroin purchase. This is followed by an almost Salvadore Dali-surrealist walk through an addict maze. It's very dark and disturbing and points to the ugliness of our kidnapper in a way that we hadn't seen otherwise.\r\n\r\nTo that end, we get very little of the perpetrator(s) of the crime. The motive, the demeamor, for example. This comes through in the ending with great results. The direction in these scenes is such that we see victims and victimisors reflected within each other.

As Gondo plans a move that will secure his position as the head of his company, he is contacted by a mysterious man who informs him that he has kidnapped his son. The crook demands a high ransom - one that is so huge it will bankrupt him. As Gondo is prepared to pay the ransom, he discovers that his son is actually safe at home and the kidnappers have mistakenly kidnapped the chauffeur's son. As quick as he was to pay off the man for his son, he is reluctant to pay him off for the son of the chauffeur and the question quickly becomes: does Gondo abandon his plans to pay off the man or does he do the honorable thing and help save his driver's son? This moral dilemma is what drives the first half of Akira Kurosawa's thriller which mainly takes place in the spacious living room inside of the Gondo residence full of long takes and a tour de force of acting and directing. The second half however is mainly set in the cramped confines of the city where the kidnapper hides from the police investigation led by the Inspector Tokura, played by Tatsuya Nakadai. The investigation scenes are done with great attention to detail and for the most part are very fast paced, compared to the long takes of the first half. Scenes that come to mind are when the kidnapper is being followed through out the city into a club where there is a crowd of people dancing around and where an exchange of money and drugs is thought to happen. The police, in disguises, follow the kidnapper into a place where many drug addicts are located waiting for a chance to score and soon after finding a dead woman overdosed off of pure heroin the men go back into the streets where the kidnapper is seen by Inspector Tokura and his men in the car speaking with Gondo although Gondo has absolutely no idea that this is the man they are looking for. This scene is one of the scenes where it shows just how much of a fan Kurosawa must have been of film noir. The film ends with the kidnapper confronting with Gondo while being locked up.\n\nWhile it may or may not be one of his true master works it is a fine example of Japanese film noir. It is helped by a fantastic cast that includes Kurosawa regulars Toshiro Mifune, Tatsuya Nakadai, Takashi Shimura and Susumu Fujita. It has great camera work and while the first act is done mostly with long takes, the second and third acts have fabulous editing that give the film suspense and energy. The acting during the scenes in the Gondo residence, along with the police procedurals of the second act and the conclusion of the kidnapper confronting Gondo all adds up to one of the best detective films ever made. Not many Hollywood movies in the genre can compare to it. Just a great film to watch and a must see for fans of film noir and of course the usual Kurosawa fans. 10/10",

It was sparse and helped intensify the atmosphere and gravity of any given situation in the film. Mifune played yet another character-type in this film since his character is very firm, but mostly reactive to other people's decisions. He's very stoic in most of the film, which is unusual to see from him. Tatsuya Nakadai also played a very different character than I'm used to seeing from him, along the same lines as Mifune's. I love the way the detectives work in this film. It's a really terrific mystery that unravels bit by bit and makes it seem like you're there with them; you're hoping to find the culprit just as they are. Great stuff again from Kurosawa.",

            "content": "The title of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 noir thriller \"High and Low\" is both a reflection of the setting in which much of the action takes place in, as well as a portrait of the class boundaries separating the industrial slums from the mansion that rests atop a hill. The film stars the longtime Kurosawa mainstay Toshiro Mifune (Takashi Shimura turns up as well, but in a much smaller roll), and it is arguably Kurosawa's best non-period piece.\n\nKingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is a top level executive at the National Shoe Company, which is in the process of a huge reform to maximize profitability. Although his associates are fine with producing less-than-stellar products, Gondo takes a great pride in his shoes and angrily rejects. Fearing the future of the company in their hands, he plans to become the majority shareholder and keep the NSC from producing poor footwear.\n\nAfter mortgaging everything and arranging a big business deal, Gondo gets a call at home saying that his son, Jun (Toshio Egi), was kidnapped. In actuality, Jun was mistaken for Shinichi (Masahiko Shimazu), the son of Aoki (Yutaka Sada), Gondo's chauffeur. Although Gondo was willing to give up his money to protect the life of his own son, he recklessly calls the police (despite the kidnappers saying police involvement will lead to the death of the boy) and refuses to pay for Shinichi's life. \n\nThe police and Gondo eventually set up a foolproof method of catching the criminals while delivering the ransom money, but they are fooled. Shinichi is back in the hands of his father, but the rest of the film follows the police's pursuit of the kidnapper and Gondo's fortune.\n\nThe first half of the film, dealing with Gondo and the kidnappers, is simply brilliant. Gondo's apartment is filled with a number of people, and each actor plays their roles wonderfully. Gondo's wife chastises Gondo for not saving Shinichi, and Aoki lingers in the backdrop as a nervous and pathetic wreck. When the story shifts to the slums and the cat-and-mouse chase between the cops and the kidnapper, it becomes more of a standard police procedural - however the perfectly realized drug and prostitution culture make it never less than fascinating to look at.\n\nAlthough the second half of \"High and Low\" doesn't reach the brilliance of the first, it's nevertheless a wonderful thriller that criticizes the cruelty of capitalism in a creative and new fashion.",

He is trying to stop his shareholder colleagues from making shoddy shoes. Then his son is kidnapped, and after some unfolding events it turns into a fascinating morality tale.\n\nAfter the tense build up of the ransom and drop, the investigation continues as the police use every method possible to catch the kidnapper. The movie has a slow pace, but an incredible absorbing feel to it. Its almost as if you're in the room with them as they utilize clues and testimonies.\n\nThe movie ends with a final confrontation full of tension. The kidnapper's mirrored sunglasses are used to full effect, and its filmmaking at its absolute finest. Akira Kurosawa makes a tense and methodical crime thriller that explores the depravity, morality, and integrity of human nature.",

            "content": "Kurosawa was long, and accurately, considered the most Westernized of Japanese directors.  Seldom is it more evident than here, in [i]Tengoku to jigoku[/i] (literally translates to \"Heaven and Hell\"), which is actually genuinely based on an American mystery novel.  I must admit that I've never read an Ed McBain novel, though I may have to start here.  This movie is based on the novel [i]King's Ransom[/i], though I have no idea, obviously, how closely.  Of course, Kurosawa has transferred the whole thing to Japan, as I'm not sure he ever set anything anywhere else.  He even works in that most Japanese of landmarks, Mount Fuji.  He works in the bullet train.  This is a very Japanese version of a very American story, and I think perhaps only Kurosawa was capable of doing that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nKingo Gondo (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, of course) is an executive at the National Shoe Company.  The other executives want to take over the company and make poor-quality shoes which will sell more and sell quickly, because they will wear out.  Gondo wants to make good shoes, which will not sell as often but will be worth the price.  He has slowly been buying up stock so that he will have enough to take over the company and run things his way.  However, he receives a phone call saying that his son, Jun (Toshio Egi), has been kidnapped.  However, it is not Jun.  Jun traded clothes with Shinichi Aoki (Masahiko Shamazu), the son of the chauffeur (Yutaka Sada), and the wrong boy has been taken.  Gondo must decide whether to pay the ransom as Aoki begs or to keep up with his plans of taking over the company, which has tied up all of his money.\r\n\r\nWhat I find interesting about the story is how beloved Gondo is by the actual workers of the factory.  The other executives?  Not so fond.  In fact, the workers suggest to the detectives that the executives might be behind the kidnapping.  They themselves wish to help find the missing boy, and public support, once the story is out, is all behind Gondo, and the rest of the executives are shamed.  Women, in fact, are said to be boycotting National Shoes.  This does not stop the machinations, of course, but Gondo is seen as almost saintly in his treatment of workers, consumers, and company.  The detectives, who are just doing their jobs, seem to like him as well, and Aoki assumes almost without considering the issue that Gondo will pay his son's ransom.\r\n\r\nI also like that Kurosawa chooses to show us Gondo's hesitance.  (It also delights me that the author of the original book is credited, in the Japanese, as \"Edo Makubein.\")  Gondo genuinely wants to help Aoki, of whom he is clearly fond.  Certainly Jun and Shinichi are shown to be real friends.  However, Gondo has everything tied up in this deal.  The stock is going to cost him 150 million yen.  He has leveraged [i]everything[/i].  To pay the ransom will take the 50 million yen that is to be his down payment.  Not only will the deal fall through, he will be wiped out.  In fact, Aoki will lose his job--but Aoki cares far less about his job than he does his son, obviously.  Gondo's choice will change things for an enormous number of people, and Kurosawa makes us feel that choice.\r\n\r\nThis is not Kurosawa's best work.  I'm still holding out judgement as to what will be, as there are several important ones we haven't gotten to yet and won't for some time.  (We're only on \"H,\" after all, and two of the most famous ones start with \"R\"!)  However, as with some other directors, even his substandard works are better than the best works of several other directors, and not just your Uwe Bolls and your Michael Bays.  And that right there?  That's the only time you'll see me compare Akira Kurosawa with Uwe Boll and Michael Bay.",

Meanwhile, edge of your seat suspense, tension and drama is heighted by what is NOT being said between characters. Kurosawa's choice of changing the POV from Gondo to Det. Tokura and finally to the kidnapper himself, is bold, risky and masterfully pulled off. This gives us glimpses into each lead's mindset with the two most important being Gondo in his desire to cement a secure future for his family, and the envy driving Ginjir\u00f4 Takeuchi to his crime. Both Gondo and Takeuchi represent the same demographic, and Kurosawa uses these characters to represent the point that we are all the subjects of our environments, and given the right (or wrong) circumstances, we are all capable of unthinkable deeds. This point reaches its dramatic apex in the final scene as Gondo sits across from Takeuchi; with each cut, Kurosawa brings the prior's reflection ever closer to the latter's until, finally, both faces overlap. ...Chillingly brilliant.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is associated with Samurai films a little too much, with the action extravaganza \"Seven Samurai\", the Macbeth-Kabuki Theatre fusion called \"Throne Of Blood\" and his Man-With-No-Name influencing duo of \"Yojimbo\" and \"Sanjuro\", it's not hard to see why this generalisation exists (Can't forget about \"Kagemusha\" and \"Ran\" made at the twilight of his career). But with his films, there was also a real compassion and sentiment which sometimes boiled over (see \"Ikiru\", a non-Samurai film), but when it didn't boil over, the results were particularly amazing. \n\nAfter his \"Yojimbo/Sanjuro\" double bill, Akira Kurosawa took on an Ed McBain novel, and made a fantastic crime thriller and one of the best police procedurals you'll ever see (It's a personal favourite of the Coen Brothers): \"High And Low\" (The literal meaning is \"Heaven And Hell\", but let's not get too picky).\n\nIt starts off (and stays for practically the entire first third of the film) in a large house overlooking the Downtown area of Tokyo. The owner of the house is Kingo Gondo (In another wonderful charismatic-yet-restrained performance by Toshiro Mifune). Kingo has worked his way up through his shoe company (a big deal in social circles in Japan) to the point where he can move enough money around to become the leading shareholder (the other shareholders want him out of the company because he doesn't want to make poor quality shoes for high sales). But before his deal to takeover the company can go through, he gets a phonecall saying that his son has been kidnapped, and to pay the ransom would leave him financially ruined. But there's a twist: The kidnappers took his chauffeur's son instead, but the ransom remains the same. Will Kingo ruin himself financially to save the life of a child who isn't his?\n\nThe second half of the film involves the Police's attempts to find out who the kidnapper was. It's a nice shift from the claustrophobic living room of the first third, into the real world where the Police use all their manpower to figure out every single detail. The procedure is done in a meticulous style that is often missing from crime thrillers made today, as the Police Chief narrow down their targets until they believe they've found their man. But a simple kidnapping charge isn't enough, they want him to hang.\n\nKurosawa's camera manages to capture the spotless veneer of the businessman's appartment, and can contrast it with the dirty stench that permeates throughout the Downtown area of Tokyo, as the areas of \"Heaven & Hell\" are clearly delineated geographically. The performances are wonderful from everyone, particularly Toshiro Mifune and Tatsuya Nakadai as the Police Inspector. It's a fantastic crime drama that lets the plot unravel at its own pace, the Police slowly piecing together the criminal's every step before zeroing in on their man. The ending shows the chasm between Heaven & Hell, and Kurosawa informs that the only way to reach Heaven is to do things the honourable way.",

It starts out as a gripping abduction film with a unique moral twist-- the opening scene of the National Shoes executives reminded me of [i]Ran[/i] -- before warping into an exhaustively detailed procedural that would certainly impress[i] Zodiac[/i] helmer David Fincher. The end result is a sprawling crime drama, easily one of Kurosawa's masterpieces.[/color][/font]\n \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]He has a defnite feel and natural observation for his characters, and it's no different here. The sheer complexity of the film, either in its first of second half, is enough to warrant keeping notes -- it's a brilliant script as always.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[img]http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/29/kobal_highandlow460.jpg[/img]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]Another thing I really noticed here -- perhaps its the 2.35 aspect ratio on the Criterion disc I watched -- is that Kurosawa really manages his widescreen angles beautifully. He can get almost every character in the same shot, utilizing the foreground as well as the background advantageously. It allows less cutting, longer takes, higher drama and another thing I really enjoyed -- very little close-ups. [/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]I keep hearing people knock Toshiro Mifune on these journals, but the guy continues to impress me endlessly. He had the best performance in [i]Seven Samurai[/i], and although his screen time here is very minimal outside of the first hour, he makes it count.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][i]High and Low[/i] was certainly a delightful surprise, as I had little interest in seeing it. The switch from abduction film to procedural got me on the edge of my seat and it's fun to think about the different and multiple meaning of the film's title. Do check it out if you haven't seen it.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]([i]'Ikiru' [/i] Kurosawa, Akira; 1952)[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]I literally just finished watching [i]Ikiru,[/i] and it's definitely Kurosawa's most seemingly personal and strange film that I've seen from him so far. Essentially about the quest for fulfillment of one man, Watanabe (the always great Takashi Shimura), before his inevitable death of stomach cancer, it's the kind of film that feels like as mysterious and masterful as Orson Welles' [i]Citizen Kane[/i], while coming up just short.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]I liked the majority of the first 90 minutes or so -- which can be easily seperated from the final 60 -- but a few things didn't completely work. First off, Watanabe's dialogue feels overwritten. I get that he's supposed to be a stumbling, inconcise kind of guy, but why does he have to say, \"in other words\" every time he feels like he needs to clarify himself? Unless this is a mistake by the Criterion english subtitles, it's doesn't feel natural.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]Secondly, Watanabe's quest for a purpose in last remaining 6 months has its hits (his relationship with a young female ex-co worker) and misses (a night on the town with a friend who feels pity for the sickly city official). Obviously, the entire sequence is well-shot, as is the entirety of the film, but it struck me as an unnecessarily lenghty detour.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[img]http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/07/04/Ikiru_460.jpg[/img]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]However, the final 50 minutes or so of [i]Ikiru[/i] is easily the best stretch of film-making I've seen from Kurosawa -- I'm talking brilliant. Every frame is full of redemption and hope as Watanabe's co-workers sit around his wake, piecing his life together that was a mystery even to his only son. Some of the attendees are touched, some unmoved, some so drunk that they act influenced by his final moments, but have clearly proven these remarks to be hollow when back at work in the very next scene.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]In the end, the result is, even with a few flaws, one of Kurosawa's more deeply-felt masterpieces. With [i]Seven Samurai, High and Low [/i]and[i] Ikiru[/i], he has as extensive and diverse a body of work with just those three films than most directors could ever even hope for -- I can't wait to watch some more.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]By the way, for those of you who fancy yourselves Kurosawa experts (ryanator), do you remember that final scene with the park and the bridge? Didn't that look like the exact same bridge with the polluted river running under it that was featured so prominently in [i]Drunken Angel[/i]? I could be imagining it, but it seemed like the exact same location to me.[/color][/font]",

This film reminds me a lot of Ransom (or should I say Ransom reminds me a lot of this) in that same feeling of high society versus low. Usually it seems that the wealthy are depicted as corrupt and the impoverished as the victim or underdog, and its interesting to see the reverse side.  I think Ransom is better in its pacing and handling of the suspense, in High and Low the transition from the executives conversation to the ransom call seemed a bit strange to me. \r\n\r\nThe primary difference I think between the two films is that Ransom uses the plot to tell the story in an exciting and suspensful way; Kurosawa seems to use it more as a social commentary on Reconstructed Japan. But what is Kurosawa trying to say with this film? That the rich can be moral too? That sacrifice does not go unrepaid? Is he simply showing the stark contrast of living between the two sects of society? I'm not entirely sure, but its still a pretty cool ransom flick.",

Hey guys, let's show the same event over and over.  I don't mind minor repetitions in films, but there is no need to repeat stuff in slight variation *cough, [i]Run Lola Run[/i], cough*, but let's be honest that was just the gimmick to get people to see it.  Oh, and a twist, Matthew Fox's character is a terrorist, yet he is assigned to guard the President of the United States.  Man, that would make his job easy[img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/rolleyes.gif[/img].  Also, Secret Service would never discharge their weapons in a crowd of people like they did unless there was immediate danger.  But let's be fair, I'm not an expert on how the Secret Service works, I'm just not retarded.  Also, it's a Hollywood film where nearly all of the stars of the film are good guys, how do you think it ends?\n\n[center][img]http://whatilove.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/vantagepoint.jpg[/img]\n\n[i]High and Low[/i] was riveting at its best, but at its worst, it is boring.  With a great start, a 15-20 minute lull, and a super ending, it was hardly a chore, yet at the same time, I think some scenes could have easily been cut down to make this 120 minutes instead of 140 minutes.  I'm sorry, but the only reason a film should be over 2 hours is if the movie has more to say and can go the whole runtime without dragging.  I actually watched this over two sittings because during the lull, I had to take a break for a while.  Looking back, if I had known the film was going to finish as strong as it did, I would have finished it in one sitting.\n\n[img]http://cache.boston.com/resize/bonzai-fba/Globe_Photo/2008/07/31/1217549316_8622/539w.jpg[/img]\n\nUntil next time....\n[/center]",
