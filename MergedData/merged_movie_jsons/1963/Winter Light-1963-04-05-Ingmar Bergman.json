            "content": "After watching this film 4 or 5 times over the years, it has moved into the top spot on my Bergman list and is one of my all time favorite movies. There is not a wasted moment in this film.  It consists of one great set piece after another.  What a cast!  Gunnar Bjornstrand gives the best performance of a clergyman since Claude Laydu in Diary of a Country Priest and even outshines him due to the interaction with the rest of the cast. Ingrid Thulin is just outstanding as his former mistress, not only in the long closeup where she bares her soul to Bjornstrand through a letter she has written, but in several scenes where she endures humiliation after humiliation from him in an effort to cut through the wall he has built around his emotions.  We also have the little community of church inhabitants--the cynical organist, the hunchbacked handyman, the stern rector.  Each one challenges Bjornstrand's faith in a different way.  Above all, we have Max von Sydow as a depressed parishioner, looking to the pastor for a reason to continue living and finding none.  As we learn in the supplementary material to the Criterion DVD, Bjornstrand was quite sick with bronchitis during filming and this adds to the credibility of his performance.  This is absolutely a 10 out of 10.  A great,great film.",

            "content": "Clearly Marked Minor SpoilerNattvardsg\u00e4sterna is dominated by Ingrid Thulin's virtuosic performance as M\u00e4rta- the mistress of Pastor Tomas Eriksson who is played with superb control by Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand.It is not a difficult film to watch. It is not particularly gut-wrenching like \"Viskningar och Rop\" can be to some, and is much less ambiguous than works like \"Persona\" and \"Tystnaden\". Very tightly edited, the film moves with measured pace to a conclusion that, like those of Bergman's best films, offers hope for the characters- if they are willing to work for it.As the film opens, Pastor Tomas Ericsson is mechanically performing his duties as Pastor to a shrinking congregation in remote Sweden. Like him, the Lutheran Church he serves is depicted as mechanically struggling to survive. Talk and action by Ericsson and other officials in the back rooms of the church are about collecting the offerings (donations), controlling costs and other mundane issues. The lack of concern over their missions or goals underscores how these men and their church have tumbled into the rut of existing for the sake of existing.God is silent in this film. The silence envelopes and oppresses the main characters of the film because there is no voice of order or authority to drown out the incessant chatter of uncertainty and loneliness in their own hearts. What was mistook for the voice of God was only the echoes of their own pleas for comfort, rationality, and, more importantly, a sense of purpose. Since God is silent, a good deal of this film is about how individuals cope with that silence and, as two characters are able to show, this process of coping can bear valuable spiritual fruit.Beautifully lit and photographed under the guidance of the famous Cenematographer Sven Nykvist, the film intersperses brief moments of simple beauty with long stretches of what I can only describe as magnificent unobtrusiveness. This unobtrusiveness is something one can appreciate in subsequent viewings when there is time and attention available for studying the film visually- it is the unobtrusiveness of near-perfection where scene after scene is believably and consistently lit so that the characters stand out in luminous clarity. We are, thus, able to forget that we are watching film and concentrate on the characters, their words, expressions, and actions.While Bj\u00f6rnstrand's Tomas Ericsson may be what one thinks of as the main character in this film, Ingrid Thulin's uninhibited performance as M\u00e4rta is, by far, more gripping. The disciplined stiffness of the Ericsson character is very competently handled by Bj\u00f6rnstrand- I can think of no better actor for the role because Bj\u00f6rnstrand is so able to make Ericsson's mask of indifference ooze with the character's true inner pain. However, M\u00e4rta, Ericsson's mistress, is far less inhibited than he is and her portrayal provided Ingrid Thulin with far more range which Thulin exploited in one of the greatest performances of her lifetime. Frustrated, hopeful, affectionate, and starving for affection, the M\u00e4rta character injects the film with the human warmth and life that makes it work. Her pain and struggles are not those of the audience, but they are portrayed so believably by Thulin we cannot deny them.About one-third of the way into the film we are treated to one of the great sequences in movie history- M\u00e4rta's letter to Thomas. He starts to read the letter and the film cuts to M\u00e4rta reciting her letter to us . In two long takes interspersed with a brief flashback, Ingrid Thulin addresses the camera so naturally and believably that she is clearly speaking to us. Add to this the before-mentioned magnificent unobtrusiveness of the cinematography and the sense that she really is speaking to us- the viewer- becomes eery. Furthermore, what she has to say is, at least, for mainstream media, thought-provoking- even touching. M\u00e4rta's hope and openness contrast to Ericsson's closed bitterness. His case seems hopeless since he seems, like another character, to have lost hope entirely. As unsympathetic a character as he is with his rudeness, whining, and selfishness, we still see a glimmer of hope for him in the end of the film. ((((((MINOR SPOILER)))))) He stands at the end of the film delivering a sermon to a church empty of all but M\u00e4rta.((((((End Minor Spoiler))))))Some viewers have expressed the opinion that the ending is distressingly pathological, that it represents Ericsson trapped in the empty and meaningless rituals of living. I see it as him being resolved to go on with life. The rut lies before him, if he chooses to remain in it. However, he could also chose to climb out and renew his quest for personal fulfillment. The choice is his and because he still has that choice, the film ends, for me, on a hopeful note. Of course, in a sequence just before the end of the movie, Ericsson has a conversation with the church Sexton- Algot Fr\u00f6vik- which does much to put Ericsson's suffering and unhappiness in context- we see that others live with far worse and still preserve themselves spiritually and morally.Who should see this film? Bergman fans should. So should individuals who are not familiar with Bergman but who enjoy simple dialogue-driven stories that have their own statements about what could be called the Basic Questions of life- it's meaning and our role in it. Viewers who expect a definitively anti-God stance will be badly disappointed. While there are anti-religious elements- they are muted and set forth plainly in a manner that strikes not at religion so much as any institution that outlives its sense of purpose and direction. This is far more subtle than saying the story is anti-Christian- for it actually is not. Those expecting an exploration of God will be disappointed- this film is about human perceptions of God. Finally, some considerable appreciation can be had by those who enjoy watching beautifully shot and edited black-and-white films.",

There are several hidden references to the crucifixion: the time covered in the movie (noon to 3 pm) is the same as the time Jesus spent on the cross; the location of Marta's skin disease corresponds to the \"stigmata\" or wounds from the nails.I can't recommend this film strongly enough.

Gunnar Bjornstrand is at his excellent best, Max von Syndow is predictably good.  I would single out the women performers for particular praise in this film: Ingrid Thulin is outstanding as the spinster who cannot break the ice that encloses Bjornstrand's pastor. Gunnel Lindblom plays a small but superb part as the desperate wife of the suicidal von Syndow.  This is not plot and action stuff, nor is it any good for you if seeing depression in others makes you depressed.  It is a microscope study of desperation and depression.  It is a small canvas film \u0096 my personal preference is for Bergman's larger canvas work such as The Seventh Seal and especially Wild Strawberries.  Of his darker, psychological work, again I would express a preference for Persona and also Through a Glass Darkly.

If you've ever lived in an environment that is perpetually cold, wet, and gray, you'll understand. If not, well, this film will illustrate it for you. A preacher, in serious depression himself, is losing his flock. His flock has rampant depression too. He tries to help, but it's useless. He starts looking for answers from them. No one has answers. Things happen. Nothing happens. It's the same old thing today, and tomorrow. This film requires patience. Expect no action. Even a scene change begins to seem like excitement \u0096 which is exactly what Bergman wanted for you. One scene, in which a major character \"narrates\" a letter she wrote to the preacher, is amazing. With a blank background, she stares into the lens of the camera, and talks \"at\" you \u0096 for pages. What a gutsy thing to do in a MOVING PICTURE.

            "content": "\"I think I have made just one picture that I really like, and that is Winter Light\u0085Everything is exactly as I wanted to have it, in every second of this picture.\" \u0096 Ingmar Bergman\"Winter Light\" concentrates around the middle-aged priest named Thomas (extraordinarilly played by Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) of a small Swedish church and his spiritual and emotional struggles during the one winter afternoon. Tomas founds himself as a non-believer. He realized that he actually became a priest because he was weak, anxious and neurotic and not because of his faith. As a young man, not knowing the REAL world and its TRUE nature, Tomas became a priest. His wife was everything to him, yes. She encouraged his \"believes\". With her, his believes (or self-deceptions) were stable, steady. After her death, they were shaken (so were his whole life and its purposes) because he encountered the \"real world\".After his wife's death he met Marta, schoolteacher \u0096 simple and realistic woman (played by brilliant Ingrid Thulin). Marta is in love with him. But he is bored with her and avoids her. Reasons for that are not very clear to the viewer or Tomas himself. He feels isolated and detached from the rest of the world. All the meanings and purposes of his life suddenly disappeared. Whole his life was one big \u0096 LIE.So, why is he avoiding Marta? She is the real representation of the ''real world'' since being an atheist. Marta is the symbol of his failure, she ''reminds'' him that he dedicated whole his life to \u0096 nothing.This is not, however, a religious film. It's a lot more exploring the real human nature and its possible ''faults''. It raises some universal issues like: ''Am I doing good things because I am a good person (because I have a good character) or because I am afraid of the consequences (because I am weak, fearful)''?\"Winter Light\" is also masterfully crafted movie with formal elements absolutely supporting (and adding to) the issues of the script. It is a very cold movie with no music (intentionally). Sven Nykvist, Bergman's cinematographer did excellent job with his contrasted black and white photography, focuses and mise-en-scene conjuring up the emotional isolation and distances between the characters.",

            "review_title": "The Silence of God",
            "content": "This film's Swedish title literally translates as \"The Communicants\", but it is generally known in English as \"Winter Light\", a somewhat inappropriate title given that Scandinavian winters are more noted for darkness than for light and that the theme of the movie is what could be described as spiritual darkness. The film begins with Holy Communion in a small church in rural Sweden one winter's morning. Apart from the pastor, Tomas Ericsson, there are only a handful of people in attendance. The principal characters are the widowed Tomas, his mistress Marta, the handicapped sexton Algot and Jonas Persson, one of the parishioners.Tomas is going through a crisis of faith, although perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he has been going though a crisis of faith for several years, at least since the death of his wife, and possibly for longer. He is tormented not so much by the non-existence of God as by the silence of God, the idea that God exists but wilfully refuses to reveal himself to His worshippers or to respond to their prayers. Marta claims to be an atheist and insists that God does not respond because God does not exist. Yet even her position is not as straightforward as it seems. Despite her atheism, she still attends the church services, and when she suffered from eczema she admits that she prayed to God for a cure. When her eczema cleared up, however, she did not credit God for the cure she had prayed for. She loves Tomas but realises that her love is not returned because Tomas is still in love with his dead wife.Persson, a fisherman, also has religious doubts, but his main worry is the obsession that the Chinese Communists are developing an atomic bomb and will use it to bring about a nuclear holocaust. This seemingly specific worry, however, is only a symptom of a much greater psychiatric depression from which Persson is suffering. Algot is a relatively minor character for most of the film, but is given a lengthy and important speech near the end, in which he points out that even Christ on the cross suffered from the same doubts which are afflicting Tomas. (\"My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?\")The theme of \"the silence of God\" does not necessarily make \"Winter Light\" an anti-religious film; it is a theme which has been dealt with by some highly devout writers such as George Herbert, who frequently complained that his longing for God was left unsatisfied. It is also a theme which lies at the heart of one of the greatest films of recent years, Martin Scorsese's \"Silence\".I would not, however, rate \"Winter Light\" as highly as that masterpiece. I must admit that I have not always been Ingmar Bergman's greatest admirer. Others will disagree with me, but at time I find him a very uncinematic director, and \"Winter Light\", with its almost total lack of physical action, its lengthy conversations, its long, lingering takes, especially close-ups, and its slow, deliberate camera movements, is a good example of what I mean. Although the film was made as late as 1963, in visual terms it looks more like a film from a much earlier date, a survivor of the \"filmed theatre\" style of film-making from the thirties and forties. On a philosophical and intellectual level the themes which Bergman deals with are interesting ones, but this seemed to me to be a story which might have worked better as a stage play than as a movie. Or perhaps even better as a prose novella. 6/10",

His \"faith\" is as much a will to live as anything else.Bjornstrand and Ingrid Thulin are amazingly good, and Max von Sydow does more with a few subtle expressions, and very little dialog, than most any actor is capable of.Not a film to watch in the dead of winter if you suffer from SAD, unless you're like me and get a perverse type of therapy from confronting the hopelessness head first.",

After the mass, Karin Persson (Gunnel Lindblom) seeks out the pastor with her husband, the fisherman Jonas Persson (Max von Sydow), and tells that Jonas is tormented by an existential crisis when he learns that China has an atomic bomb and intends to commit suicide. Tomas unsuccessfully attempts to comfort Jonas but he is not convincing due to his lack of faith and Jonas kills himself with a shot of rifle in his head. Meanwhile, the schoolteacher M\u00e4rta Lundberg (Ingrid Thulin) is in love with Tomas, but the widowed pastor rejects her love with bitter and tough words. In the end, Tomas discusses with the sacristan the true suffering of Jesus Christ in the Passion of Christ. \"Nattvardsg\u00e4sterna\" is the second part of Bergman's Trilogy of Silence with an unpleasant story of unrequited love, lack of communication and lack of faith on God. The pastor Tomas Ericsson is one of the bitterest characters that I have ever seen, and his speech to M\u00e4rta Lundberg is one of the cruelest and coldest of a man to a woman in love. The performances are awesome as usual in a Bergman's film, with wonderful black-and-white cinematography, and this cold film does not have soundtrack.

            "review_title": "Grim, dry, depressing and visually stunning, but Pastor Tomas Ericsson is really hard to relate to",
            "content": "In his not-to-be-missed, detailed interviews to Scandinavian filmmakers/critics Jonas Simas, Torsten Manns and Stig Bj\u00f6rkman published in France as \"Le Cin\u00e9ma Selon Bergman\" (1973) -- inspired by the Hitchcock/Truffaut/Chabrol interviews, and with material selected from over 50 hours of conversations in the span of 5 years -- Bergman reassesses \"Winter...\" in affectionate but moderately critical terms. He quotes his wife (as of 1962) K\u00e4bi Laretei's comment about it: \"Yes, Ingmar, it's a masterpiece, but a boring one!\" (or \"dreary one\", according to another translation).Not that it is really boring, at least not for IB's fans (as myself); and not that it's REALLY a masterpiece. It IS one of his driest, grimmest, most depressing films along with \"Shame\". As usual, there are magnificent scenes: every one Max Von Sydow is in (what an actor -- with barely a single line to speak he builds a very complex character); \u00c5ke Fridell's character, who's got the best lines; the argument between Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand and Ingrid Thulin at the cottage. Bergman's and Nykvist's visual conception is riveting: you can FEEL the cold of the bleak Swedish winter. However, there are other scenes that seem to drag longer than necessary (even for Bergman), especially the opening church service, and, yes, the letter scene (which is the source of the great letter scene in \"Persona\"). But I think the main difficulty with \"Winter Light\" is that Bergman paints his protagonist (Pastor Tomas Ericsson, played by Bj\u00f6rnstrand) mercilessly, making it hard for us to make any connection with the selfish bastard, whether you're religious or not. The question of faith -- that should be the important issue here -- is compromised by the incredible level of egotism of Pastor Ericsson; it's hard to believe that man has ever experienced Christian compassion. Bergman despises him and makes us despise him too; I, for one, couldn't manage to feel the smallest degree of sympathy for the man.In those interviews, Bergman talks about how difficult shooting \"Winter Light\" was, with Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand ill and detesting his role (no wonder!!) and the influence of Bergman's traumatic religious upbringing (his father was a strict Lutheran pastor), which made it hard for him to convey sympathy for Bj\u00f6rnstrand's character. The idea for the film came when a bishop of a small-town church told Bergman of his failure in preventing a fisherman in anguish from committing suicide. Bergman also said that Thulin's character was partly based on his second wife, who had serious eczema in her face and hands.Christian faith has been the subject of superior films by great filmmakers -- Dreyer, Rossellini, Bresson, Bu\u00f1uel, Pialat, Melville, Pasolini, and, of course, Bergman himself. With \"Winter Light\", I found myself thinking a lot about Bresson's masterpiece \"Diary of a Country Priest\". Both \"Winter...\" and \"Diary...\" deal with lonely, depressed Christian clergymen who struggle to come to terms with faith-shattering issues within themselves and the ones around them. Both live in small, bleak, grim villages and cannot find solace in people around them, or give them sound advice. Both strive for an evidence of God \u0097 a signal, a word, an inspiration to help comfort people. Both face the peak of their religious crisis in winter time (no wonder!!) and when faced with suicide (the doctor in \"Diary\", the fisherman in \"Winter...\"). But the major difference is that Bresson's priest ultimately finds a way to trust his God, while Bergman's pastor is abandoned by his (\"God's silence in an empty church\"). And, of course, that Bresson's priest is impossible to dislike whereas Bergman's pastor is a s.o.b. Bergman himself had been very impressed by Bresson's movie, which, in my opinion, is superior and \"thicker\" than \"Winter....\", although both display some of the most magnificent b&w cinematography the movies have ever shown (and Bergman talks proudly about the great amount of work it took to reach the right lighting for the film).The second of the so-called \"Silence Trilogy\" (it was never planned as such, but you know, it was the trilogy fad -- S.Ray, Antonioni etc), \"Winter Light\" is, IMHO, the least satisfying of the three, overshadowed by the powerful study in schizophrenia and incest with richly elaborated characters of \"Through a Glass Darkly\" and the incredibly daring, close-up approach of female sexuality, childhood innocence, war threat and terminal sickness of \"The Silence\". Anyway, \"Winter Light\" is film by Ingmar Bergman \u0097 stratospheres above most mortal filmmakers. My vote: 6 out of 10 (considering it's Bergman!).",

He's unable to accept the love offered him by the plain school teacher Marta (Ingrid Thulin, also very good), and incapable to offer the conviction of his faith to save from suicide a fisherman called Jonas (Max von Sydow) troubled by the prospect of a nuclear war(incidentally, this was filmed just before the Cuban missile crisis).This must have been a very personal film by Bergman (the son of a stern Lutheran priest, the director lost his religious faith as a young man). There are a lot of biblical allusions and religious discussions (we have a doubting Thomas, a fisherman called Jonas). One can nitpick here and there (one could wonder why the younger Marta is so attracted to the middle aged, aloof Thomas, or whether Jonas motivation to kill himself is credible), but if you are willing to suspend your disbelief, the minimalist direction and the great acting made for a powerful movie. Reportedly this was Ingmar Bergman choice as the favorite film he made.",

            "content": "Winter Light (Nattvardsg\u00e4sterna- literally The Communicants) is the middle film in Ingmar Bergman's Spider Trilogy (as it too references the God as a spider imagery), following Through A Glass Darkly, and preceding The Silence. Made in 1963, it represents a dramatic notching upward from the well made, but often melodramatic and symbolic, Through A Glass Darkly. Where the first film of the trilogy suffers from the overacting of Harriet Andersson, and some over the top displays of incest (for sex is a subject that the cerebral Bergman is at his weakest in handling) Winter Light is simply one of the greatest Socratic dialogues ever put to film, and as close to perfect a screenplay as a mortal is likely to produce. The acting, in every single role, is pitch perfect, yet Bergman regular Ingrid Thulin gives one of the great dominant female performances in film history, as M\u00e4rta Lundberg, an atheistic substitute school teacher in a small town with a now unrequited love for a Lutheran Pastor named Tomas Ericsson (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand), head of a church whose congregation has dwindled to a handful. The gorgeous Thulin is at her frumpiest and dowdiest looking in this film, and it seems that after an illness, she lost the affection of Tomas, with whom she had lived with for two years. Even Tomas does not believe any longer. His is a rote life, ever since the death of his wife four years earlier. He gives communion to a congregation that is bored- a boy licks the pews, others try to stay awake- including the church organist who checks his watch and reads, and the church hierarchy is dominated by money hungry apparatchiks, and M\u00e4rta's swooning over Tomas is part of local gossip, which discomfits him. As he ends his noontime ceremony he is confronted by a fisherman, Jonas Persson (Max Von Sydow in a curly permanent wave) and his wife Karin (Gunnel Lindblom). The man is suffering from depression, ostensibly over the Chinese getting the atomic bomb. Of course, this is just a pretense, for we know Jonas is an unemployed fisherman, with three children and a fourth on the way, and even in the 1960s people were not so detached from reality to off themselves over an abstraction. Wisely, Bergman never reveals his true fears, as Tomas brushes him off and tells him to come back later, for a man to man talk. The Perssons leave, and then Tomas reads a letter M\u00e4rta wrote him, confessing her love. It is a brilliant scene, shot with Thulin reading the words in two long takes, interspersed with a brief flashback. She addresses the camera so comfortably yet frankly that it puts the viewer in the place of Tomas, and we can later identify with his discomfit around this sincere, but needy and not altogether 'there' woman, who has suffered from a variety of ills which she feels had led Tomas to be repulsed by her. Yet, we are also drawn to her by the quiet brilliance with which she utterly guts religion with her atheistic views.Bergman, apparently, has always stated that this was his only perfectly realized film, and while others may add to that number, there is no denying the excellence of this filmic masterwork, which shows that while Bergman had his roots in the theater, he also knew exactly how to use the filmic medium. The original Swedish title, as The Communicants, would seem to be better title for this film, which deals with connections and communications, and their fragility. While Through A Glass Darkly deals with people on an island, this aloneness is handled even more deftly here, where winter seems to be the defining metaphor- whether as the winter of religiosity or human kindness. Winter Light ranks with Wild Strawberries and Shame as one of Bergman's greatest works, which makes them essentials as films. It does not indulge in the technical masturbation of some later works, not does it rely too much on stagy overacting, as it deftly balances the inner and outer worlds of film and life. It is a truly great work of art.",

I did, however, like the fact that a minister was having so many doubts--it was unique and MUST occur from time to time. However, because the movie just seemed to abruptly end, I felt a little dissatisfied. Yes, I know that tying everything together in the end is a very Hollywood-like thing to do and MANY foreign films avoid this convention. But, I just wanted to see more and see the dilemmas unfold further.By the way, one poor aspect of the film was the minister's ROTTON counseling session (that seemed to push the Max Von Sydow character over the edge to suicide). Following this suicide, the minister didn't seem that broken up by this or seem to take much responsibility for the suicide. I know he is described as not exactly a people-person in the film, but this was ridiculous!! This really had me hating the man and I doubt if that was Bergman's intention.",

I suppose in the end it depends on which side you come down.Taken in the overall scheme of things it is, of course, essential Bergman and possesses an honesty and intelligence most other film- makers can only dream of; perhaps that's why Bergman is so easy to parody.

            "content": "\"Nattvardsg\u00e4sterna\" or \"Winter Light\" is a Swedish black-and-white movie from 1961, so this one here is almost 60 years old and if you take a look at the number of votes here, you will probably see more than expected. This of course has to do with the fact that the writer and director is Ingmar Bergman, unanimously considered Sweden's finest ever and also in general among the best filmmakers out there. He was in his mid-40s when he made this one and it is not among his early or late career efforts. But at only 80 minutes, it is definitely among his shortest films out there. As for the cast, you will find the names of actors here like Thulin and von Sydow that he cast in other films as well. The latter is one of two actors I believe still alive in 2019 now that I am writing this review, but of course at a very high age already, no surprise looking at how old this film is. Lead actor who plays the character of Tomas is Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand and he is long gone sadly. But in this film, he is in basically every scene as he plays a priest who seems to have lost his faith in the Lord and we watch his struggles with himself as well as with the supporting characters. When seemingly he has come to the conclusion that it is all over and there is no future for him as a man of the church, mayhem ensues before he can tell anybody and he is needed badly. One man kills himself and leaves his pregnant wife and mother of several kids alone. Another servant of God, crippled he is (the servant, not God) in charge of a little chapel needs him as well and then there is also the boy who does not want to have anything to do with church anymore after his brother tells him the classes just aren't fun. So you could say, it feels a bit unrealistic that he starts working immediately again after telling the female protagonist of this film that it's all over, but you can also see it from the perspective that he does not need his faith to be there for the people and support them. They think it is what defines him, but he may have other motives that they know nothing about. It probably also has a lot to do with what he has been doing for decades and it's just not easy, maybe not even possible to step out from one day to the next.Now I want to say a few words on Thulin's character as well. Honestly, I must say I found her almost more interesting and fascinating than the actual main character. First of all, you need to see her and everything I am saying about her from the perspective that she plays a really attractive woman who could have pretty much any man she wanted in any place and the scene when that other guy tells her at the end to get out as fast as she can as long as it is still possible is really telling. But obviously, she is way too deep inside already. The letter she wrote makes obvious that she very much needs a lesson in self-love as she basically admits that she only feels complete when she is loved (by Tomas). And even after the in my opinion best scene of the film when he says all these horrible things to her and she takes of her glasses and sees him (physically) for what he really is, she puts the glasses back on and leaves with him once again in a situation in which, if she was a self-confident and not needy woman, she would never want to see him again. I must say it took me a little while to really get curious about the film and also the two main characters, but when I did, I was glued to the screen. Sadly it took way too long, but maybe that was just me and not the movie itself. The parallel between the ending and the beginning is also pretty interesting in the sense that it is basically a loop if you want to say so and despite everything that happened the situation is exactly the same, even with all the process inside characters that took place. The only real difference is probably that von Sydow's character wasn't alive anymore and we don't know if Thulin's is still there. But I believe that she is because honestly if the humiliation cannot change her, then the words of her suitor won't change her either. Overall, I believe this is a movie that the Church probably did not like very much because of the frequently very critical tone about religion and (losing) faith. Maybe this is one reason why Sweden did not pick it as the country's official Oscar submission for the foreign language category that year because they thought that the then even more conservative America won't give it a chance. But it is a good film, maybe not Bergman's best because of the sub-par first half, and I also believe the rating here is definitely a bit too high, but with how things got better the longer it went, I definitely do think it is worth seeing and therefore I give it a thumbs-up and a positive recommendation. Go watch it if you are ready for the very bleak material and also the subject is to your liking. It's typical Bergman. Comedy is basically non-existent and in the one or two moments when there is a tiny little ounce of humor, it is always closely linked to tragedy. It is a film and director/writer that is not for everybody, but if you can warm up to his craft and approach, then you are in for something convincing. Give it a chance or decide for yourself because I think you will not really need my recommendation as it is most likely rather unlikely this is the first work you would be going for from Bergman's pretty admirable (in both quantity and quality) body of work.",

The dissolution of body and soul. Cruelty, loneliness, and fear - all these things would be straightforward and transparent. Suffering is incomprehensible, so it needs no explanation. There is no creator. No sustainer of life. No design.\"What a brilliant little passage this is in Bergman's 'Winter Light', capturing one of the better arguments for atheism, that it's the simplest and most elegant explanation for our existence. As in many of his other movies, Bergman's protagonist wrestles with faith, wondering how it can be that a benevolent God could allow the atrocities of war and his wife to die. In this case, the man is a pastor (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand), and the openness of his doubts is a little shocking. \"I had this fleeting hope that everything wouldn't turn out to be illusions, dreams, and lies,\" he says, contorted with torment.Reflecting spiritual desolation, the film is stark and quiet in many ways: he preaches to a nearly empty church, the winter landscape is barren and cold, and he contemplates the gruesome image of the church's faith, the crucifixion, by muttering \"what a ridiculous image.\" At the end of the service where he performs rituals despite having grave doubts about the existence of God, the money collected is counted out, and we see a subtle reference to religion being in part a business, a livelihood. Later he'll be in a church with cabalistic numbers on a pillar, one left in semidarkness during the day because electric lights are believed to disturb the spirit of reverence. Is it any wonder the young are turning away from the faith, like the 10-year-old he meets in the empty schoolroom?In three consecutive conversations, about God, love, and death, the pastor speaks with brutal, unflinching honesty, devastating the people he talks to, perhaps in a way resembling his own spiritual state. Max von Sydow is on the receiving end of the first; his character has existential fears of the atomic bomb being in the hands of the Chinese, and he's hardly comforted by the pastor. In fact, he hardly gets a word in, but von Sydow's expression of discomfort tells us the spiritual angst he is going through, and it's an excellent scene for him. Ingrid Thulin is on the receiving end of the second; her character loves the pastor, but it's unrequited. She's a non-believer (\"God has never spoken because God doesn't exist. It's as simple as that.\"), and has practically replaced the notion of a heavenly god with the pastor, the way she reveres him. Like the pastor's faith in God, her faith in the pastor is sorely tested by how he treats her, and it's an interesting parallel. The third blunt conversation is with a young woman whose husband has committed suicide, and the pastor's approach is pretty far from providing real emotional comfort. He's a very unlikeable character, and we see that the raw pain he's in is like a cancer to those around him.Despite presenting a bleak view of religion, Bergman leaves the door open with an ambiguous ending. The sexton of another church points out Christ's own abandonment by his disciples, and His own difficulty dealing with God's silence to the question \"God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" on the cross. Maybe this will put his own troubles in perspective, remind him of Job, and trigger in him a realization of the value of having \"someone to rely on,\" even if she doesn't live up to his dead wife. Personally, though, I found more enlightenment in Thulin's character, who wisely says \"If only we could feel safe and dare show each other tenderness. If only we had some truth to believe in.\"",

            "content": "This Silence trilogy isn't easy movie watching, but it's very rewarding.Tomas, a minister in the Church of Sweden, is finishing a service at a small country church with only a handful of congregants. He speaks the words of the communion rite seriously, but dryly. We can tell by the solemn by detached manner in which he speaks that Tomas is somewhat removed from this thing that takes up his life.With the service ended, we begin to see Tomas's relationships with some of his congregants. There is the school teacher, his lover, who's an atheist and took communion as a challenge to him. There's the married couple with the husband who's consumed by apocalyptic visions stemming from the idea of China's combination of saber rattling and nuclear ambitions (what he would do with Kum Jong Un fires the imagination a bit). We also see the hunchback who prepares each little isolated church for service and the bored organist who's leaving before he's finished playing the final song.Tomas's doubt about God's existence, his consumption with the idea of God's silence, is overtaking his faith. He can't say anything to comfort Jonah's visions, offering nothing but pablum. He can't counter the school teachers barbs. He's lost, begging for guidance from God, but God says nothing to him. There are subtle implications that God may be trying to speak to him through other ways (a window brightening with light as Tomas takes his first large step to rejecting his own faith, for instance).The key to understanding the film, though, really is Through a Glass Darkly. According to the essay in the Criterion book, Bergman wrote this movie as a direct response to his own previous film. Even without the essay, the connections are stark. There are no shared characters, but we hear the same repeated image of a Spider God, which should send up flags from every audience member. There's also the continued references to the idea that God is love. The two different manifestations of God are now at war with the idea that there simply isn't a God. A two front war has become three.Which vision of God wins is actually a bit unclear, and I lean towards Bergman saying that the God is Love manifestation is the dominant one, an interesting counter to Through a Glass Darkly where the Spider God obviously won. There are key moments in the final minutes of the film that point to it. Tomas has traveled to a second church to say the service, but no one else but the hunchback, the school teacher, and the organist have shown. Will they even do it without a congregation? Tomas ultimately decides yes. Tomas has broken things off with the school teacher minutes before as Tomas has rejected both the Spider God and the God is Love visions, rejecting love itself. Just before Tomas begins the service, Marta, the atheistic school teacher, falls to her knees to pray, presumably to the God of Love.And yet, there is still a literal silence, much like the hunchback describes must have been Jesus' experience in his final moments. His apostles had abandoned or betrayed Him, and Jesus calls out to God asking why He had been forsaken. It wasn't the physical suffering, the hunchback concludes, that took the greatest toll on Jesus, for it lasted no more than four hours and he'd survived years in different states of agony because of his condition. No, it was the silence that Jesus seems to have faced that must have been the worst.Is God working through these people, or is there no God at all? Is God merely silent, or does he not exist? The ending suggests no solid answer, but a desire for the God of Love to be real.These movies are intelligent, touching, and difficult, but they are also extremely rewarding to the patient viewer willing to give the films a chance.",

            "content": "With Ingmar Bergman's recent passing I have been inspired to write this review, after holding off for quite some time.I'm going right out and saying it: Winter Light is Bergman's masterpiece. Most critics, fans and lovers of the cinema will cite either Persona, The Seventh Seal, Fanny & Alexander or Wild Strawberries as the film that defined him, and while those are all masterpieces, none of them capture the internal struggle for faith and a need for God that he, and many of us face quite like Winter Light.The film centers around a priest of a small country village who, recently begins to lose his faith, in God and human beings. He cannot offer any real advice to a depressed man, who is in need of reassurance, because he himself is not assured at all. With tragedy and hopelessness comes a truth about God, that ultimately affirms what many Christians believe. A truth that says he often is silent, and we all must face emotional doubt as Jesus did before we can become affirmed.Its a depressing film, and it isn't easy to deal with on any given occasion due to its sheer emotional force. I found myself with a desire to turn it off because it was ringing true too closely to my own personal life. However, I persevered and was rewarded with an uplifting, yet subtle ending. It is a heavier film then any of his others, because it is a film that will most likely ring a bell with a lot of of people, whereas the ideas in his other great films can often be just viewed as ideas.What makes Winter Light so great is its nature to cease being a piece of art, and a film and begin to become an experience to which both atheists and believers can relate. Atheists may relate to the uncertainty of God and the belief in his utter silence (he would have to be if he didn't exist), while Christians will be moved by the idea of hope amongst a world full of emotional suffering.This is my honest review about a film that moved me deeply. I hope that you, the viewers are moved as deeply as I was by this masterpiece.",

Do I smell an inferiority complex again, lurking behind the words of yet another small-minded person who gets all excited when he finally understands something that is actually quite banal in a supposedly artistic movie? Just how \"serious\" does one have to be to fulfil the lofty conditions for managing to comprehend and enjoy Bergman's \"Grand Visions\"? Get over yourselves...I was surprised to find the movie mildly interesting. Normally I am both bored and annoyed by Bergman's endlessly repetitious themes: misery, regret, relationships gone bad, depression, and suicide. Sure, all these hallmarks of the \"great Bergman\" are here, especially suicide and the thoughts of it, but this time our favourite Swedish ex-Nazi, father of nine, and pompous film-maker delves into religion, which is the only reason I found some interest here.The first ten minutes must be like Umberto Eco's book intros: i.e. designed to turn off readers (in this case viewers). (With the difference that Eco then rewards the patient reader...) We are shown a drawn-out sermon that lacks any valuable information about the characters or any kind of visual goodies to latch on to. It is merely grim and dull: like so many Bergman dramas. After this ultra-pointless sermon ends, we finally get to hear some dialogue (and typical Bergmanian monologue), which is for the most part well-written. The movie is also well-acted, no complaints there.The problem with the movie is that the priest's inner conflict about whether there is a God or not eventually drifts and meshes with your typical human-couple relationship crap, when the priest starts berating his girlfriend for being such a nuisance in his tortured existence. (She is a much younger woman that is in love with him (yet another male fantasy here in action, I suspect)). This is one of the main reasons I find his movies so dull (Bergman's, not the priest's): so much focus on what has gone wrong in male-female and female-female relationships. WHO CARES?? Aren't there better subjects to go into? Bergman writes his movies like a woman. It's all about people and their frustrations, and that sort of trite \"human condition\" stuff gets quickly tiresome. There is little or no depth in that. Those are the same kind of themes that you find in your typical dumb TV soap, only better written by Bergman. A truly great director like Kubrick explores all sorts of subjects, doesn't stick to one and the same thing with the manic obsession of a celebrity stalker. In fact, Kubrick just in his last 5-6 movies has covered far more ground than Bergman in all his nearly 50 movies.Take suicide, for example. It's impossible to watch a Bergman movie without someone musing about suicide or committing it, and no later than within the first third of the movie. The aura of self-imposed death is always in the air, which not only makes his movies somewhat predictable, but too repetitious. Btw, I find it highly ironic that a man who was this obsessed with whether life's worth living or not lived to be 89! He must have used his suicidal characters to live out his own fantasies of finally toping himself, which he never did because in reality he was probably too much in love with all the fame and adoration his suicidal dramas brought him to actually kill himself. (Hm... I sense another irony here...) Bergman's hapless priest drives Sydow to suicide - or at least accelerates that inevitable(?) outcome - and then we fail to see any real regret or sadness about it. Even Sydow's widow - with 3 kids and pregnant - doesn't react with sufficient shock. Is everyone emotionally dead here? Or is that merely the way people are in Scandinavia? The movie had a good middle, but after Sydow kills himself there was little to get excited about. No-one to relate to, plus the religious theme takes a backseat for a while.If you're sick and tired of watching Bergman's mostly pretentious drivel being translated properly, contact me by e-mail, and I'll send you any of these movies' subtitles, completely altered by me: \"Autumn Sonata\", \"Passion Of Anne\", \"Cries & Whimpers\", but also the non-Bergman overrated oddity called \"Der Untergang\".",

This illness resembles schizophrenia, but Bergman cruelly calls it \"the disease of faith\", a symptom of Karin's theism.Karin habitually sees visions of God, but her visions are warped to the point of parody. Her God takes the form of a salacious spider, and later a helicopter which ferries her sputtering body to a mental hospital. Supporting the increasingly deranged Karin are three men: Karin's brother, husband and father. These men embody three very different approaches to \"spirituality\" or \"love\", each of which is contrasted with Karin's more Christian outlook. The father, for example, is a cynic, depressive and writer, and is increasingly detached from a family he loves only insofar as they provide material for his increasingly morbid novels. The husband, in contrast, is a man of science, but his rationality proves unable to cure his wife. Meanwhile, Karin's brother is a naive, budding play-write, who develops an incestuous, sexual attraction toward her. As with Bergman's other \"faith\" films, Karin's beliefs are mocked for being hollow and borne of delusions, but shown to be far less horrific than those of the apathetic, post faith characters who surround her.The film ends with a macabre parody of romantic, spiritual and familial love. Here, Karin's embrace by God is ushered in by incestuous sex with her brother. An angelic helicopter then lifts her, not up into heaven, but toward a psychiatric ward. Afterwards, Karin's father tells his son that the family's love for one another is proof enough of the existence of God. His words are a self defence mechanism, designed to assuage the pain of watching his family disintegrate. The son, so starved of affection and attention, then accepts the father's drivel. By the film's end, Bergman has shown not only how a love of God is often the displacement of the love we should show for one another, but how even the staunchest unbelievers summon \"Gods\" to bolster their fragility.Like \"Through A Glass Darkly, \"Winter Light\", the second film in Bergman's trilogy, takes place in a cold, remote part of Sweden. Bergman's tone is austere and chilling throughout, all skies, oceans, rivers, buildings and vistas seemingly bleached and robbed of all depth. Attuned to this suffocating \"nothingness\" is Tomas Ericsson, a village pastor (named after Bergman's own father, a priest called Erik) who has lost his faith but continues to tend to his dwindling congregation. If Bergman's \"faith trilogy\" traces a movement away from shaky belief to profound existential abandonment, then \"Winter Light\" represents the mid-point of this journey: shaky disbelief, God's light wintry, wispy and uncertain.And so Bergman paints Tomas as a man of, not only uncertainty, but contradictions. Tomas uses his position of \"divine authority\" to absolve himself of blame when one member of his congregation commits suicide, whilst using his certainty that God doesn't exist, and therefore also absolute morality, as an excuse for his treatment of several woman. But the problem, the film goes on to show, isn't that God does or does not exist, but that he has always been summoned and shunted aside whenever it best suits man.\"Winter Light\" ended with two atheists in a church, waiting for God to speak. The silence that greets them becomes the basis of Bergman's \"The Silence\", arguably the greatest film in his trilogy (and the precursor to his traumatising \"Cries and Whispers\"). Making heavy use of sound effects and little use of dialogue, the film centres on Anna, Ester and Johan, a young boy. Whether these characters are related (Lovers? Family? Friends?) is never clarified.It isn't long before Bergman is alluding to off-screen wars (expressionistic shots of tanks and war machines) and the on-screen mortality of his characters (Ester coughs blood; she's dying from Tuberculosis), all forms of human suffering which for centuries have cast doubt on the existence of God. The rest of the film then largely takes place in a hotel, which Johan explores whilst Ester remains ill and bed bound. During his explorations he will stumble across various mundane yet disturbing sights and sounds. Think the fan which is placed at Ester's bedside, ostensibly for her comfort, but with each blade spin being a reminder of helplessness. Meanwhile, the click of Johan's toy pistol echoes shadowy military vehicles, whilst typewriters and clocks sing songs of death, each tick-tock bring one closer to oblivion. There's a certain, sickening \"finality\" to \"The Silence's\" \"noise\".Most horrific, though, is the disguised contempt these characters have for one another, despite their seemingly unwavering love. Ester despises Anna for her good health, for the carnal pleasures she indulges in, whilst Anna apathetically views Ester as a constant inconvenience. It's a love-hate tug of war which little Johan is being indoctrinated in.And so more horrific than God's silence is our own silence, our inability to both truly connect with another human being, and to know completely what the other is thinking. Despite Ester and Anna's rituals of human connection, they remain forever apart and forever alone. Ester herself represents the \"Mind\", a figure of intellect and rationality (linked to Bach, is multilingual etc), while Anna represents the \"Body\", Bergman stressing her bodily routines (bathes, eats, sex, is facile etc). What the film shows is that Pure Reason eventually withers the body, whilst carnality, unennboled by reason, ultimately leads to similar self destruction. Bergman's cure is the film's final word: \"spirit\". He closes on a powerful shot of Johan, the boy's future, and dilemma, ours.8/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing. The trilogy's cinematography, by Sven Nykvist, suffocates.",

            "content": "Never has a film-maker given such emotional depth to the notion of absence, was it of words, answers or any form of communication, as Ingmar Bergman did in his glorious and inimitable body of work.In \"Winter Light\", we meet Tomas, a priest from a rural town played by the inevitable Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, he's stuck in a profound faith crisis, something similar to a mental block for a writer. The parallel is even more striking since the film is the oeuvre of an artist in a constant quest for inspiration. But whether from the depths of Bergman's mind or from the highest summits of Divine incarnations, the echoes of reason are desperately inaudible and all we're left off is sheer frustration.\"Winter Light\" is the second opus of the Faith (or Chamber) trilogy, starting with \"Through a Glass Darkly\". After reviewing the first film, I realized I had totally forgotten to mention that the character played by the same actor was a successful writer but, as induced by a play within the film, a failed artist in the way he maliciously exploited the suffering of his daughter without compromising himself, the way his son-in-law did. He stayed in his own egoistical circle, and that circle might've been the eye of Ingmar Bergman, the son of a Lutherian pastor trying to break through his rigorous education and the weight of oppressing certitudes.And while in \"Through a Glass Darkly\", we couldn't empathize with Bj\u00f6rnstrand's character because he was wrapped up in his own ego, in \"Winter Light\", it's doubt that poisons the heart of the sickly priest, removing all traces of sincerity in his own sermons, not Cartesian doubt but something of a more emotional level. In the opening sermon, something in Tomas' eyes clearly betrays his lack of confidence, he stares at a crucifix looking for answers that would never come, and ironically, he's the man people came to, for some relieving words. The first is Jonas (Max Von Sydow) who looks as if he was already contemplating his fate to come.The man is scared of the nuclear threat and wonders if there is any hope to hang his hands on. Then Tomas, as it often happens when we want to take someone part of a confidence, admits that he's lost faith when he started his service during the Civil Spain, and could understand why there would be so much cruelty that God would allow, unless God's absence would be his defining quality, but then what's the point of praying Him? Tomas doesn't realize he signed Jonas' death warrant, later we learn, he committed suicide by a rifle. This is the most extreme form of whatever disease strikes Tomas' mind.The second protagonist to the film is M\u00e4rta, played by Ingrid Thullin. It's interesting to note that all these actors, have lost their youthful appeal, Gunnar looks cold and detached, Sydow looks older and sickly and Thullin hasn't this breath-taking beauty that was almost distracting in \"Wild Strawberries\". There is a deliberate intention of Bergman to accentuate the ugliness of these people as to convey their very feeling toward the world. M\u00e4rta is an atheist but she comes to the church because she's in love with Tomas. A sequence features her staring at the camera and opening her heart to him. She admits her flaws but she's convinced that she's the one for him. Later during a cruel and upsetting scene, he definitely rejects her, enumerating all her exasperating traits, and the way she indecently tries to pose as a replacement for the only women he ever loved: his late wife.Something faded with the death of his wife, causing his emotional apathy. Surprisingly, he asks her later to drive him to Jonas' family, to announce the sad news, feeling partly responsible for it, but the wife reacts as if it was all predictable and she's not fooled by Tomas' perfunctory attitude. The journey ends in the church where Algot, the crippled assistant starts the first discussion about religion. Algot points out that the Christ's physical pain was nothing compared to the moral one. He evokes the betrayal of the apostles and his own father, this God that had forsaken him. We never quite know what goes through Tomas' mind, maybe the realization that this absence is part of our mortal condition, and it's our interpretation that makes who we are.The film ends with four persons in the church, a half-drunk organist who doesn't care, an atheist who is here out of love, a cripple with a cheerful attitude and a man who can't find his path to happiness. To a certain extent, we're all conditioned by how we react toward this absence and some simply don't believe in God not to have to deal with his absence. And M\u00e4rta believes in her love for Tomas, but he rejects her, her 'Silence' is Tomas', and she'd live as desperate and disappointed as he is, echoing the final words of \"Through a Glass Darkly\" where the idea of God was associated with love, and maybe Tomas' pain comes less from the absence of God, than the person he loves the most, and he only suffers because he feels like betrayed by God who took his most valuable person in life.It's just as if his faith was 'interested', why not? even Jesus, expected a reaction from God before asking why he forsake him? Maybe we all have to face silences, because we all expect answers, and the best way to avoid it is the absence of any kind of feeling, but we can't. This absence is devastating, and never has an absence of words been so eloquent, so rich in meanings, so powerful.",

The man (Max von Sydow) and the priest Tomas (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) has a pastoral talk, where, roles inverse, the priest complains his own spiritual agony to his embarrassed guest. The man leaves, and commits suicide immediately. - This trigs a series of discrete but inherently dramatic events and confrontations whereby the priest returns to a cold and sober attitude to his profession, his duties, and his associates. Everything goes back to an unglorious everyday state of things.This is the film Ingmar Bergman himself is most satisfied with, feeling he finally has managed to be perfectly honest. His preceding film, Though A Glass Darkly, a masterful melodrama with a consolating end: \"love demonstrates God's existence\", very clearly left Bergman with an uneasy feeling of opportunism and compromise, so here he disowns it, producing the \"plain and brutal truth\". The Love solution does not work, since love itself is selfish and confused. The illusion of his relationship with a female school teacher M\u00e4rta (Ingrid Thulin) is mercilessly crushed by Tomas in a direct encounter. Tomas tells M\u00e4rta he loves only his deceased wife. Towards the end the disillusioned cantor of a neighbouring Church, where Thomans performs a mass for no visitors, however reveals that even this love was not unblemished, since it made Tomas forgetful of his congregation, causing it to melt away.Now this subtle film is frequently misinterpreted. It's not as grim and depressing as it's told to be. It's theme is disillusion, not despair. Tomas and M\u00e4rta are hard hit by the sudden crisis; but they can handle it, and quickly return to business-as-usual, and in the gray world of everyday realities, there's considerable relief in the fact life, if rather bleak, isn't really as difficult as those glorious illusions would have made it. God remains silent - but he may still exist, so, just go on with the routine services seems the only viable alternative. And this is what Tomas (and M\u00e4rta) does; certainly not a hero, nor a scoundrel, just an ordinary, reasonably decent man.This modest, low-keyed, but very smart and subtle film is the least overtly dramatic Bergman film I have seen, but it's still another towering masterpiece, a Ten; and the photo is as exquisite as ever.",

            "content": "Nattvardsg\u00e4sterna / Winter Light (1963) :\nBrief Review -Ingmar Bergman creates conversational engagement between Pastor's existential crisis and god's silence. Winter Light, apparently known as second film in Bergman's trilogy over God's existence and his influence on disciples is short but extremely thought-provoking. It follows Tomas Ericsson, pastor of a small rural Swedish church, as he deals with an existential crisis and his Christianity. The religious belief in the small is remotely low and the pastor himself had indifferences with the god once and yet he proves god's importance for humans. It is not a lecturing film that has monologues on God and his actions but it has conversational engagement between those few characters. First monologue appears in that letter scene in which Marta describes her feelings and that 5-6 mins scene alone is a cinematic experience in itself. Forget all what you've seen and what you'll see in the film but when that scene appears you know it's not an ordinary scene. It is a long shot in which Marta is alone captured on the screen and she does an unbelievable job in that one particular scene. I couldn't move my sight off her and it was like she's staring into my eyes and talking to me and me alone. Bergman's conversatinal segments always amaze me but in this film it was bit higher than expected. Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand's performance is also great and a treat to watch. The cinematography is way beyond any ordinary framework, and it's god they're showing us through those hideous designs. Can you believe it? The last frame when Tomas begins Service in almost empty Church, what a fabulous vision it was for a cinematic sequence. Ingmar Bergman cracks another code of human derivation of religious coaching. Overall, a Must Watch for Religious experts. Atheists can also give it a watch to learn something new for their own definition of God.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

Basically pastor Tomas Ericsson (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) performs his usual Sunday service to a tiny congregation in the small rural church, but the cold winter weather has given him a cold, and unknown to others he is also suffering a crisis of lack of faith in God, following the death of his wife two years ago. After the mass Tomas is approached by Karin Persson (Gunnel Lindblom), and her fisherman husband Jonas Persson (Max Von Sydow) who is suffering from anxiety due to China having a bomb and he is contemplating suicide, but rather than consoling him Tomas cannot help but talk about his own troubles, and later Jonas kills himself with a rifle shot in the head. School teacher M\u00e4rta Lundberg (Ingrid Thulin) is in love with Tomas and offers her desperate feelings as a consolation for the loss of his faith, but the widowed priest resists and rejects her with bitter and tough words, and in the end Tomas finds someone to talk to about his lack of faith, and what he believes with regard to the true suffering of Jesus Christ in the Passion of Christ. Also starring Allan Edwall as Algot Fr\u00f6vik and Kolbj\u00f6rn Knudsen as Knut Aronsson. I can agree with the three stars out of five that this film is given by critics, it is engaging to see the man struggling to remain faithful during the cold season, and the refusal of love from one who has true feelings is intriguing, but it is perhaps one of those films that only half watching will like or understand, it is certainly an interesting drama.

The relationship between the two principle figures is so stunningly delivered. How can someone offer something when they have nothing to offer. I have listened to so many sermons where I have thought, \"Do you really believe that?\" or \"It sounds like a nice pat little expression from the minister's handbook!\" The beginning of the movie, basically a church service with all the bromides and liturgy, makes me itch to get out. When five people come up for communion, it is so depressing. Then the thing with the seaman, Van Sydow, dragged to the minister by his wife. He just exudes angst. I can think of no finer actor, even in this minor role. The entire movie is filled with tension and despair. Please come out of it and look at the wonders of life! But that's not going to happen. When Tomas and Marta are together, we feel that we want to keep them at arm's length or we will be infected. Like so many Bergman characters there is irreversible loss and hopelessness, and all the talking will not bring it back. This is about as tightly structured a film as I've ever seen, and while some may be dissatisfied at the conclusion, I think it has to be the way it is.By the way, I thoroughly enjoy the character of Allan Edwall.

I found this film heart-wrenching at times because I fully connected with some of the struggles of Tomas. That hollow feeling when you don't sense God's presence is tough to swallow. And you can feel the agony he is experiencing in his soul, particularly when he blurts out things he shouldn't say to a man in need of his help. I also appreciated that they utilized the opening scenes to establish that there is basically no congregation, suggesting that his ministry is getting weaker and the town is losing faith right along with him. It's a dark and depressing tale to say the least.What I found less worthwhile in WInter Light was this romantic relationship that seems to be a thorn in Tomas's side. I found the whole thing annoying and unpleasant. Their interactions were awkward, and I could not stand the way he seemed to be sending Marta mixed messages. I know that a woman in his life ties into the eventual reveal of why he has begun to doubt the presence of God, but the way it is handled did not work for me at all. Another thing I struggled with is the conveniently timed question of Algot. It's one of those movie tropes that could work here, but just felt forced and a little like it came out of nowhere at the 11th hour. Finally, the ending was more ambiguous than I'd like for this kind of story. I was engaged by Winter Light, but there were definitely parts of the story that bothered me.

This is her Garden of Gethsemane.Welcome to Life on Earth.I found this film mesmerizing. From the very first scene, I was pulled into this melancholic, thought provoking tour de force of art-house cinema. It is deftly directed with such sublime sensibility and intimacy. The realism is extraordinary; few if any other movies I have seen are so authentically delivered. Like many of Bergman's movies, 'Winter Light' challenges us to reflect on our own lives, our very existence, essentially what it means 'to be'. Many reviews remark how it is steeped in connotations of religion, but I found its themes closer resembling aspects of 'Faith'. Not just faith in God, but faith in oneself, faith in one's partner, faith in what it means to be human. For me, it didn't require multiple viewings to fully appreciate this Tower of Movie. I got why Bergman said: \"I think I have made just one picture that I really like, and that is Winter Light\u0085Everything is exactly as I wanted to have it, in every second of this picture.\" \u2013 Ingmar Bergman from Ingmar Bergman Directs by John Simon 1972.

To my mind, this isn't a movie, its best described as a vision, a vision so pure and finessed to screen that its almost like walking into someone else's dream, but by the last act you realize it could be more akin to your subconscious, because really this vision has been imparted to you. The plot, multilayered symbolism and striking metaphors to the events of 'The Passion of Christ' and human suffering (Christians and atheists alike) could be discussed at infinite length, but I'll leave that to the 'movielogians' rather than influence the mind set of someone who may intend on watching this movie.

Even in his lighter portions with the 80 minute, half dozen characters, half a day time frame bleak masterpiece Winter Light, he can create such a rich and thought-provoking portrait of life with a universal problem - God's silence. Faith is always a vocal point of discussion in the films of Bergman and this is one of his most fascinating under the microscope studies. It focuses on the theme of the sense of abandonment we get from deep losses, and while many suffer from a deliberating sense of paralysis, it suggests with comparisons to Jesus Christ's final struggles that those feelings lead to the ultimate sense of purpose in life. Instead of being a depressing theory to match the film's anguished tone and network of characters, of which are remarkably performed by Bergman's regular company, it's an idea quite reassuring.Winter Light has a naturally limited plot, being mostly formed out of dialogue and monologues, but Bergman's structure and economy still shine through. It's cinematic and intimate enough to not feel as though that it instead belongs on a stage. The narrative hinges on the idea of a priest's existential crisis causing one of his most distressed flock to commit suicide, but that setup and payoff is powerful enough to not need anymore besides the small backstories and dramas of the priest's life. While the unexpectedly muted reaction dulls the film somewhat, its subsequent reflection and sense of life going on elevates it even higher. It's a testament to Bergman's elegant grace in simplicity behind the lens. But that's what's so palpable about his films that Winter Light boasts most of all in its poetic imagery, it has a soft and relatable atmosphere that's simultaneously ethereal and painful, oozing intense emotion in a single frame. This is a thoroughly profound film to cherish for the darkest of times.9/10",

Max von Sydow is an exceptional actor but his role here is a mere extended cameo in a role that Bergman must have written as a self-parody - a fisherman on the brink of suicide because he believes the Chinese will bring about a nuclear apocalypse.

            "content": "\"Winter Light\" is the story of a Lutheran pastor in a multi-point charge who is losing his faith. It is said to be Bergman's favorite film, partly because he was himself the son of a pastor. I'm also the son of a pastor, so all the religious language in the film was understandable to me. \"Winter Light\" got a mixed reception in North America, partly because it was obscure to many viewers, though now it is included in some \"great films\" lists.As in \"Through a Glass Darkly\" there are four main characters in \"Winter Light.\" Tomas (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) is the pastor; his wife died four years earlier and he was devastated by her death. I'm sure this is also part of the hold of the film on me. Bj\u00f6rnstrand had a bad cold during the filming, and Bergman made use of that fact throughout the film. M\u00e4rta (Ingrid Thulin) is a school teacher who became Tomas' mistress several years ago. She is an atheist, but loves Tomas and has tried to be supportive of him. Jonas (Max von Sydow), a fisherman, and Karin (Gunnel Lindblom) Persson are a couple in the congregation. There are other characters (the sexton and the organist) but I did not find them terribly compelling.The film opens with the end of a Lutheran church service, including the Lord's Prayer and communion. There are less than 10 people in the congregation. After the service Jonas and Karin come to talk to Tomas. Jonas is very depressed by the prospect of China getting the atomic bomb. Recall that this is the height of the Cold War, and many people wondered if the world had a future. Tomas starts with platitudes that \"We must go on living\" but has no answer when asked why. Tomas asks Jonas to come back for a longer talk in the afternoon.While waiting, he reads a letter from M\u00e4rta that wonders why he has turned from her, and essentially begs him to marry her. There is a dramatic six-minute closeup of M\u00e4rta as she \"reads\" the letter to Tomas. Jonas finally returns, but Tomas can only talk about his own failures as a pastor. He reflects on his time as a pastor during the Spanish Civil War. He says, \"Picture my prayers to an echo-God who gives benign answers and reassuring blessings.\" When faced with reality, God turned into a monster (using the spider image from \"Through a Glass Darkly\"). \"If there is a God, would it really make any difference?\" After Jonas leaves he says \"God, why have you forsaken me?\"Unsurprisingly, Jonas commits suicide on his way home. Tomas stops to visit Karin on the way to his afternoon service, but is able to give no comfort. He also has it out with M\u00e4rta and tells her he is tired of her and all the little things of life she brings to him. Nonetheless she goes with him to the afternoon service. Tomas, M\u00e4rta, the sexton and the organist are the only persons present. Before the service begins we see atheist M\u00e4rta pray for belief as she kneels in the back. The film ends as Tomas enters the pulpit and begins the liturgy.The light throughout the film is grayish, leaving no shadows. Hence the name of the film. This also impacts the bleak ambiance of the film throughout.I was able to relate to this film at many levels. My own perceptions of God have ranged over a wide terrain in my lifetime, and they have continued to change in recent decades. Much of orthodoxy no longer interests me. At some levels I'm agnostic, though I consider myself a follower of the teachings of Jesus. There is much in Tomas with which I can identify. I think it's a great movie.",

            "content": "Winter Light (or \"The Communicants\") is the second installation in Ingmar Bergman's famous \"Silence\" Trilogy. The plot is remarkably simple, Gunnar Bjornstrand plays a preacher who has lost his faith after the death of his wife and a failed affair with a local schoolmarm (Ingrid Thulin). After giving the service, he reads a letter that she wrote to him, tearing him apart, and then professing her love for him. A local fisherman (Max von Sydow) asks his counsel on his feelings of depression and suicide due to his growing anxiety about China's nuclear capabilities. The preacher cannot console him and he ends up killing himself. In the end, the preacher faces his own short comings, and continues on with his second service at his second congregation (this one is attended only by Thulin's character, the organist, and the church caretaker).What really struck me about this film is how Bergman was able to convey the lack of communication and dreariness of the whole situation. This film portrays the desolation of broken dreams and loss of faith in a very frank way. The acting was superb, and the camera work was some of the best I've seen in any film. The coup of Sven Nyquist's camera work was the monologue of Ingrid Thulin reading the letter her character wrote to Gunnar Bjornstrand. For about six minutes all you see is a close up of her face reading the letter. The result is captivating. All you can think about is her speaking to you in a frank and somewhat unflattering way.I recommend it to anyone who enjoys film. Modern directors owe a lot to Bergman, and this film is an excellent example of his work.",

I revel in films that are challenging, thought-provoking and stimulating. Winter Light is certainly that as well as beautifully photographed, intensely acted and masterfully paced. Everything is stripped to the bare bones minimum; nothing is expanded or developed. All of the tools exist to show exactly what Bergman is trying to say about God, faith and life. These are questions everyone asks at some point in life and it is amazing to me to actually see these themes materialize onto a film; it's like reading my own thoughts. It also makes me wonder why I ever decided to waste my time on the tons of crap put out by Hollywood every year. Silly, trivial and lurid, these movies cannot even begin to compare to what Bergman is going for. I won't go into detail as that would ruin the experience. And it is an experience; one that cannot and should not be forgotten or missed.",

There are those who say Winter Light is cold, and they are right, the lack of music and the fact that Ericsson is not a character you'd like instantly if even that further accentuates that. But considering the subject matter and the story, these were deliberate and appropriate. What matters though is if the film is well made and whether it engaged me, and Winter Light did. As with all of Bergman's films, it is very well made, the scenery is beautiful to watch and the black and white cinematography, mainly in close-ups is very atmospheric. The dialogue is very thought-provoking, sometimes cold in tone, but a lot of it resonated with me in how powerful it was. The story is a subtly told and powerful, and I for one was captivated and moved by it. Bergman's direction is superb, as are the performances, especially from Gunner Bjornstrand who inhabits the character of Ericsson. Ingrid Thulin is strong in her compassion also, and Max Von Sydow's face speaks volumes even when he is saying little. In conclusion, not everybody will like Winter Light but I found it to be excellent. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I thought this second film was a minor step up but like that film, it seems this one will get better with repeat viewings since there's so much psychological feelings going on throughout the film. Once again the strongest aspect are the performances with Bjornstrand giving the best one. I hate watching movies where someone is thinking yet you can look at them and tell the only thing they're really thinking about his their next line of dialogue. At anytime in this film you can look at Bjornstrand and tell that he's really thinking about his relationship with God and everything else going on in his life. Thulin is equally great and really shines during the best moment of the film when the Pastor is reading her letting but Bergman gives us a closeup of her reading it. Then there's Max von Sydow who just speaks so much without saying a word of dialogue. The ending is when the film really comes into shape with, like the first film, a quick cut to leave the viewer thinking.",

            "content": "I recall first viewing this movie on a Good Friday, many years ago. I was very touched by it. I wanted very much to view the movie again but never seemed to come across it on television, DVD, or even in a recent documentary on Ingmar Bergman, where there was no reference to it. Yet, Bergman considered it his best work. So hard to explain the lack of recognition. The story takes place in three hours in which Gunnar Bjornstrand as a Lutheran minister/priest conducts a service, counsels a married couple and is called to the scene of a tragedy. He also has a philosophical discussion with his sacristan who gives a stunning insight into the life of Jesus. Finally, he tells a parishioner with brutal honesty that he has no use for her, despite her desire to marry him. The priest is suffering a complete breakdown of faith, following the death of his wife a few years earlier. He cannot pull himself out of the pit he has fallen into, let alone strengthen his parishioners in their faith. The movie was made in 1962, the height of the Cold War and a time when people were beginning to walk away from their churches and their religions. The existentialism that had crept into 20th century Christianity is very evident.It is true that the movie is very grim but it is so beautifully made, the gloominess of the film is hardly important. What does matter is how effectively the sad atmosphere is shown in this unvarnished masterpiece. There is no music or humour. Some sequences move like a slide show from one shot to another, showing the bleak landscape or the sad faces of people inside the church as a series of portraits. Ingrid Thulin and Max Von Sydow also give strong performances but the sadness and honesty of Gunnar Bjornstrand is the movie's great strength.",

            "content": "Winter Light is the most unequivocally religious of all Bergman's films. It deals with the God-Man relationship, but also with human relationships in terms of the divine. The basic theme of the film is the failure of everything to communicate with everything else: God with humans, and humans with humans. It is what Tomas describes as \"God's silence.\" Winter Light is constructed like a stage play, with a series of well-defined scenes. It also has the nature of a Passion play, in so far as it takes place on a Sunday, between noon and three o'clock in the afternoon, the time of Christ's passion The first fifteen minutes of the film, a religious service officiated by Tomas, underscore the human disconnection, through the image of eight people widely scattered throughout the church pews. Tomas's first words, \"Our Lord Jesus Christ in the night when he was betrayed,\" points toward what he feels is his own betrayal by Life. Following the communion at the altar, the communicants' demeanors, except for Frovik's, leaves no doubt as to the utter failure of the liturgical act to communicate with the tiny, detached congregation.Following the service, Tomas meets his first challenge in the person of Jonas. Tomas is totally unable to connect with Jonas's torment, and therefore to be of any solace to him. He hopes for a second chance when Jonas returns to meet him face to face, but again fails miserably at soothing Jonas's anguish. It is as if Tomas is trying to heal himself, rather than Jonas. Tomas talks about his disintegrating faith. The god of his beliefs is \"an improbable and private image of a fatherly god. Picture my prayers to an echo-God.\" When Tomas held up his God to the lens of reality, his God \"turned into something ugly and revolting. A spider-God.\" Tomas concludes that God does not exist: \"There is no Creator.\" Tomas is stunned by his own revelation and loss. The room is suddenly filled with sunlight, underscoring this revelation. He utters Christ's last words on the cross, \"God, why have you forsaken me?\" He rushes out into the chancel, falls to the floor in a paroxysm of coughing, mumbling, \"Now, I am free\u0085free at last.\" His body is sick and so is his soul, as he now finds himself alone. However, he soon reverts to his echo-God upon hearing the bad news from the old lady. It is also Bergman's conclusion, according to which one must do one's duty, even if one feels it meaningless.Tomas's encounter with death by the river rapids only reinforces his feelings of emptiness. The roaring of the river covering the speech and overwhelming the human presence, shows Nature's indifference to Man. This directly contradicts Tomas's pronouncements to Jonas that when God is taken out of the human consciousness, \"life becomes something understandable\" and death just\" a dissolution of body and soul.\" Tomas's second challenge comes in the form of Marta's letter. Tomas's relationship with Marta is also a failure. Tomas had married a woman who, like his mother, protected him from everything evil and ugly in the world. After she died, Tomas took up with Marta, who, probably not coincidently, physically resembles his deceased wife. When Tomas, alone in the vestry, takes out pictures of his dead wife, we see that he holds pictures of Ingrid Thulin, and they are stamped \"rakopia\" (i.e. \"proofs,\" or literally \"raw copy). However, Marta does not behave as the protection-wife, and his obsession with his memory of his dead wife prevents him from connecting, or opening himself to Marta's love for him. Tomas reads Marta's letter, but he still has not understood her. She is simply smothering him with her demands, as he so \"eloquently\" will tell her later at the schoolhouse.Marta herself is also incapable of real communication with Tomas. She resorts to writing a letter to him, trying to explain herself, her feelings and her love for him, rather than speak to him directly. In her letter, she displays a self-assurance and aggressiveness that she is unable to project in Tomas's physical presence. Marta is a self-declared atheist. She tells Tomas unequivocally, \"God has not spoken because God does not exist.\" But it would seem that she has a connection to God in spite of herself. Having been born and raised in a joy-filled non-Christian home, she is perplexed by Tomas's neurotic, narcissistic relationship with God, and by his \"indifference to the gospels and Jesus Christ,\" which is the main part of the Christian religion that she understands (for viewers to get this point, Bergman has Marta wearing stigmata for a while). She ends her letter with, \"I love you and I live for you. Take me and use me\u0085I have only one wish: to live for somebody,\" which is of course the true Christian creed.Frovik, on the other hand, has no need for God to talk to him. He knows through his faith that God is present. Frovik is able to connect with love to others, as he shows in his exposition of the Passion of Christ. He understands that Christ's suffering was not so much physical, as it was psychological. Christ's mental agony was being misunderstood by his disciples, and later on denied by them. \"Yet this was not the worst. When Jesus\u0085cried out, 'God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' He thought his heavenly father had abandoned him\u0085in the moment before he died\u0085Surely that must have been his greatest hardship? I mean God's silence.\" This is the same \"God's silence\" that Jonas has been experiencing.Through Blom's sarcastic remarks at the end of the film as he quotes Tomas's leitmotif, \"God is love and love is God. Love proves the existence of God,\" Bergman underscores precisely which certainty, the one achieved in Through a Glass Darkly, he wanted to expose as false in Winter Light: the identification of love with God.",

In a sense he goes in his father's shoes in the central character he wrote for Bjornstrand, a weary, ill, and emotionally zombified priest who can't give much comfort as he feels none for himself. As frigidly powerful as his other god-questioning dramas, this film's only weak spot is a not 100% fulfilling denouement, and too little screen time for the supporting character of Jonas, played by a usual Bergman choice, Max Von Sydow.

            "content": "Winter Light, the second film in Ingmar Bergman's trilogy about the difficulty of existing in a universe without God, returns to the question posed in the trilogy's first, equally bleak film, Through a Glass Darkly, namely the question of God's existence. Agonising over this question is the film's leading character, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand's doubt-filled pastor, aptly named Tomas. Through his questioning of God's existence, and of whether it would matter if he didn't exist, Bj\u00f6rnstrand casts aside the hope that sustained his character in Through a Glass Darkly, namely that \"God is love and love is God\". The organist, Fredrik Blom (Kolbj\u00f6rn Knudsen) describes how this hope sustained Tomas' faith for years, and, combined with the support of his wife, inspired him to lead a religious revival in his parishes. Tomas describes his God as existing with him, \"in an ordered universe where everything made sense\", but now, trapped in a universe full of isolation and grief since his wife's death, he calls out in vain to that God for help. Denied a response, he forces his agonising over what the film calls \"God's silence\" on whoever will listen, thereby isolating himself from those around him even further. Tomas' and the other characters' isolation from one another is expressed visually through Sven Nykvist's cinematography of decaying churches and barren winter landscapes, a reminder of the emptying Church which Tomas belongs to, and the living death he has condemned himself to since the loss of his wife. But it is also a reminder of the isolation of smaller players in the film, such as M\u00e4rta, the lonely, atheist schoolmistress, who tries to convince Tomas to love her, or Max von Sydow's fisherman, Jonas Persson, whose wife (played by Gunnel Lindblom) cannot help him escape his terror of nuclear war, and neither can Tomas. He is so immersed in his own woes that all he can do is force Jonas to listen to him agonise over these woes, or by his own admission, \"spout drivel\" about the importance of faith and love, driving Jonas away in despair. Tomas' inability to help Jonas reveals a theme running throughout Winter Light, namely that people are of little help to one another when they genuinely need each other. This is a theme expressed through Tomas' spiteful rejections of M\u00e4rta's offering him her love, and through his inability to offer comfort to Jonas' wife following her husband's suicide. However, it is most poignantly expressed in the reflections of the sexton, Algot Fr\u00f6vik (played by Allan Edwall), that the Gospels' focus should not be on the physical suffering of Jesus, but rather on how he must have felt when he was arrested and all his disciples deserted him, and later on the cross, when he thought his Father had forsaken him. Algot believes that the sense of abandonment Jesus must have felt must have been \"extremely painful\", bringing home to Tomas the scale of the damage he's caused by being of no help to Jonas. This inspires a new resolve in Tomas. At the end of the film he decides to hold a church service, even though M\u00e4rta is the only attendee. Tomas' motive is revealed by his resigned, yet determined delivery of the \"Holy, holy, holy\" prayer; namely to do his duty as a pastor, in other words, to do what Bergman deems an essential duty, to \"hold your communion\", \"regardless of what happens to you in life\". For all Tomas' new resolve, Winter Light ends with nothing really resolved. It is not clear whether or not Tomas' faith has been restored, whether he will do better as a pastor from now on, whether he will break out of his self-inflicted isolation, or how he will resolve his relationship with M\u00e4rta. Nonetheless, he has seen the disastrous consequences his own failings can have, he has resolved to do something about them, and by following his and the other characters' stories the viewer has learnt what sort of place the world of Winter Light is. It is a bleak world, whose inhabitants exist largely detached from one another, and the story of its healing is one which Bergman appreciates as being far beyond this intensely intimate film's scope.",

            "content": "The film is considered the middle part of the trilogy that began with \"Through a Glass Darkly\" and ended with a \"Silence.\" The movies allowed Bergman to try to reconcile his feelings about the creator. The plot of Winter Light revolves around a pastor named Thomas Ericsson and the name is not accidental. The man is in a state of spiritual crisis, hence, he is a doubting Thomas which is a reference to the Apostle Thomas who refused to believe that a resurrected Jesus had appeared until he saw the wounds that Jesus had suffered on the cross. And, the last name Ericsson meaning son of Erik Bergman appears to convey that the disillusioned pastor represents the director's feelings.\nAt first, it is difficult to believe that skepticism is the major theme of the movie given the fact that the first 13 minutes are devoted to a church service. However, the opening images of the movie start with Thomas performing a heartless recital of scripture which makes it clear that he has lost his passion. A lonely priest, who is struggling with his own faith, comes to a realization that he has devoted his life to a faith that doesn't talk back to him. He may talk to God but this is a world of silent God as God doesn't speak to him directly. It's a one-sided conversation. It then slowly moves away and shows the outside landscape. It is bleak and seems to be in the middle of nowhere. There's snow on the ground and the trees are bare. Everything is bleak, frozen and lifeless. This is a very image of spiritual emptiness.\nThe movie is structured as a series of conversations that Thomas has with his parishioners, the people attending the service. The first visitors are a fisherman, Jonas Persson, and his pregnant wife. Mr. Persson confides in him that he is depressed about both his life and also the possibility of war because China is developing an atom bomb. Thomas starts reassuring him and begins with an empty platitude that \"We must trust God.\" But, when the fisherman sharply looks at him he looks down as he is unable to meet the fisherman's eyes. Here arises a question: If he himself has doubts, how can he reassure somebody else? Coming to the framing, when Thomas offers a platitude, he's in a separate frame just as the fisherman is in a separate one. This is due to the fact that fisherman is the one with the problem and he assumes that Thomas is the one who has solutions. However, as soon as Thomas lowers his eyes he crosses over and comes towards the fisherman because he is on that side meaning he doesn't have any solution either. After the couple leaves, the next person to enter is a school teacher named Marta who's been in a relationship with Thomas. She understands him or at least she thinks she understands him but he doesn't seem to want her anymore. Here, I would like to draw attention to his use of the word \"higher order\" which seems to refer to some kind of transference. He wants God in the same way Marta wants him and because God is not in a relationship with him, he's similarly rejecting her love.\nBergman breaks the conventions of cinema and simply shows an uninterrupted six minutes or so of Marta. Thomas is reading a letter from her and in it she states her opinion of Christianity. God and Jesus exist only as vague notions and from the perspective of an outsider it seems obscure and full of neurotic rituals that are overwrought with primitive emotions. People of faith do not want to consider such things but in this scene we are stuck with this woman's opinion. There is no escape. Bergman saw a kind of hypocrisy in the teachings of the church and the reality of its people of faith. His father would deliver beautiful sermons and then come home and lock young Ingmar in a cupboard. He was told that a monster that ate children's feet lived in the darkness (Young, p.17). There is a scene in which Thomas tells Marta that his father pressured him into religion mirroring the director's feelings about this father. As they speak, a train rolls by and the wagons look like giant coffins. The subject of God as a spider is brought up and Thomas says that everytime he tries to witness God he sees only the monster. This is another reference to the incongruity between the teachings of Christianity and the realities of the world. Algot, someone who works with Thomas is seen as a kind of angel. He is unashamedly faithful and tries to give this faith to pastor. In their conversation, there is a parallel driven between Thomas and Jesus. Christ in his final moments was abandoned by his disciples, he was nailed to the cross and when he cried out to God he got no answer. The point being that if Jesus himself suffered this fate without getting a sign from God, it's as if Thomas had been abandoned and had faced God's silence too. In the end, there is a kind of stirring of renewed faith or at least an acceptance of what it is as Thomas leads the church in prayer. With only one person attending the service he decides to perform his rituals because all people including Christ in the garden struggle with the silence of God.\nTo sum up, the movie is one of the most personal works for Ingmar Bergman as it reflects his innermost thoughts on religion. It seems that all the characters in his work are troubled in nature. This must be how it feels to live in such a cold country where light is dimmed for most of the year and it tends to reflect in the cinematography of the region. Through the characters, film arises questions that in the world where we have legitimate fears of a world where we could all be destroyed: why isn't God helping us? Why God has abandoned us? Why does God has let life have no meaning? Because if we do blow up in a nuclear disaster as a fisherman was worried, life would have had no meaning to some extent. This is kind of a fear that religion has to deal with. Would the world be any different if there wasn't a God? The fact that we can't know it is the true test of faith.Works Cited\nYoung, Barbara.

            "review_title": "Drama that makes an atheist empathy",
            "content": "Ingmar Bergman, swedish classical director, has authentic Scandinavian style. Close-up shots, smooth transitions, merciless fate of heroes - all are endemic features of the Scandinavian cinematography of that age. This movie, the second of the so called \"Bergman's faith trilogy\" was directed without any exception. The film tells us the story of the experiences at a tipping point of a protestant clergy - pastor Tomas Ericson, starred by director's favorite Gunnar Bjornstrand. It covers such crucial aspects of worship as sacrifices, inner sufferings, search for answers, silence of God, also exposing inner kitchen of a church work.\nThis review will address cinematic methods and specific tricks that are utilized in order convey socio - religious cases and show that \"Winter light\" is a decent drama that makes even atheist empathy.Draining routine service and life of Tomas.\nRelevant cinematic moves support in developing a topic . For instance, in the opening scenes, we are introduced to the movie setting - the beginning of the day, morning service in the premises of a small town protestant church. Close-up shots of unethusiasticly broadcasting pastor Tomas, and of parishioners one by one; coming to church means different things to each of them. We see a young boy playing around, bored grandfather, some sinner, who bashfully lowered his gaze and a girl full of hope. The shooting angle visualizes the distinct pastor to parishioners relationship by putting Tomas on a higher setting.\nAfter, we meet Marta Lundberg. Being an atheist, she prays the God asking for the meaning of life in the form of reciprocal love and offers to be his humble servant. This fact is mirrored in her love letter to pastor; and to emphasize feelings, Marta's close-up is captured in frame. It alternates Tomas' reading scene.\nThey say \"Doubt is a death sentence for a faith\". After the death of his beloved wife, Tomas has lost the meaning of his life, presumably, as well as his true faith in God.\nTomas even demotivates his visitor, Jonas Peterson, when he was in need, by theorizing on the thought of Silence of God, implying God's inexistence. An interesting setting comes with the bad news of suicide of the forementioned Jonas: the noise of the flowing water drowns out the sounds of conversations. Probably, it symbolizes the storm of thoughts and mental sufferings per hero's soul.\nAccording to Ion's parable, true faith is known in suffering. Though, the Gospel is mentioned by deacon Algot as counter argument to this belief. It may seem little odd that a deacon educates the pastor himself on the meaning of recently read Gospel. Anyways, it leads Tomas to a new thoughts, that maybe it is his serving, maybe the Silence of God is the suffering, the burden that he needs to carry.\nEvening service, no one in the church probably as a feedback to the soulless pastor serving. There is nobody except for loving Marta, sacred pastor, deacon, clergy musician and the feeling of a reborn new faith.8/10",

            "content": "I have always wondered what is it about Bergman that so many people acclaimed. After watching many of his films I'm still wondering as I haven't got a response yet. To those who like the technical aspects of his film making, I'll say I have seen many better ones. There's very little ingenuity to his camera movement, which is always too slow to impress me, his use of light is no better than that of silent movies made decades before and he always seems to abuse the length of many of his close-ups that are unnecessarily eternal. The acting in most of his movies is simply adequate, never of an Oscar-winning quality. And, as for his stories, well...that's probably the worst part. In Winter Light there's really no story, or is there? All we see is a man who's lost his faith fighting his inner demons in a self-destructive manner. I don't recall ever having drawn any positive pointers from any of Bergman's movies. His world is a desperate one where not even the slightest glimmer of hope is ever offered. His characters are always tortured and never seem able to find a solution or relief to their inner anguish. What's his message? That we may as well either kill ourselves or continue to live a pointless life? That no matter how hard we search our soul there's never gonna be an answer to our questions and doubts? I don't recall ever finding a light moment in his films. There's never a respite, a funny moment, a shadow of a better future. With Bergman there's never a light at the end of the tunnel. I, for one, really despise Bergman's hopeless universe and refuse to allow myself to be drawn into it. It's great to watch a movie that makes you think, but when it ends abruptly, as is the case with Winter Light, leaving everything unsolved after little or no consequential storytelling, what can you gain from that? There's not even the hint of a moral to this story, it's just another depressing, pointless exercise by a guy that must have had a very sorry life indeed. Don't watch it unless you're looking for another reason to commit suicide!",

            "review_title": "Austere and gripping.",
            "content": "\"Winter Light\" (also known, more accurately, as \"The Communicants\") is the the central film in Bergman's \"faith\" trilogy (following \"Through a Glass Darkly\" and preceding \"The Silence\").  It is austere and minimalist to a point that should lose an audience's interest; but it doesn't -- in fact, quite the contrary -- it is one of the most gripping films I've ever seen (and probably my favorite Bergman movie).  Bergman, aided by cinematographer Sven Nykvist and performances by Gunnar Bjornstrand and Ingrid Thulin, has created a small masterpiece about a village priest who finds \"God's silence\" intolerable.  It contains one of the most daringly anti-cinematic alienation effects I've ever witnessed: Marta (Ingrid Thulin) has written Tomas (Gunnar Bjornstrand) a letter -- as he begins to read it, Bergman cuts to a medium close-up of Thulin who then proceeds to read the letter out loud directly to the camera for a full five minutes (with one brief flash back cut).  I wish I understood why this sequence pays off so well, I only know that it does.  But as brilliant as Bergman is (and as daring a risk as this choice was), certainly Thulin's performance has a great deal to do with the power of the scene.While watching \"Winter Light\" in conjunction with the first and third parts of the trilogy is a fascinating experience, the film stands alone beautifully.  At any rate, the films are only thematically connected: the \"plots\" function independently.  \"Winter Light\" may not be for those uninitiated in Bergman films (it lacks the grandeur of \"The Seventh Seal\" and the sweet optimism of \"Wild Strawberries\"), but for those in the mood, it is the most rewarding of his movies.",

Normally it's because I spot something interesting and I feel like... Nice, I've learnt something new. Bergman's style is just flawless, though. He set a whole journey through life in just a church and a school, plus few short scenes in: a car, a wood and a house full of children. Some transitions (fade in/fade out) are more meaningful than a picture. I was impressed by one where a \"skull and bones\" fades out and makes space for a close-up profile of the priest, approaching quickly his desk. I can't really add anything to such a widely appreciated work and all I can do is to suggest this movie to anyone.",

            "content": "The sound of a church bell fills the air with as much resonance as the crippling doubt of questioning one's faith. The way the sound reverberates in the air is reminiscent of the debilitating blow of a thought that one can't release from their mind. When that thought is doubting the faith you vowed to protect and project, it becomes nearly crippling. This conundrum is exactly what Ingmar Bergman presents in his 1963 film Winter Light. Starring Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand as Tomas Ericsson, the small town priest in the throes of a crisis of faith, and Ingrid Thulin as a school teacher willing to substitute her love in exchange for God's in Tomas' life. In a deeply moving and powerful film, Winter Light is just one of the prime examples in Bergman's oeuvre that cement him as the filmmaking giant he is.On a cold day, in the heart of winter, Pastor Thomas Ericsson finds himself preaching to a nearly empty church. One of the members of the congregation, sure to always be in attendance, is schoolteacher M\u00e4rta Lundberg. M\u00e4rta is in love with Tomas, but the death of his wife two years prior has left him unable to love another person and has left him in a bitter state towards God, as well. Also among the attendees are Karin Persson (Gunnel Lindblom) and Jonas Persson (Max von Sydow). Karin seeks out Tomas to counsel her husband who has recently been consumed by an existential crisis after learning that China has atomic bomb capabilities. Desperate to ease her husband's anxiety, Karin begs Tomas to renew Jonas' faith in God and talk him away from the suicide he has been contemplating. Unfortunately for all involved, the only lens Tomas can see through is his own doubt and fractured relationship with religion. Jonas, sensing this lack of faith, leaves Tomas with more anxiety than he came to him with. The weight of doubt brings Tomas, who is expected to be the leader of the church, to a point where he is discussing the future of his theological pursuits with those charged with maintaining the church.Winter Light was a film I wasn't ready for. Ingmar Bergman has over a dozen classics tied to his name, but this wasn't one that I had personally heard of in that group. Obviously, it sticks out as a part of Bergman's religious trilogy, the films in which he deals most with man's relationship to God. The barren dismal landscape of the winter outdoors is echoed inside the church as the bodies lining the pews are topped with desperate faces, bored and lacking interest in the church service. Bergman's blocking is fantastic, often photographing his distraught priest standing in doorways, much as he's standing at a precipice regarding faith in his own life. For believers, God is a welcome sight, the actualization of an idea that fills one with hope and purpose, no matter how. There is much symbolism in Christianity regarding hands. The hands of man are to do the work of Christ, as often alluded to, especially in regards to Joseph (the husband of Mary, Mother of Jesus) and his profession as a carpenter. Likewise, in Winter Light, hands are the focus of Bergman's camera throughout the entire film. It is M\u00e4rta's hands that are attacked by a rash that disgusts Tomas so much, he avoids her. Tomas's hands shake and falter as he goes about this day, much like his faith has been shaken so much that he is hopeful no one will attend church services at his dwindling congregation so he doesn't have to perform mass. Every time Tomas's hands are interacting with God, he is unable to perform his task. Thomas's hands visibly shake when he is attempting to counsel Jonas. His hands also shake so badly he is unable to put the letter M\u00e4rta sent to him back in the envelope after reading its heartbreaking content. The intentional focus on hands is carried on as we see the hands of M\u00e4rta as she dries the tears of regret falling from Tomas's eyes. Bringing such focused religious symbolism to a film that questions the limits of faith shows not only the incredible directorial prowess of Ingmar Bergman but also reveals a tenderness of his toward a subject he questions. Winter Light is a methodically beautiful look at one of the biggest questions in life by perhaps the perfect person to use his camera to search for the answers.",

            "review_title": "Stunning cinema for serious viewers",
            "content": "\"Winter Light\" is simply stunning cinema. Ingmar Bergman realized this was the film (with the arguable exception of \"Fanny and Alexander\") that satisfied him most among his entire body of work. And this was not a casual remark made by a director to promote his film soon after he made it, it was instead a written statement he made 25 years after the film was made. Viewing the black and white film a few days after Bergman died, I could not but agree with his view. It is a great film from a great director. It is a film that average audiences might never appreciate. Even Bergman's wife (at that time) found it dreary. It would make sense to viewers familiar with theology (Bergman was the rebellious son of a Lutheran priest) and much of the gravity of the film will be lost to those unfamiliar with the issues presented in the film. Yet it is film that would provide adequate material to atheists and believers alike in equal measure. It's a thinking-person's film.Most critics bypass this particular work of Bergman for good reasons. It is totally devoid of music, if you discount the church bells and the organ played in the church. It does not have the hypnotic visual allure of \"The Seventh Seal\" or of \"Sawdust and Tinsel.\" It has unusually long sequences of actors speaking into the camera. Its actors are all ugly, anti-heroic, and stunted (even the beautiful blonde Ingrid Thulin appears here in major role as a homely brunette destined to remain a spinster).It's a film about suicide, about physical suffering, and about cold Scandinavian winters. Like David Lean's \"Ryan's Daughter\" and John Huston's fascinating adaptation of Tennessee Williams' \"The Night of the Iguana\", this film too is populated with anti-heroes, cripples and losers. Finally, the film is overtly theological. All these are facets of cinema that rarely makes viewers sit up these days.Why then is this movie stunning?It has an absolutely flawless structure for its screenplay. It begins and ends with a church service. The number of worshipers seems to diminish towards the end of the movie but the few believers are stronger in faith. The scene after opening service and the scene before the final service are both in the vestry. The middle sections take the action out of the church. This structure would have pleased the ancient Greek playwrights and Shakespeare alike. Every scene, every sequence is carefully created. You remove one and the whole film collapses. The use of light and shadows is awesome in each scene. Each scene provides fodder for reflection. Take the scene where the priest and his lover stop at a level crossing. The line spoken by the priest is that he entered priesthood because his father told him to become one. An innocent statement if you do not know Bergman was the son of a priest and that \"Through a Glass Darkly\" the previous work in the trilogy ended with a crucial conversation on God between a father and his son. The spoken words throughout are intense and often interlink this film with Bergman's previous film in the trilogy \"Through a Glass Darkly,\" where the leading lady having a nervous breakdown has visions of God as a spider. In \"Winter Light,\" the connection is made with the words of the priest: \"Every time I confronted God with the realities I witnessed - he turned into something ugly and revolting. A spider god, a monster. So I fled from the light, clutching my image to myself in the dark.\"Similarly the link to the next film in the trilogy \"The Silence,\" is made by the words: \"When Jesus was nailed to the cross -and hung there in torment - he cried out -\"God, my God!\" \"Why hast thou forsaken me?\" He cried out as loud as he could. He thought that his heavenly father had abandoned him. He believed everything he'd ever preached was a lie. The moments before he died, Christ was seized by doubt. Surely that must have been his greatest hardship? God's silence.\" Doubt about the existence of God is the underlying theme of the Bergman trilogy. It is not a coincidence that the main character is called Rev. Tomas after Thomas the doubting Apostle who refused to believe in Jesus resurrection until he put his finger in his Jesus' nail wounds. The film's end offers both a comforting interpretation to non-believers and another one to believers. When Bergman wrote the script, he was rebelling against his father who was a devout believer. The end of the film was crafted by Bergman after he saw his old father insisting on all the prayers said in a church when the regular priest was too ill to say them. Non-believers will argue that in the final scene of \"Winter Light,\" the priest who knew he could not honestly help a man about to commit suicide, lamely continues his vocation without conviction. Believers will interpret the same scene to mean that the wretched priest realizes that silence from God does not mean that God does not exist but that he has to toil and suffer with added conviction and begin once again with a single worshiper to populate the near empty church. We can surmise that the priest will marry again because his new wife will now not be struck by his \"indifference to (his) Jesus Christ\" and that the crippled sexton finds a new supporter for his viewpoint that physical pain is easier to bear than loneliness.Either way, the film offers considerable option for a sensitive, intelligent viewer.",

            "content": "Winter Light tells the story, in one continuous day, of a country priest's struggles with his faith and emotions. Tomas, the priest, lost his wife several years before the beginning of the film and now exists as a bitter, hollowed-out shell of himself. He runs a sparsely attended parish in the countryside, though he himself seems to have lost his faith, or else be on the very brink of doing so. This setup takes the ritualized nature of the services to a new extreme, with a man who does not believe the words he is saying going through the motions with a dwindling flock of adherents.Early on, Tomas meets with Jonas, an existentially troubled parishioner in whom Tomas clearly sees something of himself and, perhaps, a key to Tomas's own anguish. Yet, Tomas can offer no solace to Jonas. To the contrary, the film raises the question of whether Tomas's interactions with Jonas actually cause the situation to deteriorate further. Throughout the film, Tomas also interacts with Karin, a rather obsessive past love interest towards whom Tomas now exhibits little but vitriol. Indeed, Winter Light contains one of the most brutally hurtful segments of dialogue in any Bergman film.Overall, the narrative is intriguing, but the relationship between Tomas and Karin is confused and, like many films of the genre, the crisis of faith can be difficult to empathize with for the nonbeliever, particularly given how steeped in the Christian tradition this rendering is. The script is tightly woven and, despite many opportunities, the film actually tends to avoid much of the philosophical proselytizing dialogue found in many of Bergman's films. Winter Light successfully captures a man on the brink of emptiness, though for reasons I have difficulty articulating, it lacked the emotional impact I was expecting. Perhaps the emotional letdown is because the film's unrelenting bleakness throughout approaches something close to sterility by the end.",

The movie has to do in a day in the life of Lutheran Pastor Thomas Ericsson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, who's just about had it with the church whom he feels after all these years of being part of it let him and the world at large down. This all started some 25 years ago when he was involved-preaching for peace-in the Spanish Civil War and witnessed the horrors in it. Now in 1962 he's confronted with a gaunt and suicidal looking Jonas who's terrified that the Communist Chines well soon detonate-they did in 1964- an atomic bomb that will lead to WWIII.After giving Jonas his usual BS story about love and peace, that he in fact doesn't at all believe in, being the way to go the poor man leaves his chapel and on his way home sits down by a tree and blows his brains out. This is nothing compared to what Thomas is later confronted with in middle age spinster & substitute teacher Marta Lundberg, Ingrid Thulin, who was hiding behind the curtains who shows up and gives him this long and boring story about how much she loves the guy and wants him to marry her, in a letter she mailed him, before he himself who's in danger of contracting pneumonia kicks off.It's here in regard to the sobbing Marta that Thomas, who looked like he had already one foot in the grave, suddenly comes alive and lets all his feeling about God and Marta as well as the world situation come to the surface. In that the man of God doesn't believe in anything good anymore and just wants to start a new life as a carpenter or druggist in town and forget all that he was thought in divinity school that he now feel was total BS. Marta for her part instead of getting more depressed sees that the man she's in love with and wants his support is in fact far more screwed up in the head then she ever was or even possibly will be.***SPOILERS*** The by now totally out of it Thomas after letting it all out in the wash now goes back to give his speech to those assembled in his church, about a half dozen, about the glory of God and how the entire world is filled with it. Which earlier he had totally rejected as a by now understanding Marta realizes just how off the wall he is being one of the few listening in on his sermon. The world is what we not God makes it which is why we were given free will to do good or bad without his-God's-interference or influence in our actions. Strak black & white photography as well as bleak wintry scenery makes this Bergman film far more depressing then it really is. After seeing it you feel that there's no hope for the world and mankind. But it's Thomas suddenly realizing that's the way it's supposed to be in order to overcome one's depressions, like it seemed that Marta did, that it makes life worth both living as well as suffering through it.",

            "content": "As usual, 'Nattvardsg\u00e4sterna' (aka 'Winter Light') is your typical Ingmar Bergman film. Slow, monotonous and dialogue-heavy to a fault, yet rewarding for the patient (or, better yet, the VERY patient) viewer by means of its highly intelligent, even thought-provoking discussions it creates.I'm no fan of Bergman, that is to be said. He is a bit TOO slow and dull, to the point I usually watch his films on fast forward. And the 'reward', while good, rarely is worthy of sitting through over an hour of intense monotony.Yet, when tackling religious themes, I find Bergman to be much more bearable. This, 'Det sjunde inseglet' (aka 'The Seventh Seal') and 'Jungfruk\u00e4llan' ('The Virgin Spring') are the only ones I've seen yet that were truly remarkable. His main characters are religious, yet face belief-shattering situations that make them question; he questions religion, yet never flat-out attacks or dismisses it but leaves it in a way the viewer is to decide. Just like his own struggle with faith in real life.In here, he does so by means of a priest (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) who is losing his faith. His confrontation with a depressed farmer (Max von Sydow), who tries to turn to the faith to quench his worries, as well as his romance with an atheist teacher (Ingrid Thulin) pave way for his increasing doubts. The ending dialogue with the church's sexton, in special, is brilliant and one of my favorite moments.The acting is great all-around. Not only do they rend their speeches (both dialogue and monologues) impeccably, they all convey the seriousness and the grim mood of their characters and situations. The fact they manage to keep things slow and monotonous (i.e..: no one goes out of their way to steal the show, or overact) is proof of their success.If one can get past the boredom of his films, Ingmar Bergman was undoubtedly a great director. But that is exactly the problem: cinema is supposed, first of all, to be a means of entertainment. How can you entertain with such a slow, monotone film? Even if you are trying to relay a message, to generate a thought-provoking reflection, how are you supposed to reach for the casual viewer, how are you supposed to make a wider audience interested in your work? This is a problem Bergman, as well as most 'art' directors, have always ignored.While good, and far more entertaining than Bergman's usual, 'Nattvardsg\u00e4sterna' still suffers from the same faults as his entire filmography. Still, being both bearable and rewarding, this is one of his best.",

            "content": "On first viewing I was less affected by this than by 'Through a Glass Darkly', which opens the trilogy, though a number of critics rank it higher, and a couple call it one of the greatest films ever made. So I owe it a re-see. Certainly, once again the acting is terrific, and the cinematography superb. More even than 'Through a Glass Darkly' this film mines the subtle shadings of the human face to an almost supernatural degree. But this film goes back to Bergman's tendency to be very on-the-nose with his themes. Here it's the story itself. A pastor has lost his faith, in the face of God's silence at the dark things of life. But in this story, just about everyone has surrendered to that sort of hopeless depression, so the film feels more one note, more talky and 'heady' than 'Through a Glass Darkly', if more quite and subtle in its approach than the early Bergman works. It's not just that the characters don't change that bothers me, its that it feels clear from the outset there is no hope of change, which made me feel I'd gotten the power of the film's questioning and aching loss (which is still considerable) long before its final moments. None-the-less, how nice to see any film that is about the big questions, and addresses them in a serious, beautifully made way. And I do find it haunting me since I've seen it.",

            "content": "\"Winter light\" is the second film in the \"Silence of God trilogy\" of Ingmar Bergman. The other two films are \"Through a glass darkly\" (1961) and \"The silence\" (1963).The film is about a village pastor (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) who, after losing his wife, also loses his faith. He therefore is no longer capable of:\ngiving consolation;\nreceiving consolation.The character of the pastor has something in common with the priest in \"Diary pf a country priest\" (1951, Robert Bresson).The inability to give consolation is illustrated in relation to the parishioner Jonas (Max von Sydow), who is very afraid of a nuclear war destroying the earth. The film was made a year after the Cuba crisis, so this episode seems rather dated. What matters is however not the source of the fear but the inability of the pastor to give comfort.The inability to receive consolation is illustrated in the relationship between the pastor and Ingrid Thulin. Thulin tries so hard to comfort the pastor after his loss that one can only conclude that she must be in love with him. The pastor however coldly rejects all her attempts. In a brilliant 9 minutes scene Thulin reads out a letter she has written to the pastor, looking straight into the camera. Really a \"tour de force\" by Thulin.\"Winter light\" begins with a poorly attended church service and ends in the same way. In between there is a cold winterday full of doubt and despair. The ending contains no signs that the next day will be any better. Sounds pretty boring, and that was my conclusion when I saw the film for the first time. At second glance however it was one of the best films about loneliness I ever saw.There is a long monolgue of the bell ringer of the church, that perfectly summarises the theme of the film. According to the bell ringer the suffering of Jesus is not in the first place about physical pain (being disabled the bell ringer is of the opinion he has had as much physical pain as Jesus and during a much longer time) but the psychological pain. A psychological pain because his discipels have abandoned him and he thinks his father has forsaken him.\"Winter light\" is also cinematographically very beautiful, with the cold winter light falling through the church windows.",

            "review_title": "God's Silence",
            "content": "From an all-involving guardian of social order and an architect of public opinion to a more and more marginalized part of one's secular life, many argue that the Church and the extent of its influence have been declining around the world. We see this overall trend depicted through one man's personal crisis of faith in Ingmar Bergman's 1963 classic, Winter Light. Bergman tastefully depicts pastor Tomas' struggles with his identity not only as a believer, but as a clergyman as well. For Tomas, his turbulent relationship with his faith seems to stem from, as described by the pastor himself, God's silence in regard to him. After finishing the mass, the pastor meets with Karin and her husband, Jonas. Karin tells Tomas that her husband has become distressed and disengaged upon finding out that China is building atomic bombs capable of mass destruction. Tomas attempts to comfort Jonas but does so unsuccessfully since he is going through a test of faith of his own. Finally, Jonas ends up committing suicide and the tormented feelings of the pastor after this event propel the movie in its further attempt of depicting a clergyman's struggle with God's silence.\nThough released more than 50 years ago, Winter Light is more than relevant today as more and more of us become distanced from highly institutionalized religious rituals and grapple with teachings of traditional religions. This notion of debating and questioning the nature of the religion and its counterparts applies to Christianity very well. As we know, the main schisms of the religion took place because the opinions of followers or religious leaders began to diverge when it came to questions like Jesus' identity and the role of the Church at large. If such examinations of the religious teachings lead to such substantive events such as the creation of various branches of Christianity, it's no surprise that even the clergymen may find themselves questioning the strength of their faith. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is the conversation between pastor Ericsson and Algot Frovik that revolved around the moment of Christ's crucifixion. In that scene, Algot argues that Jesus' worst hardship was not the physical pain, but rather the feeling of abandonment and that his preaching has turned out to be nothing but a lie. This seems to resonate with Tomas as he himself feels his connection to God shaken and his belief weakened. On the other hand, this also applies to the larger issue of the nature of Jesus Christ and how that question has led to years and years of debate in the Christian community. If indeed, as put by Algot, Jesus felt abandoned and questioned the truthfulness of his teachings, wouldn't that make him human like the rest of us? If one assumes that Jesus is one with God, does one also believe that God himself went through all of those feelings? The question of nature of Jesus is one of the many issues that have been a subject of debate and inspection in the Christian community. Though we never really find out what exactly makes pastor Ericsson question his beliefs, we can see how certain aspects of the Christian doctrine can propel some followers to search for more clarity and information.\nIncreasingly with a rapidly broadening scope of scientific human knowledge, more and more people seem to start questioning not only the logic and soundness of certain religious teachings, but also the moral underpinnings of those beliefs. While many people seem to succeed in weaving together their religious beliefs and parts of their identity as feminists, representatives of the LGBTQ+ community or scientists, many choose to leave their religious beliefs behind. Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light does an incredible job of depicting one man's journey through a personal crisis of faith and what it means to the larger society if that man is also a clergyman tasked with preaching the very values, he is found himself questioning. However, one could also argue that this movie is larger than a single character, this is also a movie about human perception of God at large, not really God himself, since as put forward by the pastor himself, the Father is silent in this film. The intricacies of human relationship with higher powers is tastefully depicted through the heart-wrenching speech of an atheist in love with a pastor represented by Martha, a thoughtful interpretation of Christ's struggles by the Church sexton represented by Algot, and a silent inner struggle and bitterness of a pastor preaching to a shrinking congregation represented by Tomas. This extremely well-edited film makes the viewers focus on the dialogues and inner struggles of all characters, especially the masterful depictions of Marta by the magnificent Ingrid Thulin and of pastor Ericsson by the incredible Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand. Overall, Winter Light is not only an incredibly visually satisfying watch, but also presents interesting food for thought about our perception and relation to God.",

            "review_title": "Movie Review: Winter Light",
            "content": "Winter Light is Ingmar Bergman's movie that tells a story about a doubting pastor named Tomas. Throughout the movie, it is possible to observe his doubts regarding religion and how these doubts affected surrounding people. Interestingly, Ingmar Bergman had a complex relationship with his father, who was a minister at the church. Therefore, it seems that Bergman transformed his complex relationship with father into the conflict with religion and God. This movie review will focus on factors that made Tomas doubt the existence of God and conclude that every man should come to the faith on his own without the outside pressure.The movie starts with a pastor Tomas, who was serving communion at the church. The beginning of the Winter Light already gives hints about the main theme of the film. Namely, during the service at the church, some people did not care about what was happening in there: the organist was always distracted and he was either yawning or looking at the watch. Another man was too busy with counting donations. By showing these two men, Bergman wants to illustrate that the church has already lost its sacred meaning and he doubts whether God is in this place.As the movie goes on, it is possible to observe how Bergman constantly tries to connect love with religion. For instance, Tomas was happily married to the women he loved. However, when she died, it seems that he lost the meaning of his life. He told to Marta that he died with his wife as well. It seems that the love between Tomas and his wife allowed him to be a pastor and help other people. He was able to be a caring man who loves the surrounding people. However, as a result of the death of his wife, it became much more difficult for him to love the neighbor and be a carrying man. Therefore, he as a pastor lost the ability to help those who were in trouble. For example, one of the church members, Jonas, was worried about the possibility of war. His wife, Karin, wanted him to talk to the pastor about his worries. Although Jonas talked to the pastor, it did not help him, so he committed suicide. This example shows that Tomas was not able to help people anymore. As a pastor, he was not able to find the right words that could have helped Jonas.Maybe the root of the problem was much deeper. Maybe being a pastor was not Tomas' destiny and this was the factor that made him doubt religion rather than the death of his wife. This argument becomes especially valid since he told Marta that his parents always wanted him to become a pastor. In other words, being a pastor was his parents' desire and he was not the one who made that decision. Maybe that is why he is not persuasive in being a pastor and other people, including Jonas, did not trust him. Even Marta, the woman who loved him, confessed in her letter that she never believed in his religion. As I watched these scenes, I realized that every man should come to faith on his own, without the outside pressure. In this case, only the man will become a true believer.Although Tomas started doubting the existence of God as a result of his silence, it is possible to argue that to some extent Algot helped the pastor to resolve his crisis. When Algot talked to Tomas, he started expressing his opinion on the suffering of Jesus. Algot believes that people overestimate the physical suffering of Jesus. This is because the physical pain, which lasted only for several hours, was not the main aspect that made Jesus suffer, but rather the silence of God, who did not react to the situation. However, Jesus had no other choice but to continue to believe and this is what everyone else is left to do as well. When Tomas heard Algot's reasoning, he decides to begin the service at the church, where he claims that everything at the earth is full of God's glory. Therefore, despite the silence of God, Tomas continued the service at the church, just like Jesus continued to believe.Probably in the ending scene when Tomas decides to begin the service Ingmar Bergman tries to tell that all questions related to faith or religion are entirely in the power of man himself. The pastor's parents indeed wanted him to become a pastor. Maybe because being a pastor was not entirely his own decision, Tomas had a crisis and started questioning the existence of God. However, at the end of the film, Tomas made his own decision when Algot asks whether they should have service since people did not come. Tomas decides himself begin the service despite God's silence and maybe this is how he came to faith on his own.",

            "content": "Film history is no stranger to religion. From biblical allegory in the character of Maria in Metropolis to the silent meditation of last year's Polish film Ida, European films have grappled with the question of creed and God's existence. In these films, the faith-filled characters often experience harsh realities and go through tests of faith. The films of Ingmar Bergman are normally rich with religious themes. In 1957, he made The Seventh Seal, which centers on a man who contemplates his existence while playing a game of chess with death. Three years later, The Virgin Spring ends in a father proclaiming to God that he will build a church in atonement for his vengeful sins. He continues this tradition in his 1963 film Winter Light. The film explores a character who is plagued with doubt. He is struggling to find meaning in a world of pain and suffering. In the end, he does not reach a clear revelation about his faith, but he does evolve spiritually as well as learn that despair is never the path to follow. The central issue of the film, namely the balance between hope and doubt, is elucidated through the constant struggle of faith the main character goes through. The movie is, in one respect, a study on a pastor who is trying to find out who he is. He is searching for meaning beyond his monotonous life. The movie does not treat memory as the primary function of identity, nor does it treat physical appearance or even personality as what makes a character who he or she is. The film instead emphasizes that which gives a character's life meaning: God or something else. Ingmar Bergman has stated that he put a lot of himself in the movie. He was the son of a strict priest and grew up around religious artifacts, teachings, and customs. He said that he lost his faith at an early age and came to terms with that fact in the making of Winter Light. Perhaps he, like Tomas, became familiar with despair but never let it defeat him, and in making this film he is giving both a lesson and a warning \u2013 religious or not, without something to live for, life is not worth living.",

            "content": "This film is without doubt one of Bergman's best. I am especially fond of his minimalistic films with a small cast, simple scenery, and a condensed story. \"Nattvardsg\u00e4sterna\" belongs to this category together with \"S\u00e5som i en spegel\" and \"Tystnaden\". The photo by Nyqvist is also remarkable, almost a reason enough to watch this film.If we turn to the story, things get rather complex. As so often, Bergman puts a lot of focus on religious issues, in this film very explicitly, even more that in \"Det sjunde inseglet\" in my opinion. For me personally, not being religious at all, these issues themselves are not that exciting. However, I usually enjoy Bergman despite this since there is often in this quest for the understanding of God a deeper and raw connection with feelings which I can relate to from a secular perspective. \"S\u00e5som i en spegel\" is my favorite in this respect. \"Nattvardsg\u00e4sterna\" has a lot of strength in this respect also, but religion gets \"in the way\" for me.But even if I have harder to connect with this film on a personal level, I truly enjoy the high demand the film puts on the viewer's intellect. This is a film with many interpretations which, at least for me, required multiple viewings to uncover. The sufferings of Jesus are central to the story, not his physical pain but more his mental pain of knowing that his words were unheard and that his sudden doubt of God's well-meaning, maybe even existence. But exactly how the characters of the film fit into this story is not clear, much so since the priest is a complex character that seems to undergo sudden changes during the film.So a film for both mind and eyes, no doubt. And although the religious issues are a bit too explicit for my taste in this film, there are other dimensions that makes it well worth seeing. A better film in my taste is, as said above, \"S\u00e5som i en spegel\".",

Thomas (the pastor) is a man who fails to deliver fiery sermons simply because he has lost his faith and is going through an infernally spiritual conflict. Even when Jonas (Max Von Sidow) comes to seek his help, he fails to offer him any help whatsoever. Instead, he even intensifies the crisis he is going through and soothes his doubt about the coming holocaust and leads him onto the path of suicide, the idea of which he had been long entertaining in his mind. Embattled and agonized by his religious doubts, Thomas tries to avoid the amorous hints of Marta who keeps lavishing her attention on him.In this film, Bergman is intent on offering a solution to man's dilemma: religious doubt, which is even justified by Jesus' doubts on the cross. Jesus' statement on the cross 'O God, O God! Why hast Thou forsaken me?' reverberates throughout the play as if the whole characters are experiencing the same spiritual ordeal as Jesus Christ. There are times in every man's life when he comes to question God's justice; God is silent to man's sufferings. It is like God is silently watching the sorrows and sufferings of man without actually wishing to do anything about them.Man in the universe is remotely far from God, the Creator. This is the point where his spiritual crisis begins. Bergman believes that man has to come closer to God through love in order that he may achieve peace of mind.",

            "content": "It's rural Sweden in 1962. Outside, in the grey, icy winds of winter's light, the radio brings news of the newest addition to world madness: the Chinese State news has announced that they now have THE BOMB and will use it if anyone tries to attack them. This news has become the final straw for a man in Vicar Tomas Ericsson's flock. As the good Pastor speaks to his flock before offering the communion of Christ's body and blood, Jonas Persson and his wife Karin come up to take their wafer and wine.Jonas has become deeply depressed by what is happening in the world. It seems to Jonas that God doesn't care about the very possible annihilation of the human race by their own hand. Perhaps Jonas has discovered that when he prays, he is talking to himself. Perhaps Jonas has a chemical imbalance in his brain which makes him more sensitive to the plight of humanity than others. In any event, Jonas has been acting strangely and he needs to speak with someone who might comfort him with the love of Christ or so thinks Karin, his wife. After the church service is over, Karin asks Pastor Ericsson to speak with Jonas.Tomas is very unsure of his place in the world. Like Jonas, Tomas has been in the process of losing his faith. He looks at the tortured, bloody Christ on the wall of his church and shudders at the absurdity this bizarre image now implies to him. Tomas is wondering why God has never spoken to him.M\u00e4rta speaks with Tomas, sometimes even more than Tomas wants her to. She loves Tomas; but M\u00e4rta is not a believer. Nevertheless, M\u00e4rta wants Tomas to love her, not just make love to her. She sees in him a man of caring integrity. Tomas cannot return her love. Like his religion, for him true love only comes around once. Thus, he cannot betray his wife, even though his wife has been dead for years. He can sleep with M\u00e4rta and has done for years; but he cannot love her.\"Winter Light\" follows \"Through a Glass Darkly\" as the second in Bergman's introspective, existentialist examination of meaning in life. It is a film about love and how love relates to God and how that if God is silent, this may be an indication that God is dead. But dead to whom?M\u00e4rta obviously is capable of love. So is Karin. The question is, \"Why can't Jonas and Tomas see what's before their eyes?\" Why do these men of high integrity and moral sensitivity turn away from love and life? Is it a question of being so concentrated on the distant perfection of the forest for so long that they cannot see the trees in front of their face anymore? Toward the end of the film, a simple church member who has been crippled rather severely for years comes to the good pastor and asks him a theological question, a question of faith, a question about Jesus:Algot Fr\u00f6vik, Sexton: The passion of Christ, his suffering... Wouldn't you say the focus on his suffering is all wrong? Tomas Ericsson, Pastor: What do you mean? Algot Fr\u00f6vik, Sexton: This emphasis on physical pain. It couldn't have been all that bad. It may sound presumptuous of me - but in my humble way, I've suffered as much physical pain as Jesus. And his torments were rather brief. Lasting some four hours, I gather? I feel that he was tormented far worse on an other level. Maybe I've got it all wrong. But just think of Gethsemane, Vicar. Christ's disciples fell asleep. They hadn't understood the meaning of the last supper, or anything. And when the servants of the law appeared, they ran away. And Peter denied him. Christ had known his disciples for three years. They'd lived together day in and day out - but they never grasped what he meant. They abandoned him, to the last man. And he was left alone. That must have been painful. Realizing that no one understands. To be abandoned when you need someone to rely on - that must be excruciatingly painful. But the worse was yet to come. When Jesus was nailed to the cross - and hung there in torment - he cried out - \"God, my God!\" \"Why hast thou forsaken me?\" He cried out as loud as he could. He thought that his heavenly father had abandoned him. He believed everything he'd ever preached was a lie. The moments before he died, Christ was seized by doubt. Surely that must have been his greatest hardship? God's silence.Tomas Ericsson, Pastor: Yes...\"I think I have made just one picture that I really like, and that is Winter Light\u0085Everything is exactly as I wanted to have it, in every second of this picture.\" \u0096 Ingmar Bergman See this film.

            "content": "One of the first Swedish films I have ever seen is a drama called Winter Light directed by Ingmar Bergman in 1963. In spite of black and white cinematography, the film is simple without any special effects which suggests that the director aimed to send a message not to impress viewers. Even though there could be a potential for the film to be boring, he included the dramatic changes with the help of actors' performance in displaying intense emotions through dialogues and monologues. The director uses human faces and emotions to speak out. The film is about the story of Pastor Tomas Ericsson who works in a rural Swedish church who experiences a crisis of questioning his religious belief.\nThe film begins from him giving his service to people including Perssons family and substitute teacher Marta Lundberg who was atheist and desperately in love with the clergyman despite his neglect. After the service, Jonas Persson with his pregnant wife Karin came to speak to him. They asked the pastor to help him to fix his consideration of taking his life while Tomas shares with Jonas about his doubt of God's existence. Later, Jonas committed a suicide by shooting himself. This is point of pastor's failure. The director emphasizes that the understanding of God is not that simple and a pastor who is considered to be a religious wisdom also confused whether the faith is all about love or it can be associated with suffering. It is related to the role of priests in the Middle Ages which often held secular influence as well as spiritual power because of perception of inherited authority. This piece of writing argues that although the pastor functions as he supposed to do by giving his service, his failure of religious faith can be used to question his authoritative position as priests held during the Medieval Christianity.\nIt is important to begin with Pastor Tomas's performing as a priest in the church, which means that he still accomplishes his main role and can be considered as a person with authority. He helps to followers of the religion to perform the Christian rite called communion involving the eating of bread and drinking wine when Tomas says \"The body of our Jesus Christ, which was given for you and The Blood of Christ, shed for\"(5min47sec). He also prepares sermons which can be seen from the beginning of the film. It shows that he as a priest performs well by connecting followers with religion to recognize Jesus and thank God for all He's done.\nHowever, he fails to answer the needs of society in spiritual terms because of his internal crisis of faith. Karin Persson comes to pastor Tomas with her husband to change his mind committing suicide which happened after Jonas hearing the news about China preparing atomic bomb. The pastor was not able to help him because he began to question the existence of God which is impossible to be done by spiritual leader. He claimed that \"I put my faith in an improbable and private image of a fatherly God. One who loved mankind, of course, but me most of all...He returned in a spider God, a monster. If there is no God, would it make any difference?...There is no creator, no sustainer of life, no design\", which shows that before Tomas pastor's religious faith was based on his belief in being loved by God (40min20sec). However, it has changed because he was suffering since his wife's death and God's silence which means the absence of help to relieve his pain made him confused.\nAnother factor that invalidates the authority of pastor is his affairs with atheist Marta which should not happen to be. Even the pastor rejects and hurts her, she still stays as a part of his everyday life. The character who is used by the director to reveal the problem in the pastor's faith is when a handicapped sexton Algot. He is the enlightened one who claims that the faith in God accustomed not only with love but also with sufferings which can be seen form Jesus Christ's crucifix to whom God also did not answer. God's silence does not mean that pastor Tomas should stop believing in God but it can be another form of price of his religious faith. It can be related to the name of the film that the faith is a light. The light can be grayish and gloomy in winter as the faith can be full of sufferings. This shows that even realization of the essence of religious belief was not afforded by the pastor without the help of Algot. Thus, pastor Tomas's previous rejection of God and his doubts in religious faith show that he does not correspond to the position of priest.\nThe fact that Tomas is not suitable for this position also can be revealed by the comparison with a Christian bishop Timothy of Baghdad in Medieval Christianity. According to Apology of Patriarch Timothy of Baghdad, he is depicted as a bishop who fully devoted his life to religious belief and to spread Christianity. He said that \"This belief in one God, O my sovereign, I have learned from Torah, from the Prophets and from the Gospel, I stand by it and shall die in it\", which shows his undeniable faith in God and the fact that he was not afraid to uphold his faith in front of a Muslim caliph also supports his correspondence to this position (p.232). During the Medieval Ages, priests were powerful religious leaders who even consulted the king in state affairs when they become bishops. They were the ones who had very strong faith in God and without any doubt they generated the practice of religious rituals. Also, the pastor's attitude towards women, in this case Marta, also contributes to question his human nature. Even though he did not want to be with her, it does not justify his cruelty to woman who helps and loves him. This also can contribute to the idea that truly religious person would avoid mistreatment of women or any other individual.\nIn conclusion, the given analysis of the pastor's role in the film and during Medieval Christianity which can be seen from the comparison with Timothy of Baghdad shows that recently qualifications of the person assigned to this position can be questioned. The personality of pastor Tomas and his position as the one who connects religious followers with God does not correlate. It also suggests about the importance of expanding your religious knowledge because Algot was able to see the different forms of religious faith because he was reading the Gospels.References:\nApology of Patriarch Timothy of Baghdad before the Caliph Mahdi.

The central issue which the Minister is dealing with is whether God exists. A particularly memorable part of the movie is the discussion in one of the last scenes between the Minister and his helper, about Jesus' suffering.

            "review_title": "Does God Exist?",
            "content": "The story begins with Tomas Ericsson, the pastor of a small Swedish church, performing his usual Sunday service for a small group of attendants. After the service, a young couple, Karin and Jonas Persson, approaches Tomas with a request to help Jonas overcome his existential crisis. Whereas such an inquiry is not a rare occurence in church, Tomas still fails at convincing Jonas not to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Marta Lundberg, another church attendant, confesses her love to Tomas but gets rejected as the pastor's only love is his deceased wife. The film ends with the conversation of the sexton, Algot, with Tomas about the Passion of Christ.\nI found Winter Light to offer a rather insightful representation of a religious man having doubts regarding their faith. How can someone like a pastor even question the existence of God? By focusing on human imperfectness, like that apparent in Tomas's character, the director conveys the key message - anyone can find God if they truly believe in God despite any suffering they have been subject to.\nAs presented in the film, Tomas suffers from several misfortunes - his illness, the death of his wife, and the silence of his God. The intertwining of these hardships result in the creation of strong doubts regarding the pastor's faith. God does not answer Tomas's prayers but takes away his beloved and leaves him ill in a half-filled church. Surely, such circumstances only amplify his confusion and make him rethink his beliefs. Does God exist if he no longer answers Tomas's prayers?\nFull of despair, the pastor then portrays an image of a bad Christian. He stops or even never begins trying to find his way back. This is evident in his relationship with his friend Marta. Tomas rejects Marta's love - not in a polite way, but he is actually disgusted by her. The placement of her rashes remind him of the wounds Jesus Christ had at his crucifixion. Her deep love for him arguably makes her a better Christian than Tomas. Essentially, Tomas is jealous of Marta, and a couple of questions spark his mind. Why does she receive more possibilities of doing good deeds while not even believing in God? Does then God really exist if he is silent to me, a pastor?\nHowever, what Tomas does not notice is that he is too focused on his past. His doubts made him behave contrary to his past actions. In one sense, he becomes an incompetent pastor. \"Love your neighbour as yourself\" (Mark 12:30-31); - Tomas's rude behaviour towards Marta is not the only example of his blasphemous deeds. The way he consoled Jonas, a father of four children and a husband to a pregnant wife, indeed showcases a turning point of Tomas's faith. The pastor does not even try to change things - he does not talk Jonas out of taking up his own life. Instead, he decides to share with Jonas that God does not exist.T his way, Tomas fails at his Christian duty of 'conversion'.\nInterestingly, Winter Light is shot in a simplistic manner, with the camera movement reduced to a minimum. This was done in order to shift the viewer's focus completely onto the characters and their personalities, their faiths. Using this method allowed the viewers to observe how none of the church's attendants are actually involved in their faith of Christianity. Possibly, their own life misfortunes, just like those of Tomas's, created existential doubts and apathy.\nAnother observation, made feasible because of the close up shots, is that Tomas never smiled throughout the whole film. Personally, I think that this signals to Tomas not being happy with his current doubteous state of mind. Considering the level of his misfortunes, he could have been depressed. This can explain his unwillingness towards attempting to gain his faith back, which makes Tomas, a pastor in post-war Sweden, a rather relatable character. Personally, I find the events of the film to be highly plausible as I think that one's well being plays a huge part in their faith.\nHowever, the last scene makes it clear that Tomas successfully overcomes his doubts and regains his faith. The sexton reminds Tomas of how Jesus Christ suffered while being crucified. He howled, begged for help, asked God to relieve him of the pain - however God was silent. Only some time later was Jesus free and entered the Kingdom of Heaven. Tomas, therefore, finally finds his long awaited answer - his faith must be bigger than his sufferings in order to find his way back to God.\nTo sum up, Winter Light is a deeply personal film. I believe that one might find a totally different interpretation of Tomas and his actions, and they will not be wrong. The film does not promote atheism and neither does it give more credit to Christianity. Instead, it demonstrates the journey of a pastor who loses hope but finds it again in love - love for his God and faith.",

            "review_title": "Highly recommended",
            "content": "This is a feature film, not a documentary, which makes a viewer find his/her own meaning of the presented story. Black and white picture also creates a certain mood and adds depth to the film. It tells a story about a pastor who doubts the existence of God. So, in this movie review, I will share my impressions while watching and the thoughts I stayed with afterward.\nWhat attracted my attention at the beginning of the movie is people during the service. First of all, it is an extremely low number. I have noticed that the church is designed to accommodate a sufficient number of people while there were only about 6-7 people during the service, however, it is more about their behavior rather than quantity. They do not take the prayer seriously. One of the church workers is coughing and straightening the tie; an old lady sees an opportunity to sing than to turn to God; a man who recognizes that the Gospel of Mark is a good sleeping pill. Moreover, there was a child among all the other parishioners during the service, nevertheless, he was extremely bored and did not know what to do. It leads me to the idea that although his mother tried to instill the religion starting from childhood, she did not explain the point of what was happening around. In addition, during the scene at the school, you can see the cross on the piano in the classroom which also can support the idea of instilling Christianity in children. A musician who provided musical accompaniment on the organ and perceives this all as a part of routine work, constantly distracting, checking the clock and looking forward to the end of the service. By the end of the movie he also shares that the church was full of people when he was giving organ music concerts. So, taking into consideration all the beforementioned facts, I suppose that the director used these small details in order to show that people of that time did not take religion seriously and perceived the church not as a sacred place where they can establish a connection with God, but as a place of entertainment and a chance to socialize and communicate with other people. This is also important to take into account Thomas's recognition that no one is interested in him as a priest and those around him are only interested in his personal life.\nThe plot of the film also reveals the life of the priests from another side. What they do right after the prayer is the calculation of donations. They keep accurate records of all the received money. Nevertheless, it did not seem like they invest in church development. The director shows a scene in which the deplorable state of the sculpture of the crucifixion of Jesus can be visible. The presence of a new car at the church's reverend and the fact that Thomas was looking for a housekeeper also casts doubt on their honesty while, traditionally, the priests are perceived as an agent between man and God and the ones who renounce the worldly pleasures and desires.\nOne of the main themes of the movie were priest Tomas's personal feelings. As it was mentioned before, he is supposed to be a religious leader who performs rituals (i.e. prayers) and connects people with the deities. However, here the question arises: how he can be a connecting link if he doubts the existence of God? When a man with suicidal thoughts comes for advice, the priest suggests trusting God and, at the same time, he constantly says that \"God seems to be so far away\" or \"I feel helplessness\". In addition, he admitted that his parents wanted him to become a priest, it was not his personal choice. Throughout the plot of the film, Thomas goes from the disappointment in God after losing his wife, and the meaning of life with her, to gaining faith again. He felt the silence of God, but after talking to the church worker who just read a part of the Gospel of Mark about Jesus's death, I believe that he reconsidered his attitude towards this silence and put himself on the place of Jesus who also did not hear God. As a result, he held a prayer for his own sake, and not for parishioners, since no one came to the service at that time.\nTo sum all of the above, this movie is worth watching not only for those who take the religion course but for the common public also. Small details such as the color of the picture, character development and right depiction of the characters make this movie a true masterpiece where everyone can find his/her own explanation of what was happening in the film. To conclude, as it was discussed during the lectures and seminars, the common public did not fully understand the meaning of religion and followed it as a part of \"herd instinct\" and I believe that this was the main idea the director tried to demonstrate. On the other hand, it teaches to look at things much deeper and demonstrates that even the priest can doubt his faith, and everyone has his/her own way.",

            "content": "When thinking about faith among the people during the previous century, it's hard to picture individuals who bear a firm skepticism towards the existence and significance of God, since it was such a big driving force for the majority. Ingmar Bergman is one of these skeptics, as he uses Winter Light to detail a pastor's deep disbelief towards God's existence. It's easy to imagine a non-believer simply claiming that (within the context of faith) good people aren't rewarded, bad people do not suffer, and that most of the famous religious principles are just built around a false sense of hope. Bergman avoids this trope; by portraying the sheer amount of torment that the pastor's conflicted feelings bring him, the audience is forced to think a little harder on how much of a detriment it is for the faith in God to be able to sedate so many people in a growing world. There are times during the film where the differences between religious principles and reality are just spelled out, and this helps so much in reinforcing the danger in blind belief. This concept heavily dawns on the pastor, since he also can't look to love as a proof of God's existence anymore.\"The silence of God\" is one of the film's major themes. This was something I really liked, since the question of \"God, where are you?\" (or anything along those lines) has plagued so many believers for as long as religion has existed. The silence itself can be hard to cope with but it can lead to a feeling of acceptance, as shown in the film. I would like to think of it as a form of submission but at that point, what else can anyone do about it? Just my two cents.I find that the acting in old movies can be difficult to judge, because I can't always tell if the performances are so realistic, or so good that they're real. Either way, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand (the pastor) blows it out of the water here. Winter Light showed me that he's an actor who knows the balance between traditional dramatic acting and emoting without verbalizing. Bj\u00f6rnstrand portrayed the internal struggle of his character so well that I really sympathized and related with him. Ingrid Thulin (the schoolteacher) is also great in this film, as she gives a couple gut-wrenching performances here and there. It helps that Winter Light doesn't completely obey the traditional film structure. Long takes, extended dialogue/monologue scenes; these are the things that emphasized the talent between these two individuals. There's a sequence where Thulin's character is talking directly to the camera for about five minutes or so. Where else are you going to see that? How often in film does that even happen? Bergman completely puts aside the feelings of the audience and forces us into that moment to absorb everything.I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to religious type of films because I haven't watched that many and I'm also not a religious person. Though in trying to label Winter Light as a purely religion-based movie, it should also be noted that this is one of Bergman's projects where he drew aspects from his own life during its creation. The fact that this film feels very personal only adds on to the effect it had on me. In the end, I really enjoyed how cold and \"real\" it was. Just like The Seventh Seal, this Bergman title achieves a lot despite its short runtime, while still retaining its cinematic values.",

However, he is stopped by visitors being disabled person, a concerned family couple and his close friend Marta.

The events of nuclear bombings created a backslash as the technology being the motivator of the optimistic worldview of the society, revealed itself to be the weapon that can erase millions of lifes. It is reminiscent of the poem on the Lisbon Disaster written by Voltair where he was arguing:\n\"Everything is at war: the elements, animals and men...\nHow should we think of God, goodness itself?\nWho lavishes gifts upon the children he loves...\"Importantly, the film references this event - Thomas was a clergyman in Lisbon during the next disaster, the Spanish Civil War.The depiction of the pastor Thomas being not as strong as people around and viewers are expecting him to be was crucial for me. His body weakness being him ill, his weakness of conviction being him not able to persuade second visitor Jonas to keep faith and even his further assertions of egotistical reasons to believe in God evoke the weak faith of people in humanity and God. Jonas is concerned with the atomic bomb developed by Chinese. In the beginning, the words written in the Bible that Thomas tells Jonas do not help him overcome his fears. As Jonas finally looks into the eyes of the pastor and asks \"Why do we have to go living?\", Thomas looks down at his table, not able to proceed with convincing Jonas.\nHis depression makes him to commit a suicide, the act condemned by his religion.The film is worthy of watching its depiction of the harsh realities to which religion should be confronted and the ways it portrays the lives of ordinary people clashing with the impactful societal problems gives important questions to address to yourself. Because who knows if we \"must trust God\"?.",

            "content": "The \"Winter Light\" by Ingmar Bergman is one of his well-known films on religion and the associated hurdles that people may experience in their attempts of making sense of the world. It is a story that unravels in just a couple of hours and that depicts the life of a pastor Ericsson played by a magnificent and incomparable actor, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, his life and his struggles. Indeed, it is only a small part of the day that has in it the fears of the people and their hopes. It is a hard time that these people live in that makes the religious theme relevant for them. The overall impression that I have is that it is a very well-planned, captivating and informative picture that evokes a range of emotions and that is palatable for a wide audience. Even though it is considered as a part of trilogy on a related theme, the movie plot along with the play of the actors makes it very concise and self-sufficient to be watched by almost anyone.\nThe movie is well-thought-out and each of the scenes flow smoothly one into another. The scenes deliver the cold aura of the time that is shown as hopeless and uncertain. The play of the actors is wonderful and it clearly depicts the personal problems of each of the heroes and how they depend on each other living in a small town. It is a microscopic view of the daily problems of the society as a whole that is based on real-life stories. It presents the lifestyle of the time when people need hope and search for it within themselves and in other people. Each of the heroes needs a hope, some have already found it, some have lost it and others are still in search.\nThe constant fight between the reality and the dreams is present throughout the movie. There are explicit contrasts that display the instability of the time and the ways people try to cope with their insecurities and make sense of their present. The different lenses that the characters look through into this world show the difficulty of interpretation of the events that happen in the world. The fears that people have are real, so are the vulnerabilities and strengths that follow it. I particularly liked the slow yet unpredictable rhythm of the movie and the way the plot develops. It is minimalistic yet sufficient in its details. It makes one to worry about the fate of each of the individual characters at the moment of hopelessness. In addition, the people are shot as if there is a larger distance between them while they may be sitting next to each other. This can be seen in the dialogue between the pastor and Marta and enhance the idea of loneliness. The heartbreaking monologue by Marta further touches this theme and is probably one of the most convincing scenes of the movie that also touches you the most with its sincerity, emotions and words.\nThe \"Winter Light\" offers an insight into the problems that many of us may be trying to avoid and not acknowledge ourselves. It makes us look within in search of the answers for our own questions about our attitudes towards life, relationships with the people that we interact with and whether or not we are satisfied with the life that we have created and who is in charge of it. Some people may avoid it by means of one's occupation or hobbies, but in the world that these people live in it is hard to imagine that they can simply opt out from this kind of life. Especially this is true for a person in charge of transmitting the God's will and leading people. This creates a sense of compassion for the pastor and the life that he has to live and so does it create compassion for oneself. It turns out eventually that it is uncertainty and silence that break this harmony.\nThe silence pervades everything in the movie and can be felt in many ways in the scenes and the dialogues. It is a silence of the person who is not able to confess, the silence about the future and it is the silence that can be disturbed only by one thing. It seems like it is only love that can make one realize the value of life and make any sense out of it. It is the unconditional love for the family, the love for God or the love for someone. When the love is over, however, it makes one to wander and struggle to look for the answers. It makes one to question his or her own values and previous views.\nIn the end, I see this movie as a successful attempt in displaying the true struggles of the characters and the idea of the meaning of life. It makes us empathize the characters of the movie using a language that can be understood by a wide audience and its ideas are relatable to many of us.",

            "content": "\"The Winter Light\" is a compelling drama accompanied with a well-structured, complex plot and a unique filming technique that contributed in showing parallels drawn between main characters and religious figures and in raising an issue on the existence of God at that time. The film is linked especially to the \"Gospel of Mark\" as it includes a dialogue regarding the \"Passover Seder\", in which Jesus institutes the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist, and regarding the crucifixion of Jesus.Before I start with the analysis, I would like to give a short plot summary of the movie. It was filmed in 1963 in Sweden by Ingmar Bergman. The movie concentrates on the Pastor Tomas Ericsson (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) who has an existential crisis and is struggling with his faith. The movie starts with the Pastor giving a service to some people, after which a married couple who attended his service, Jonas Persson (Max von Sydow) and his wife, Karin (Gunnel Lindblom) come to the Pastor and ask him to help Mr. Persson. During the talk between Tomas and Jonas, which was held later at the same day, Pastor understands that Mr. Persson is afraid of possible future nuclear war but in order to console him, Pastor, who by himself is not sure of his faith, tells Jonas that he does not think that God exists. He afterwards suggests that the world would be much understandable if God did not exist, after saying which Jonas goes away and commits a suicide. After attending the crime scene, Tomas and Marta have a conversation in a Marta's classroom, during which Pastor finally tells her that he never loved her, in response to which Marta still keeps caring and loving Tomas. Near the end of the movie, Algot, the handicapped sexton, questions Tomas about one of the parts from the Gospel regarding Jesus crucifixion: mainly, Algot talks about the worst suffering of the Christ, which was not experiencing the betrayal of his disciples but being abandoned by God, to which point Pastor agrees, and afterwards, gives a service in a room of no people except for Marta.\nFirst, I would like to consider the plot of the movie, which, I think, was structured very well. To be more exact, I was fascinated by how the director made a parallel between the Pastor Tomas and Jesus Christ. The parallel is seen from the dialogue between Pastor and Algot near the end of the movie where Algot questions the physical suffering of Jesus. There is a common feature between the Christ and the Pastor in that they both doubted on whether God exists or not and that they both were abandoned by God, and it is this \"silence of the God\" that was a great suffering to experience for both of them. Moreover, the parallel is also drawn between Marta and the Disciples of Christ: in other words, the Disciples knew Jesus for many years but were not able to understand him similarly as Marta who knew Tomas for a long time but was not able to understand him. Even though, according to Algot, this suffering was not the worst for the Christ or for the Pastor in comparison to being abandoned by God:\"He thought that his heavenly father had abandoned him. He believed everything he had ever preached was a lie. In the moments before he dies, Christ was seized by doubt. Surely that must have been his greatest hardship? God's silence.\"In other words, the God's silence was considered as the greatest suffering for both of them. In general, creating such kind of relation of some of the main characters to religious figures contributed to improving the quality of the plot, and thus, increased my interest in watching this film. I could notice and better understand all the abovementioned parallels, along with the phrases that were constantly repeated by the main characters such as: \"God, why have you forsaken me?\", \"God's silence\", meaning of which kept me curious during the whole process of watching the movie.\nAdditionally, I admired the well-constructed plot also because it shows various perspectives on the existence of God. Near the end of the movie, a character named Fredrik mentioned to Marta that \"Love shows the existence of God\". Not all characters in the movie shared this idea: for example, Tomas did not seem to support this idea as he still committed suicide because of the fear of future nuclear war. If instead Tomas admitted that love indicates the existence of God, he would not presumably commit a suicide because he has a loving wife and children. On the contrary, we can also observe throughout the movie that Pastor shares an idea that love shows the existence of God because he used to love his wife and when she died, he lost this love to some extent (and her love as well) so that he is not able to love someone, and thus, God is silent and does not exist for him.Another important thing that I liked about the movie is a simple and unique style in which the movie was filmed. To be more exact, this unique way of how operators used the camera is that there was no single movement of camera but only zooming in and out of the camera focus. For instance, there was a zooming in of the focus during the dialogue between Algot and Pastor near the end of the film, in which the focus kept changing by zooming in towards only Algot (presumably to show that he is going to say an important thing) and towards both characters. This style contributes to making the audience pay attention to important details of the film. In general, throughout the movie, we can observe many zooming in actions especially during important and intense dialogues.Overall, this is a great movie with a well-thought out script and filming style that raises important life questions like regarding faith and meaning of life. If you are looking for a good drama that also contains a captivating story and raises religious issues in it, this is undoubtedly the right movie for you.",

            "review_title": "Characters' images",
            "content": "Winter Light is one of the films produced in 1963 by Ingmar Bergman, a Swedish film director. Bergman produced religious films, especially about man's relationship with God and was nominated for Oscar several times. In this film, Bergman shows personal struggles of Tomas, a pastor of a local protestant church. Throughout the film, Tomas is concerned with his poor relationship with God, insincere faith, and meaningless life. He realizes that everything went down right after he lost his wife. His wife, as he discovered, was the meaning of his life and the source of his faith. Tomas still loves his wife and cannot be with Martha, a school teacher that fell in love with Tomas. In this film, Ingmar Bergman uses different techniques and tools to make this film very depressive for the audience, as it was planned. Black and White theme, lack of music, lack of communication, cold shades, strict and boring styles of the main characters, and dynamic use of shadows contribute to the Bergman's plan to focus more on thoughts, dreams, and problems of the main character. Besides all these aspects of the film, I would like to elaborate more on how images of the characters impact the mood of the audience and their perception. By images of the characters I mean their clothes, hair styles, and facial expressions.I think that Bergman successfully picked up the clothing for the main characters in his film, such as Tomas the priest, Martha, Mr. and Mrs. Persson, and an old woman. All the characters are dressed in the dark colors. This can be seen from one of the fragments in the film, where people drink holy water from the hands of the pastor during the Sunday service. Since it is a winter, characters wear oversized clothes such as dark cloaks and trench coats. Men wear dark costumes and women wear hats, which makes their outfits look humble and even boring, Every detail contributes to the mood of the film: simple design and the texture of fabric, straight silhouette and muted colors. Accessories such as bags, scarves, hats, and ties were also in the dark and gray shades.Another important visual factor is facial expressions of each character. Their facial expressions reveal their concerns, problems, desires, and attitudes toward religion. Tomas, the main character, has a long face and he is depicted as exhausted, sick, and depressed person. Mr. Persson has a hopeless facial expression and it is evident that he has an anxiety. He is afraid of Chinese people and he wants to kill himself. His wife, in turn, has a hope that priest will help her husband because she is concerned with his poor state. She has very sad but more confident facial expression. Martha, in turn, has a desperate facial expression. Although she looks at the priest, reads the bible, and attends the Sunday services, her facial expression demonstrates me that she is not interested in religion at all. It is written on her face that she is confused with everything that is going on in her personal life. Lastly, the old woman that came to the Church with a little boy, has the most depressive facial expression. She almost cries during the service. She prays so hard and I can see that probably she or her relatives had some sins and they are trying to emancipate themselves.Generally, Winter light is a very cold and depressive film. Ingmar Bergman could effectively create images for his characters to illustrate such a depressive mood of the film. Clothes are relevant to that period of time and relevant to people's lifestyle. Their images accurately represent their status. Facial expressions of the characters were mostly negative and they were constant from the beginning till the end of the film. Such a plan helped the author to create a negative mood for this film. It is like a simple sequence: facial expressions of the characters affect the characters' mood and their mood, I turn, create the mood of the whole film.This film contains mostly sad and cruel moments and it wasn't really pleasurable for me to watch this film. However, I understand that the author didn't make this film for an entertainment. It is not a mainstream film that has a broad audience, it is an art-house. This film can be strange and hardly understandable for some people. Therefore, Winter Light was meant to be produced for certain groups of people. Bergman, wanted to show how people always challenge the rightness and wrongness of their actions, how people feel when they loose the faith and meaning of life. I'm not sure, would I recommend this film to others or not. It is difficult to rate it but one thing is clear, this film is very personal and it can touch people's hearts.",

            "content": "One does not need to have endured a strict, religious upbringing to be captivated by the immense power of Winter Light. We all experience a yearning for spiritual peace in one way or another. Even still, at some point in our lives we must come face to face with the cruelties of an indifferent universe. Tomas is a man being crushed beneath the weight of his faith. It's a vice grip squeezing out every ounce of life left in him. He can no longer feel God's love, and so he refuses to accept any earthly substitute. He instead chooses to slowly hate himself to death in defiance of his creator's silence. The meaninglessness of his existence infects his soul and manifests in tangible sickness of his physical body.Apparently Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand was suffering from tuberculosis in real life and Bergman had him on medication that instead of alleviating his illness, actually served to exasperate it. Yikes. This sociopathic disregard for a life long friend was in service to what Bergman often referred to as his most personal film, and the one he considers perfect. It's not hard to see why. Every frame of this stark and brutal masterpiece is considered and consequential. The cinematography is gray and shadowless, and yet Sven Nykvist can't help but sneak in moments of profound beauty into the void. Is it Bergman's greatest work? I'm not sure. However, It's impossible to deny the mastery of form and vision on display here.",

            "content": "I saw this film again recently. The first time I watched it I was more taken with the scene of Max von Sydow, when he visits the priest. I was amazed how the priest confirms his Godless suspicions. I think the original title of this film is God's Silence and this goes with the movie around that point. The English title is Winter Light, and that is a more optimistic title, perhaps they needed that for American audiences? Nevertheless, the film does have a positive ending. I don't want to spoil it by saying how, but it's not all dark and hopeless as you go through long sequences of despair with broken relationships and characters struggling with their relationship or understanding of the existence of God.I think that if you're a deep person that's asked yourselves these questions in the past or presently, then you would relate to this film. Otherwise if you don't care about these big questions, then you probably won't care about this film either. Ingmar Berman deals with these questions in many of his other films too such as Seventh Seal, but here he does so in a different way, with this priest. I prefer this take because it's less theatrical.",

Like Through a Glass Darkly (1961) and The Silence (1963), they daunt a presence of melancholy, absence and dissolution over faith. Looking back, I find Winter Light the most poignant of the three and in particular with its architecture. The silent atmospheres within the church and foggy outsides are felt between the walls. It is a cold winter with ghostly lights, gothic like.The lighting of shadows, shapes and movement coincide into Bergman fashion. Its sensitive, quiet and imbued in coldness. The film doesn't ask you to walk or run with it, but rather to sit and to listen. Within these moments, we become distil in communion. Characters here are sincere enough to know that all questions are not answered. We look at their faces and see it; we listen to what they say. This is in all Bergman's greatest: the ability to listen.In the third act, our priest spills his thoughts and feelings through a monologue. Brokenly absorbed but expressed. In the end, we are resulted back to a communion, something that all the characters return to as well; a place to hold onto, if not spiritually, then communally.Looking back, there seems to be a feeling and muse of a dark reverie. It films the present invisibility of faith in the characters. Its use of camera, set, people, and stillness, there is a collective beautify to it, and keeps it in this trilogy as a lasting work.",
