            "content": "One of my favorite films from the seventies is The Taking of Pelham One, Two Three because it's so New York. Of course the film was shot entirely on location in The Big Apple including the interiors which helped greatly. But more than that, the characters have all the New York flavor about them with one exception.The cat of course is led by Walter Matthau who plays a Transit Police Lieutenant. His character is a kind of combination of Archie Bunker and Detective Lennie Briscoe from Law and Order, in many ways not terribly admirable. He's also a transit cop and at that time the Transit Police were a separate entity. They were merged into the regular NYPD during the Giuliani administration. There's no real glory in the Transit Police, these guys were mostly charged with dealing with drunks and kids with loud boom boxes. If a homicide ever occurred the NYPD quickly took it over as they would in most situations. But this ongoing crisis on a train on the Lexington Avenue Local occurs on his watch and it's career make or break case that Matthau is very aware of. And he proves fully capable during the crisis.The crisis is four men, Robert Shaw, Earl Hindman, Hector Elizondo, and Martin Balsam mount a carefully planned assault on a subway train out of Pelham Bay station in the Bronx in mid-Manhattan and hold it and the passengers for ransom for a million dollars. The outsider to New York is Robert Shaw in one of his best roles, a former British army officer and mercenary. During the course of the robbery they kill a station supervisor played by roly poly Tom Pedi, one very quintessential New Yorker and their coldblooded villainy is established.In fact the whole cast is a microcosm of the ethnic strains of New York City which makes the film so enjoyable, especially to one who lived there, the first 49 years of his life. Even the mayor is portrayed as a weak, fumbling nonentity and back then our mayor was one Abraham D. Beame who was just that, probably one of the worst mayors the city ever had. Tony Roberts has a very good role as the tough as nails Deputy Mayor concerned about both his boss's political career and resolving the crisis.The Taking of Pelham One Two Three once the hijack is done is suspense filled and doesn't let up for a moment. I can't give the ending away, but the final shot of Walter Matthau's face as the end title music starts and the credits begin to roll is priceless.",

            "content": "I suppose any era when you make the transition from child to adult is a tough one, but the 1970s was when I did, and New York was where. It wasn't a pretty time, with headlines like \"Ford To City: Drop Dead\" and about Kitty Genovese. At times the City seemed in free fall, and every adult's job consisted of ducking your head, walking into the oncoming storm, and keeping things working until the end of your shift. After that, it was some other adult's problem.That's why this movie is so good: it captures that moment in the City, when the cleaning was imperfect, adults expressed their frustration freely and profanely, and efforts by film crews to make sure there was no trash on the street when the cameras rolled were doomed to failure. All the men wear ties like they're nooses around their necks, and confronted with a gang of crooks which have taken over a subway train on New York Transit Police Lieutenant Walter Matthau's shift, he's the adult who has to deal with the problem. Joseph Sargent did such a good job, that it's been remade twice; each time, it's been a decent thriller, but little more, a dependable property. This version is the real deal.",

            "content": "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is one of those films plundered by movie magpie Quentin Tarantino, the director stealing the whole 'criminals with colours instead of names' idea for his debut Reservoir Dogs. It's easy to see why Pelham would appeal to QT: it's a gritty '70s thriller with a cool cult following, focusing on a group of violent ne'er-do-wells who carry out a daring hijack on a New York subway train. The dialogue is snappy, the cast is excellent, and David Shire's music is big, bold, brassy and badass.Leading the hijackers is Robert Shaw, whose cold, calculating Mr. Blue is truly chilling; on the side of the law is Transit Police Lt. Zachary Garber, played by Walter Matthau, whose job it is to converse with the criminals whilst trying to figure out who they are and how they plan to make their escape. Much of the movie consists of exchanges of dialogue between the two men, but don't make the mistake of thinking this is a dull blab-fest: the tension runs high throughout, the race to deliver the ransom money against the clock being a particularly exciting highlight. And with one of the hijackers a dangerous loose cannon (Hector Elizondo's Mr. Grey, surely the inspiration for Michael Madsen's Mr. Blonde), the potential for the loss of innocent life is ever present.A thrilling final act sees the train speeding out of control with the terrified passengers still on board, the gang having disembarked between stations. Meanwhile, Garber and his men tighten the net, and one-by-one the hijackers pay for their crime, with one death proving very shocking indeed. The fun continues right up to the final frame, an amusing ending that is nothing to be sneezed at.",

            "review_title": "A thrilling heist movie and a love letter to the New York City of our imaginations",
            "content": "This is a splendid film from a time when exciting movies still tried to mirror the real world instead of mimicking amusement park rides.On an ordinary day in that most extraordinary city of New York, 4 men hijack a subway car. Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw) is the leader of the gang, a precise and icy military man with no war to fight anymore. Mr. Brown (Earl Hindman) is one of his old comrades-in-arms. Mr. Green (Martin Balsam) is a disgraced subway motorman. Mr. Grey (Hector Elizondo) is a foolish and cocky former mob hit-man. They plan to hold the subway car and its 17 passengers hostage until the city gives them one million dollars. Opposing them are New York City transit police lieutenants Zachary Garber and Rico Patrone (Walter Matthau and Jerry Stiller), whose goals are to keep the hostages alive and figure out how the hijackers plan to escape from an underground tunnel surrounded by dozens and dozens of cops. But the dangerous and deadly crime drama has to share equal billing with a sprawling cast that embodies 1970s New York.That cast and their marvelous performances are really the standout element of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. It's not just Robert Shaw's cerebral precision as Mr. Blue or Walter Matthau's street smart practicality as Garber, virtually ever actor shines like a star when they're on screen. They're not just playing individual roles. They're playing the entire city of New York in all its facets - bold, angry, jaded, fearless, racist, profane, impatient, selfish, selfless, sometimes broken but never bowed. This is the New York that everyone loves, even the people who wouldn't want to live there. This is a New York where every day is a battle and every New Yorker is a battler. Even if the rest of the film was terrible, the atmosphere and personality of these characters would be worth seeing by itself.But the rest of it is just as good. The plot is clever, well thought out and fast moving. The direction is unpretentious but affecting. Many big screen films from the 70s look like TV movies by today's standards. That's not the case with The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The story generates tension and suspense without having to resort to cartoonish levels of violence or emotional hysteria. This is also a pretty funny movie, though none of the humor is jammed into the script just to get a laugh. It's the humor that real people use as a shield and a sword against the challenges they face in real life.As you may know, they did a remake of this. I haven't seen it and I certainly don't plan on it now after having seen the original. I'd bet money that the remake is bigger, louder, faster and more extravagant in every way than its predecessor. But I'd also bet money the remake is harsh everywhere the original is smooth, overwrought everywhere it's refined and aggressive everywhere it's inviting. Hollywood still tells good stories, but it seems to have lost the talent for telling this sort of story well. Action movies are now spectacles that assault you as you sit in the theater. The Taking of Pelham One Two Three creates a fuller and more varied experience that excites you without requiring you to turn off your brain.When people say they don't make movies like that any more, this is the kind of movie they're talking about. If you've never understood what that saying meant, watch this film and be enlightened.",

            "content": "I first learned of \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" in a film encyclopedia. Now that I've seen it, I'm impressed. This is what an action flick should be: plenty of suspense, and no explosions or scenes of people improbably escaping danger. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat every step of the way.Aside from that, a lot of what happens in the movie seems characteristic of New York. The subway is the obvious point, but there's also no shortage of grouchy characters, gritty settings, or other things that mark this as the Big Apple in the 1970s. Must've been fun to film.Aside from stars Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw, we have Martin Balsam (Arbogast in \"Psycho\"), H\u00e9ctor Elizondo (a frequent co-star of Garry Marshall's movies), James Broderick (Matthew's dad), Jerry Stiller (Ben's dad), Doris Roberts (the mom on \"Everybody Loves Raymond\") and Kenneth McMillan (the racist fireman in \"Ragtime\").Good one.",

            "content": "A group of criminals highjack a subway train and demand $1 million from New York City.  Transit cop, Lt. Garber tries to work the situation out, but it seems the gang have planned everything to the second and are running the show.  Garber tries to get one step ahead of the gang.Of course now everyone knows this film because of the supposed connection to Reservoir Dogs, in that the criminals are colour coded instead of names. However even without this cult reference this film deserves to be watched and enjoyed.  The story exists on two levels.  First we have the setup \u0096 it also acknowledges that it is the usual disaster movie setup\u0085.the majority of characters are listed in the credits as stereotypes instead of people (ie, `the pimp' `the junkie' etc).  However this is not a weakness as the thriller story is solid enough to carry the film.  It isn't all action but it's very tense and interesting.  What really tops it off is the thick vein of humour that runs through it \u0096 mostly coming from Matthau.Matthau shows how wonderful he is and how he manages to do well in so many different film styles.  His world-weary act is great and his Brooklyn accent is pushed to the fore.  Roberts Shaw is also good, but has less of a character and is working hard to sound English.  The cast is actually deep in faces \u0096 we have an almost unrecognisable Elizondo, Woody Allen actor Tony Roberts, a fantastic Mayor from Wallace and Jerry Stiller (Ben's dad), who doesn't look much older today than he did then!Overall this is very enjoyable, but it is made by Matthau.  The thriller plot stands up well despite the lack of modern fireworks.  A cult classic in the making.",

            "review_title": "New York State Of Crime",
            "content": "It takes a rough town to host a tough crime caper. New York City in its bankrupt \"Ford To City: Drop Dead\" period offers a compelling backdrop to the story of four desperate men who launch a scheme to make the city pay a million dollars by taking a subway car and its passengers hostage. It's a fascinating story with a lot of local color and a perfect distillation of suspense.Funny lines, too, not clever sitcom banter but real-life wisecracks from people used to living their lives in constant tension, delivered with all the electricity of New York Post headlines.\"Never say you're sorry,\" a senior conductor warns a young trainee. \"Someone might come out here and hit you in your damn nose.\"An angry trainmaster (Dick O'Neill), when reminded about the 18 hostages, replies: \"What do they expect for their lousy 35 cents, to live forever?\"When a senior transit cop named Lt. Garber (Walter Matthau) asks a colleague played by Jerry Stiller to tell some Japanese visitors about the kind of crime they have to deal with, Stiller's character replies: \"We had a bomb scare in the Bronx yesterday, but it turned out to be a cantaloupe.\"Matthau's role isn't the most challenging of his career, mostly he pushes a lot of buttons and talks into a microphone, but he throws up an array of great reaction shots, from his first moment of being woken from a catnap to his last, one of the most memorable of any 1970s film. I love his reaction when Stiller's Lt. Patrone character offers his theory of how the hijackers plan to get away with the loot by flying the subway to Cuba: \"You're a sick man, Rico.\"The real sick man in this movie is the great Robert Shaw as the lead hijacker, who goes by the alias Mr. Blue. Shaw excelled at playing functional psychopaths, not to mention dangerous train passengers, and here he keeps the suspense on a low boil throughout. He doesn't want to kill anyone, not because he's a nice guy, but because he's a perfectionist who doesn't want anything to upset his plans. This sets him at odds with his trigger-happy associate, Mr. Grey (H\u00e9ctor Elizondo).Matthau's got his own problem associate, the trainmaster who's probably feeling guilty about the subordinate he sent to visit the endangered car, and their back-and-forth makes clear this is a shaky bit of business for all concerned.Director Joseph Sargent makes a very dynamic, functional story hum with minimal drag. Another New York director of more artistic pedigree, say Sidney Lumet, would have made a great film from this John Godey novel, but he would have paused a bit for \"what-it-all-means\" moments. There's none of that here, but there are still many fine touches in the execution of this movie. I suspect Lumet got the idea for shooting his Washington Post interiors in \"All The President's Men\" from the gritty way the Transit Authority office is shot here, with those hot florescent lights that contrast so wonderfully with the dark subway scenes.What else to say? David Shire's masterful score will keep you on the edge of your seat whenever it starts up, and the editing by Gerald B. Greenberg and Robert Q. Lovett is up to the level of the scheming bad guys.If you want to see a movie that celebrates the Big Apple when all goes wrong, this is a place to go.",

            "content": "There are many disappointing action pictures out there \u2013 this is not one of them. The genius of the film is there is no wasted motion. The picture starts right with the plot \u2013 no introduction or character development. The characters are allowed to develop as the plot moves along.Which brings us to pacing \u2013 the pacing in this picture is excellent. It moves right along and never stops, never slows, never goes too fast. This is the strongest element of its success.Another strength is its economy of motion. Many action pictures bore us with unneeded car chase scenes, shoot-em-ups, explosions and other mayhems that are used as filler when true creativity comes up short. This film needs none of that. Only that which is necessary is shown. Only that which needs speaking is spoken. This film is deftly written and crafted with great economy and this underpins the excellent pacing. It moves right along because there is no wasted motion as there is in most other action pictures.This does not mean there is no action, there is fabulous action, but only such action as is necessary to move the plot along. There is no action simply to occupy time until the requisite 90 minutes are up.The directing is equally economical. No fancy shots, shaky cameras, or special effects \u2013 just good, straight forward directing.I doubt this picture could be made today for the above reasons. The script readers would reject it for 'lack of development'; 'not enough action'; 'no romantic interest'; and all the other brainless formulas script readers dole out. The producers would demand 'more action' and 'camera work' from the directors. And, of course, a romantic interest (in some state of undress) would have to be shoe horned in.Film students should study this picture. From it they will learn that brevity is a virtue and mindless formulas are just that - mindless.",

Matthau was right on spot in this film. He took charge and negotiated with the kidnappers, led by Robert Shaw. The back and forth was crisp and to the point. No wasted words. Shaw was also perfect, and one has to wonder how John Travolta will play this role out.This movie was tightly directed by Joseph Sargent without special effects and gadgets. It was a crime thriller that focused on the crime. It remains to be seen how Tony Scott can improve on this movie.",

            "content": "It is my belief that the finest era for films was the 1970's. Consider all the classics that were produced in that era (Godfather I and II, Patton, The Sting, Jaws, Mean Streets, The Exorcist, The French Connection, Star Wars etc). My belief was recently validated by Jodie Foster, who essentially said the same thing. One of the reasons why the films were great was that the directors were ostensibly in control of the films, rather than by a committee of the usual Hollywood \"insiders\" who think they know what people want to see, but rarely make the correct decisions.I know that this film was re-made( for TV)--God knows why--but I'm sure if they attempted another film version Matt Damon would be playing the grizzled transit police cop (Matthau's role) and Jude Law would be playing the Robert Shaw role. That's another reason why the original and other films of the 70's were so great: the casting was more believable. Today Hollywood is so incredibly youth-obsessed that actors are completely miscast.I am not stating that this is another 70's classic, but even this film is far superior to many of today's films. And yet, I'll bet you couldn't find \"Pelham\" in your local video store.I love several things about this film. The first thing to hit you is that wonderful, funky score that in some parts sounds like controlled chaos. I love the script, which is not completely dark despite the underlying theme, as there are some very funny moments throughout the film: for instance, the chagrined look on Matthau's face when he discovers the Japanese visitors can speak English. There are many examples of mistaken identity in this film: the supervisor who is gunned down is called \"goombah\", but he isn't Italian; Matthau thinks the black police captain is white over the radio; Matthau mistakes the long-haired undercover cop (who was shot on the train tracks) for a female. I also love the character who plays the mayor, who unbelievably bears a striking resemblance to Mayor Koch, who was elected 3 years later!!!! All in all a great action film, and one that will hold up for years.Addendum: Well, they're doing it--they're re-making this film because Hollywood is almost completely bereft of new ideas (see \"Josie and the Pussycats\" \"Bewitched\" the upcoming \"I Dream of Jeannie\"). I half-expect they will remake \"The Paper Chase\" next with P.Diddy as Professor Kingsfield.",

There was Mr. Brown and lastly Mr Blue who was a former transit employee who held a grudge against the authority and wasn't satisfied with his pension.Lieutenant Garber was the head of the transit security played by Walter Matthau who found himself the unfortunate go between or negotiator during the hostage stage. His New York dialect and humor was a great contrast to the methodical leader of the gang with the English accent who took himself very seriously and was prepared to kill anybody at any time in cold blood. Admittedly this type of negotiation would be ridiculous today, he wasn't even in anyway qualified to negotiate with the hijackers. Also, Garber not only had deal with Mr. Green but also found himself up against one of the head dispatchers who couldn't care less about the predicament of the hijacked passengers but was more concerned about getting his trains running on time. This approach would not cut it today 30 years on, hostage taking requires a more professional approach. However, he does his best and on a couple of occasions his quick thinking is able to save the lives of some the hostages.Anyway the crooks only wanted money, there was no political reason, but were highly motivated, very well organized and determined. This was understood very quickly when one of the subway station managers Caz Dolowicz or known as \"fat Caz\" took exception to these upstarts and decided berate the hijackers and board the train. Just to prove that the hijackers meant business they gave him a 'lead breakfast' and he was ripped apart by the hail of bullets discharged from an automatic weapon which made him look like a swiss cheese! It's great viewing, quite entertaining and has a very typical but jazzy 1970's music score that accompanies the movie. I would highly recommend this film, 70's movies don't get more interesting or as watch able as this.",

I've seen it countless times and never tire of it. In fact, I love so much I have deliberately avoided the Travolta/Washington remake so I can't pass comment there.It has a very simple but ingenious plot; four men hijack a New York subway train and hold 18 passengers hostage. The ransom is a million dollars and the getaway plan, considering they are in an underground tunnel, is perhaps the most ingenious part of the plot. Robert Shaw and Martin Balsam are two of the hi-jackers and Walter Matthau, the New York cop doing the negotiations but the whole cast are first-rate. This is a great ensemble piece, in front, as well as behind, the camera. Unmissable.",

            "content": "Tense thriller concerning a gang of four heavily armed extortionists, who systematically hijack a subway train and hold its passengers hostage for one million dollars. Robert Shaw is the cold blooded clinician who leads the motley crew, including Martin Balsam (I'd regard this as his best role) as an almost reluctant participant, Earl Hindman (pre \"Home Improvement\") as the compliant thug, and Hector Elizondo as the trigger happy psychopath. Walter Matthau is also good, albeit somewhat contained, as the transit detective negotiating for the hostages release.The supporting cast is first rate with Julius Harris, Dick O'Neill, Tony Roberts, Rudy Bond, Kenneth McMillan and Nathan George just to name a few. David Shire's frenetic score is memorable and director Joseph Sargent (his best film) keeps the action and suspense high throughout. Witty dialogue contains plenty of laughs (uniform to dispatcher \"they just shot him with a machine gun\", dispatcher \"is he dead?\", uniform \"wouldn't you be lieutenant?\") but the tone is never compromised - both Elizondo and in particular Shaw, create chilling characters promising to execute one hostage for every minute the ransom is late; e.g. Shaw's execution of one of the hostages as retribution for a sniper strike is performed with merciless efficiency.I initially responded to the idea of remaking this film with contempt - akin to turning this train thriller into a train wreck. And while the subsequent remakes (Vince Vaughn and John Travolta versions) have both been inferior, if they promote the original and introduce a new legion of fans, then it's a worthwhile exercise. From the NY pop culture, wardrobe and trends of the era, to the unique group of actors assembled, there's so much you can't replicate that the original can never be surpassed.",

            "review_title": "A Very Good Thriller About the Most Unlikely Crime of the Century!",
            "content": "\"White Lightning\" director Joseph Sargent's \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" ranks as an exciting, intelligent, white-knuckled suspense thriller about the most unlikely hijacking in criminal history. Walter Matthau heads up the cast as an unlikely but shaggy dog hero while Robert Shaw is extremely focused and ruthless as the nefarious villain. They qualify as brilliant adversaries. Anybody that watches New York based dramas, television shows, and/or movies will recognize the ensemble of seasoned New York City actors that flesh out each scene. The chief drawback of \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" is that its protagonist and antagonist stay holed up either in the subway train or in some downtown command center for long periods of time. Nevertheless, Sargent and scenarist Peter Stone manage to keep things pretty taut as this formula fare unfolds with flavorful dialogue, crisp performances, and five-time Oscar nominated lenser Owen Roizman's atmospheric cinematography.A quartet of heavily individuals decked out in disguises with submachine guns occupy the eponymous New York City subway train and hold 17 passengers hostage for a million dollar payday from Gotham. Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw of \"Custer of the West\") looks like he is on the way to a concert with a musical instrument case, while Mr. Green (Martin Balsam of \"Hombre\"), Mr. Brown (Earl Hindman of \"Silverado\") and Mr. Grey (Hector Elizondo of \"Valdez Is Coming\") climb aboard the Pelham One Two Three at different intervals and take up positions. Mr. Blue sticks a .45 caliber, automatic pistol into the motorman Denny Doyle's face (John Broderick of \"Alice's Restaurant\") and takes control of the train with the help of Mr. Green, a former motorman who was fired for supposedly participating in a narcotics ring operating on the subway. Initially, nobody wants to believe that they are serious about their demands, until the trigger happy Mr. Grey riddles Transit Authority supervisor Caz Dolowicz (Tom Pedi of \"The Naked City\") with a burst of machine gun. The irate Dolowicz warns everybody that he is going to get to the bottom of this incident and he winds up face down dead in a subway tunnel. Lt. Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau of \"The Odd Couple\") passes along their demands to New York City Mayor (Lew Wallace) who is battling a terrible case of the flu. The Mayor's Deputy Mayor (Tony Roberts of \"Annie Hall\") convinces everybody from the Mayor to the Police Commissioner to cough up the dough. Nevertheless, with the clock ticking, Mr. Blue refuses to accommodate a desperate Garber as the city struggles to meet his demands and get the money to him on time.On route to deliver the ransom, the NYPD cruiser crashes and the authorities have to scramble to deliver the money in the nick of time. Meanwhile, the hijackers kill the conductor and Mr. Green begins to sweat because he doesn't believe that he will survive the ordeal. Meanwhile, the NYPD has assembled an army of snipers and other policemen and they line the subway tunnel twenty yards behind the occupied subway train. The catch is that on board the subway, unknown to the hijackers, is an undercover cop. Nobody knows if the undercover cop is a man or a woman. This revelation adds to the suspense since there are several scenes between the hijackers and the passengers. The former subway motorman Mr. Green has a surprise up his sleeve after the villains receive their million dollars.Academy Award winning scenarist Peter Stone of \"Father Goose\" as well as \"Mirage\" and \"Arabesque,\" based his riveting screenplay on author John Godey's bestselling novel. The principal differences between Godey's novel and Stone's screenplay consist of the chief villain's demise, the racial identity of the New York Transient Authority detective, a booby-trapped subway train crash, and a police cruiser crash when delivering the loot to the hijackers. Ostensibly, Stone adheres rather closely to Godey's novel. Instead of being brought in alive, the villain commits suicide by stepping on the third rail and electrocuting himself. The Walter Matthau Transient Authority detective in the novel was an African-American. Moreover, the man who shot the villain in the book was in a subway train trailing the hijackers. As a precursor to Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs,\" where the criminals adopted colors as nicknames, the felons in \"The Taking of the Pelham One Two Three\" use names such as 'Mr. Blue,' 'Mr. Gray,' 'Mr. Green,' and 'Mr. Brown.' Finally, unlike Godey's novel, Sargent and Stone open the movie with the villains occupying the train and the response of the authorities to their demands. In his novel, Godey relied on flashbacks to flesh out the characters. Instead, Stone incorporates important exposition about these characters while they are on the train negotiating with the authorities.\"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" isn't the greatest thriller ever made, but it is very good. The sneezing gag is tremendous. Godey didn't have it in his book, but it is truly a stroke of genius. People who want to see more blood and violence may be disappointed because blood and violence is held to a minimum. Indeed, when \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" came out, the MPAA gave it an R-rating, primarily for its profanity.",

And it goes from there.The most notable thing about this film is the overriding realism. It was shot on real locations rather than in a studio, and it looks great, bringing with it a gritty New York vibe in much the same way as a film like SERPICO or even the B-movie monster flick C.H.U.D. Walter Matthau is perfectly cast as the hero of the piece; rather than running around with a gun, he controls things in his office for the most part. Robert Shaw and his allies are all menace as the villains, although Martin Balsam does manage to bag a sympathetic part.

They are each dressed similarly and each wears glasses and have moustaches; they also use obviously false names; Mr Blue, Mr Green, Mr Brown and Mr Grey. Shortly afterwards they take control of the train and force the driver to stop. They then split the train and continue further down the line in the front carriage. The authorities quickly realise something is wrong but it isn't until the hijackers respond to their call that they know just what has happened. The hijackers want one million dollars within the hour... and threaten to shoot one hostage per minute after the hour is up. The person responsible for defusing the situation is New York City Transit Authority police lieutenant Zachary Garber. He must try to figure out exactly what is going on, how the hijackers hope to escape and try to buy more time as the city authorities try to get the money together.This is a taut thriller with almost no extraneous material and no time wasted establishing characters. We do learn a little about them; Mr Blue is a British mercenary who saw action in Africa and Green was a former subway driver. This, combined with uniform dress and coloured coded names gives them a good air of mystery. We also learn that one of the hostages is an off duty cop but have no idea which one. Once the hijacking is underway the tension is quickly raised and things stay tense till the end of the film. The cast is impressive; most notably Walter Matthau who is impressive as Garber and Robert Shaw who is suitably menacing as Mr Blue. The action is impressive but not excessive; there are shootings and the high speed drive to get money to the train but no unnecessary explosions or other spectacular but unneeded events. While the film is serious in tone there is a modicum of humour as we see the mayor struggling to decide what to do while suffering from the 'flu and Garber talking insultingly to a group from the Tokyo underground thinking they don't understand English... they do. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoys a good thriller or classic '70s movies.",

And for all the publicity and build up the new film's received, guess which version is the better one?Like the re-make (which I'm always seeing first these days) this has a neat (if less stylish) opening, with a cool, funky soundtrack, but unlike the new film, this original version maintains an air of genuine suspense and tension, with a neat sense of claustrophobia to it. Robert Shaw's calm, reserved euro bad guy makes far more of an impression than John Travolta's chaotic, angry villain, genuinely striking you as a man with a plan who's thought things through and no less psychotic than Travolta's Ryder. Likewise, Walter Matthau seems well cast as the good guy, doing his usual gruff, quietly sarcastic thing to great effect in one of his crankier roles. The air of a 'real time' thriller is in the air, making it seem a bit ahead of it's time, not to mention getting to see where Quentin Tarantino got his inspiration for giving villains clever 'colour codenames' in his classic Reservoir Dogs.One thing that does bother you is the ending, which is very sudden and leaves you without a definite climax where everything is resolved. But this is actually cleverer, as it leaves the ending open to suggestion, letting the viewer decide it for themselves, as it's clear the one crook has been rumbled. For all the flashiness and style of the new one, in this case once again the original's the winner hands down. ****",

While my memories of the novel have faded, I thought the movie was still a great thriller. There isn't a wasted moment - it gets right to business very quickly, and the rest of the movie unfolds at a brisk (but wisely not TOO fast) speed. The cast is very good, with Robert Shaw finding the right tone to portray a bad guy who is very smart and dangerous. Walter Matthau also does well in a mostly serious role, though he adds some subtle humor to his words on occasion to make sure the movie doesn't get too serious for its own good. Definitely a lot better than the remake with John Travolta, which was too slick and loud for its own good.",

            "review_title": "The best 'hostage' movie...",
            "content": "`The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' superbly achieves what few other movies do: a successful blend of thrills, style, comedy, drama, suspense and action.  The story focuses on four criminals who hijack a subway car and demand one million dollars from the mayor of New York, or else they'll kill a hostage a minute.  It's up to transit lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) to stall with the crooks and negotiate while he tries to get their demands met.  The hijackers are Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), the crafty and efficient leader; Mr. Green (Martin Balsam), the train driver; Mr. Gray (Hector Elizondo), the hothead; and Mr. Brown (Earl Hindman), a nervous, stuttering man.  Take a look at the four men, armed with machine guns (and all following the same costume theme) and then guess where Quentin Tarantino got the idea for his reservoir dogs.The style and direction of the film is great.  It opens with the four criminals boarding the train at different stops, until we finally see Mr. Blue, who is introduced tapping his feet impatiently as he waits for the train.  Then we see Matthau, giving a group of Japanese businessmen a tour of the transit station.  Some might say this scene was added for mere comic relief, and though it is funny it also shows how not much happens at this transit station, and that the characters aren't used of anything as big as a hostage situation.The film takes place over one day, and considering the circumstances there isn't much room for depth with the characters.  Matthau isn't exactly underwritten; it's just that he only serves the purpose as the negotiator. Hindman and Elizondo are underwritten, though.  I would've liked to see Elizondo have a bigger part, though I guess he hadn't discovered his coolness until he got old (around the early nineties).  Balsam gives another great performance here as a sort of sleazy, sort of noble train driver turned thief.The best performance and deepest character is by far Shaw's Blue.  He makes a great, crafty villain, but it goes deeper than that.  You get to know him. He's a control freak, he has to be in control of everything or else he freaks out.  He's even sort of paranoid.  At one point of the movie he tells Green that he doesn't trust Gray because he's a psycho.  At first glance he seems right, but most of Gray's bad behavior in the film is somewhat justified and never too extreme (at times he's just being rebellious).  At one point he guns down a man who's trying to get onto the car.  Gray had reason for this, but Blue exploits it because he doesn't like him and wants to turn the others against him.Spoilers ahead.There is even a hint of nihilism in Shaw's character.  He's not upset about being kicked from the British army; he never seems worried throughout the heist.  My theory is that Blue just doesn't care about anything, win lose or draw.  When Garber finally has him trapped in the subway tunnel at the end Blue asks him if New York still has executions.  Garber replies with a no, so Blue simply shrugs and steps on the third rail, frying himself to death, smiling.  He doesn't look reluctant in this scene, he doesn't look defeated, and he looks the same as he does in every other scene.  Killing himself is no more important than killing someone else or robbing a train.  Shaw's performance is so focused and calm, worthy of an Oscar.`The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' is definitely the best hostage movie out there, 8.5/10.",

We see the whole story from everyone's perspective: the gunmen, the victims, the cops, the mayor and his cronies, and, most importantly, from the transit authority police and various officials. This movie is one gritty film as New York is presented in all its 70s grandeur. Crime. Filth. Corruption. Yet, despite all this, the men serving the city work hard to protect the lives of those 17 passengers on Pelham 1, 2, and 3. At its roots this film is a story of two men - Mr. Blue(all the gunmen have color-coded names that Quentin Tarrantino borrowed in Reservoir Dogs)played with his usual aplomb by Robert Shaw as the leader of the gang and Walter Matthau as the Transit detective out to do what he can to remedy the situation. we get action, suspense, and some witty dialog as well as some subtle and not so subtle humor(loved the Matthau guest-touring scenes!). We also get drama with a real edge. The film like the situations it mimics feel explosive. There are some fine performances in here. Shaw, his voice is awesome, plays the evil, ruthless, and calm Mr. Blue to perfection. Martin Balsam and Hector Elizondo are very good as two other gunmen. Matthau is excellent and has always been overlooked for his dramatic value as an actor. Sure, he is funny in the film but it is a realistic kind of funny. it is like he is a real person - we call that acting I guess. Watch for Tony Roberts, Doris Roberts, Dick O'Neill, Jerry Stiller, and many other familiar faces throughout. I have not yet seen the remake, but the original will be hard to beat if for no other reason than it is a time capsule in its own right of a New York that no longer exists.",

Walter Matthau is absolutely hilarious in it, and the mixture of droll humour and tension, interspersed with violence works extremely well, none of the moods being affected by the others. The naturalistic style of acting and the unglamourous visuals paint a picture of realism; in fact the movie looks like a Mike Leigh film in places, and shares a feel for New York with The French Connection and Klute in its seedy realism. The scenes with Warren and the Mayor are a delight, and the moment when Gharber snaps and grabs Frank is a scream. One interesting feature is the portrayal of the hostages. There is a sarcastic cartoon of New York people on display here; they are observed with the right degree of caricature without becoming pure stereotypes, despite their descriptions in the credits. The hostages do not strike up friendships or save each other's lives, more they behave as people in these situations ndo...they are not allowed to communicate and when left to their fate they are not comforting or optimistic. The hijackers are excellently portrayed and Hector Elizondo is magnificent. Although I found the escape of the hijackers a little (only a little) implausible- I won't say why in caes it spoils it for people who haven't seen it- the excitement is intense and the professionalism of Zack throughout the whole nightmare situation gives the film a great pivot. He is not a hero, merely a professional who's seen it all and is not fazed by anything. And a word for that score...anyone else noticed how similar it is to the score for McQ (same year)? It is magnificent, heavy and steam roller like with a humour lurking beneath the surface. I've raved enough...this is a great movie which manages to build strong characterisation without any background detail, merely exposing them by their reactions to the situation. Matthau's real strangth comes in his effortless manner of making lines funny by their straight delivery.  And finally, look out for that wonderful documentary style camera shot in the last scene when Martin Balsam says \"you said you'd tell me why.\" A gem.",

            "content": "One of the main reasons why I love 70's action movies and will always prefer them over their nowadays remakes is because even the 'good guys' back then were often deeply unsympathetic and obnoxious characters. Somehow this makes them much more realistic and plausible. \"The Taking of Pelham 123\" is a prototypic example to prove this statement. Lieutenant Zachary Garber and his partners aren't a muscular heroic types at all. They're whiny, aggressive and women-unfriendly chauvinist pigs that actually comes across as less sophisticated and intelligent as the villains they're trying to arrest. In this modest 70's action blockbuster, based on the novel by John Godey, a quartet of well- prepared and heavily armed men that address to each other with colors instead of names (I suppose Quentin Tarantino holds a copy in his private film collection as well) hijack a busy New York subway train and demand $1 million ransom from the city council. Lt Garber has one hour to deliver the money, if not the hijackers promise to kill off one hostage per minute of delay. The mayor agrees to pay up the sum, especially because everyone's convinced that the criminals won't ever be able to escape the underground subway network without being caught. Or will they? \"The Taking of Pelham 123\" is a vastly amusing and unpretentious action flick. The script doesn't waste any time on boring introductions, as the story almost immediately opens with the four hijackers boarding the train at different stations with obvious malignant intentions in their facial expressions. They're horribly disguised as middle-aged men with mustaches, hats and long overcoats. Their hostages are a typical assembly to represent the population of New York, including pimps and Hispanic pregnant girls. The subway control room is, as said, a chauvinist male world where grumpy men don't care about the potential loss of human lives and simply want to kill the terrorists as quick as possible. The first hour of \"The Taking of Pelham 123\" is fairly slow and talkative, which is understandable since it mostly concerns negotiations between the lieutenant and the leader of the thugs, but the third act is very exhilarating with an unstoppable train raging through NY and a deadly confrontation between police and hijackers. The cast is excellent with a couple of monumental names like Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. Martin Balsam and Jerry Stiller deliver excellent supportive roles, but my personal favorite remains Hector Elizondo as the psychopathic and trigger-happy Mr. Grey.",

This is a magnificent example of a New York-themed film that feels right and looks right (except for the lack of graffiti in the subway train, very common at the time). The film is perfect in every other way, from the clever dialog with its highly appropriate gallows humor to the dark photography that provides the gritty look, to the performances by a stellar cast, to the music.Walter Matthau's Lt. Garber is a New York Everyman unlucky enough to be on duty when this happens. He has prejudices we don't approve of today, but wants to do the right thing. He's also streetwise and savvy enough about the human condition to know what he's dealing with. Robert Shaw's Blue is cold, calculating, and sociopathic. Only we know there's a chink in his armor, but it isn't obvious to Garber who only knows him as a voice over the radio. Blue is perfectly composed most of the time, only losing control very briefly. The vibe between him and his accomplices is fractious, with the potential to explode at any time. This keeps us guessing as to when and how the entire scheme will fall apart. Earl Hindman, Hector Elizondo, and Martin Balsam provide excellent performances as the varied accomplices whom we know could turn on each other at any moment.All the supporting characters are authentically portrayed, from the other MTA employees to the police, to the mayor's staff, down to the hapless mayor himself. Was it coincidence that he bore a great resemblance to Ed Koch, who was elected three years later? If that was a coincidence it was a very lucky one. The passengers are also excellent, mostly sympathetic, and absolute New Yorkers in their diversity from the WASP executive to the hippy, the hooker to the Puerto Rican praying woman, the Jewish senior to the smart-mouthed pimp. The actors were largely unknowns and types who would today populate LAW & ORDER episodes.The music perfectly matched the energy of the story and the feel of New York and the always-in-a-hurry manner of its people. The rhythm of the theme feels like a subway train from the start; even the more romantic break in the closing theme feels like the nicer side of a subway ride as it pulls into a desirable destination when it suddenly returns to its \"back to business\" tone to remind us of what we just saw. It's a total winner.The 1998 TV remake was a joke with no actor chemistry and no feel of authenticity. The current release is somewhat better in that it provides two good performances and some logical updates in the story details, but it still can't beat this original for anything mentioned in this review.",

(I won't hold \"Jaws: The Revenge\" against him.) It's a masterfully directed, well plotted crime thriller, and one of the finest of that genre to come out of NYC in the 1970s. It doesn't boast wall to wall action, instead focusing on telling an actual story, but when the action scenes do take place, they're utterly gripping and nail biting. Best of all, the movie does have a good sense of humor, paying itself off in a couple of ways.Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo, and Earl Hindman play a quartet of ruthless men who hijack an NYC subway train and hold almost 20 passengers hostage. Their demand? One million dollars in cash (back then, it would have been a lot of money), to be delivered in ONE HOUR. Otherwise, the passengers start getting executed. Intrepid Transit Authority lawman Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) is the calm, level headed Everyman hero who tries to appease the bad guys while ensuring the hostages come out of the situation unscathed.Sargent and his top notch filmmaking team (including such luminaries as cinematographer Owen Roizman and editor Jerry Greenberg) craft a well paced bit of entertainment, enhanced by a dynamic and forceful music score by David Shire. There are some fun quips among the dialogue, and the performances are all right on the money. There's no scenery chewing here - even loose cannon Mr. Grey (Elizondo) is fairly low key while causing an overt amount of trouble for his co-conspirators. Shaw is a smooth villain, while Matthau is as amiable as he's ever been. In addition, there's a steady parade of stars and familiar character actors filling out a great many roles: James Broderick, Dick O'Neill, Lee Wallace, Tom Pedi, Beatrice Winde, Jerry Stiller, Nathan George, Kenneth McMillan, Doris Roberts, Julius Harris, Alex Colon, Michael Gorrin, Christopher Murney, Sal Viscuso, Bill Cobbs, Joe Seneca, and Tony Roberts.

And we're off... the action doesn't stop until the credits roll. The beautiful thing about films of this era was that they didn't need a \"good-guy\" protagonist; we see and feel as much for the hijackers as we do the police trying to stop them... no sides are taken by director Joseph Sargent. Our de facto lead is Walter Matthau, that rumpled paper bag, providing a stark contrast to Robert Shaw's icy criminal computer. But no one's playing a character here... these are actors being as \"real\" as any camera can ever capture.The police are slow-moving slobs mired in attitude and bureaucratic formality... the criminals are nervous, violent, desperate with a clock ticking over their heads.

I had a penchant for reading road maps as geography was my best subject. I tried to make heads or tails reading the very complex New York city subway map. The four of us rode the E train headed for the Seventh Avenue station where we changed trains. Conveniently the B train came rolling in across the platform. We ran into the train without checking the letter. I should have waited for a D train to complete the journey to the hallowed ball orchard in the Bronx. Now my friends and I are on the wrong train. Time to check the subway map. Unfortunately under the map was a man of color wearing a turban and reading scriptures from the Quran with use of a magnifying glass. I wasn't about to disturb the religious man but my friend Mark decided to go ahead and approach this man's space. Mark looked and looked for 161st Street and River Avenue station on the complicated board. The man felt that the boy was staring at him and said in an angered tone, \"What stop you looking for , BOY! I said what stop you looking for?\" Mark in desperation replied, \"I found it. I found it!\" Being a life long strap hanger, New York metro terminology for subway rider, I was drawn to this subway story of ransom,murder and the chain of events that lead up to the a subway ride for the ages. Four crooks plan to take a New York City subway train. Each wears a colored hat and bears the same name i.e. green hat, Mr. Green. One of the crooks is a New York City Motorman/Conductor Harold Longman AKA Mr. Green (Martin Balsam) who is the essential player in this ransom heist because of his knowledge of the Subway cars and system guidelines. Armed and motivated Mr. Green ousts the regular motorman well known actor James Broderick who would star on the hit TV show Family a few years later. The other colored hated rogues are played by popular TV Icon Earl Hindman (Mr. Brown) who found success on the hit TV show Home Improvement starring Tim Allen. You remember Earl who played the neighbor of reason Wilson only showing half his face behind a picket fence. That leads us to this strange connection of actors as our other partner swindler Mr. Grey is played by Hector Elizondo. Elizondo also co-stars with Tim Allen on the hit TV Show Last Man Standing. The star racketeer in all this is English Actor Robert Shaw Famous for his work in Jaws and Henry The VIII . AKA Mr.Blue the brains, the plotter, making the calls all the way as he demands one million dollars in cash within one hour or he'll shoot each passenger on a separate detached subway car each minute the authorities from the transit system are late. Enter Police Lt. Zack Garber (Walter Matthau) with his dead pan demeanor and wisecracking way of speaking to his co-workers. Matthau is a natural here. Not shouting or losing his cool but via a radio is the negotiator between ring leader Blue and the NYPD. The lives of the seventeen innocent passengers on that lone subway car are at stake. Nail biting action throughout with funny lines thrown in to relieve the tension. A race to the finish but this movie doesn't end with a bang. An anachronism of sorts as the Mayor is portrayed by Lee Wallace who bears a striking resemblance to former Mayor Ed Koch but during the film Abe Beame was mayor. Koch was elected four years later. Uncanny! Honorable mention to Jerry Stiller as Lt Rico Patrone. I particularly enjoyed the negotiating between Matthau and Shaw which was riveting as well as entertaining. Back to my personal experience on the train ride to the Bronx.

            "content": "Head back in time 38 years along Lexington Avenue's 6 Line; You'll notice few changes on that New York City subway line with the exception of the entrances/exits to each station with the various abbreviations (such as IRT) used back then. Still crowded, smelly, too fast paced for some, yet a bit safer and always an adventure. Add on a major crisis, in this case, a hostage situation. \"Who'd want to steal a subway?\" one person here asks. Someone wanting a million dollars, that's who, and in this case, there are four of them. Walter Matthau plays the head of the subway police whose early part of the afternoon has consisted of showing what he thinks are non-English speaking Japanese members of the Tokyo Metro Board around their office. He's in for two surprises. A little lesson in diplomacy is followed by the worst crisis since a bomb threat turned out only to be a cantaloupe. Four men, dressed almost alike, enter the train at different stops. Since this train left Pelham (the start of the line up in the Bronx) at 1:23, it is in the middle of its journey between 28th and 23rd streets when the train suddenly comes to a stop. The four guys pull out their automatics, and as soon as headquarters notices, the train is contacted without the conductor answering. It isn't until one of them finally calls in that they learn that the remaining people aboard this single car (separated from the others) will be killed unless the city meets their demands.This is certainly not a comedy, but if you feel the tension of what the politicians, police and public transportation people are feeling, you'll understand why they have to crack wise. The unpopular mayor happens to be down with the flu that day; One of the women who works with the transit police has dropped her wedding ring down the john; and another officer is too busy reading the paper to acknowledge the influential Japanese VIP's visiting. There's also the fact that the terrorists don't get along, and one of them (Hector Elizondo) is obviously even more psycho than the rest. The transit police must get the $1000000 from the New Amsterdam Building on Center Street down to 23rd and Lexington within a ridiculously short time. This creates one of the greatest action scenes on NY City Streets covering a good majority of lower-mid Manhattan. It's as exciting as the chase sequence in \"Bullitt\". There is an excessive amount of violence, but considering the plot, it is absolutely necessary.I found myself riveted to the screen from beginning to end, actually routing for one of the bad guys in spite of the fact he was a crook. There's a really funny brief bit concerning a drunk passenger in the hostage-held car that has a great pay-off. Not one false note to make this a great film. Some reviews complain about the cursing and unlikable characters, but NY City in 1974 (let alone today) is not Disneyand. Tony Roberts, Doris Roberts, and Jerry Stiller are among the recognizable faces in smaller roles. And the ending? A punch-line that will have you in stitches!",

Supporting cast are all superb as well and the ending is so simple yet memorable - it's the one thing I did remember from watching all those years ago yet still a delight to watch.The comparison between this and the recent Travolta/Washington versions sums up exactly what's wrong with so many movies today being made for the mindless ADD generation and lacking so much substance, and a reminder that we may never see actors with so much character on the big screen anymore.Go buy/rent the best copy you can find and enjoy the sights, the sounds (including the awesome soundtrack) and colour of 1970's New York City.",

            "content": "First off, the title. In the New York subway system trains are noted by their location and the time of departure. So the train called \"Pelham 1 2 3\" left at 1:23PM. But then, what would they call the one leaving at 1:23AM??The new version with Travolta is hitting theaters soon, so I wanted to see the original first. I will see the new one in about 6 months.Walter Matthau, already into his 50s and as seasoned an actor as there was, is transit officer Lt. Garber. The highlight of his day was to be giving a group of Japanese transit executives a tour of the NYC facilities. But that is interrupted when they get word that four unknown gunmen have taken the Pelham 123 hostage, with passengers on board. Their demand is straightforward, deliver to them $1Million by exactly 60 minutes, otherwise a passenger would be executed every minute they were late.All the crooks gave themselves code names, various colors. The leader was Brit Robert Shaw as Blue. The other two key characters were Martin Balsam as Green and Hector Elizondo as the hot-headed Grey. Also Earl Hindman was Brown.What puzzled Garber was how did the crooks expect to get away with this, you can't exactly run away inside a subway!Also good was Garber's coworker, Jerry Stiller as Lt. Rico Patrone.Good action and suspense, but with the usual very cheesy soundtrack that you would expect for the 1970s. SPOILERS: As the money is being packaged and delivered, we see the four crooks had planned to get off the train and rig the dead-man control to run the train without a driver. One of them, Green, had been a train driver formerly, and released for poor performance. But he knew the system and knew where they could surface without being caught, each with one-quarter of the money hidden under their winter coats. But a plainclothes cop on the train jumps off and follows them, and shoots one of them. Blue ends up shooting Grey himself, and Green manages to get away and home. Garber finds his way down to the tracks and traps the mastermind, Blue, who electrocutes himself on the tracks instead of being captured. Then, in the final scene, Garber and Patrone go to the apartment of Green. They didn't discover the money, but as they were leaving Green sneezes, the same sneeze Garber had heard over the radio from the train. Gotcha!!",

In this story a New York City subway gets stolen and the passengers are taken hostage only to be released for 1 million dollars in ransom demand. How will they get away with it?This classic hostage flick goes back to the seventies, 1974 to be exact. Sound quality is MONO. Does everybody still even know what that means? One channel sound, when today there are 7 or more. Besides this the photography isnt grandiose either. It really has got that typical cheap early seventies feel to it, the period however Quentin Tarantino was so found of and is now going back to with his new movie. And for good reason, because in this period a lot of classics were born. And \"The Taking of Pelham 123\" is one of them. Although it certainly is no masterpiece, it is still a really good hostage movie with excellent acting by Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw.You can also choose to see the modern remake of this movie with Denzel Washington and John Travolta. I watched that modern remake myself but I got bored with it within minutes. Maybe kids would love the modern version better though, but if you personally are more of a cinephile then the seventies version is the more popular one that gets the highest Imdb ratings from critics as well.Seen it many times now and besides some cheap effects and poor sound quality it is still a movie I go back to every year or so. I just love the New York cussing and complaining in it,I love the dirty New York strreets and subway and I really dig the great seventies soundtrack, however bad it technically may sound in MONO lol...",

            "content": "There can be few instances when title music so perfectly suited a movie. It's a big, brash, jazzy number that could almost be an anthem for New York city. Then, if you listen carefully, there's an understated - almost mechanical - riff beneath the blaring brass that is a metaphor for the subway train itself. Somebody knew exactly what they wanted, and got it. It's perfect. (If you want to hear a benchmark of ineptitude - check out 'Ashanti').And the movie lives up to expectations. Most of the people are ignorant, coarse and vulgar in varying degrees, but their characters are funny with it. Walter Mathau plays the world-weary head of railway security, showing a contingent of Japanese visitors around with manifest contempt, referring to them as monkeys, unaware that they can speak English (perhaps I should say 'Manhattanese). His boss is a loud-mouthed fool. The mayor is a cynical vote-counter in bed with the flu. A fulminating supervisor won't take 'No' for an answer, and catches the first bullet.Despite the humour, it is no comedy. A subway train is hijacked and held to ransom. The 4 villains, led by an icy, ruthless ex-Briton, convincingly played by Robert Shaw, also feature an equally ruthless but almost unbalanced mafia hoodlum.They, along with their prisoner-passengers, are a strange mix, creating unpredictable conflicts.It's a solid action-movie, taut and highly original. The passing years haven't dulled its impact. Quite the contrary, recent acts of terrorism have only served to highlight the conspicuous vulnerability of its subject.There's a lot to be said for taking a cab.But take the movie as well.",

            "content": "Taking of Pelham One Two Three, The (1974)*** 1/2 (out of 4) Four armed men (Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo, Earl Hindman) hijack a subway car in New York City and demand one-million dollars or they will start shooting the hostages. Lt. Garber (Walter Matthau) is working the station when the hijacking starts and it's up to him to figure out their plans, which seems like they haven't a chance of escaping from their situation. The idea of four people actually hijacking a subway is certain far-fetched and a rather stupid idea but the screenplay is smart enough to have several characters in the film say the same thing. What makes this film so special are the performances by the cast as well as some of the best dialogue to come out of any movie in the 70s. Once the laws of \"pure\" movies were taken off filmmakers we got all sorts of new things. The 70s allowed nudity, sex, gore and violence but the one thing that often gets overlooked is the way profanity was used. I don't think there's a greater example of the power of profanity than this film here. It might sound stupid to highlight cuss words but they really do bring so many of these characters to life. The rawness of the four letter words really puts you right in the middle of the situation and I think it brings a certain reality to the events. The dialogue is often very tight and makes one feel as if they're listening to real people talk but even better is some of the dry humor thrown in. There some terrific bits about the Mayor wondering if they should pay the ransom or not and the debate scene is certainly one of many highlights. The drama in the film is quite high from start to finish as director Sargent knows how to stage a scene and build up the tension even when nothing is happening. The majority of the film takes place on a stopped train or inside an office but these scenes are so perfectly edited together that you get a real sense of danger. The performances are certainly a major plus with Matthau doing a very good job with his role. I'm sure most people will always remember the actor as a comedian and he was so masterful at it that it's easy to forget that he was also terrific at drama. I thought he was very convincing in the part and the way he could deliver the lines to the hostage takers made for some real excitement. Shaw, the leader of the group, is also superb in that certain, laid back way that only he could get away with. Balsam is also a major plus to the film as are supporting players like Jerry Stiller, Tony Roberts and Elizondo. At 104-minutes the film packs the right amount of drama mixed in with the action and comedy. There were quite a few heist films to come from these decade but it's easy to call this here one of the best.",

Even compared to films made in recent years (with the possible exception of \"Good Fellas\" and \"Snatch.\"), the language is very, very 'spicy'--with tons of G-D this and G-D that (IMDB will not allow me to actually write what they said). This may or may not be realistic for the characters....I dunno. But it certainly is NOT a film to watch with young kids, your mother or Father Jenkins!The film has a very simple plot--four guys hijack a subway train and threaten to kill all the passengers unless they are paid $1,000,000. The problem is that these are VERY smart and ruthless criminals--and they are more than willing to kill passengers and they seem to have thought out all the details very, very well.I appreciate how the mastermind (Robert Shaw) was portrayed and I like how he and his men weren't tripped up because of stupid mistakes. I also like how the man in charge of the case was portrayed--with Walter Matthau putting in a great performance as a man who is competent, smart and also a bit cynical and funny.

            "content": "An absolute classic thriller from the 1970's. Walter Matthau headlines a superb cast in this adrenaline charged, roller coaster ride. Matthau is excellent as an everyman thrust into the pivotal position of negotiating with a lunatic who along with his cohorts has hijacked a New York City subway train.Robert Shaw is truly magnificent as the villainous mastermind behind the subway train takeover. But, the magic truly starts to simmer in the high tension interplay between Matthau and Shaw as the ruthless killer demands his money while Matthau attempts to achieve the safe release of the victims.Each of the heavies in this picture are identified by colors Mr. Green, Grey and so on; a plot point which inspired director Quentin Tarantino in his debut film Reservoir DOGS. A solid crew of character actors round out this picture including Jerry Stiller as a transit worker in Matthau's department, Martin Balsam is terrific as one of the hijackers with a terrible case of the sniffles. Hector Elizondo, in a very early role, really makes an impression as an unhinged thug who is more than eager to execute anyone who crosses him.Character actor Lee Wallace is memorable as the New York Mayor particularly for his striking resemblance to New York Mayor Ed Koch. New York City is used to great effect here especially during a frantic sequence featuring a police car making a crucial delivery. The back and forth plotting between the stalled train and the pressure ridden Transit Authority headquarters with Matthau attempting to appease the hijackers is crisply edited and creates wonderful balance in this high stakes thriller. During a decade that featured some of the best movies ever made, this one is a jewel not to be missed.",

            "content": "From the first notes of David Shire's groovy score playing at the movie's start, you know you're in for a treat. The Taking of Pelham 123 is one of the most enjoyable and upbeat movies I've seen in a while. This is a gritty crime movie, with deaths, and yet it's also light and humorous in a way action movies no longer are. To find such lightness in a crime movie I have to go back in time, back to The Thomas Crown Affair, the only crime movie I know that exudes so much elegance and coolness.Four armed men hijack a subway train and demand a ransom for its passengers. In charge is Mr. Blue, a courteous, serene but implacable mastermind who will not negotiate or change one item in his plans. He gives the authorities one hour to deliver 1,000,000 dollars, and if they're one minute late, Mr. Blue and his associates, will start killing hostages.Opposing Mr. Blue is Lt. Zachary Garber, of the Transit Police. In this role, which traditionally should have gone to an action actor, is the unlikely Walter Matthau. But for Mr. Blue they chose an actor that matches the role: the great Robert Shaw. He's such a bastard playing a hero in Jaws, imagine what he can be when he plays an actual villain.Matthau and Shaw are pretty good in their roles. Matthau was especially delightful: he brings humour and a humanity that is rare in this type of role. He's not a fighter, he's a thinker, and a damn good one; he not only negotiates with Mr. Blue but also manages to crack the mystery that is at the center of the movie: how will four armed men escape an underground tunnel blocked by policemen on both exits? Although in the history of cinema, this movie is insignificant, I think that in its own genre it's a masterpiece, so tightly plotted and efficient in the use of resources to tell the story, it's a joy to watch. And it has David Shire's score, which is one of the best I've ever heard in my life.",

            "content": "Terrific heist-flick from the early 70's, a golden era for me of movie-making, when quality film-making was set in everyday locations amongst identifiably ordinary people but playing out extraordinary situations. The extraordinary situation here, mind you, is up with the best of them, namely the hi-jacking of a New York City underground train, no less, its passengers held for ransom by Robert Shaw and his \"rainbow\" gang, (Messrs Green, Gray, Brown and Blue), prefiguring a minor plot device Tarantino would re-use in \"Reservoir Dogs\". Despite lacking a really big name in the cast, (it is just possible to envisage a McQueen or Newman in Walter Matthau's role), this only adds to the everyday mundanity of the scenario presented and enhances the credibility of the situation. It really does look and play like a real-life event, aided in this also by the near-real-time sequence of events depicted. The dialogue is razor-sharp, very much in the local vernacular with much grim humour abounding, the mixture of studio and actual locations wholly convincing and the ensemble acting first-rate. Robert Shaw is very good as the cold calculating mastermind, while Walter Matthau, for whom the phrase \"hangdog expression\" must have been invented, gets a break from his numerous comedy castings and is even better as the workaday transport cop whose instincts carry the day, even surrounded by dozens of real cops. The narrative is played out tautly, with the tension kept right up, but as stated, isn't afraid to throw in some humour to season the offering here. Thus we get a humorous sub-plot with Lee Wallace as a flu-ridden mayor, unpopular with his electorate, happy to lie in bed watching daytime TV, until goaded into action by a very good Tony Roberts as his deputy. The violence is sparing but effective, the out-of-control train at the end again pre-dates \"Speed\" by several years, with the concluding denouement handled superbly and even if I saw well in advance Martin Balsam's give-away to Matthau in the last scene, it couldn't have been delivered more crisply or succinctly. Certainly no need for alternative endings here. All in all, I just thought it was a gripping, exhilarating ride of a movie, unfairly overlooked and worthy of plaudits which somehow seemed to pass it by on original release.",

The movie deserves its own book, and ranks right up there with Citizen Kane (1941) as a movie so good, there's no way to say how good it is.The use of comedy inter-cut with tension and true tragedy was never done better in any movie, and highlights how important the unlikely marriage of comedy and horror is when it's done well.The James Whale 1930's horror movies (two Frankenstein movies and the Invisible Man movie) do this well, and so did better class sci-fi space travel movies (Destination Moon in 1950 had a comic passenger very important to the film).I was born in New York City, and lived there several times in my life, and I'm partial to the unique wise-guy, one-oneupmanship humor found nowhere else, and brilliant when it's done well.In The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three (1974), New York City wise-guy humor is done well....the timing, the straight face delivery of outrageous blandness, the irony, the put-down humor.....only New Yorkers could and have come up with comedy like this.They did it when New York City was truly a city which included people of all backgrounds and income levels, all part of the city's life, all players. Sadly, that is no longer true.New York City in the 21st century has become a city made of up permanent residents who include embarrassingly rich people and desperately poor people who live in the non-Manhattan boroughs, except for Staten Island, also known on maps as \"Richmond\" (New York City is, collectively, made up of five different \"boroughs\" including Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and \"Richmond\" also known as Staten Island, for non-New Yorkers who may not know). A commuter population mostly from northern New Jersy south of the Hudson River pour into Manhattan daily to do working class jobs once done relatively recently by Manhattan and other NYC borough residents.The movie's funniest and best actor is Tom Pedi, famous for the late 1950's \"Dash\" soap commercials on TV, and a great character actor. He plays an outrageous, outraged long time supervisor worker on the New York subway system named \"Cas Dolowitz,\" and his performance is incredible.Tom Pedi as \"Cas Dolowitz\" plays a proletarian character of dignity, importance, interest, and charisma....not just a piece of background actor scenery decorating scenes dominated by \"beautiful people\" main actors.The is a proletarian movie in very important and unusual ways few other films ever are.In a sense, every one of the actors in The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three (1974) are character actors, and this defines the movie importantly, and makes it one of the greatest movies about common people in one of the world's biggest cities ever made.---------------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

            "review_title": "Before this train reaches the next station it will become the scene of the most spectacular hijack ever attempted",
            "content": "Based on the book by John Godey, TAKING OF PELHAM focuses on four criminals who hijack a subway car and demand one million dollars from the mayor of New York, threatening to kill one hostage per minute if their demands aren't met. New York City transit lieutenant Zachary Garber goes above and beyond his call of duty to play negotiator with the hijackers.With the remake coming out this weekend (June 12, 2009), what's a better time than to watch the original film? I guess the film aged well because even at 35 years later, the film doesn't feel dated. What I liked about this film is how easily it blends suspense, comedy, and action. Some films try to blend genres and end up failing horribly but not TAKING OF PELHAM. The blend is smooth, being funny when it needs to be, thrilling when it needs to be, and just plain entertaining from beginning to end.However, I was surprised the movie had some light-hearted scenes. I wasn't expecting that, thinking that it would be a serious gripping film. Well, it actually is, but the subtle humor and the witty dialogue are here too. The relationship between Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw, both playing the main hero and villain respectively, is very fun to see on screen. They do a great job in the movie. The other castmembers did decently in their roles, although there isn't one to shout out about.If there is a negative thing to say about TAKING OF PELHAM, it would be the over-dramatic score that I was never used to. The whole plan turns out to be a bit of a letdown too, after being built so much throughout the film. However, the last scene is pitch perfect, although I saw it coming. It was great to see the inevitable finishing of the movie, though. TAKING OF PELHAM is what you want in a crime thriller. It's funny, gripping, and, most of all, entertaining. Don't be worried to stop for this train. (Sorry, I couldn't resist).",

Sam Peckinpah's lurid freight-train, the original The Getaway, and Joseph Sargent's excellent The Taking of Pelham One Two Three come to mind.The story is so strong and the performances are so spot-on that snipping out an F-bomb here and a gunshot wound there won't have a negative impact on the viewer's experience.What a great movie this is! It captures the times, the fear and the moxie of New Yorkers, and the grit, grime, and gallows humor that you would expect.It has humanism without sacrificing suspense. It has clich\u00e9d but delightfully accessible characters. The very fact there is no high- falutinisms, no artsy-smartsy, brings the movie to a level of excellence that is very hard to find. It is pure escapist entertainment, what movie-tickets were designed to deliver.Since I can find nothing of great consequence to complain about in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (the cynicism gets a little too thick from time to time), I simply think you should, if at all possible, grab a copy or a download of this wonderful suspenser, and make it an evening.",

            "content": "The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 is not one of my favorite sort of hijacker-type thrillers, but it is a professional type of film that gives its audience what it wants on a base level; stone-cold and (perhaps) crazy criminals taking over the wheels, literally; a group of frightened, but realistic, passengers held hostage; cop characters who are smart, and sometimes funny. One can see what must have appealed to Quentin Tarantino for Reservoir Dogs, which he kind of raped & pillaged for his screenplay (not just with the color-coded character names, but also certain aspects of the criminal characteristics, and a little detail about a undercover cop). On its own legs, Taking of Pelham is also sort of a trend-setter; one can also see the influence on the original Die Hard, and other countless B-grade or less thrillers. But the circumstances in the story, the acting, and indeed some of the humanity, bring it up a notch.The story is hard-boiled, but is surrounded by realistic dialog for all involved. When there is humor, its unexpected, but worthwhile. We are given a group of consummate criminals, with Robert Shaw (Mr. Blue) as the steel-eyed, no non-sense leader of the four, who take a subway train with twenty or so passengers hostage. At first the subway company man goes nuts over it, until Lt. Garber (Walter Matthau, a surprise but interesting casting choice) overhears the situation. He becomes the negotiator, having to go between then and City Hall for the ransom money. For a while in the story, until the train starts to move again, not much goes on, but what does go on is meticulous, and therefore even more suspenseful.There are funny characterizations of those who in lessor crime films wouldn't have much to them, like the second-banana to Garber, played to me as a total surprise by Jerry Stiller (one may rewind to check again), plus a couple of notables in the Mayor's office like Tony Roberts. And there is of course Shaw, who gives the kind of performance that's a given if you've seen Jaws (though Jaws is his best). Martin Balsam is very good as the older one of the bunch. Hector Elizondo, with an excellent character-actor career nowadays, is perfect as the un-hinged Mr. Gray. But one thing that is very effective is the cast of those who are held hostage. The director Joseph Sargent knows how to get more interest than in just plain caricatures in them. These are real people, and the audience's interest in their survival is more prominent by the little details that are put in-between the phone tag with Garber, Blue, and the flu-stricken Mayor.There is a sort of expected outcome for what will happen to the villains of the story (and if you've seen Reservoir Dogs before this it might give some of it away), however the grittiness of the story becomes only firmer in the climax; the fates aren't etched in stone, like in the best of the heist pictures of the 40's and 50's. Basically, as a genre picture, you could do a lot worse, even if it isn't necessarily a great movie- it's un-pretentious, New York film-making of a truly 70's order.",

            "content": "The 1970s was the decade for the thriller genre. Riding the crest of the American New Wave, emerging filmmakers were free to pursue realism in their pictures, and suddenly the genre was transformed from the stuffy Gothic melodrama of yesteryear into the authentic this-could-happen-to-you urban thriller, often exploiting the Watergate Scandal for some old-fashioned government conspiracy. Though Alan J. Pakula's 'All the President's Men (1976)' is the crowning achievement of this period, 'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974)' is still among the decade's finest thrillers. The film was adapted from a novel by Morton Freedgood {writing under the pseudonym John Godey}, and features an excellent cast in Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw and Martin Balsam, as well as \u0096 in an unexpected treat for fans of TV comedy \u0096 Jerry Stiller (\"Seinfeld\") and Earl Hindman (\"Home Improvement\"). Director Joseph Sargent, despite also having 'Jaws: The Revenge (1987)' to his name, really does know how to maintain the suspense, and Peter Stone's screenplay is laced with darkly-humorous lines of dialogue.The New York subway system is the most complex underground railway system in the world, and, around the clock, hundreds of (theoretically) hard-working employees are labouring to keep the system running smoothly. Every day, members of the New York City Transit Authority must investigate a vast assortment of criminal acts that regularly take place in the subway, including vandalism, theft, murder and sexual assault \u0096 but what about a hostage situation? When a group of four heavily-armed men hijack the 1:23PM train to Pelham Bay Park Station, the entire Transit Authority is sent into a spin, and it falls to grumpy senior lieutenant Zachary Garber (Matthau) to resolve the situation. The leader of the mercenaries, sporting an icily-sinister British accent (Shaw), demands that the cash sum of $1 million be delivered to their locomotive within one hour; failure to adhere to this deadline will force him to execute innocent passengers at a rate of one per minute. However, throughout the entire ordeal, one nagging question plagues the minds of the authorities: how do these men expect to get away.In a perfect Hollywood, all ruthless and calculating villains would speak with intelligent British accents. Robert Shaw is commanding as Mr. Blue, the hijacking operation's primary mastermind, and his cold, commanding exchanges with authorities over the radio possess a chilling finality that suggests he's quite willing to carry out everything he's just threatened to do. Martin Balsam, an actor of whom I am quite fond, was momentarily unnoticed beneath a fake moustache and a hacking cough, but he plays the uncertain criminal with perfect tentativeness. Walter Matthau, who played a similar role completely straight in 'Fail-Safe (1964),' adds some humour to his performance as Lt. Garber, particularly in the way he's consistently deprecating Mr. Blue over the radio, even if the insults appear to bounce off the hijacker as though he doesn't even notice them. For the film's conclusion, the tension finally eases enough to ensure some solid breathing room, and Garber's double-take and final stare, a mixture of surprise and amusement, is pure brilliance.

This, for me, is the essence of Shaw's brilliance as an actor. He had a sort of coldness and sarcasm that I can only compare to another great character actor in Claude Rains. Both of them were wonderful villians. When they were the guys, you know they were the bad guys...and in this film you know that Shaw is one bad guy. The way he looks at his watch, as time is of the essence. The precision with how handles his every move. That voice! He had a voice that was almost like a hiss from a snake. It was amazing, his talent and dedication to a character. This was one of his best... see it again and watch closely for Shaw's intense performance.",

            "content": "Many years ago, make that many decades ago, I stumbled into the middle of this picture and was intrigued enough to watch it to the end. I never bothered to try catching the entire movie until it showed up on cable the other night. I have to say, this is one of those Seventies action flicks that just grabs you and doesn't let go until the red lights come on. Another picture that did the same for me back then was the original \"Assault on Precinct 13\" with John Carpenter at the helm. You have to catch that one too.Probably the first thing I noticed in the film were the names of the four subway thugs. I had to wonder if this was the source of Tarantino's inspiration for the criminals in \"Reservoir Dogs\". In fact, there's a Mr. Blue and a Mr. Brown in both pictures. And as for the mayor of New York City (Lee Wallace), I couldn't help thinking that he might have been selected for his resemblance to Ed Koch, until I realized that Koch wasn't mayor until a few years later. So that was interestingly prophetic.Like everyone else who watches the movie while trying to figure out how the hijackers would get away with it, it never occurs that the simplest solution would be the best - just get off at some point along the way. I thought it was just a bit too coincidental the way Garber (Walter Mattthau) second guessed the bad guys, but there was still enough suspense to keep one invested in the story. With nice dollops of humor thrown in every now and then, the picture still holds up pretty well after forty years, and will make you think twice the next time you board a subway train.",

I was surprised to find out it was Wilson from Tool-time as one of the other gunmen(!), knew him but couldn't place him you know. Ditto Dick O'Neill as the spluttering transit authority guy.The movie is dated, sure-it was made in the Watergate era so you have half the cast in leather jackets or wearing bell bottoms or golf pants, but it's how people looked then. You also have to like the nods towards integration of races and sexes in the jobforce and in the world at large that was taking place in that era---'I thought you were-uh, shorter-' was priceless.Check it out, am sure it beats the remake by a mile in quality, acting and interest.

Zachary Garber (a marvelously cantankerous performance by Walter Matthau) to maintain order while pandemonium erupts all around him.Director Joseph Sargent keeps the gripping story racing along at a breathless swift pace, generates plenty of nerve-wracking tension, and offers a pungent evocation of 1970's New York City in all its brash, loud, rude, and seedy glory. Peter Stone's tightly constructed script provides loads of choice cynical humor and has a refreshing dearth of pretense. Robert Shaw as ruthless ringleader Mr. Blue makes for a great coldblooded and calculating villain; he receives sturdy support from Martin Balsam as the antsy Mr. Green, Hector Elizondo as the volatile Mr. Grey, and Earl Hindman as hulking brute Mr. Brown. Moreover, there are sound contributions from Dick O'Neill as huffy desk train master Frank Correll, Lee Wallace as the whiny flu-stricken mayor, Tom Pedi as irascible railroad boss Caz Dolowicz, Jerry Stiller as the laid-back Lt. Rico Patrone, Kenneth McMillan as a no-nonsense borough commander, Tony Roberts as sensible deputy mayor Warren LaSalle, Julius Harris as the hard-nosed Inspector Daniels, and Nathan George as noble patrolman Jones. Further enhanced by Owen Roizman's crisp widescreen cinematography, given an extra kinetic kick by David Shire's driving'n'dynamic score, and topped off by a priceless last image, this honey rates highly as one of the all-time best and most exciting nail-biters from the gloriously gritty 1970's.",

Daniels for the first time face-to-face. I too find re-makes falling short of the originals, or earlier versions - Assault on Precinct 13, The Fog, The 39 Steps et al. Unfortunately not being a reader, I often wonder how the book and film interpretation compare - even allowing for all the differences inherent in the differing mediums! Certainly in The 39 Steps the Robert Powell version is quite different from that of the Robert Donat and Kenneth More versions.

This white-knuckle thriller features some of the crispest dialog you'll see in the movies. The characterizations are vivid and intelligent, and the audience is treated to some real crackerjack performances.You see, the best part of this movie isn't guessing whether the authorities are going to submit to Shaw's demands and give the gunmen their money, it's in wondering how he plans on getting away with the crime. You have four gunmen with automatic weapons on a single subway car in the middle of a tunnel. There are cops surrounding them everywhere, although none can quite get close enough to the car to commandeer it. How do they propose to do it?Like some movies that purport to develop in 'real time,' (like High Noon and Nick of Time), this movie seems to take place in precisely the hour or so that Matthau and company try to win the battle of wits with Shaw and company. But it never seems like it, as the rapid pacing of the script take care of any possible lulls. Matthau himself is brilliant, as he offers an award-worthy performance. Shaw matches him move-for-move as his evil counterpart. His character names the men in his gang after colors, much like Quentin Tarantino would later do in Reservoir Dogs.",

The hijackers have taken the precaution of only referring to each other by their code names (Mr Blue, Mr Grey, Mr Brown, Mr Gray). Almost 20 years later the gang in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs would take the same precaution.The man that is leading the official response is Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) of the Transit Police.The cast is uniformly good and there is an interesting supporting cast that includes a number of actors who later become better known for sitcoms; Jerry Stiller (Seinfeld), Doris Roberts (Everybody Loves Raymond), Earl Hindman (Home Improvement), Dick O'Neill.The film very effectively portrays a perceived New York attitude and in particular the New York attitude of the 1970's.The score which is by David Shire (husband at the time of Talia Shire of Rocky and The Godfather fame) is very effective in setting up the mood.The film which has already been re-made once for television has again been re-made this summer by director Tony Scott.

The casting was believable and the criminals were actually well developed to the point you sort of get there characteristics down. The funky score was cool, but the script was well written as well. And for the budget, they really did a great job with it. The mistaken identities over the radio was a nice touch as well. Basically in New York City, 4 men wearing trench coats and rimmed glasses hijack a Pelham 123 subway train and for the hostage to go free, they want a million dollars. The deadline is almost an hr and every minute it's late with the criminals request, they will kill a hostage. The person on the other line the criminal leader communicate about what they want and how they want it done, is Zachary Garber(Walter Matthau) who's job is help run the subways, and they both put on a good performance. The leader of the hijacking(Robert Shaw) was ominous while keeping his cool about everything, in another words he is a charismatic criminal, while Garber was amusing to watch and realistic at the same time how he deals with the situation of being the negotiator. The mayor was annoying to watch, but that is just his character and it fit quite nicely. The hostages in this movie weren't that believable though, they all seem to have a loud mouth, except the motorman. The kids that were taken hostage was really annoying and wished they were killed off or something, but it just showed that the criminals had a heart(being sarcastic), maybe I just hate kids. Even if there is lack of action, it kept my attention from beginning to end. It wasn't a exciting or suspenseful heist thriller or anything like that but it kept me entertained, especially how the character interact with one another while dealing with the hostage situation.7.3/10",

The story line is familiar enough that I won't bother going over it much. The notion that the thieves should name themselves after colors -- Mr. Brown, Mr. Green -- was adopted by Tarantino for \"Reservoir Dogs,\" of course, as every Turturro addict knows. I should point out that the novel is at least as good as the film because the author occasionally uses an omniscient point of view and we get some better notion of what the participants in this caper are feeling. The confrontation between the African-American kid and Robert Shaw on the subway platform is more amusing, for instance. In the film, the kid glares at Shaw, and Shaw can only smile back. In the novel we are taken inside the kid's head and invited to play with him the game that he plays with people like Shaw. He has this idea, you see, that if he stares at some stranger with this particularly menacing expression, \"he HYPMOTIZE him!\" As it turns out, Shaw is nobody to play games with. In deciding whom to execute, Shaw looks around the car and thinks about the flat-out drunken woman. She'd be the least missed. But on the other hand, \"who am I to play God.\" The exposition in the novel is clumsy but adds to our understanding of what's going on. We get more information about how many cars there are on a subway train, how long the train is, how many transit cops are around, and how they relate to the NYPD. Kind of interesting, in a touristy way. The Japanese \"monkeys\" in the movie serve their comedic purpose. Anyone who has seen footage of the real Tokyo subway system in operation must suspect that they view the New York City subway system as a paragon of order and good taste. (In Tokyo, they use \"pushers\" to squeeze as many innocent passengers as possible into each car; what happens if one of them wants to release some Sirin gas?) Walter Mathau is at his slouching New-Yorkese best, grumbling, kwetching, outfitted in a droopy suit with a startling canary yellow tie. And -- well, look at the movie. Here we are given a story about the hijacking of a subway train -- and there is not a single exploding fireball.There is some shooting with automatic weapons and pistols, but not much of that, and nobody wields two Uzzis at once. Nobody's head balloons into jelly. There is no blood, and no final shoot out in an unused deadend tunnel or empty warehouse. Mathau doesn't even carry a gun. The movie ends with a sneeze and an ironically polite German blessing. The acting is up to snuff, the narrative easy enough to follow, and exciting, if not entirely believable. The villains are neatly differentiated. The low-brow greedy ex-motorman of Martin Balsam, who practically embodies New York City in its grittier aspects; Shaw's icy disdain; Elizondo's angry psychopathy. It's an enjoyable movie, all around. The fact that it was made when it was, in 1974, helps in understanding why the story and characters weren't overwhelmed by special effects. Cf., Stallone's movie about the Holland Tunnel. (Everyone in that movie should have been drowned; who would want to go to New Jersey anyway? The state smells like somebody's old sweatshirt.)It ought to be mentioned that despite the tension and occasional violence this is a pretty funny movie. Much of the humor grows out of urban, ethnic cynicism and vulgarity. Yiddish is flung around profligately -- \"Mishigas,\" \"putz.\" The transit supervisor, a Polish-American, is accosted by a released hostage who shouts, \"I'm gonna SUE you! Hear me? I'm gonna SUE your a**.\" Cas Dolowitz bellows back an obscene Italian expression that can be roughly rendered as \"fanablagotz!\"It would be nice to turn back the clock and be able to watch a film like \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" on a regular basis. It engages your interest with no pretensions at attempting to do anything else. It leaves your eardrums intact. Did you realize that one of the membranes in your inner ear is so sensitive that it transmits sound by vibrating only the diameter of a hydrogen atom? If you want to treat your ears like a temple instead of a pool room, see this movie and avoid \"action-movie gap.\" Do it now. Offer ends at midnight. Not sold in stores.",

It's a testament to \"Pelham\" that it has been remade twice--once as a made-for-TV movie, and the other as a big-budget action picture. However, the decision to produce these remakes hasn't yielded satisfying results. Peter Stone earned an Oscar nomination in 1974 for his screenplay, which is adapted from John Godey's 1973 novel. You can count among its biggest admirers Quentin Tarantino, who borrowed the color-coded nicknames of the villains in the film for his band of thieves in \"Reservoir Dogs.\"Four armed men hijack a New York City subway train and demand $1 million dollars which must be delivered in 1 hour for the release of the passengers held hostage. Lt. Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) of the New York City Transit Police must contend with City Hall, the demands of the hijackers, and the ticking clock in his efforts to save the passengers and bring the hijackers to justice. The initial hijacking plan doesn't seem to make any sense because their options are so limited. At one point Lt. Garber jokingly says: \"They're gonna get away by asking every man, woman and child in New York City to close their eyes and count to a hundred.\" But there is a clever getaway plan coordinated by Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), who plays a former mercenary soldier. His team members include two professional criminals and a fired motorman (Martin Balsam) with a grudge.The main strength of the film is the acting. Shaw, Balsam, and Elizondo each get to play to their own specific skill set. Shaw is cool, devious, and calculating. Balsam is a working class, somewhat decent, criminal. On the other side of things, Matthau is at his sardonic best as Garber. Little time is spent on the back story, subplots, or exploration of motives. It's about a subway train, the bad guys, the good guys, hostages, and money. That's it. comparing the original to the 2009 Tony Scott- directed remake, where substantial screen time is devoted to such concerns, the movie falls well short. Do yourself a favor: instead of watching the remake, seek out the original. It's an urban thriller with charisma and a vitality all of its own.",

Four crooks hijack a NY subway car, holding the passengers for a million dollar ransom or they'll be shot one-by-one for each minute the ransom delivery is late. Whew! Mr. Blue (Shaw), the brains of the gang, is calm, cool, and collected. He better be, because it seems every cop in the city is on the case. Meanwhile, back at subway headquarters, transit cop Garber (Matthau) is trying to keep a handle on the chaos the gang's tight schedule has caused. Usually the authorities are portrayed as cool professionals. Here, they're portrayed much more realistically considering the pressure they're under. And for once, movie cursing amounts to more than just a stab at reality. The profanity amounts to a good pressure check as the crisis intensifies. (Speaking of bureaucrats, somebody really has it in for NYC mayors since the movie's mayor is treated as not only hopelessly inept, but buffoonish, as well!)Matthau and Shaw are excellent in the two leads. Matthau registers just the right amount of wavering emotion one would expect in his situation, while Shaw remains calmly dispassionate right up to the end. A mystery man through and through. And I love that final sequence where director Sargent does a typically Hitchcockian turnaround that has us rooting for Mr. Green (Balsam) as he tries to hide evidence from the cops. And what about the very last shot, about as ironically inspired as I've seen in decades of movie watching. I can't believe there are remakes when this first version appears the last word in suspense.",

Directed by Joseph Sargent and based on a novel by John Godey, with an adaptation by Peter Stone, this motion picture remains a much better film in comparison with the recent one. At least, it is much more realistic, even if those were not the days of computer driven special effects.More than anything, \"The Taking of the Pelham 123\" captured the essence of New York City, as it look in the early 1970s. Those were the days where high crime was rampant, something that has nothing to do with the plot. The four criminals that had planned the hijacking of the subway train running under Park Avenue South, was an act of boldness no one could have imagined.What worked in the film was the amazing cast that was gathered for it. Walter Matthau, was at the top of his career. He gives life to Zach Garber, the police lieutenant negotiating with Mr. Blue, the head of the gang. Robert Shaw proves why he was one of the best actors in whatever he decided to play. Unfortunately, Mr. Shaw died much too young. Martin Balsam appears as the disgruntled former transit authority employee who knows a thing or two about the way the subway was run. Hector Elizondo made a cool Mr. Grey. The supporting cast featured some of New York's best actors in smaller roles. James Broderick, Jerry Stiller, Nathan George, Kenneth McMillan, Tony Roberts and a terrific Doris Roberts as the mayor's wife.The production was shot on the streets of Manhattan with great style and realism by Owen Roizman with a musical score by David Shire. The direction by Joseph Sargent keeps things moving at great speed, reflecting a gritty city that moves so fast, it is hard to keep pace with it. The older Pelham 123 is presently the number 6 line, made famous by J.Lo's song.",

The perfect counterpoint to Shaw and everyone else. The hostages a bit shrill - the film gives us nothing personal about them. Lots of screaming is the only device that makes us sympathize with their terror.Funny script - throw away lines. And very little in the script to make you think oh groan, that wouldn't happen or that couldn't happen or how stupid that was. Airtight logic...nice turn in the last frame with an inimitable Matthau glance. A few of the greats can say with one look that it takes most everyone else a whole page of dialogue to communicate.In summary this is economical no frills \"just tell the d*mn story\" film-making in the mold of Don Siegel - Eastwood of the last 20 years and Sidney Lumet throughout his career.

Still its lacking on some fronts, which prevents this movie from being an absolute perfect classic, though it really could had became one, since the right ingredients for it were definitely there.The movie looks like a '70's movie, just mostly because it simply got made in the '70's and technically also got made like one but it yet just doesn't have that typical '70's feeling over it. The movie just doesn't has this typical gritty and realistic kind of atmosphere all over it. The movie also isn't filmed with an awful lot of experimental cinematic tricks, such as you would expect from an '70's movie. Only the editing is totally typical '70's like. The fact that this movie doesn't really feel like an '70's movie might be a disappointing aspect about the movie.Even though the story is well constructed and especially the ending is really great and suitable for the movie as a whole, the actual main plot-line is still lacking. I don't know, the whole hijack to me didn't really seemed like a great and perfect criminal plan. It also is a missed opportunity that you just never get to know one of the hostage, which makes the whole hostage situation kind of emotional shallow and uninvolved. This takes away lots of the tension and surprises in the movie. As a thriller this is just a totally lacking movie. The movie also doesn't feature any big action sequences or chases in it, to make the movie more exciting in parts. The movie features a surprising amount of humor in it. Of course not the hilarious forced kind of humor but more the sort of the same style that also got used in \"Dog Day Afternoon\", which by the way got released one year after this movie. Especially the dialog is really effective.I won't pretend as if I'm a Robert Shaw expert, since I actually have, as of yet, seen surprisingly few movies with him starring in it (only 4, with this one included) but it seems to me that for every role he learned a different accent, which shows what a great and committed actor he really was! In this movie he uses a very thick English accent. Also Walter Matthau was really well cast. Most of the supporting actors were still fairly unknown at their time and it includes Hector Elizondo and Jerry Stiller.It's a real great and highly enjoyable and recommendable 'in between' movie but just not really a must-see '70's classic in my opinion, even though it still deserves an high rating.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The hair-gripping suspense is the major element for this type of film, and it may last more than an hour to prepare for the unexpected to happen. Robert Shaw (\"Quint\" from JAWS) has done fine performances, and his part in leading the hijacking quartet is a sensible role. Little do we know that these \"villains\" are more stylish and handsome in description, rather than the tackiness. But hang on for the climactic section of the Pelham subway train; the fast-paced editing meant new creativity in 70s movies. I appreciated the comedy relief being added to this exciting film because the feeling turns more episodic for its increased value, and this special blend of formula works. It might actually mistaken the careless viewer for blaming on the corny dialogue spoken by many of the actors!

Though it has a rather undeveloped story, the movie is backed by a phenomenal share of performers and spattered with moments of comic relief.This is the story of four men who hijack a New York subway car (Pelham 123). While their motives are never really explained, their demands are simple: one million dollars in exchange for the eighteen passengers being held hostage. Where the idiotic mayor (with a striking resemblance to former New York mayor, Ed Koch) fails to respond to the emergency, the Lueteneit of the New York Transit Authority (Walter Matthau) prepares to negotiate with the men and save as many of the hostages as possible. This is no easy task of course, given the unrelenting \"leader\" of of the gang of four, Mr. Blue (yes, this serves as the precedent for Tarrantino's 'Resevoir Dogs,' as do many things in 1970s cinema), played by Robert Shaw, who seems to command the show, making seemingly impossible demands on the authorities. The movie does well with maintaining the pace throughout the picture, with the tension being broken moments of comic relief. Although, the story remains somewhat undeveloped, since we never really find out why the hijackers have chosen to take over the train. Other than Robert Shaw's character, the hijackers are men of few words.However, in spite of this, the movie is still entertaining, due in large part to a terrific cast of acting veterans and regulars, including Marty Balsam, Hector Elizando, and Earl Hindmen (\"Wilson\" on TV's 'Home Improvement') who portray the hijackers, and Jerry Stiller, James Broderick, and many other familiar faces serving as Matthau's support team.Overall, I would recommend seeing this movie, if you're able to find it. Unfortunately, since Hollywood never has any original ideas anymore, 'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' was remade as a made-for-TV movie in 1998. For maximum enjoyment, catch it in its original form. The cast alone is reason enough to watch it.",

Their assessment of this mode of cosmopolitan transportation, probably frightened them, especially if they were to be on the Pelham line during this particular fiasco!! By attrition, all of the belligerent reprobates who orchestrated this depraved debacle, wound up being their own undoing while in the process of terrorizing New York City .. It was mere conjecture as to whether or not the law enforcement units of New York would capitulate to such blatant blackmail.. As it turned out, this was a crap shoot that these academic hoodlums won!! So many details related to this crime were convincingly earmarked in their favor, so what went wrong? I'll tell you what went wrong: Of all the days to catch a cold!! This movie dealt with garnering an emerging empathy with the malaise movie-viewer to allow many different walks of life to assert themselves!! Movies and television have always had a knack for glamorizing heinous crimes!! So many criminals have incredibly brilliant minds!! Many hypothetical theories manufacture the distorted contention that \"If these criminals used their minds to do something constructive, they would be able to make as much, if not more money, legitimately, than they do by stealing it!!\" Unfortuneatly, I have just this analogy to counter that statement with: \"All the change that I have found under the cushions of the living room sofa have amounted to enough money to be able to pay off the mortgage\" Basically, this is just an exaggerated figure of speech!! The '2009 version of this film has intrigued me, I am very interested in finding out how good it is!! The original 1974 movie is so creative!! One little detail which employs deductive reasoning winds up solving this entire case!!! It becomes a proverbial instance of three strikes and you're out!! Such a scenario makes these visceral components to this sordid incident, the outlaw's ultimate Achilles heal!! This movie keeps you interested from start to finish, not too many movies are capable of doing that!! The acting, the directing, and the fast paced cinematography of New York City in this film were all fantastic!! I give this film five stars... It is on my top 50 list!!! Definitely!!!! See the new one if you want to, however, without question, it goes without saying that you should see the 1974 version first!!!",

            "content": "Yes we know this is where Tarantino got his idea of colour-coding his criminals in his debut crime-feature \"Reservoir Dogs (1992)\", but this film should be watched for not that reason. For what we get is an authentic looking thriller that might not be spectacular, but it's starkly intense and littered with hard-bitten wit. It doesn't come any anymore down 'n gritty than this! Rather than concentrating on set-pieces or action, it's the grimy character interplay and detailed realism reeling from its New York locations sets it rolling. A bold, tightly plotted story seems constantly busy, even if it doesn't look it. The humour is thick, but the edgy style of it works. There's a whole bunch of cursing and cussing\u0085 yep it can be crude, stereotypical and ugly to listen to, but it holds your interest without much trouble. This could be due to a standout cast led magnificently by Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. Matthau is superb as the weathered, but head-smart Lt. Garber. He just has a knack to hold you mesmerised by what was coming off his tongue with those well-timed jibs. Shaw is also quite good in a cunningly cool 'n' collected presentation as the head-honcho of the criminals Mr. Blue. Martin Balsam as the cautious Mr. Green, Hector Elizondo as the hot-wire Mr. Grey and Earl Hindman as the straight-forward Mr. Brown put in fine performances. There are also amusing support bits by Jerry Stiller, Dick O'Neill, Lee Wallace, Doris Roberts, Tom Pedi and a wonderfully humorous Tony Roberts. Director Joseph Sargent makes something that's very exciting, intense and unpredictable from what could look rather ordinarily plain on paper. Its minimal, workmanlike quality just grinds away and effectively balances out the thrills and drama to maximum impact with such perfect pacing. David Shire's forcedly, jive-riddled score gets the heart-beating. A fundamental, but squarely to-the-point and credibly raw crime caper that does what it sets out to achieve.",

            "content": "I'm always amused by those who wax nostalgic for 1970's New York. Truth be told, it was a chaotic, dreary period in the city's history as it teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. Corruption and street crime were rampant. It was far from paradise.This grittiness, however, inspired some fine movie-making which perfectly captured the atmosphere and culture in the Big City. With its frantic pace and frenzied intensity, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three represents such an effort. It boasts a fine cast and is well-directed. It features an outstanding score by composer David Shire. And it proves that action-thrillers can indeed be effective without massive budgets and an over-reliance on special effects.Four criminals code named Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Brown and Mr. Grey mastermind the hijacking of an NYC subway train. Detaching a single car holding seventeen people, they demand one million dollars from the city, threatening to shoot one hostage for each minute the money is late. NY Transit Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) is tasked with handling the crisis and communicating directly with their leader, the ruthless Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw). Garber is the quintessential New Yorker; cynical yet quick on his feet. With the help of Police Captain Rico Petrone (Jerry Stiller), he matches wits with the criminals in an effort to deliver the money, save the hostages and identify and apprehend the hijackers.The movie never drags and keeps us guessing. Despite its serious theme, Pelham has comedic elements- most notably Garber's early dealings with a visiting Japanese transportation delegation and his interplay with a Head Dispatcher (Dick O'Neill) more concerned with keeping his trains running on time than he is with a hostage crisis. Also funny are scenes with the neurotic Mayor of New York trying to gather the ransom by the deadline. It mirrors the buffoonery of many real life politicians unable to effectively handle a crisis and accurately reflects the very real money woes NYC had at the time.Matthau, Shaw, Stiller & O'Neill all perform their roles well, as do Martin Balsam and Hector Elizondo- two members of the heist crew. And The Taking of Pelham also has maybe the best ending I've ever seen in a film. A super movie. Highly recommended.",

Also fine are Shaw and Balsam as two of the villains. Though implausible, the film is quite entertaining, as the suspense builds and reaches a satisfactory if unspectacular climax. Sargent, a veteran of TV, keeps the plot moving at a rapid pace, maintaining a sense of excitement. The supporting cast is peppered with familiar faces.",

While everyone around him seems to be taking things in stride (more or less), his character gets caught up in the gravity of the situation early on. Even so, he seems to have a fatalistic sense of humor about it all (though he never belittles the kidnappers or openly makes light of them or the situation); it's a well-balanced performance by a man who's at the top of his game.

This is in no way a criticism and truth be told makes it more enjoyable in contemporary times where no one is allowed to upset anyone . Remember Sidney Lumet's heist thriller THE ANDERSON TAPES with its homophobic wisecracks ? PELHAM reinforces what would probably qualify as \" hate crime \" amongst humourless critics have probably never cracked a joke or a smile in their entire life . PELHAM is awash with New York City stereotypes and ethnic groups which leads to some witty and funny scenes such as Lt Graber referring to a Japanese guided tour party as \" A bunch of Jap monkeys \" only to have their leader thank him in English . All New Yorkers are loud self centered and the most common job amongst women is prostitution and all Jews are only interested in money:\" Excuse me sir do you mind me asking how much you're getting ? \" \" A million dollars \" Oi vey that's not so good \" The dialogue by Peter Stone is so enjoyable that the main plot of the heist itself is secondary . It's also interesting to note that the villains give themselves code names involving colours , an idea that Taratino referenced blatantly in RESERVIOR DOGS All in all this is a very enjoyable thriller mainly down to the fact that in the 1970s no one who produced a movie thought along the lines of \" Oh we'd better not say that in case we upset anyone \" . In my view the only crime a film maker can do is fail to entertain the audience",

If they are a minute late, they start killing one hostage (they've got 18) every minute they are overdue. They agree to pay the ransom, and they manage to get off with the train running, and in the end, Mr. Blue electrocutes himself on the train tracks, Mr. Grey and Mr. Brown are gunned down, and the only one that gets away, Mr. Green, is caught by Garber (who managed to gather information about criminals that can drive trains, running it down to nine names, and Green's one of them) when he recognises his sneeze, after saying \"gesundheit\".

The villains are villainous. And the cops are as stupid and cowardous as any real cop you'll ever meet.On top of this, the plot revolves around a technical aspect, that hasn't been seen since Rififi, and later films like Mission Impossible and Thomas Crowne Affair (remake) would only live up to.And to fashion an inherently anti-heroic character like a transit authority cop as the hero, above all others in the film, is just golden.It would go on to spawn to remakes of it's own as well...a made for tv movie in the late 90's and full film remake in the 2010's.Not even films like The Italian Job or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels managed to raise themselves to the bar that this film has set, despite their own greatness.It's plain and simply, the greatest heist film ever made...and an underrated masterpiece.Full Stop.10 out of 10.",

            "content": "I try to avoid using words like \"the Best\" when it comes to movies since it is all so subjective. I feel much more comfortable and poised discussing my personal favorites, and why I love them. Walter Matthau is virtually ideal as the world-weary and sarcastic New York police detective. Capable of interjecting quick wit into the most morbid situations and equally capable of committing numerous faux pas, he nonetheless NEVER loses his humanity and does not let fear of ridicule deter him from taking care of the business at hand. I have never seen a movie portray a cop that, at the same time, is so realistic as a human being, entertaining as a character, and effective as a detective despite inevitable false starts. There is not a false note in Matthau's performance.As a perfect complement to Matthau's tour-de-force, the quartet of crooks (Shaw, Elizondo, Balsam, and Hindman) all present facades of coldly and brutally efficient professionalism as robbers-by-choice but murderers-only-by-necessity. Shaw and Elizondo are superb with the two showier roles, but they are made even more effective by the underplayed professional support supplied by Hindman and Balsam. The latter contributes mightily to the film's unforgettable final scene.The plot, music, photography, background, dialog, and the rest of the supporting cast -- most especially Dick O'Neill as a vengeful city worker, Lee Wallace as the whiny mayor, and Tony Roberts as Wallace's image consultant -- are all equally up to the task.I love many 1970's movies. Probably not coincidentally, my #1 favorite remains the Sting, another caper movie. Some of my other favorites that still hold up well today include: Rocky, Sleuth, Patton, M*A*S*H, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, American Graffiti, Paper Moon, Kramer Vs. Kramer, Star Wars, Taxi Driver, Fiddler On The Roof, Brian's Song, The Godfather, The Last Detail, and Cabaret.

Sure Tarantino lifted the color coding of the principles in \"Reservoir Dogs\" yet Joseph Sargent's expression of the crooks as an organized military unit has been a staple of solid crime films since.  Perhaps building on the smooth style of Robert Vaughn from his days working on \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", Sargent has Robert Shaw (Mr. Blue) playing the police like a drum until Mr. Grey throws a wrench into the system.  The classic struggle between the \"intelligent\" versus the \"barbaric\" villain has played itself out in countless films since.  In classic 70's style, this straight forward film is fast moving and doesn't waste a scene.  Each character is developed enough to fit their role in the story and not a bit more.  Peter Stone's writing not only communicates the Godey novel, but clearly reflects the social attitudes of the time.  It only took three scenes and 45 seconds of film to acknowledge the effect of women in the work place and the continuing struggle of minorities in 1974 America. Having not viewed the movie in twenty years, it further reminded me of just how great the 1970s was for film in America and how far we have fallen since.  Can you imagine what Jerry Bruckheimer and crew would do with a remake of this one?  Hopefully whom ever urged him to butcher \"Gone in Sixty Seconds\" didn't like classic noire.",

That was a really good mainstream novel. I dare say this movie does what few movies of good novels ever do - it tells the story even better. I further dare say it trumps another Robert Shaw movie of 1974, the Oscar winner The Sting. Shaw coldly and coolly plays the mercenary who spars with Matthau, playing Leftenant Gah-ber of the NYC transit police, maybe in his best role ever. The movie takes the best pieces of the novel and then adds a couple of twists of its own, just superb screenplay work.

There was obviously a feeling that audiences couldn't handle the amount of tension involved and so some unnecessary comedic elements were added. I'm thinking particularly of the portrayal of the lily-livered, indecisive Mayor of New York (played by Lee Wallace) and, although it was only one scene, the reaction of the drunk woman on the train to the hijacking after it was all over. Assuming that they were added to break the tension, neither succeeded - they didn't add much comedy and they were unnecessary add-ons to a very exciting movie. The very last scene of the movie also left me a bit empty. Frankly, I knew what was going to happen from the moment Garber and Lt. Patrone (Jerry Stiller) showed up at the apartment. True, it was only one scene - but it was the last scene, and - again - it seemed to be written with the intention of making the audience laugh, which seemed out of sync with the whole feel of the movie. Still - a great story and a great movie. 8/10",

Head of the subway is Garber (Walter Matthau) and he communicates with the villains, but he's an intelligent man.

Crime was worse then also. But I must admit that life in the \"City\" was never boring. Living and working there morphed me into being fluent in profanity.\nThis film is centered on a strange, weird hijacking ... of a NYC subway car. The 4 Bad Guys led by the unbelievably GREAT actor Robert Shaw (as leader Mister Blue) take over control of a subway by brandishing machine guns. Among the hijackers is ex-motorman Mister Green, played by great role actor Martin Balsam. They have plans to demand ransom, $1 million, which is probably worth over $10 million now, and to kill hostages unless their demands are met. Using the expertise and knowledge of Balsam/Green, they devise an ingenious plan to escape from the subway tunnels WITH the money and without being discovered by the police. It almost works.",

Another - that, in no way diminished from my enjoying this on TV recently. Yes, there are those repartees that are more a norm, them being organic and all, though they were rehearsed, of the 70's staple, that could be found in movies of any genre (with a few not-too- notable exceptions, of course). Yes, like many movies of that period, it looks like 'French Connection' (the first one). Yes, 'Payback' got the 70's period soundtrack right. This one has the pounding score throughout, except when it's all silent for us to get the sound design. Very nice.The plot's the same, with the plan being the same, and the dead man's feature being the linchpin of the gig. It's been a while since I watched Robert Shaw man it up as the suave baddie. He does one more fantastic job, that evokes memories of his other good roles, in 'From Russia with love' and 'The Sting', among others. he would have made a great Marlowe, along with the other Robert.Speaking of evocative turns, Matthau pretty much mans it up too, throwing politically incorrect barbs all the way, while Jerry Stiller is very much himself, and Hector Elizondo playing the kind of character we have not seen him play in a long, long time, wishing he'd had more screen time. Balsam is, as always, fantastic, and his 'tic' (Hic) that's used very much for effect, and a key twist as well, is super- endearing.The focus is on the narrative throughout, and this has to be one of the best edited features out there, and does not seem dated a bit. Mattahu plays the kind of reluctant and recalcitrant hero we have seen before, but the way he kind of eases into it allows us to get into his shoes quite a few times, and there's no doubt about who's actually in control in all the exchanges he has with Shaw, even though things on the surface might indicate otherwise.Not to be missed, and worth repeat viewings. The remake's pretty decent too, but if I were asked to choose, in spite of my fondness for Tony Scott movies, and the Washington-Travolta combo, I'd have to say that the original's the better movie of the two, even though I saw it after the remake.",

I don't know if I have heard this much verbal abuse in a 100-minute film as this one, although I can think of a few others that are close. It's too extreme and ruined the movie for me, and it's typical of films made around this time in the mid 1970s. These thrillers had a good \"edge\" to them but had such a sleazy atmosphere, I can't enjoy them anymore. Also, despite the premise and the trailers, this movie does not have the amount of action you expect you're going to see.

Four gangsters kidnap a carriage of the New York underground (or subway) and demand a ransom of 1 million dollars for the passengers they are keeping hostage. The big questions are: Will the government pay? And how will they get out of the underground tunnels? The plot is well-constructed and sagging only just a little in the middle passages of the film. Especially the scenes showing the sick mayor of New York don't contribute much; director Joseph Sargent might just as well have done without them. The acting is hard to assess, given that the four gangsters (Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo and Earl Hindman) are covered by so heavy prosthetics that they are almost unrecognisable. Walther Matthau, who plays Lt. Garber of the New York transport police, is of course good as always; his look in the last scene is priceless. In sum: a solid 7 stars-rating.",

The city is a character above and below the ground and is on parade as the hostage drama plays out while a militant 70's jazz score systematically picks up the pulse. There is as much action as humor, but they do not prey upon each other like in today's' action thrillers. They are not simply trying to be cool, but seemingly real...

You had to love it--guys and gals who had little time for some gang holding a subway car full of riders hostage. Some of their attitudes were very welcoming because it was BS-free and others--their penchant for being no-nonsense only made things worse. We got to see the good and the bad of New York hostility and angst.This was a well written movie and well cast with the exception of Walter Matthau and Jerry Stiller. I would say that Matthau and Stiller being cast as lieutenants on the Transit Authority Police Force seemed out of place. As serious as the movie was and as the criminals were Matthau didn't really pull off the serious, keen cop role. Not that he was silly in the role it's just he wasn't that believable.Matthau and Stiller aside, the casting of this movie was still great.

I'm probably guessing but I suppose its got a typical 1990s gloss with added subplots and lots of sanitised political correctness.If I'm incorrect then it still doesn't excuse these feeble 90s excuses for \"action\" films (Speed, Money Train and a host of others), because they're all about as convincing as the Easter Bunny surfing Niagra Falls standing on one leg while singing \"This is the Real thing!\"It might humour a lot of younger people when they see how dated this film really is but at least New York (and action films back then - French Connection, Seven Ups) had a gritty, realism about it. People spoke as they wanting to speak (rightly or otherwise), they didn't have to take a breath before making a remark that might be deemed offensive in today's overly sanitised society. Watching Pelham is like watching a microcosm of New York life at street level: in computer terms, What You See is What You Get!It could have been so easy for director, Jo Sargent to cast \"beautiful people\" instead of the heavily thick-set actors of Matthau, Shaw & Balsam. He could have added a romantic subplot with some pretty young thing being one of the hostages wishing her heroic boyfriend cop will jump over high-speed carriages or leap through windows to save her before the bomb goes off with a second to spare (yawn)!But no, instead Sargent plays it for real. The hostages are all typical New Yorkers, remote, insular and yet real people with ordinary human hearts & mannerisms. The bad guys, too, don't have to try too hard to convince us they mean \"we're professionals\" and therefore \"don't f**k with us\".Robert Shaw & Hector Elizondo in particular are not visually handsome actors some might say; yet they carry a natural air of menace that a lot of today's \"stars\" couldn't create without a lot of makeup, method acting & voice training.I have to say I was somewhat surprised with Matthau's role: I'm not saying that it was above his considerable acting talent because it wasn't; just that we all know he is more familiar with the dry humour & wiseguy comedy role movies  with the likes of Jack Lemmon & Billy Wilder.However, he is quite amazing here as the anti-hero transit cop who has to deal not only with the bad guys stealing the train, but also with the subway manager & buddy, Correll, who is trying to keep the remaining train timetables running(excellently played by Dick O'neill). In fact Correll is more of a Lemmon trade-off since there is still plenty of wisecracking remarks being fired off between both men that lightens the tensions somewhat.The action builds at a tactically measured pace: there is no great hurry to move us or the story along too fast. The script is not overworked and the characters (especially the bad guys) are given enough time to develop into something substantial, so that we the audience can get an inkling into the minds of these calculating professionals.The ending (after the dramatic train-run) is a bit of a let down, and perhaps all too obvious and expected. For once, in a movie like this, you got the feeling that these bad guys are way ahead of the cops on a tactical level and would/should win, and yet they....well.....see for yourself.The real bonus though has to be the score by David Shire. Typical 70s anthems with Jazz, moody blues and a really heavy funk theme at the very beginning - talk about throbbing energy - imagine that playing on your car stereo with the bass on number 10 (or number 11 if you like Spinal Tap)!A superb crime film that has all the right ingredients and no CGIs, no overly done special effects, no silly macho men/new age men, no political axe to grind and no 90s superficiality.****/*****",

Supporting performances from Balsam etc are also top notch.I think a native New Yorker would appreciate the film even more as it is full of NY humour.

In fact, some of the action scenes may seem cheesy by today's standards, but somehow that doesn't matter here. This film is great because of the characters and how well they function on screen. One of my all-time favorite actors, Walter Matthau, is brilliant here in what is one of his best roles, if not his best. His wisecracks alone make this film worth watching, but that's not the only reason it's good. Robert Shaw also plays the leader of the bad guys very well, without being annoying and over-the-top like most villains. The team of villains is also great in that we really get to know each of them enough to make them interesting to us. The main characters make this film good. It is not, however, a completely perfect film, mainly due to the poor supporting cast. Some characters, such as the guys who work at the train station and police department are good for nothing other than complaining and swearing up a storm! An improvement on these minor characters would have made this film flawless. Nevertheless, an excellent action/suspense movie, especially for its time.***1/2 out of ****",

I remember seen it with my dad back in the days when I was a teenager and nowadays that almost everything is available I ordered it and didn't regret it after all. What starts out as a hijack of a metroline in NY slowly turns into a cat and mouse game. The story is so strong that it never bored me at all. Even as I still remember what did happen you just sit through this action thriller and the ride is over before you know it. earlier I told that there were no effects and before people will say hey, there are, well, speeding up the reel isn't an effect for me, what you see happening above ground and in the metrolines is actually filmed in NY. No shaky camera's or over the top shots, straight in your face as it should be done. Perfect, no go take the ride.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",

            "review_title": "Fast Moving, Exciting Seventies Thriller..What a Ride!",
            "content": "I caught this movie coming on last night on Turner Classic Movies, and not being sleepy, decided to settle back and enjoy a film that I had not seen since I was a boy of eleven when it first came out and my parents took me. I had forgotten what a thrilling, exciting, and often uproariously funny gem of a thriller this movie was, and it still holds up beautifully almost four decades later.I read in the trivia that the producers said that PELHAM was a smash hit in cities with subways but flopped pretty much everywhere else, which I find hard to understand, because you do not need to be familiar with any subway system to enjoy this movie's taut script, edgy direction, brilliant performances, perfect atmospheric score, and the astonishing way it walks the tightrope between nail-biting suspense and laugh-out-loud comedy (The Mayor of New York is a particular joy; looks a bit like Ed Koch and whines about being booed in public, and sure enough, when he makes his obligatory public appearance, the crowd boos. That moment alone is worth the price of the ticket.) Interestingly enough, this film came out four years BEFORE Koch became Mayor; a happy accident, if you will, but one that makes the movie that much more fun. Back to the main plot. I think by now, thanks to the 2009 remake (though God knows why they bothered; you cannot improve on what is already nearly perfect), most people know at least the bare bones of the plot: Four men in disguises hijack a Lexington Avenue line subway train, detaching one car from the rest of the train and demanding a million dollars in one hour or they will begin shooting hostages (a wonderful collection of characters as New York as they can get). The task of dealing with this crisis falls to Transit Authority policeman Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau, brilliant as always), who must rouse the Mayor out of his sickbed (he has the flu), butt heads with MTA official Corell (Dick O'Neill in a splendid performance), and do his usual bellowing and strutting, all with perfectly executed timing, in an effort to get the crisis resolved without the shedding of innocent blood.The villains are a fascinating lot. Led by Robert Shaw in a chilling performance as Mr Blue (they use colors as code names), the crew consists of Mr Grey (Hector Elizondo), a trigger-happy former mobster (is there such a thing?), Mr Brown (Earl Hindman), the group's general gofer, and Mr Green (Martin Balsam in another of the splendid character roles he was so justly famous for), a former subway motorman fired by the MTA and presumably trying to get even, and suffering from a rather noticeable head cold (keep your eye on that).This is one of those great movies that is bigger and better than the sum of its parts. Its parts are nothing to sneeze at (you should excuse the pun), but put together, they create nothing short of cinematic magic; this is easily one of the best suspense thrillers since Hitchcock's heyday, and I think the Master of Suspense would have been proud to claim it as his own.Predictably enough, things do not go as smoothly as Garber would wish; getting a million dollars together in less than an hour is no small feat (demonstrated in a brilliant montage of scenes of hands and machines counting, sorting, and bundling hundred-dollar bills), and Garber's pleas for more time fall on deaf ears. Blue is a cold, calculating killer and completely impossible to turn from his purpose.I won't give away too much more, but at the crisis point the subway car is rigged so that it will go from Times Square to South Ferry (roughly fifty City blocks or so) with nothing but green signals so that it will not only not stop, but will pick up speed and eventually we are faced with a runaway subway car, screaming hostages, police rendered impotent, and a chiller of a denouement that ends at the final moment with an unexpected laugh (I won't tell you what it is; it would be too much of a spoiler).I am a native New Yorker and lived there for more than forty years and rode the subways regularly, so this movie was and is a particular treat for New Yorkers. But you don't have to be from New York, or even familiar with the inner workings of a city subway system, to be captivated by Joseph Sargent's brilliant and exciting creation, with a sensational script by Peter Stone, and Owen Roizman's marvelous camera-work, a particularly notable accomplishment since, this story being set in the subway, much of the action has perforce to take place in the dark or semi-dark.Great ride. Great film. And you don't have to be from New York to love it.",

            "review_title": "Another '70s NYC classic",
            "content": "The 1970s was a great decade for New York City-set films. The city itself was on the edge, which probably climaxed when then-President Gerald Ford basically told NYC to go f--k itself. In this trying decade, William Friedkin, Sidney Lumet, Martin Scorsese, among others, made some classic, gritty films. Joseph Sargent, a much lesser-known filmmaker, had his own mini masterpiece with The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.A very simple plot - four individuals--initially strangers--donning glasses, mustaches, and hairpieces, and given fake names based on colors, hijack a subway and hold the city hostage for an hour, demanding $1M. Of the four hijackers, the two played by Robert Shaw (\"Mr. Blue\") and Martin Balsam (\"Mr. Green\") get the most attention - and background stories. Blue is an ex-British Royal Army officer who ended up as a mercenary in Africa. Blue is basically devoid of emotions, cool, and calculating - a sociopath. And Blue is a long way from the character of Quint, who Shaw would so memorably bring to life a year later in \"Jaws.\" Green is a former subway motorman who was fired for his involvement in a narcotics smuggling operation. Green is also suffering from a nasty cold, and sneezes repeatedly, annoying Blue and the other two hijackers.Mr. Grey is another psychopath who was kicked out of the Mafia for being \"too violent\" (although seeing how violence should be an asset for the Mafia, \"too reckless\" was probably the real reason). We don't learn much about Mr. Brown, the fourth hijacker.Transit police lieutenant Garber (Walter Matthau, fairly relaxed amidst the chaos of the transit headquarters during the movie) is the main channel of communication between the hijackers - Mr. Blue only - and the city. Mr. Blue gives the city exactly an hour, not even one minute more, to deliver the money, in stacks of non-sequential $100 and $50 bills. Easier said than done, but Blue doesn't care. If the city fails to deliver on time, one hostage will be killed for every minute the city is late.Although most of the action takes places under Manhattan, this is still a living and breathing NYC movie. The subway passengers who are hijacked are a cross-cultural graph of the city: Irish, Italian, Jewish, Puerto Rican, Black. And in the mix is an undercover cop who doesn't make his presence known until the end of the film. Why? As Garber calmly explains to his hot-headed colleagues, it's one cop with a handgun vs. Four hijackers with machine guns. Do the math, pal. Occasionally the action moves to street level, and Garber has an exchange with the deputy inspector tracking the terrorists and the train that predates a similar exchange between Jackie Gleason and a Black police officer in Smokey and the Bandit three years later.Regarding the other actors in the film, Balsam is pretty much one note as the disgruntled former motorman, but is the only member of the hijacking team with a conscience. Hector Elizondo, who later appeared in several Garry Marshall comedies, is perfectly hateful as the racist, misogynistic, gum smacking former Mafiaso with the amusing real name of Giuseppe \"Joe Welcome\" Benvenut.Matthau, who was known mostly as a comedic actor, is just perfect as the cynical, wise-cracking, yet tough when he needs to be, lieutenant. An early running gag in the film involves Garber offering a tour to several Japanese transit executives. Believing none of them speak English, Garber makes some inappropriate comments and ends up with his foot in his mouth when he learns they do in fact speak English. There are more comedic moments involving the highly unpopular mayor, loosely modeled after Abraham Beame.This film has left its stamp on current pop culture, as it is a favorite of Quentin Tarantino, who named his diamond heist crew in Reservoir Dogs after colors, as a tribute to this film. And a remake with Denzel Washington and John Travolta surfaced in 2009. But for a real slice of the Big Apple in all its mid '70s glory, the original can't be beat.",

            "content": "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (a.k.a Pelham 1-2-3) is a riveting suspense movie that builds on great acting, a fine script, and an amazing story line! Walter Matthau plays a lead Police Lieutenant assigned to stop a group of four men who have hijacked a New York City Subway train. Four hijackers, with characteristics that inspired Quentin Tarentino's Reservoir Dogs, demand a one million dollar ransom within a near impossible to reach time limit, threatening to kill one hostage on the train for each minute that the money is late.An amazing music score captivates the viewer immediately. We are drawn into a character study of people representing diverse New York populations. However the real drama and tension of the movie is watching Walter Matthau and the hijacking leader Robert Shaw communicate and compromise about the hostages and the money in a race against time. Viewers of this film will actually feel as if they are part of this terrible and dramatic experience.The one small spoiler that brings the movie down a bit is in negotiating with the hostages and trying to get the mayor's approval, he says, \"This city doesn't have a million dollars.\" This is one statement that hurts the credibility of this fine film. Even in 1974, when this film was released, New York City had far more than a million dollars if these types of situations were to take place. Having the producers place a higher number for the ransom amount may have helped here.There are other elements of the film that are very real. Authentic subway cars were used during filming, and many of the scenes have very dramatic shootouts in tunnels where you can't be sure who's dead and who has survived after the gunfire has stopped. It are little surprises around every corner that will keep you riveted to this movie till the end.Speaking of the climax, the end of this picture may be one of the most brilliantly written scenes in cinema! Whatever you do, don't bother with the two remakes of this film. There is no way that either of them can hold a candle to this slick action flick!",

The latter spout dialog usually complete with a smirk; Matthau and the rest are in too big a hurry to deal with the problem at hand. Read the quotes in the header above; none are followed by a reaction shot but rather the film flows around them. And how nice it is to see the head cop not be a rogue, but rather a simple slob just doing his job.

I saw this on television in the 70's and thought it was amazing and then rented it about five years ago.This film is so finely acted by a cast of really great actors. Walter Matthau proves that he's a very versatile actor in this film. I've heard that he didn't like to be described as a comic, that he liked being referred to as an actor and for good reason. He can play anything. Look at this film, \"Charade,\" \"The Fortune Cookie,\" \"Fail-Safe,\" and \"The Laughing Policeman,\" the latter made a year before this film and a really bad and incredibly dull movie in my opinion.Other actors are great in this film. Robert Shaw is great. Tony Roberts has a great part. Jerry Stiller proves he's more than a comic actor. Martin Balsam, an actor whom I can't remember really getting his due, is great in this film. Hector Elizondo doesn't really get a lot to do.The film really captures the sense of a confined space with the subway. Directing a film in a tight space is probably pretty difficult.

            "content": "When Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo, and Earl Hindman board the Pelham 123 train, no one thinks anything of it. They don't appear to know each other, and they keep to themselves - until they don't. Robert is the ringleader, staging a kidnapping and hostage with demands for one million dollars in exactly one hour or they'll start killing the passengers. Walter Matthau is the police lieutenant in charge of negotiations, and with New York traffic, unavailable politicians, slow manpower at the bank, and other obstacles, he struggles to buy time to save lives.Though a fun diversion for the evening, this movie has been remade twice, and this one definitely has the flavor of the 1970s. Also, I didn't care for the screenplay. In particular, the scenes with Mayor Lee Wallace and Lieutenant Walter Matthau felt glib and unrealistic - as though screenwriter Peter Stone thought, \"People will think this sounds so cool!\" In a realistic situation, the people involved on the other side of the hostage negotiations would never be so cavalier. Matthau would not step away from the phone for a smoke break, needing to be summoned when the kidnapper is ready to talk again. Wallace would not trade witty barbs about his political career when first confronted with the news of the crisis.However, if you like disaster movies with a train setting, like The Incident or Unstoppable, you can check it out. It's definitely entertaining, as long as you can get past the slick screenplay. And if you can pretend someone besides Walter Matthau is the lead, like Glenn Ford or Paul Newman. Maybe it's just me, but I don't see Walter as either the \"hero cop\" type or the fellow someone would turn to in a crisis.",

Well worth the price of admission, but be careful not to accidently get last year's TV movie version of it; it's got nothin on the original.",

When I first watched this movie, as soon as I heard the opening theme song I was hooked. Then once the movie began, I was on the edge of my seat all the way to the end. I get those feelings every time I watch this movie! One time I skimmed through the novel this movie is based on by Morton Freedgood, known professionally as John Godey. I thought: \"this would make a great movie!\" When I got home, I looked it up and sure enough they made a movie based on the book. All I can say is; this is one of the most faithful book to screen adaptions in all of cinema. It followed the original novel story exactly! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack. This movie fires on all cylinders, and then some! Walter Matthau is perfect as the main character; Garber, and Robert Shaw is stellar as the main villain. The rest of the cast also does exceptionally well! The story is phenomenal, it will keep you hooked from beginning to end. I am not going to spoil anything else, but the ending is one of the most memorable in the history of cinema. This movie is like an ultimate thrill ride, I can watch it 1,000,000 times in a row and never get tired of it. Without question, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\", go watch it. If you've seen it already, watch it again. This movie is that good! I guarantee you'll enjoy it. What are you waiting for? Go check out the movie right now. The subway train is leaving!",

I discovered it when I was a teen and have never forgotten it; the day after the airing on a TV channel, the Paris subway - at least the carriage where I was in - stopped between two stations, and folks around me began to talk about TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE which was on every TV the evening before. It was in 1979 and in France there were only three channels, and the movie was aired in prime time; so only a few people missed it. That's because of this incident I remind the viewing of this milestone in the hostage thriller history. Robert Shaw outstanding as the cold blooded gang leader, a pure mechanic without any feeling, a character faithful to the John Godey's novel, that I have read ten times, less than the viewing of the film. Walter Mathau also awesome, and I don't speal of Marty Balsam. Tense, taut, tough, a film that you won't forget, believe me. Terrific piece of work.",

This 1974 version is so well done, from throwing you immediately into the story, to great actor choices like Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw, it's hard not to like \u2013 more or less love \u2013 this film. It dispenses with unnecessary romantic subplots, and never deviates from the cat and mouse game interwoven from start to finish. Shaw is captivating as the menacing mastermind, and Matthau is surprisingly good as his would-be nemesis. Even the supporting cast from Jerry Stiller to Maltin Balsam (as \"Mr. Green\" \u2013 BIG smiles for all BIG 'Reservoir Dogs' fans out there) to Hector Elizondo are wonderful choices. Sure the clothing is dated as is perhaps some of the Seventies lingo, but it never detracts from the intense story. It really has that 70s movie feel and the external Manhattan scenes are terrific. If there is any negative to be given about this film, the less-than dramatic ending and its subsequent frozen last image could have used an additional Hollywood-styled edge-of-your-seat conclusion. Otherwise, this a movie is well worth the watch.",

The film is gritty and does not paint a pretty picture of New York, suggesting that everyone is corrupt, bad-tempered and couldn't give a damn about anyone. No one is happy and it is interesting to see that the hijacked portion of the train coincidentally contains a perfect cross section of society (an old man, a young man, a negro, a prostitute, a woman with kids, etc). This is just nitpicking, and the film does have some good characterisations. The film also contains some wonderful New York banter with liberal use of \"Goddammit.\"  Added to all this is a brilliantly funky jazz soundtrack that really captures the mood of the film. The casting of Robert Shaw as the leader of the violent hijacking gang perhaps started off a trend for US film makers to employ English actors as baddies. Watch it.

Walter Matthau's greatest movie, backed by a tremendous supporting cast that captures the mood and fabric of New York at that time. A perfect mix of dark comedy (some scenes of which would end up scrapped today---and in fact have, on a rather poor remake of the movie for TV several years back) and dead serious drama. You need just the right type of people in a movie of this kind, and this one is brilliantly cast, in some cases right down to physical attributes---even the mayor (Lee Wallace) resembles Mayor Koch (before he was elected!).

Garber is the wise-cracking, world-weary New Yorker - Mr Blue the intelligent, cool, calculating Englishman who somehow still manages to retain an air of English politeness and good manners while being a ruthless killer. This film combines tension and suspense with laughs along the way - not an easy combination - but it works. By the way, I've noticed some comments about Shaw along the lines of him \"working hard to sound English\".

This obviously well planned endeavor executed by intelligent men involves taking a train that can only follow the tracks, in a tunnel, no less. Everyone knows where the tracks go and where all (known) escape routes are.Using the then state of the art technology, the appropriate branches of the New York City Government work together as a well oiled machine. The clunky patching together of their different communications systems allow them to privately snipe at each other while still cooperating to insure every exit is covered.Made in 1974, it has the heavy handed obligatory anti-discrimination dogma crow-barred in to place in an occasionally successful attempt at humor. That emphasizes how the workplace had recently changed with respect to sex, race, and country of origin no longer predicting holders of positions of authority in a large municipality. Like their technology, it is now seems out of place and is an interesting comment on that time in our history.I appreciate how, with few exceptions, the principles involved are good at their job. From the Mayor down to the conductor on the train, they are competent, with no contrived weaknesses added as a mere plot device.

The first is its time capsule value in capturing a typical day in the city during the 1970s. Note how incredibly antiquated much of the equipment was, specifically the telecommunications gear which probably hadn't changed for 40 years. Also interesting is the latitude in offensive remarks towards women and minorities that has since been criminalized. The second was the handling of terrorism, which really at that time was a new concept and out of the playbook for the authorities. Remember that in those days, we basically gave the terrorists what they wanted so that they would release their hostages, and then hoped to apprehend them in their escape. Yes the film is therefore dated, but in this case, it's a positive. I don't often feel this way towards films from this era. The cast is fantastic. Robert Shaw is a somewhat forgotten figure in film, even though he appears in some of the biggest movies of the time. Here as always, he is a pleasure to watch. Matthau sort of lead foots the New York accent, but he also gives a first rate performance. The final freeze shot of his unforgettable mug is classic. Good stuff!",

This is a wonderful work of suspense that's totally character-driven, with Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw and all the rest giving outstanding performances. But the main character is New York City, with all the supporting characters and bit players providing a beautiful, tragicomic tableau of NYC as it was in those days.

Walter Matthau is a surprisingly tough sleuth, playing a transit cop; Stiller is excellent as well as the laconic police chief, Elizondo and Shaw (both generally under-appreciated) play an edgy ex-mob killer and a former mercenary captain, respectively. Also look out for the excellent Nathan George as a patrolman and Julius Harris as Inspector Daniels. The late Matthau is excellent as usual, balancing wit with a tough, pragmatic and sometimes even effusive edge. The film even manages to make a little bit of fun of the time period's ethics- both a running joke made of Japanese trainmen and one about a police officer being female both are corrected in fine fashion.The Taking of Pelham One Two Three itself is steeped in classic New York flavor- the fashions, the speech, the train culture, the characters, the comebacks, the lampooning of the mayor (not so strange in the Lindsay years) and so on. Filmed in the classic period where so many films were made in NYC, this could be one of the best for seeing the city itself- in one scene, a police cruiser must speed uptown from the financial district; in another, excellent views of the FDR drive.Matched with an exciting score- the 12-tone funk jazz piece by David Shire- this is a classic piece of action cinema. I recommend it very highly for train fans, NYC enthusiasts, 70's film buffs or anyone looking for a great piece of suspense.",

As the train car is stopped in the subway tunnel it wreaks havoc upon the rest of the subway system. Transit Police Lieutenant Zackary Garber (Walter Mathau) makes contact with Mr. Blue who demands $1 million ransom in exchange for the passengers.The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is an adaptation of the 1973 book of the same name by John Godey. The movie came out during the so-called \"golden age\" of skyjacking while New York City had been dealing with an ongoing financial crisis and rising crime and Godey being a subway buff wrote the novel combing the two elements with his knowledge of the Subway system. Having acquired the rights to the story, Palomar Pictures assigned director Joseph Sargent and writer Peter Stone to adapt the film to be produced on location in New York City's Subway. Due to the nature of the novel's premise and detail oriented approach to the hijacking the film makers had issues securing the cooperation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and it was only after downplaying technical elements of the heist, refusing to show cars with graffiti, and the encouragement of then mayor John Lindsay that the MTA allowed filming. The movie was both a critical and commercial success upon its initial release and to this day is considered one of the best action thrillers of the 70s and has served as a template for subsequent films. The movie is the prime example of a simple idea done to its fullest effect.The movie does well in establishing itself right from the opening where we follow several nondescript men in hats, overcoats, glasses, and mustaches boarding the train one-by-one. Intercut with the setup we get Walter Mathau giving a great performance as Zackery Garber giving a tour of the Subway administration offices to a visiting group of representatives from Tokyo's own subway system believing they don't understand a word he's saying only to serve as pitch perfect payoff to a punchline later. The movie does a good job of combing its strong thriller setup with a healthy dose of humor as the film creates a lot of memorable characters with large personalities coupled with engaging performances. And then of course we have the robbers themselves who are lead by the late great Robert Shaw as Mr. Blue and much like Shaw's performances in Jaws and The Sting this is an influential benchmark of a performance even if it hasn't leant itself to parody and homage like his most notable works. With The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, you can see the seeds of influence that would influence subsequent creative works such as Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs also featuring robbers with \"Mr. Color\" codenames or even the setup in Die Hard of the protagonist and antagonist talking to each other over a phone or radio prior to their ultimate confrontation. The action side of the film is also rich with tension and the climax involving the train and the red light/green light system is a real seat gripper.The Taking of Pelham One Two Three remains a solid benchmark for genre filmmaking with likable characters, good performances, and a balance of humor and thrills. While the film being so ingrained in the 1970s can occasionally serve as a bit of a barrier, it does little to detract from the bevy of strong performances and moments in the film as a whole.",

At 2:13 PM, the demands are made: $1 million is to be delivered to them in EXACTLY one hour, or they kill one hostage for every minute the money is late. And if any outsiders interfere in any way, the hostages get killed immediately, regardless! It is thus up to a very cagey NYC transit cop (the late, great Walter Matthau) to try and buy some time to not only get the money to the hijackers through the Big Apple gridlock, but to also get a bead on them. He winds up finding two of Shaw's associates (Hector Elizondo, Earl Hindman) already dead; and when he finds Shaw, the mastermind of the hijacking electrocutes himself! One man, however, has escaped detection--the motorman (Martin Balsam). And in order to wrap this caper up, both Matthau and an associate (Jerry Stiller) must find that elusive motorman and, if possible, the money.Full of snappy and rather salty dialogue, plenty of suspense, and black comedy, THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE offers up a solid contrast between Matthau and Shaw, which keeps the film moving through the slow spots, what few there are. Joseph Sargent, who directed the 1970 sci-fi drama COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT, really lays the tension on, buoyed by an excellent score by David Shire. This is an absolute must-see for those fans of action and suspense films who believe that you don't need testosterone and explosions to be on the edge of your seat. 10/10 Amazing.",

Matthau is great in this is the witty cop -- kind of like a precursor to Jerry Ohrbach's Lenny Briscoe on Law and Order.

Sheer force of character!  Robert Shaw is evil, and we know it from the git go.  He conveys this to the audience without shooting anyone, kicking a dog, or beating a woman.  Matthau is a transit cop who is a bit worn down and cynical.  But under the cynicism you can sense the toughness and determination.  These two characters are the perfect protagonists.  Much better than DeNiro and Pacino.  It is the tension between these two characters that keep you on the edge of your seat - not the action of which there is very little.Add to this a great ensemble cast that includes Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo, and the city of New York, and a very clever plot with a wonderful little twist at the end, and you have one of the best crime films of the 70s.  Hell, you've got one of the best crime films of them all.And best of all, the film translates well to the small screen.

Not because it's a tough, no nonsense realistic thriller full of great and not overdone action with a completely predictable ending; that's beside the point. Even the most realistic thriller was quite predictable by the early '70s and most have not aged well. And it's to counteract that 'recognition' of something you've seen a hundred times before and sell people the same mediocre product again and again that all we get nowadays are movies with more and more special FX and less attention to holes in plots (which don't make much of a difference in the box-office bottom line anyway). But no special FX extravaganza can come near a film that has geniunly interesting and real characters. \"Pelham 1,2,3\" is interesting because of the characters, what an Oscar winner like \"The French Connection\" doesn't have enough of. It is interesting not only because of the fantastic performance of Robert Shaw (only matched by Rutger Hauer's in \"NightHawks\"), but the many authentic New York characters scattered throughout the movie: not so much Walter Mathau (who's great in his role) but more his hot-headed jerk of a partner or the other hothead who gets shot on the tracks or the police captain played by that Jimmy Cagney-meets-dough-boy Irish guy who later portrayed Barney in \"The Pope of Greenwich Village.\" The city of New York (and the people in it) becomes the main character in the film and keeps it rocking into a more poetic zone. Also, if anyone out there is interested in 'Subway related' films, they should definitely check out \"The Incident\" starring Martin Sheen and Tony Musante, a great film that's so realistic it's hard to believe it was shot on a soundstage!",

Robert Shaw is absolutely unforgettable as the cold-blooded terrorist leader. His British accent and erudite, sophisticated demeanor make for a wonderfully evil villain who hisses his lines like a deadly snake. Shaw's villain is an icy monster who never looses his composure\u0097he even absently mindedly works crossword puzzles while waiting for the ransom to be delivered\u0097and thinks no more of killing innocent hostages than swatting a fly.This is one of the best crime/suspense films of the 1970s and deserves a much wider audience than it has.

This film seems to be the inspiration for later action films that would employ the same formula of action and smart dialogue, \"Die Hard\" immediately comes to mind.The acting in this movie was top-notch and it was great fun seeing a lot of people that weren't yet names, such as James Broderick, Jerry Stiller and Doris Roberts. I especially enjoyed seeing a favorite actor of mine, Tony Roberts, as a fast-talking, wisecracking Deputy Mayor. (Although I'll admit that I like him only because I once had a deep crush on his breathtakingly gorgeous daughter.)Walter Matthau was at his dry, sarcastic best as Lt. Gerber. His scenes with the Japanese businessmen (I had to snicker at the guy with the large camera-the stereotypical Japanese shutterbug) are classic, especially his \"this way, dummies\" remark.Robert Shaw was also at his insane best as the leader of the terrorist group, as was Martin Balsam as the sneezing brakeman. One thing that I wondered was how such a disparate group of men could ever have hooked up in the first place. But no matter. One thing that disappointed me was the fate of three of them. After all they did, what happened to them seemed anti-climatic. Particularly Robert Shaw. I was hoping for more than him frying himself on the third rail.The end, when Matthau catches Balsam, is truly classic. The look on Matthau's face when he realizes he has his man is the best shot of the film and and a great closing shot. Gesundheit.",

Robert Shaw is icy as Mr. Blue, devising a near perfect crime while maintaining extreme professionalism. It is Shaw's performance that elevates Pelham to a classic as he remains calm as everyone else panics and worries and that plays beautifully off his fellow hijackers Balsam and Elizondo, and even off Matthau through the radio.While the remake is a fine movie, it is nowhere near the caliber of the original.

Walter Matthau was fairly good as the subway cop who was frustrated by everything (including, I'd guess, the plot). Photography was good. I liked the musical score. Now the bad things. SPOILERS AHEAD. The whole plot boils down to this: bad guys hijack a subway car filled with riders who become hostages, and demand one million dollars or they will murder the hostages. That's it. That's the plot. And it just does not work. I knew from the very beginning that the hostages would never be murdered. I knew from the start that the hijackers would not get away with it -- either they would wind up dead or arrested, or they'd lose the money. That was the entire basis of the \"suspense.\" So for me, there was no suspense. This made the entire remainder of the movie an exercise in futility. I can hear the director and producers saying, \"How many different complications can we stick in this movie to keep the audience worried? Let's have the hijackers demand a million dollars in an impossibly short period of time, so that it's obvious it won't be delivered and all the hostages will be killed. Let's have the mayor sick and weak and stupid and unable to make a simple decision, unable to decide to pay the ransom and save the lives of innocent hostages. Let's make the main hijacker (Robert Shaw) really really smart, but so stupid that he makes one impossible demand after another, despite the fact that what he supposedly wants is the million bucks. When the cops finally try to deliver the ransom, let's put every conceivable roadblock in their way, literally, to make it appear that they will never reach the subway on time. Meanwhile, let's inject a lot of absurd \"comic relief,\" like maybe having some Japanese people visit and be treated in a racist manner. When the hijackers finally leave the subway car with their money, let's not end the movie there, let's have the subway car become a runaway car, so now the audience has to worry about whether they will all be killed when the car crashes. Let's not end it there, either -- let's have a shootout at the subway corral, and then the hero (Walter Matthau) can get the drop on the bad guy (Robert Shaw). No, wait, what if the bad guy refuses to give up, and instead electrocutes himself on the notorious third rail? Wow! No, wait, let's not end it yet -- what if one hijacker is still at large, the one who sneezes all the time, and Walter Matthau tracks him down and thinks he's innocent until he sneezes? Bottom line, I can't believe I'm in such a tiny minority here, I can't believe people were entertained by this stuff.

In those days, a \"sneak preview\" was just that, a movie studio sneaked upcoming releases into the theatres without the benefit of early press reports. It was a tactic used to create early buzz through word of mouth from those who were fortunate enough to witness an early release of what may have gone on to become a hit\u0085thanks, in part, to the \"unwitting sneak preview marketing team\".That evening's sneak was Pelham and it was exactly what I wanted to see in a movie of that genre type. There was no \"early word\" no \"buzz\" no \"plot description\", just a story that unfolded before my eyes.I loved it! The movie's most worthy accomplishment, in my opinion, was the way in which the movie's combined elements had it being a white-knuckle thriller along with moments of near hilarious tension breaking humor that were brought seamlessly together. I credit the movie-makers simply because the novel was a straight up caper movie.Of course, I fully acknowledge that my experience may not be shared by today's audience because of all the repetition and idea stealing that follows in the footsteps of such a popular movie like a Pelham. For me, the movie had broken new ground for most caper movies and cops & robber movies of the time took themselves fairly seriously.See for yourselves. This link will take you to the 1974 version of Pelham: http://tinyurl.com/9dy6ap and be sure to watch it in full screen mode.Think about it, the movie makers had a lot of balls to introduce the kind of humor into what was to be a very serious storyline...even for today's audiences, particularly with 9/11 fresh in our collective memories. Need I say more? As with all things in our lives we are continually, even at this very moment in time, on the cutting edge of whatever mankind has to offer.All of our current achievements are stepping stones toward future achievements and the current ones could only have happened based on past achievements. This goes for movie-making as well. Far too often older movies are not met with the respect they deserve merely because they are considered \"old\" or...Oh my God!...in Black & White.For anyone to truly appreciate films from any era one must look at the movie through the eyes of the filmmakers at the time it was made. When King Kong of 1931 was released people ran from the theatres in terror. Those who saw it in theatres at the time of its release and who may still be alive remember Kong's effect on them; still retaining that visceral experience of being one of the first to have seen such cutting edge movie-making...up to that point in time.A good movie with a solid story never loses its appeal. While some movies made today that are held in high esteem may be scoffed at and have us exclaim sometime in the future, \"What were we thinking? Was \"Out Of Africa\" really the best picture of the year of 1985? Likewise, movies dismissed almost immediately upon release may well find an audience in the future. Examples abound of this phenomenon with the likes of Wizard of OZ; It's Wonderful Life; A Christmas Story and many more.Can you tell that I love movies?",

Transit cop, Walter Matthau, has the unenviable chore of escorting several 'directors' of the Tokyo subway on a tour of the subway control room who, it turns out, speak perfect English and have understood his every insult. New York is feeling sorry for itself. It's the mid-1970s, and New Yorkers are compulsorily (in films of the day, at least) yelling at and insulting each other... oh, and by the way, armed men have hijacked a train. The film's strong points are its location shooting, a situation in which the audience is kept guessing how the hijackers plan to get away, and a strong finish to the action. Its weak points are its gratuitous anger and incongruous attempts at humor. Robert Shaw is the most convincing performer in a mix of name actors and little-known or second-rate performers. Matthau, in a out-of-type role, cannot help hamming it up; but rather than providing the sort of comic relief that constructively interacts with the suspense, he undercuts it. Many of the bit players also seem unsure whether they are in a spoof or a genuine thriller. A strange film that could have been much more and has not traveled well.",

I know that things were cheaper then--I was a productive member of society, sort of, at the time--but even so, $250,000 a pop seems like too little reward for all the time and risk they invested in their plan. Even one of the passengers held hostage thought it wasn't enough--why didn't that occur to the merc or the wise guy?Second, how did the makers of this movie know that Ed Koch was going to be mayor of New York? It was 1974 and Abe Beame--who would not have made an interesting character if you had put him in platform shoes and hot pants--was Mayor of New York, yet somehow the makers of this film got someone who looks and acts more like Koch than the Mayor in Ghostbusters.

            "review_title": "Review Of \"The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three\"",
            "content": "\"The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three\" is a 1974 action thriller starring Walter Mathau and Robert Shaw. The movie was directed by Joseph Sargent and it tells the story of a man (Shaw) who, with some other gunmen, hijack a subway train in New York City. The man is soon pitted against a railway police official (Mathau) who, with the help of others, tries to stop him. Now let me start off by saying that I actually saw the 2009 Tony Scott remake before I saw the 1974 original. Is the original better than the 2009 remake? In short - yeah, pretty much. In comparing the two movies, it seemed as though, while the 2009 remake felt more up-to- date, it's more modern approach to elements presented in the original often came off as too over-the-top. I felt that in presenting these certain elements, the 1974 version came off more subtle and pulled it off with a lot more finesse. The 1974 movie has two really impressive actors in the leading roles - Mathau and Shaw. Both of which are really, very entertaining in \"Pelham\", but I'd have to say that Shaw's performance shines the most in this movie. His demeanor throughout the entire movie is really hilarious. He just comes off as this soulless jerk - a soulless jerk with some pretty hilarious one-liners. That brings me to the script which, as I said, contains some pretty great one-liners not only from Shaw, but from Mathau and others. It's nothing really impressive or Oscar-worthy, but it does have a few gems in it here and there. While I, a Generation-Z kid, found this movie to be very easy to watch, it did at times have a few moments of cheese. That being said, I'm not going to knock the movie for being a little long in the tooth - but it does show sometimes. The movie was really entertaining and I can see why it was well received when it came out. I can also see the immense amount of expectations the 2009 movie had to live up to. Overall, I found \"The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three\" to be a fairly enjoyable crime thriller.",

It's a terrific film with good performances all around (I especially liked Walter Matthau's take on the weary transit cop who's seen it all--at least he though he'd seen it all).  The film finds humor in the most unexpected places and the tension is built from the very first frame.  But, once again calling on the New York setting, those hostages have to be the most annoying ones in the history of cinema.  There were a few times I was actually rooting for the hijackers because of this!  It was somewhat hard to buy Martin Balsam as one of the hijackers, but he's the only one that Robert Shaw's Mr. Blue seems to respect.  And I'm not giving away anything by saying that the movie has unusual fates for all of the terrorists.

Between the lone car careening though the South Ferry local line, and the cops racing uptown with the bag of money, The production must have been interesting, to say the least. Walter Matthau was great, as usual. The opening tour that he gives the Japanese VIP's is one of his best moments. The casting is right on with one small exception. The actor playing the part of the \"Station Master\" Caz Dolowicz is overheard saying \"Ba fa Napoli\" under his breath. I don't think that Dolowicz would have been using that particular phrase.

Walter Matthau's puts in a superb performance as the subway controller - a lovely mix of hard-nosed, determined professional with a side-order of his usual laconic comedic style. Robert Shaw is convincing as the ruthless leader of the gang. The contrast between the maniacal action at street level as the ransom money is raised and transported, intercut with the dark, quiet, nerve-tingling suspense down in the subway car, is the main directorial coup.My favourite scene is where the flu-ridden mayor is told about what is going on and closes with the line \"S**t, F**k, P**s!\" - the only time I every recall hearing this line in a movie, but how often does it get used in real life?",

Comparisons are often odious, but I don't think it's as good as his, even though he says so himself, in his own commentary. This one, directed by Joseph Sargent, doesn't seem to know if it's a genuine, gritty thriller or a semi-jokey, wacky but slightly flimsy comedy. Scott is right: these are two quite different films. This one has Shaw, as an Irish (according to Scott) mercenary, named Bernard Ryan, taking the train, and holding the passengers to ransom. He doesn't sound Irish but it's an Irish name. He doesn't seem to be as highly motivated as he ought to be, and not as ruthless as he pretends. He doesn't follow through on his threats with proper conviction, because he gives his targets an extra ten minutes, and he only kills the conductor. In fact, what is his underlying psychological motivation? The story contains a lot of wisecracks, the Mayor is a total dipstick, and it all builds up to a final sneeze. Big laugh. Earlier laughs come at the expense of a bunch of what Matthau calls monkeys, goofily thinking they can't speak English. They are actually Japanese subway executives, although one of the NY subway staff calls them Chinese. There is a wide roster of stereotypes making up the hostages. In fact, there's a kind of sub-current throughout of social minorities being slightly mocked and ridiculed: female staff, homosexual passengers, hooker passengers, bag-lady passengers, Jewish passengers, undercover cops (are they male or female?), black chief of police, who really gives Matthau a double-take. However, Matthau handles it all very well, being alternately tough, smart, cool, weary and witty. It's entertaining, but never remotely believable. In the style of The Sting, or Butch and Sundance. With all those wisecracks, you never feel the hostages are in any serious danger. The Scott version felt dead real, and it seems he thought so too.",

There are a few other minor plot quibbles, and for some reason, we are never actually shown a key piece of machinery that enables the bad guys to make their escape, but overall, this is a fun, fast-moving thriller.

However, by the time finally ended, I felt that all of this was really much ado about nothing.  The ending was very anti-climatic, when it should have been the culmination of an hour and a half of suspense.  Instead, we actually kind of have three separate threads that are tied up separately, and that kind of diffuses the bomb somewhat. Perhaps I expected too much though; I rented this film because Entertainment Weekly had said that it had one of the best ending plot twists out of all of the movies in the seventies.  Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but I never found out what that plot twist was.  There was no single, shocking moment when everything that I thought I knew about the movie turned upside down, as there was in movies like \"The Usual Suspects\" or \"The Sixth Sense.\" As for the acting:  the real gems in this movie are in the supporting players, especially the hostages on the train and the various cops involved. They exhibit strong New York personalities which are fascinating to watch. Walter Matthau also does a fine job, but...  Walter Matthau as the hero in an action film?!  Maybe I've seen \"The Odd Couple\" and \"Grumpy Old Men\" one too many times, but to me he seems to be the last person to star in an action film.  I would have given the part to Clint Eastwood.  Plus the sight of George Costanza's father (from \"Seinfeld\") as a tough-talking, Italian cop threw me for a loop.  In any event, if you see this movie, you won't be any worse for the wear, and if you don't see it, well, you haven't missed much.  I give it a 5.",

Well, when I recently found that it was available on DVD, I purchased it. I watched it again and still found it to be very entertaining. The only complaint that I have is the \"god d---\" this and the god d---\" that that I heard every two minutes it seemed like.  The profanity really added nothing to the movie. Some of the characters, to me, were overly dramatic with their toilet mouths. I thought Walter Matthau's performance was excellent and had one of the cleanest mouths in the whole movie. I haven't seen the 1998 made-for-TV version but I recommend the 1974 edited-for-TV version.",

It captures the times, the fear and the moxie of New Yorkers, and the grit, grime, and gallows humor that you would expect.\n\nIt has humanism without sacrificing suspense. It has clich\u00e9d but delightfully accessible characters. The very fact there is no high- falutinisms, no artsy-smartsy, brings the movie to a level of excellence that is very hard to find.

I love the pace of this film, because it does an excellent job of slowly raising the stakes so I'm always on the edge of my seat waiting to see what will come next.  I also love the way they melded 2 different genres that I love.  There is the heist film that has us meeting the crooks and figuring out how they will execute their plan, and simultaneously we are given a mystery film where we get to see how the police are going to solve this problem.  The movie has a superb cast, loaded with names and faces that you'll recognize.  Most prominent of these actors are Robert Shaw as the leader of the gang, and Walter Matthau as the man in charge of the transit cops.  They have very different styles, but I love watching them talk to one another because they're always trying to get into the other person's head.  The movie has some humor sprinkled throughout it, and I loved that aspect as well.  Some of the characters who are working for the subway have hilarious personalities, and I was intrigued when those humorous characters suddenly became serious as the tension escalated.  The ending isn't some dramatic or unpredictable twist like you might expect, but that didn't matter to me because I was enjoying the entire ride.  However I could see others being let down because the film seems to be setting up for some brilliant surprise by the crooks, but it's simply not all that shocking.  To be honest, the only criticism I have of this film is the quality of the version I was able to watch.  It had some serious sound issues, including some very poor ADR lines.  I think if I can watch it again in a higher quality this might be a film I love for a long time.",

Matthau is greatly aided by a terrific supporting cast of NYC character actor types that includes Jerry Stiller, Kenneth McMillan, Joe Seneca, Bill Cobbs and Tony Roberts. The bad guys in the cast include Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam and Hector Elizondo. Directed by Joseph Sargent, who was for the most part a journeyman director who did make a few cool movies like \"White Lightweight\" and \"The Man,\" but who for the most part did a lot of TV work and a lot of  unmemorable of films, which is surprising considering he made this one that stands out as a terrifically smart and suspenseful classic. And I don't necessarily think it's a case of Sargent being elevated by the cast and script. His direction is stylish and wonderfully tight.

            "content": "A critically acclaimed thriller classic, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three sounded like a very interesting film.\n\nLike many of the thrillers of the age, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a slow moving thriller. With its hostages trapped in a train underground, they have nowhere to go and all the importance comes from the negotiations between Lt. Zachary \"Z\" Garber and Bernard Ryder. But the negotiations aren't as intense as they could be, and the simple fact that almost nothing goes on inside the titular train Pelham One Two Three leaves it feeling a little dull. Clearly, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a dated film and the battle of age is a hard thing for it to win. I guess it doesn't necessarily win the battle, but it does survive it. But then again, a lot of viewers may be thrown off by its length and the fact that it is all very slow.\nThe intensity in the film could have been a lot better if director Joseph Sargent capitalised on its musical score a lot more. As Donald A. Guarisco writes, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three \"one of the best and most inventive thriller scores of the 1970s\", but you would hardly recognise that today because the music is used too little for it to be of any serious benefit. While the music is terrifically composed and iconic of the time that the film was produced in, it really is not used enough to lay much of a serious effect down. A lot of the scenes in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three seem extensively long and dull without much atmosphere or tension whatsoever, and it is those scenes which are particularly boring and negative in how they affect the film as a whole. Viewers have to be prepared for a long and slowly burning thriller with The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, and though fans of classical films may rejoice at the sight of such an influential and original film, a lot of modern viewers may deem it to be too slow to satisfy them. But overall, it is easily to see what makes it an enjoyable film.\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three is one of the earliest examples of a thriller which maintains interest by displaying the terrorists, the hostages, and the negotiators all evenly over the course of its story. Although it doesn't have as much depth in focusing on the passengers as it could, it does manage to focus on the terrorists and police officers well, as well as capturing the large scale of how the events affect the city. The Taking of Pelham One Two Three makes a good effort to truly and honestly captured the spectacle of its events and the exterior effect of them, and it does that well. \nAnd admittedly, it is easy to see how viewers would feel the thrills in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three because it has such a gritty edge with its subject matter and the fact that it is not afraid to explore such rough edged material. It is violent without being excessive, and it finds just the right line.\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a fine visual spectacle because being shot on location ensures that it is thoroughly convincing as a thriller. Capitalising on the scenery of the subway and such, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three feels genuine and ensures that the effect of the film is greater. While it isn't perfect, it is captured all with a lot of fine cinematography and edited at a great pace to ensure that it moves along nicely.\nAnd on top of it all, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three stays very true to its source material by maintaining the nature of its story as well as a lot of intelligent dialogue which ends up ensureing that the cast have a lot of material to work with.\nWalter Matthau gives a terrific lead performance. Putting a lean strength into his line delivery which is full of emotional tension, Walter Matthau capitalises on the most key element to his character as a negotiator in a complicated hostage situation. By maintaining the appropriate heroic sophistication the entire time, Walter Matthau gives the character Lt. Zachary \"Z\" Garber the ideal persona and maintains it the entire time throughout the film without slipping up for a second. Walter Matthau's lead performance in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is an immensely strong one and it increases his credibility as an actor through simple means which come to him without being challenging at all as clearly demonstrated by his charisma.\nRobert Shaw also makes a fine cast member in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. Tackling the role of the main antagonist, Robert Shaw is fearless to step into the role of Bernard Ryder because he does it without problem. He incorporates a lot of natural grit into his line delivery and so he creates a realistic figure for the story, and the unflinching sense of relentless killer instincts in him is what makes him such a villain. You can tell that Robert Shaw has no problem in the role because he gives a dramatic edge to the film which adds to its streak of success in touching upon edgy material, and he is consistently strong with his dark natured line delivery and intense stare. His chemistry with Walter Matthau is also great even though it is challenging to have chemistry with another actor when interacting over a microphone, but the two talented actors have no problems with doing it in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.\nThe performances of Martin Balsam and Jerry Stiller are also terrific.\n\nSo although The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a very dated thriller film, it is visually stylish, original and well acted enough to transcend most of the issues that come with being a slow thriller that has existed for 40 years.",

It's just a regular day in the New York City Transit Authority.\r\n\r\nWalter Matthau headlines a superb cast in this adrenaline charged, roller coaster ride. He was excellent as the cop  thrust into the position of negotiating with a former mercenary who along with his cohorts has hijacked a New York City subway train.  Robert Shaw is equally good  as the villainous mastermind behind the subway train takeover. But, the heart of the film is the interplay between Matthau and Shaw as the ruthless killer demands his money while Matthau attempts to achieve the safe release of the hostages.\r\n\r\nEach of the heavies in this picture are identified by colors Mr. Green, Grey, Blue and Brown; a plot point used by director Quentin Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs. Martin Balsam is terrific as one of the hijackers with a head cold, which ultimately leads to his undoing. Hector Elizondo, as an unhinged thug who was thrown out of the Mafia who is eager to execute anyone who crosses him, and Earl Hindman who later played Mr. Wilson on Home Improvement, were good in early roles in their careers. A solid crew of character actors round out this picture, most notably Jerry Stiller as a transit cop who ably matched wisecracks with Matthau.\r\n\r\nThe film generates tension and suspense without resorting to blood and gore levels of violence. There is some shooting with automatic weapons and sidearms but not much of that. There is no blood, and no homage to the ultimate action film cliche: the final shoot out in an abondoned warehouse, albeit there is one in a subway tunnel; this is a subway story after all.  The tension cleverly shifts from whether the hijackers will receive their ransom on time to how they will escape from a subway tunnel beneath Manhattan.\r\n\r\nThis are also some funny lines, but none of the humor is jammed into the script just to get a laugh, but rather  comes across as what people under such stress might say.",

This movie delivers very well with suspense and action. Both main actors are very good and made sure their characters stayed interesting. This is my first movie seeing Walter Matthau playing a serious role. I think his execution as lieutenant darber was right on. Robert shaw as seen before can pull off the role as a villian with no trouble. And same as in this movie he is as cruel and villainous at his best. I think this movie is a very fast fun action movie filled with great suspense. This movie fires on all cylinders.",

This is a stunning work of cinema that is executed to near perfection and the key to the success of the film is in the taut and thrilling, well written script that delivers a memorable and very entertaining plot that still holds up to this day. So many great classic cinematic works are set in New York, and this is one of the few that has been overlooked and very underrated. If you love the classic, unfiltered action films of old that don't use nifty special effects, but the power of a terrific script, wonderful acting to create its tense situations, then give this one a viewing. Brilliantly executed and this is a stellar work of a heist film that has enough thrills to rival any action pictures that came after it. The remake was good, but it fell short of course, and with that being said, this film's biggest strength is the tour De force demented performance of Shaw who plays the leader of criminals who highjack the train Pelham one, two, three. His role alone is for me anyways one of the most memorable roles in any film of this period and it is among his greatest performances. Sit back, buckle in and be prepared because Pelham one, two, three is a ride that you won't soon forget.",

Critics came down on Tony Scott for the remake's \"brutality\", which is just what I thought this version needed.

In other words, if all of you simultaneously were to rush me, not a single one of you would get any closer than you are right now. I do hope I've made myself understood.\u00a0\n\n\"No other hijack was ever like this.\"\n\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a great classic thriller. It's exciting, suspenseful, funny, and brilliant. I saw the remake from Tony Scott awhile ago and I moderately liked it. I was not expecting the original to be this good. It's tense, but it has a sense of humor throughout. It's also incredibly intelligent, which is a lot more than you can say about the average crime thriller. The pacing is perfect. It isn't hyperkinetic, but it also keeps a foot on the gas the whole time. There's just nothing I can say about the film. The acting is good; I especially liked Robert Shaw as Mr. Blue. The whole runtime is filled with entertainment and fun; and there's always a sense of danger throughout.\u00a0\n\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three describes the action of the film. Four hijackers take over a subway train in New York. They have 18 hostages and order the city to get them $1 Million in an hour or they will start shooting hostages. While their in the tunnels, a police officer works to try to get them the money in time. He negotiates with them, while keeping track on the route of the money. What tells me this is an incredible movie, is that I already knew the plot beforehand; yet I was engrossed by it again. It all leads to a very smart and well done ending that completely destroyed the remakes.\n\nThis is also an influential film. The most obvious point from the movie is the color coded names. We all know the other famous film that did the same thing. It also set a new standard for the hijacked vehicle type of movies. This is probably the best one I have ever seen. It should be the blueprint when looking at how to make a good hijack movie.\u00a0\n\nI think in the end, fun is the word that best describes the experience of watching Pelham One Two Three. You can't watch it and not be completely sucked into everything that is going on. There's not a whole lot in the sense of action. There's no big explosions. There's shooting, but its sparse. Yet the movie reaches an area of excitement that action films that endlessly blow stuff up, can't.\u00a0",

There's none of that here, but there's still a lot of fine touches in the execution of this movie. I suspect Lumet got the idea for shooting his Washington Post interiors in \"All The President's Men\" from the gritty way the Transit Authority office is shot here, with those hot florescent lights that contrast so wonderfully with the dark subway scenes.What else to say? David Shire's masterful score will keep you on the edge of your seat whenever it starts up, and the editing by Gerald B. Greenberg and Robert Q. Lovett is up to the level of the scheming bad guys.If you want to see a movie that celebrates the Big Apple when all goes wrong, this is a place to go.",

            "content": "\"We are going to kill one passenger a minute until New York City pays us $1 Million.\"\n\n\"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" is a perfect example of a tension filled, wonderfully constructed, and extremely entertaining thriller. It's a testament to \"Pelham\" that it has been remade twice--once as a made-for-TV movie, and the other as a big-budget action picture. However, the decision to produce these remakes hasn't yielded satisfying results. Peter Stone earned an Oscar nomination in 1974 for his screenplay, which is adapted from John Godey's 1973 novel. You can count among its biggest admirers Quentin Tarantino, who borrowed the color-coded nicknames of the villains in the film for his band of thieves in \"Reservoir Dogs.\"\n\nFour armed men hijack a New York City subway train and demand $1 million dollars which must be delivered in 1 hour for the release of the passengers held hostage. Lt. Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) of the New York City Transit Police must contend with City Hall, the demands of the hijackers, and the ticking clock in his efforts to save the passengers and bring the hijackers to justice. The initial hijacking plan doesn't seem to make any sense because their options are so limited. At one point Lt. Garber jokingly says: \"They're gonna get away by asking every man, woman and child in New York City to close their eyes and count to a hundred.\" But there is a clever getaway plan coordinated by Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), who plays a former mercenary soldier. His team members include two professional criminals and a fired motorman (Martin Balsam) with a grudge.\n\nThe main strength of the film is the acting. Shaw, Balsam, and Elizondo each get to play to their own specific skill set. Shaw is cool, devious, and calculating. Balsam is a working class, somewhat decent, criminal. On the other side of things, Matthau is at his sardonic best as Garber. Little time is spent on the back story, subplots, or exploration of motives. It's about a subway train, the bad guys, the good guys, hostages, and money. That's it. comparing the original to the 2009 Tony Scott-directed remake, where substantial screen time is devoted to such concerns, the movie falls well short. Do yourself a favor: instead of watching the remake, seek out the original. It's an urban thriller with charisma and a vitality all of its own.",

            "content": "(4 Stars) The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is very much a film of its time. It takes place in the 1970's with all of its politically incorrect glory. It also shows you how much thrillers have changed throughout the years: there are no cell phones, very little surveillance cameras, and digital technology (if any) is in its early form. Even the villains in thrillers of the 1970's are more subdued; just compare Robert Shaw's calm and cool performance with John Travolta's frantic and hilariously vulgar in the 2009 remake. It was a simpler time and that meant simpler thrillers, like Marathon Man and The French Connection. So which film gets the edge? The original or the remake? I can't really favor one over the other since it feels like apples and oranges. They share the same basic story, but vary in acting, direction, style, characters, and atmosphere. Both films have good chemistry between the protagonist and antagonist despite being mostly on a radio. Both are also entertaining from start to finish. There are many reasons to see The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, like the Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw's performances, but my main recommendation is because it's a time capsule of 1970's thrillers.",

They all board at a variety of station stops at the Pelham 123 subway train run of the 6 Lexington Avenue Local Service. Armed with submachine guns, the men hijack a subway car and demand a million-dollar ransom for the passengers in hostage. Even if it's paid, how could they get away?\n\nDirected by Joseph Sargent, 'The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three' features excellent acting performances from the following cast:\n1.) Walter Matthau (Lt. Garber)\n2.) Robert Shaw (Blue)\n3.) Martin Balsam (Green)\n4.) Hector Elizondo (Grey)\n5.) Jerry Stiller (Lt. Rico Patrone)\n\nWhen I first watched this I found 'The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three' as a great, thrilling underground subway action classic of the time. I believe that the '70s saw the rise of hijackings in transportation that coincides this movie (and the John Godey novel that it was based on) being made. There is a moving drama in which the armed men take over the train as the subway control room listens, all the way until the great action happens when Walter Matthau comes to fight them. He's done an outstanding acting performance here while playing the hero who saves the day. Films from the '70s are now fascinating me, and I was glad to have found this exciting film from Pelham 123.",

The focus of the story is on the authorities as they try to stop the villains and free the hostages.  Moreover, you will spend the majority of the film wondering how the bad guys can possibly get away.  This film isn't about great acting, though Walter Matthau did a great job of extending the plot while subsequently serving as the comic relief.  Instead of relying on its actors, Pelham's story-telling creates a driving intensity that carries the film from curious start to fantastic finish.  In fact, the majority of my rating for this film was determined in the final 10 seconds as the story was perfectly resolved.  There is some action, particularly in the epic runaway train scene, but the film is primarily a thriller filled with intrigue.  Although it is difficult to distinguish between the bad guys with their matching mustaches, Robert Shaw (from Jaws) is the most memorable villain.  His unpredictability, particularly in his final scene, and mysterious back story kept me wish that he had his own spin-off film.  From start to finish, Pelham is entertaining with unpredictable twists.  Its 2009 remake did not receive positive reviews but do not let that hinder you from giving the original masterpiece a try.",

            "content": "\"The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three\" is a 1974 action thriller starring Walter Mathau and Robert Shaw. The movie was directed by Joseph Sargent and it tells the story of a man (Shaw) who, with some other gunmen, hijack a subway train in New York City. The man is soon pitted against a railway police official (Mathau) who, with the help of others, tries to stop him.  Now let me start off by saying that I actually saw the 2009 Tony Scott remake before I saw the 1974 original. Is the original better than the 2009 remake? In short - yeah, pretty much. In comparing the two movies, it seemed as though, while the 2009 remake felt more up-to-date, it's more modern approach to elements presented in the original often came off as too over-the-top. I felt that in presenting these certain elements, the 1974 version came off more subtle and pulled it off with a lot more finesse. The 1974 movie has two really impressive actors in the leading roles - Mathau and Shaw. Both of which are really, very entertaining in \"Pelham\", but I'd have to say that Shaw's performance shines the most in this movie. His demeanor throughout the entire movie is really hilarious. He just comes off as this soulless jerk - a soulless jerk with some pretty hilarious one-liners. That brings me to the script which, as I said, contains some pretty great one-liners not only from Shaw, but from Mathau and others. It's nothing really impressive or Oscar-worthy, but it does have a few gems in it here and there. While I, a Generation-Z kid, found this movie to be very easy to watch, it did at times have a few moments of cheese. That being said, I'm not going to knock the movie for being a little long in the tooth - but it does show sometimes. The movie was really entertaining and I can see why it was well received when it came out. I can also see the immense amount of expectations the 2009 movie had to live up to. Overall, I found \"The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three\" to be a fairly enjoyable crime thriller.",

The original has more believable villains (Travolta in the remake merely chews the scenery) but perhaps too many side characters; the Tony Scott movie developed an interesting dynamic between the lead hero and the villain, whereas here it is more an ensemble of villains against the city.\nOne major plus point for the original is that there's no stupid soundtrack. Tony Scott has a dynamic directing style, but he picks horrible urban garbage for his soundtracks.\nBetter villains, better soundtrack, but perhaps a more strangled character narrative. As good as the remake, if not better!",

            "content": "The 70's crime film was built on reality: language, violence, filth... with true stories often unfolding in real-time. \"The Taking of Pelham 123\" is a crisp, dense, real-time crime story. Most people probably never even realized this version existed before seeing or hearing about The Denzel Washington/John Travolta 2009 remade/updated version.\n \nThe 1974 version's premise is pretty simple, A team of hijackers take over the 1:23 Pelham Bay subway train: they want one million dollars in one hour or they start executing passengers being held hostage. Where the idiotic mayor (with a striking resemblance to former New York mayor, Ed Koch) fails to respond to the emergency, the lieutenant of the New York Transit Authority (Walter Matthau) prepares to negotiate with the men and save as many of the hostages as possible. This is no easy task of course, given the unrelenting \"leader\" of the gang, Mr. Blue (yes, this serves as the precedent for Tarrantino's 'Resevoir Dogs,' as do many things in 1970s cinema), played by Robert Shaw, who seems to command the show, making seemingly impossible demands on the authorities. The movie does well with maintaining the pace throughout the picture, with the tension being broken with moments of comic relief. Although, the story remains somewhat undeveloped, since we never really find out why the hijackers have chosen to take over the train. Other than Robert Shaw's character, the hijackers are men of few words.\n\nHowever, in spite of this, the movie is still entertaining, due in large part to a terrific cast of acting veterans and regulars. The cast alone is reason enough to watch it. Walter Matthau is superb in this, as is the ever reliable Robert Shaw. The supporting cast is wonderful. Marty Balsam, Hector Elizando, and Earl Hindmen (\"Wilson\" on TV's 'Home Improvement') who portray the hijackers, and Jerry Stiller, James Broderick, and many other familiar faces serving as Matthau's support team are hilarious. \n\nOverall, I would recommend seeing this movie, before the 2009 remake and then compare. There is definitely enough different in both movies to stand on their own merits and for both to be enjoyed in different ways.",

            "content": "Joseph Sergeant's 1974 classic got a 21st century makeover just a few years ago, in other words, they increased the ransom demanded, crashed more cars, killed more people and gave John Travolta the role as the main hijacker. Clearly Joseph Sergeants 1974 classic is better in every significant way. Taking of Pelham One Two Three went on to inspire the names of Quentin Tarantino's characters in Reservoir Dogs. \r\n \r\nBased on the 1973 novel by John Godley Taking of Pelham One Two Three (not 123) concerns four men hijacking a subway train and demanding $1,000,000 dollars. They also demand that the money should be collected and paid within the hour. If these demands are not met the hijackers will kill one person for each minute that the money is late. Lt Zachery Garber (Walter Matthau). has been asked to negotiate with the hijackers is Lt Zachery Garber (Walter Matthau). \r\n \r\nTaking of Pelham One Two Three is just as nitty, gritty and tense as the best action movies during cinema's golden age, namely The French Connection and Dirty Harry (both 1971) rank as the best action movies of those golden years. Taking of Pelham One Two Three is as 70s action movies go, fantastic fun. It's a typical 1970s action movie stereotypical, racist and sexist, though nothing worth getting worked up about. One of greatest factors of Taking of Pelham One Two Three is the quietly intense performance of the wonderful Robert Shaw as Mr. Blue. Robert Shaw's performance is a dominant one, he demands authority, he quietly, with a menacing growl in his voice, orders the passengers of the hijacked train around and they instantly obey him. With some cracking lines of dialogue 'I could kill every single one of you before you got any closer to me from where you are standing now' Robert Shaw's character, Mr. Blue, authority is not to be questioned. Robert Shaw, for me, makes this film, he has a talent for playing cracking villains, for example take From Russia With Love he played a charming, charismatic and ruthless killer who almost fooled Bond himself. It is Robert Shaw's finest performance but Jaws and From Russia With Love are proving to be strong competition. Robert Shaw's performance is a complete contrast to Travolta, who shouts, swears and spits and delivers an abysmal performance, Robert Shaw is a far more powerful and dominant screen presence then Travolta ever will be, this is clearly evident in Taking of Pelham One Two Three as Shaw bosses the screen in every scene he is in. The performances of the fellow hijackers are less intense but serviceable and Walter Matthau is great as Lt Zachery Garber. \r\n \r\nTaking of Pelham One Two Three is just as tense as The French Connection and Dirty Harry (but the later two the far superior). The discussions between Mr. Blue and Garber are gripping and both actors are sensational together and share a great chemistry even though they rarely share the same screen. However, amongst all this seriousness and tension of this 1970s classic action movie is even a spot of comedy, and low and behold its actually funny. The script, unlike a shed load of the most recent action movies, is full of wit, irony and hilarious one liners. One bloke asks who is going to steal and subway train anyway (while a subway train is being hijacked) and the mayor's wife replies 'eighteen sure votes' when the flu ridden mayor (who has the most laughs) asks what would get in return paying the ransom demanded and a hilarious scene in which Garber is entertaining some Japanese guests under the impression that they do not speak a word of English. It's nice to see a spot of comedy mix perfectly together with the serious and tense aspects, only once every so often does it work quite as well as it did in Taking of Pelham One Two Three. \r\n \r\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three benefits greatly from Joseph Sergeant's steady hand and his approach to straightforward, simple story telling. There are no confusing and pointless subplots but just one story about a hijacked train that is told in a simple but great way in a way action movies should be told. The simplicity in the approach to the story makes The Taking of Pelham One Two Three one of the many hidden gems of 1970's cinema which is dominated by The Godfather, Taxi Driver and Chinatown (to name a few). The Taking of Pelham One Two Three tries to poke it's head above the high seas of quality productions in the 1970s. Yet The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is not flawless, the hostages are without a doubt the most irritating group of people on the planet, not one of them are likeable. You almost want Robert Shaw to spray the bullets into every single one of them. The screaming women is possibly the most annoying of the lot but yet taking of Pelham is not really about them its about the hijackers and the discussions with those attempting to compromise and save the lives of those on board, that is where Taking of Pelham shines. \r\n \r\nJoseph Sergeants The Taking of Pelham One Two Three has grown to be a classic of the genre, of course it's not on a par which the likes of Die Hard (the first one), The French Connection and Dirty Harry but The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is entertaining, fast and furious in the only way 1970s action movies can be. For fans of the genre it is essential viewing and superior to the mess that was the bland 21st century remake. Helped greatly by Robert Shaw's tremendous, quiet but very menacing performance The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is fine action movie making. A classic thriller.",

Now this might be considered lack of character development for some, but I thought it was perfect for the effect the movie needs. Also, the amazing score is definitely a standout and puts you into the mood for the type of story being told. It's almost the complete opposite of the Tony Scott remake (which I really like as well), but somehow has the same exact plot. It's funny how only a few things can change an entire movie. Robert Shaw, as usual, does a great job as the mysterious villain that we never quite understand.

The group is led by Robert Shaw (Jaws and The Sting). Walter Matthau is a transit authority cop who is helping to resolve the hijacking and also trying to catch the criminals responsible.\r\n\r\nIn what turns out to be a decent plot and one filled with fine performances, the pace never really takes off for me. There is action and it's well thought out but I really could have used more sinister actions or dialog from Shaw. His characters always felt genuinely vicious and I wanted more of that here. He's calms and cool but quite serious in that he will do what he says... most of the time. I did not appreciate what the story had in store for him and found it almost insulting. You judge for yourself. Meanwhile, Matthau brings a great presence to the story, and an unusual one for him. Most of his roles are much different than that of a law man mixed up with gunmen. He is sarcastic and yet has his wits about him. He perhaps brought more to the film than anyone (surprisingly). \r\n\r\nSargent brings a pretty straight forward story to the screen and it is well directed and not corny like some of his later work (think Jaws: The Revenge). This is perhaps his best work and he got to share it with many screen greats including Jerry Stiller. In conclusion, this is not high octane thrills and it's not a sedative either. I have really no wish to see the remake so I will hold onto the memories of the decent action thriller from 1974. (C)",

As a kid riding the subway, my first exposure to this movie was the ominous, black and white billboard showing a subway train moving past the viewer with just one thing out of the ordinary: a man with a machine gun standing at the back door. Jaded as I was by the crime rate in those days, that image freaked me out. Too young to see an R rated movie at the time (by today's standards it's a PG), I saw it when it came out on network TV, and WOW!!! This is a wonderful work of suspense that's totally character-driven, with Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw and all the rest giving outstanding performances. But the main character is New York City, with all the supporting characters and bit players providing a beautiful, tragicomic tableau of NYC as it was in those days. Ten years later, after I'd moved to the Midwest, this was the film I watched when I was feeling wistful for the old days. It brought it all back to me, and it still does. Five stars.",

It's a cartoon and, franky, I just cannot buy John Travolta as an evil GENIUS in any movie. Whatever his assets as an actor, genius brainpower ain't one of them. I've watched him in interviews and while I like him, he's a borderline mental defective. He should stick to playing clueless thugs and dance happy dimwits. \r\n\r\nThis version, Pelham 1.0, is whip smart and gritty. It hearkens back to the bankrupt, strike ridden, unmanageable New York City of the early seventies and when old fogies like myself point to the early '70s as a golden age for film (if not for America), this is a pretty good movie to use as an example. Even as a plot heavy suspenser, \"Pelham\" was sharp enough to wryly comment on city politics, the media and an agitated urban populace, all while keeping the clever plot mechanics chugging along and not resorting to preachiness. It has a dense script with a fine comic undertone that the new version can't even touch, and Matthau is perfectly, frumpily cast. Despite the far-fetched premise, the setting and the characters are grounded enough in reality to make the story tense and believable. \r\n\r\nThis is a classic cat-and-mouse thriller, intelligent and fun, and there was no good reason to Denzel it up, add comic book pyrotechnics and cardboard villiany. 5 stars.",

It started off excellently as it wastes no time getting straight into the plot as 4 men board a New York subway and take control of it without the passengers knowing what's going on. Quentin Tarantino is obviously a fan because he ripped off the character names for his film Reservoir Dogs, as the characters are called Mr. Green and Mr. Blue etc. Sadly once the initial take over has been completed and contact is made with Walter Matthau's Lieutenant, the film seems to completely stall and we have to sit through tensionless scenes involving the main hijacker and Matthau talking to each other and Matthau arguing with the subway controller. The film needed a little something extra to happen to hold our intention but it never came. The last half hour is excellent however as the action picks up and the police attempt to take back the carriage but it doesn't quite make up for the previous half hour. \n\nAll the actors playing the hijackers are very good but it's hard to take Walter Matthau as a Lieutenant, it's a bad case of miscasting. The direction is good and the film has aged very well even if the soundtrack gets a little grating at times. \n\nPelham One Two Three is a good film, especially if you like slow burning thrillers, but sadly it's just a little too slow at times to be truly entertaining.",

It concerns a gang of heavy-armed men with machine guns who hijack a Lexington line subway train in Manhattan, and then threaten to kill one hostage per minute unless they are payed a million dollars in small bills. As bad guys go, they don't get much better than these heavies, Robert Shaw is chilling and delivers a memorable performance as Mr. Blue, the mastermind and cold-blooded leader of group, Earl Hindman is superb, as Mr. Brown, who is a genuinely disquieting presence, silent and brooding with a crazy man's glare, Hector Elizondo is terrific in a scene-stealing turn as the psychotic and insubordinate Mr. Gray, the gang's wild card, Elizondo raises the stakes throughout with his itchy trigger finger and naked contempt for the group's leader Mr. Blue. Martin Balsam delivers a fine performance as Mr. Green, the disgruntled TA worker and most reluctant terrorist. Balsam brings a sympathetic quality to his role. On the other side of the coin we have Lt. Zachary Garber of the transit police, played to grumpy perfection by veteran character actor Walter Matthau, who is just wonderful in the role with his hangdog looks. Lt. Garber must ad-lib and shrewdly stall for time until the ransom is delivered or a rescue can be made, but it will become a battle of wits and a deadly game of cat and mouse between the sharp-witted Lt. Garber and the crafty Mr. Blue, that will lead to a nail-biting conclusion. As crime films go, Pelham is uniquely amusing. It is filled with enough jokes and clever one-liners, but screenwriter Peter Stone and director Joseph Sargent wisely play their bad guys straight. With little more than their presence, the hijackers create a tension so nerve-racking that the deaths of innocent people feel both shocking and inevitable. Astute direction by Joseph Sergent with colorful supporting performances by Dick O'Neill, James Broderick, Tony Roberts, Lee Wallace, Jerry Stiller, Kenneth McMillan and Julius Harris. A 70s gem and one of the best heist films of all-time. Highly Recommended.",

The cast includes Walter Mathau, Hector Elizondo, Jerry Stiller, Dick O'Neill, and Doris Roberts.\r\n\r\n\"We had a bomb scare in the Bronx yesterday, but it turned out to be a cantaloupe.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the recent remake of this picture was airing on cable, I had to find this picture based on its wonderful reviews on RT.  This movie was outstanding and I'm going to have a hard time believing the remake can be anywhere close to as good as this picture.  The script for this movie was marvelous and Walter Mathau delivers a triumphant performance that is emphasized in the final scene.  This is a must see movie and worth having in your collection.  It is a shame that some of these classics are not well known until the remake is made.\r\n\r\n\"I'll shoot your pee-pee off.\"\r\n\r\nGrade: A+",

The inimitable Walter Matthau plays Lt. Zachary Garber, a New York subway police officer confronted with the case of his life when hostages demanding ransom hold up a train.  A stoic, calculating Robert Shaw plays chief baddie Mr. Blue, who seems to have everything planned to perfection.  What is most interesting about this film - which contains no great scenes of violence or action - is the way director Joseph Sargent controls the tension in the film purely through the drama created in the hostage standoff, using character and plot to move events along, instead of reliance of set-pieces or cheap thrills. The film does not feel dated in its treatment of subject, with its keen eye in characterization and the society it depicts holding steady to this day.",

It was funny seeing Walter Matthau in anything other than comedy since I'm used to him being one of the Grumpy Old Men.  This also had George's father in it from Seinfeld.  Both did a great job.\r\n\r\nThe tension was solid.  Typical movie where they make all new yorkers seem like abrasive, loud-mouthed punks, but I found it funny in this movie whereas other movies it is sort of a distraction.  The movie didn't take itself too seriously, which I think is what made it work so well.  Everytime the captors would make more demands to Walter Matthau's character, he would respond with a smart-aleck burn.  Even the ending was sort of 70s-80s sitcom-like.  Sounds weird, but it worked- the tone of the movie was very consistent.\r\n\r\nBasic plot line was that a group of heavily armed men hold a train hostage to get money as ransom- if they don't get their money by a certain deadline, they will start killing hostages.  How will their plan play out?  Will they get away with it?  There is no deep messages or things to think about with this, so there is no need to go into details.  This movie is a good example of one that you can sit down and enjoy- in a manner very different from Michael Bay films.",

It's a pretty well thought out little story and the script is good too, but these two actors make it work. Mathau as always is a gem! He has just the right amount of cynicism and humor to make his character both believable and at the same time endearing to us.They could have very easily had a shoot em up tough guy like Eastwood play the hero cop and turned this into a Dirty Harry like vehicle, but instead they played it more real to life.  We get an experienced, but job weary Mathau methodically unraveling the crime in a more method and life like manor all the while working against the clock. On the other side of the crime we have a team of criminals led by a cold, intelligent, professional played perfectly by Shaw.\nOne scene that is definitely worth noting is a group of Japanese subway on a tour of the New York subway headquarters with Mathau when the crime begins to unfold. Also watch for Jerry Stiller of Seinfeld and King of Queens fame!\nGood tight little drama and well worth watching if you have never seen the original!",
