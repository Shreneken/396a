            "content": "In Bedford, most of the girls of the sorority house Pi Kappa Sigma that is administrated by Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) travel in the Christmas holiday to the houses of their families. Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) schedules to meet her father on the afternoon; however, an intruder kills her in her room, hides her body in the attic and Mr. Harrison (James Edmond) never sees his daughter. Meanwhile Jess (Olivia Hussey) receives obscene anonymous phone calls while Phyl (Andrea Martin) and Barb (Margot Kidder) go to the precinct with Mr. Harrison to report that Clare is missing. Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller (John Saxon) is interviewing a mother that reported that her thirteen year-old daughter has never got home and the police organize a search party. When they find the body of the girl in a park, Lt. Fuller asks to bug the telephone of the sisters. Meanwhile the prowler has killed Mrs. Mac and is stalking the three sisters.\"Black Christmas\" is a simple but very dark and suspenseful horror movie. The deranged serial-killer is never seen and the slightly ambiguous conclusion clearly indicates that Peter had nothing to do with the murders or calls, and the incompetent police officers do not find the bodies of Clare and Mrs. Mac. In 1979, the idea of a psychopathic killer calling from the inside of the house was brilliantly used in the creepy \"When a Stranger Calls\". The future Superman's girlfriend Margot Kidder is very beautiful but her character is completely fool. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Noite do Terror\" (\"Night of the Terror\")Note: On 03 July 2020, I saw this film again.",

            "content": "The girls of a sorority house are being tormented by a twisted prank caller who continually calls to convey increasingly vile and abusive sentiments. What at first appears to be a sick joke eventually turns violent for the girls during the season of supposed goodwill and merriment.The original and maybe even the best, \u0091Black Christmas' set the ball rolling for the slasher genre and was the biggest influence for the phenomenally successful John Carpenter classic, \u0091Halloween' (1978), which was, in fact, originally conceived as a sequel. Although Italian director, Mario Bava, had previously created what some see as the first slasher movie, \u0091Bay of Blood' (1971), it was \u0091Black Christmas' that was to become recognised as the catalyst for one of the most lucrative sub-genres of horror cinema. Bob Clark (who previously made the kooky, enjoyable, low-budget zombie film \u0091Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things' (1972)), still at this point something of an amateur director, took a simple yet naturally frightening concept and turned it into one of the most unsettling and nerve-wracking one hundred minutes in cinematic history. Only a select few films such as \u0091The Haunting' (1963) and \u0091Alien' (1979) are atmospheric enough to truly equate to the eeriness and feelings of apprehension that are to be induced by \u0091Black Christmas'.The simplicity of the production is what makes it so endearing. There are no overly bloody death sequences or unlikely, comic-book style events; the viewer is just presented with an unnerving tale which could easily have a strong basis in reality. Inventive camerawork and POV shots as well as a superlative use of lighting are the elements that combine to achieve the desired results. The often pseudo-claustrophobic environment of the sorority house, from where the vast majority of events occur, offers the perfect, vulnerable and unguarded location susceptible to intrusion and thus attributes to the continual foreboding atmosphere. Clark was not afraid to take time building both the story and characterisation as well as introduce the viewer to the aspects that he would use to build the suspense. This is prepared before plunging the viewer into a seemingly uncontrolled nightmare that one experiences along with the protagonists. Another aspect that firmly stands out is the mysterious way that everything is presented; even at the very end, very little has truly been explained yet everything seems like it should have an obvious explanation. Even in its undoubted simplicity, \u0091Black Christmas' has complicated facets that require thought from the viewer to entirely comprehend the film. In some ways, the concealing of several key points puts the viewer's knowledge of events on a par with the actual characters.\u0091Black Christmas' is also complimented wonderfully by strong acting performances from Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, John Saxon and a highly pleasant and amusing turn from Marian Waldman. Despite the tiny budget, this is a highly polished horror film that genuinely belongs among the elite of the genre. This is where it all started and those familiar with later slasher films such as \u0091Halloween', \u0091Friday the 13th' (1980), Slumber Party Massacre (1982) and \u0091The House on Sorority Row' (1983) should be able to spot several of the now-clich\u00e9s that first materialized in \u0091Black Christmas'. My rating for \u0091Black Christmas' - 8\u00bd/10.",

            "content": "Released and ignored in 1973, \"Black Christmas\" became a forgotten classic. The Canadian shocker was eventually re-released as \"Silent Night, Evil Sight\" in order to avoid confusion with the blaxploitation films of the time, but it bombed once again. In the early 80s, it was broadcast on cable as \"Stranger in the House\" in order to snatch up some rantings. Right when the movie seemed dead, NBC decided to cancel a prime-time airing of it because it was deemed \"too scary\" for network television. This was all film-buffs needed to go back and discover the wonderful \"cool movie that you never heard of\" that is \"Black Christmas\".Before I go on, here it goes: \"Black Christmas\" is one of the scariest (and finest) horror films ever made. Major credit must go to director Bob Clark (who went on to direct the epic \"Citizen Kane\" remake and because of legal reasons had to change it's title to \"Porky's\") who like John Carpenter in \"Halloween\", is able to create a current and simplistic creepy atmosphere. \"Black Christmas\" is indeed very similar to \"Halloween\": Both movies are themed with a particular time of year, both movies feature a killer with breathing problems who loves POV shots, and both movies have a long and slow build-up that makes the audience care for the characters that are about to get slashed. The difference is that \"Black Christmas\" does it much better, in fact, I think it is a superior film.The movie begins with a shaky POV shot of a stranger who decides to sneak inside a sorority house in order to get some fresh meat. That's it! Plain and simple. There is no \"your father killed my cousin's cat\" motive, the killer wants to kill because he simply wants to. Isn't it much scarier like that? No motive at all?The cast is not your usual teen slasher stereotypes: There is the not-so-virginal sweet leading lady Jess (Olivia Hussey) who is having trouble because she wants to have an abortion. Her boyfriend Peter (Keir Duella) eventually disagrees. In the sorority house there are many other odd characters, including chain-smoking, foul-mouthed, heavy-drinking Barb (ironically played by Margot Kidder) who steals the show with the much-needed humor. Unlike the countless other slashers out there, \"Black Christmas\" takes time for the audience to get used to these characters and actually care for them. Unlike in \"Halloween\", the entire top-notch cast in \"Black Christmas\" give excellent performances. Olivia Hussey is perfect as not-so-innocent Jess, Keir Duella is scary and misleading as her deranged boyfriend. And of course, Margot Kidder steals the show with an excellent and amusing take playing herself. Also noticeable is cult star John Saxon as Lt. Fuller who many years later started showing his personal love for \"Black Christmas\" on interviews.The well-balanced doses of drama and comedy connects the audience to the characters on screen so strongly that they sometimes we forget it is a horror movie. And when something scary eventually happens, it comes as a total shock. Bob Clark eventually became famous for his comedies, and you can sense his upbeat sense of humor though the entire film. Recent movie audiences lost their patience, so movies like that can't be made anymore. And there is a good reason \"Black Christmas\" is currently labeled as a comedy at the IMDb, it is really funny. So many memorable quotes here: \"These broads could hump the Leaning Tower of Pisa if they could get to top of it!\" or \"I'm a drunk? Here we have the queen of vodka herself!\" and of course, the whole Fellatio address.But isn't this a horror film? It really lives up to it's tagline. To begin with, the killer is not a silent invincible maniac on a Santa Claus costume. Instead, he is never seen. Most of his moments come from POV shots and dark takes. He is confined to the sorority house's attic for most of the time. How is that scary? Sound comes to play. The killer calls the sorority girls though the phone many times (early shades of \"Scream\" and \"When a Stranger Calls\") and uses some of the most disturbing voices you will ever hear. He imitates pigs squeaking, perverted dirty talk, animal noises, screaming, heavy breathing, and many other weird sounds. Does it work? Of course. This guy makes Norman Bates look like Richard Simmons.These disturbing elements are all put together though the brilliant cinematography by Reg Morris, who is able to capture the silent Christmas atmosphere perfectly with the wonderful use of silent snow-covered streets and decoration. Let's face it, Christmas is a bit creepy, isn't it? It certainly will be after watching this flick. The piano score by Carl Zittrer is simplistic and effective as well. The repetitive use of Christmas carols also add up to the tension.Ignored over the years and unknown outside the cult horror fans, this is an underrated classic that deserves much more attention that it ever got. Everything is perfect in this Canadian chiller: The atmosphere, the music, the overall spooky look, and one of the scariest villains in history. No gore (although the killings are so disturbingly shot they don't really need any) no sex, no nudity, just plain old-fashioned horror. This is \"Black Christmas\": Snow-covered silent streets, creepy Christmas carols, spooky use of lightening and color, scary atmosphere and the overall look of the plastic bag suffocated victim in a rocking chair staring from the attic window. Trust me, you will never go to your attic the same way again.\"Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, a creature was staring...\"",

            "content": "A classic exercise in subtlety, this film prefers to leave the horror to the imagination rather than splattering it graphically across our screens. And it benefits as a result of this. In fact, the film has the (dubious) distinction of being the first 'proper' slasher film, influencing many others that were to come later, including the classic HALLOWEEN.The director, Bob Clark, was no stranger to horror films, having directed CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS. With Black Christmas, he popularised many of the clich\u00e9s we are used to seeing in horror films today, such as the obscene telephone calls. Of course, when this film was made these ideas were still fresh, and not clich\u00e9s at all. There's also the POV shot from the killer in the opening scene, which was used again to great success in HALLOWEEN. Due to the success of the latter, this film remains neglected in the annals of horror, and is not credited with the creation of the numerous clich\u00e9s which slasher horrors of the 1980s contained.One big advantage this film has over the many other slasher films around is the realism and atmosphere. For instance, the characters in the film are totally realistic, and all have traits which make them interesting. Margot Kidder is fine as the foul-mouthed alcoholic and Olivia Hussey is excellent as the main heroine. Obviously parallels are to be drawn between her character and Jamie Lee Curtis' character in HALLOWEEN, but I would go so far to say that Hussey creates a more believable person in this film, someone to really empathise with. John Saxon is on hand once again to play a policeman (what else?) and personally I find him totally capable in the role as well - he offers a hard, but kind presence, someone who you can turn to for help, which is exactly what a policeman should be.There's also a little bit of comedy, revolving around a slow policeman at the station. The killer's manic telephone calls are totally disturbing and offer a contrast to the silent menace of Michael Myers. This killer is insane! With lots of atmospheric scenes and an unsettling ending guaranteed to stay with you long after the film has finished playing, this is really one of the best slasher films there is, a film strong enough on chills to cope without the welter of blood and gore and inventive deaths we are used to seeing.",

            "content": "It's not often that you find a film in the thriller/horror genre that has something \"new\" to say, so it's even more exciting to find that one of the original films in the \"slasher\" genre is actually still one of the freshest, most unique and utterly entertaining of them all. This is the kind of movie you can't wait to tell your friends about, knowing full well they've probably never seen it, but they've heard of it.Everything about this film is stellar. The acting, to steal the words of a great reviewer who loves this movie, is flawless. The direction is confident and assured. What is Bob Clark's story? How did he go from making quirky, ground-breaking horror to...well...\"Baby Geniuses 2?\" His black-humored wit is on display in all his movies, and here too. Margot Kidder and Marian Waldman shine as foul-mouthed alcohol abusers. Particularly Kidder--it's hard to believe she did this at the BEGINNING of her career, she's that assured...and fun to watch. Olivia Hussey is alluring as the lead, Jessica, and her beauty, as well as her speaking voice are a welcome presence.The plot might seem clich\u00e9d now, until you understand that it was all the movies that came AFTER that were the clich\u00e9s--even \"He Knows Your Alone,\" which seemed so vital at the time, can't compare. \"Black Christmas\" is a FILM, and goes beyond the conventions of a cheap slasher. The key is the ending--only a director with an artistic sensibility would have fought for it (no spoilers here). Suffice to say, in all the slashers I've watched I've never seen the equal. It's a tricky business to sum up a mystery in a plot, and few can maintain the element of surprise, intelligence or creativity required. You will NOT see the ending coming here, and though the end is a surprise, it works well.If you're like I was and hesitating to watch this because you think it'll just be \"another fear film,\" don't waste anymore time! You will NOT be sorry you spent your Christmas \"black...\"",

            "content": "I watched this film during the holiday season a few years back, and have come to the conclusion that \"Black Christmas\" is a neglected classic, and (in my opinion) is the first and best slasher film ever made. Guaranteed, fans of John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" will love this film, some may find they love it even more than \"Halloween\". And even though I thought I'd never say that, after viewing \"Black Christmas\" a few times, I found myself enjoying it much more.\"Black Christmas\" starts off with a Christmas party at a sorority house. While the festivities are taking place, a stranger is breaking into the attic upstairs, while the unknowing sorority sisters are enjoying themselves. The phone rings, and we are introduced to Jessica (Olivia Hussey), our main character. A strange person on the phone makes obscene comments, speaking in different voices while the sorority sisters listen in disgust. As the sisters flood out, all leaving to visit family and friends and whatnot, only a few are left at the sorority house, among them are - Jessica, Barb (Margot Kidder), and Phyl (Andrea Martin). Clare (Lynne Griffin), a fellow sorority sister, has gone missing, and Clare's father comes to investigate along with the help of law enforcement and her friends. The strange phone calls continue, and get more and more disturbing as time goes by, until Jessica is forced to call the police. Could it be her boyfriend, Peter (Keir Dullea), playing some sort of sick joke? Or is someone watching the helpless girls from within the house? As the holiday nears, the psychotic killer sets in motion his bloody agenda, while the local police try and track him down before more murders are committed.Before Bob Clark went on to direct the family holiday classic \"A Christmas Story\", he took a darker look at the holiday season with this hidden gem. \"Black Christmas\" is a masterpiece horror film, and surprisingly predates the classics by many years, such as \"Halloween\" and \"Friday the 13th\", which get most of the credit for \"creating\" the slasher genre, when in fact this little Canadian chiller started it all. The plot was very original at the time, and contains some very scary moments - the scenes in the attic with the killer are among the scariest and strangest scenes I've ever watched, and the phone calls are flat out bizarre. The movie reeks a very dark, foreboding atmosphere (despite it taking place during the holidays) that never lets up throughout the film's entirety, as it slowly builds suspense before reaching the climax. It takes place during Christmastime, which honestly doesn't matter to the plot (it could've taken place at any time of the year), but the fact that it's set during such a joyous, festive season gives it a little more of a sinister quality, and makes it a perfect holiday horror movie.The acting in this film was excellent. Olivia Hussey is our lead, and she plays her character with vulnerability and innocence, putting the audience on her side the whole way. Margot Kidder plays the loudmouth, drunk sorority girl, and is also excellent in her performance, being a boisterous yet a likable character at the same time. Her character is probably the most memorable of the bunch. Andrea Martin plays Phyl, the quiet but friendly girl, and is also very good in her role. And Keir Dullea plays Jess's suspicious boyfriend well - the audience isn't sure if they should consider him a suspect or not, and he plays that perfectly. The rest of the cast includes numerous Canadian performers, all whom turn in convincing performances. There is even a little comedy thrown into the mix, an example being the alcoholic sorority housemother, Mrs. Mac., and her witty one-liners. The humor is subtle and is easily overlooked by the movie's grim demeanor, but it's in there for sure. The movie also contains some very creative death scenes (especially Barb's glass unicorn death, and the plastic attack in the closet), but even though these are present, it's really not a gory film, we mostly see the aftermath. The deaths aren't very bloody, tending to rely much more on sound, which is equally effective. One of the major things I admire about this movie is that the audience never knows who the killer is - he's kept a mystery, even at the shocking conclusion - the audience ever really gets a resolution and we aren't given any answers, something that I find to be very effective. I like the fact that we are given so little information on the villain, because it makes his presence much more terrifying. The tricky camera-work prevents us from ever seeing his face, in fact all we really see is his body shape, hair style, and his hands. We hear his voice though, as he harasses the sorority girls over the phone, muttering vulgar and disturbing phrases and making death threats (which were very well done, I might add). Even scarier, is the fact that he's hiding in the attic the entire time. This movie completely shatters the idea of feeling safe in your home... you can lock your doors and windows, but what if the killer is already inside the house, and you just don't know about it? Very scary concept. To sum things up, \"Black Christmas\" is an overlooked classic that deserves so much more recognition than it's gotten over the years - I'm sure any horror fan would love to find it in their stocking. Hopefully the upcoming remake will gain the original film some long-deserved attention. \"Black Christmas\" is the ultimate holiday-horror film for fans of the genre, and is the best slasher movie ever as far as I'm concerned. An underrated masterpiece. 10/10.",

Instead of having \"Dracula\" \"Frankenstein\" and \"The Mummy\" we had \"Michael Myers\" \"Jason Voorhees\" and \"Freddy Kruger\". Well a few years before those movie villains hit the screen there was another killer who packed a powerful punch his name was Billy and he was terrifying in the 1974 film \"Black Christmas\". To me he is the scariest man in movie history.This 1974 film is not well known. It is however 10x better than most other horror movies pf the 1970's and 1980's! This film has many things that seemed to of inspired \"Halloween\". The opening shots and set up were almost identical to \"Halloween\" which was released 4 years later. In this film As winter break begins, a group of sorority sisters, including Jess (Olivia Hussey) and the often inebriated Barb (Margot Kidder), begin to receive anonymous, lascivious phone calls. Initially, Barb eggs the caller on, but stops when he responds threateningly. Soon, Barb's friend Claire (Lynne Griffin) goes missing from the sorority house, and a local adolescent girl is murdered, leading the girls to suspect a serial killer is on the loose. But no one realizes just how near the culprit is.This film developed a cult following and was later remade. The original however is still an edge of your seat thriller!

            "content": "Long before Jamie Blanks turned popular urban legends into a theme for his routine slasher franchise, director Bob Clark took one of the most vigorously touted of those fables and created a genre staple that would become the forerunner of the stalk and slash cycle. Comparisons can obviously be drawn between this and Halloween, including notorious but unconfirmed reports that Carpenter's film was in fact based upon an un-produced concept that Clark had earlier initiated as a sequel to this 1974 sleeper. Both efforts certainly have a lot in common with one another; including two excellent steady-cam openings - putting the viewer in the killer's shoes as he enters his 'soon to be' scene of a crime - that are almost interchangeable. On the 'making of' featurette for the 25th anniversary of Halloween, perhaps one commentator is fairly unjust when he states that it was that movie that started the excessive use of point of view shots that are so often imitated in horror cinema ever since. Black Christmas was equally as effective with its application of first person cinematography, a feat that John Carpenter clearly recognised before incorporating and perhaps improving upon it for his further acknowledged masterpiece.The story concerns a group of sorority sisters that are preparing for their Christmas celebrations in a remote house. They have been receiving bizarre and threatening calls from what sounds like a group of insane people, although no one takes them seriously at first, believing that they're just a typical prank from a few of the local town boys. However fears are ignited when one of the students, Claire (Lynne Griffin), doesn't arrive to meet her father on time and is reported missing. Later a child is found butchered in the park, whilst all the while the Looney continues his demented ringing and terrorising the young women. Before long Lieutenant Fuller (John Saxon) realises that there may be a link in the occurrences and asks Jess (Olivia Hussey) to remain close to her phone so that he can trace the line when the lunatic next rings. But will there be anyone left alive when that happens?Although this movie is neither graphic, gratuitous nor particularly unpleasant by today's standards, it remains one of the most disturbing and chilling 'slasher' movies ever made. Perhaps as mysteriously alluring as the exploits of Michael Myers and certainly far more alarming than any of the endless Friday the 13ths could ever hope to be. The killer creates the fear himself, but not in the typical methods that have become somewhat old-hat in more recent efforts. This assassin doesn't wear a mask, probably doesn't possess any super-human attributes and may only be threatening towards the female of our species. But his enigmatic ranting and crazy excessive skips between multiple personalities that are portrayed superbly over phone calls, which are all but too short; effortlessly allow him to become one of the creepiest wackos ever set to celluloid. Never has a telephone been implemented as a tool for creating fear so efficiently, there's something really unsettling as this Jekyl and Perhaps ten Mr. Hydes argues potently with himself. He changes his pitch from that of a high female to a deep and aggressive male and then back again, in a manner of pure and unadulterated insanity that really sticks in your throat. He perhaps reaches his most bloodcurdling moment when he drops all the wacky personas to adopt a civil yet curt voice and mutter once; `I'm going to kill you'. Proving to be the one and only direct threat that he makes in the whole movie.Where as Michael Myers' success was brought about by the mystery that surrounded the little that we knew of the true motivations of his character, a similar method has been used here. We never actually see who's terrorising these girls and we are never given a reason for his dementia. He often refers to himself as 'Billy' or 'Agatha' in his one sided conversations, but we never learn of the events that made him spiral into such mindlessness. In a movie like Scream (aka The Outing - not Wes Craven's) this just feels like lazy and incompetent filmmaking, however Bob Clark puts it across in a manner that makes you want to learn and know more and he teases you with revealing that you never will. His talents as a director certainly reached their peak with Black Christmas.  Helped excessively by some great cinematography and neatly planned lighting effects that often evade the more recent slasher movies, Clark proved himself as a great filmmaker that would have his inspiration cemented over the years that followed. He produced fairly original ways to keep the killer obscured from view, whilst not forgetting the fundamental silhouette and shadow play. If you do predict the twists in the plot, then it's only because they have been carbonated so many times since this hit the shelves, that they now feel second nature to any horror fan. It's good to remember that this was one of the first to use these elements and you must also note how perfectly this holds up against the less than impressive attempts that have been released up to three decades after.Some brilliant supporting actors whom themselves would make their own slight impressions on the genre  (Margot Kidder: The Clown at Midnight, Lynne Griffin: Curtains and John Saxon: Nightmare Beach and The Babydoll Murders) are sadly let down by a weak lead in Olivia Hussey. She's certainly not terrible, but at times her performance was fairly improbable when she could have found chances to shine. Kudos however to the actor(s) that performed the terrorising calls, I don't think titans like Brando or Nicholson could have played them any better! Credit has to be given to whoever helmed that crazy dialogue, for without it, the movie certainly would not have been so fearfully memorable! Perhaps a little further explanation on Peter's (Keir dullea) exact involvement may have helped make the end a little clearer, admittedly I was a little confused. Although I must confess that I can't be sure if that was my fault for not watching properly (it was late at night) or it was crafted deliberately to help cloud the mystery? But those gripes are hardly damaging and mainly I really enjoyed Black Christmas.The slasher genre has gained a reputation over the years for being somewhat over populated by incompetent/amateur filmmakers. But efforts like this, Halloween and The House on Sorority row prove that the category is a necessary ingredient to cinema history when it's handled properly; often able to generate superb and noteworthy results that rank up with any of horror's acclaimed pieces from the past. This has recently been re-released on DVD with minimal extras but maximum value for money and really does warrant a purchase. There's really not a lot more to be said to convince you, this is a true cult-classic and your collection is poorer without a copy. As stylish as the best Giallos and as disturbing as Friedkin's Exorcist, this is certainly worthy to hold its renowned status for years to come. Maybe next time you are bothered by a crank caller, you'll be a little more cautious as to how you handle the situation.",

This highly influential horror-thriller does just that, every time I see it!As a college sorority house empties out for the holidays, the remaining girls are unaware that a warped murderer has just climbed into their attic...Black Christmas is one of the most shamefully over-looked films in the slasher film genre, it's also been one of the most inspiring films of the genre. The story that drives this film is an extremely creepy one, taught with suspense, mystery, and an undying feeling of dread. It's also an intelligent story that wisely remembers that the unseen is scarier than anything one can put on film. Director Bob Clark builds an atmosphere of almost unnerving tension through out this film. Clark makes even the singing of Christmas carols very chilling. Adding even more to the sheer spookiness of this film is Carl Zitter's bizarre music score, which sounds as twisted as the killer's brain. A number of scenes from this film are simply unforgettable - the insane phone calls from the murderer, the glass unicorn stabbing, and my personal favorite, our heroine turning to see the killer's eye staring at her from behind the bedroom door.The cast of this film is great and contains a number of stars. The wonderful Olivia Hussey is sympathetic as our leading lady. Keir Dullea is strong as Hussey's boy friend, who's been behaving rather strangely. Margot Kidder provides some comic relief as the sorority bad-girl. John Saxon is solid as the police lieutenant who's trying to solve a murder. Supporting cast Marian Waldman, Andrea Martin, Art Hindle, and Douglas McGrath are terrific as well.Black Christmas has had a big hand in the slasher genre, such films as Halloween (1978), When a Stranger Calls (1979), and Friday the 13th (1980) were strongly influenced by this forgotten classic. For horror fans, Black Christmas is a must-see terror. I wouldn't recommend that you watch it alone in the dark though.**** out of ****",

I was expecting more of a \"Halloween\" type film, except the fact that the always brilliant Margot Kidder was in it. So I was into it from the start. The film follows a sorority house on the days proceeding Christmas when a psycho stalker starts getting into the house and, quite frankly, under the girls skin. Then the murders begin. Thesetting has been seen before, and so have the P.O.V. shots, but who cares?This film was scary anyway.Olivia Hussey is terrific and tense as the lead sorority sister, Jesse, who has the burden of dealing with all the other sisters' crisis problems. She looked really great too! And in the finale, she really played her role out for all it was worth.Kier Dullea was descent. A little too humble for the role, and not as, well,intimidating as he could have been. His scenes here are played out like a play. if not Broadway style, more conservative.Margot Kidder, being as good as she is, was not surprisingly fabulous! Hercharacter was the rough tough stuff sister who drinks, swears, and is the only one of them who has the guts to show off some glitz. The rest of the cast does just fine, particularly Andrea Martin as the soft spoken sister, John Saxon as the police chief who only wants to find the answer, and the actress who played Mrs. Mac was certainly worth the view too!Writing wise this film was greatly and adroitly planned. The central theme of this film is that you can't trust anyone, friend or foe, and the scares are genuine, and come psychologically, instead of in your face like \"Halloween\" or \"Friday the 13th.\" Bob Clark is in love with his actors as he photographs them in brightexuberant colors, while his killer is photographed in jaundiced, grainy colors. All in all, a very artistic film and very creepy to the bone. Great atmospheric music too!",

            "content": "Before Bob Clark made \"Porky's\" or \"A Christmas Story\", he made this lost classic: \"Black Christmas\". A sorority house is infiltrated by a serial killer who is probably mentally deranged. Being Christmas, the police are overburdened and the girls are drunk. Who can save them? Can they be saved? This film excels at everything. The mood is very good. The casting is great (Olivia Hussey is fantastic, and a young Margot Kidder steals the show). The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. This really lays the groundwork for films to come.And this is what makes \"Black Christmas\" so great. Besides a foul-mouthed Santa Claus and the feeding of alcohol to children, we have the beginning of some of the most well-known horror clich\u00e9s. \"Halloween\" borrows the first person camera angles, and all slashers in general take something from this movie (since, to my knowledge, this was the first movie featuring drunk kids hacked up by an outside intruder).\"When A Stranger Calls\" borrows heavily, as does \"Scream\". The horror comedy \"Student Bodies\" (now very hard to find, and not even on Netflix at all) takes so much from \"Black Christmas\" it should have made them royalties. In short, once you've seen this horror film you've really seen them all.Some have said the music was noteworthy. Personally, I didn't notice the music -- but I'll just assume that means it fit the mood well. What I did notice was the voice of The Moaner. Films with phantom callers are not unusual, but I don't think any of them do what this film does with the creep. Some strange calls.There is a subplot of a killed girl and of a possible abortion. These story lines never get resolved but work to reinforce the tension in the air. And unlike every other horror film, there is no \"Black Christmas 2\". I commend them for that choice... will the remakers make the same decision? If you haven't seen this film, see it. You've been eating your hot fudge sundaes without the ice cream, and it's time for that to change.",

This is also a very, very relevant shocker as it deals with weirdo stalkers terrorising girls (which happens all the time in real life) & how useless the Police are at dealing with it or even believing it or even taking it seriously (Also what truly happens all the time until its too late) & this was made back in the 70's so imagine how bad that crime is today with social media & stuff!!! Scary.Anyway, Black Christmas has the perfect look with it's colourful Festive decorations & beautiful snowy backdrop & that big beautiful old Serority house where most of the Horror takes place. This is more creepy & unnerving as it is violent & bloody but it still gets nasty when it wants too but still with some humour & funny moments sprinkled throughout.The cast are all great, especially movie legend JOHN SAXON (A Nightmare on Elm Street) as the local police lieutenant & also the excellent Margot Kidder (Lois Lane from Superman) but all the girls do a fine job of bringing the fun 'N' banter & the terror. I totally dug the Cinematography/look & mood of this Classic & i can see why this is Classed as a Slasher/ Horror Masterpiece just like John Carpenter's Halloween & Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the 70's crafted some of the greatest & most impact full Horror's of Cinema History.Just sit back with a nice hot cup of coffee with the Christmas tree lit-up & watch Black Christmas, at night.",

The only reason why I rented it was that Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea were in the leading roles (I have a strange and sick obsession with Olivia Hussey and I liked Keir Dullea in 2001). But then when I first watched it that dark and cold Saturday night, I was amazed.The film's style was very dark and mysterious, as well as bizarre. While watching the film, I saw where John Carpenter might have gotten a lot of his filming technique from his 1978 classic, Halloween (one of my personal favorites). It, like Halloween, involves the murders of young women. And in the case of Black Christmas, it's sorority girls.\nWhat set this apart from Halloween is that the killer is less human than Michael Myers. You saw Michael Myers, but you do not see the killer in Black Christmas. Plus the killer is insane, especially when he rants. His rants make no sense, making his intentions unknown. He just kills, not for revenge like most horror films. But he just kills. I don't know about you, but that is what makes this film even scarier, aside from the spooky musical score.They say that Jamie Lee Curtis is the \"scream queen.\" Well whoever thinks that obviously has not heard Olivia Hussey's lungs in action. That woman can SCREAM.It's best if you watch this film alone in a quiet house at night during the Christmas season. I did that the second time I watched it. I tell you the truth, I had a hard time walking downstairs to go to the bathroom I was so scared. And no horror film has ever done that to me since the first time I saw Scream about three years ago.Some may argue that the characters in the film are not very developed, but that does not matter because most of them die anyway. One of the few characters that stood out in this film was Barb (Margot Kidder). She is a drunk, trash-talking sorority girl who manages offend just about everybody. The woman who played the sorority house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marion Waldman), also stood out as a trash-talking, drunken woman. Olivia Hussey's character is a bit snobbish, like any sorority girl, but not to her other sisters. Keir Dullea's character is high-strung and unpredictable, which adds to the film mysterious style. But as for the rest, there really was no room for them to grow. Besides, like I just stated, most of them get killed off anyway.The end really surprised me. I mean, really. No questions asked. It even shocked me, but I'm going to spoil it for anyone. But if you loved John Carpenter's Halloween, you'll love this film even more. I guarantee it.",

            "content": "25 Days Of Christmas Cheer: Day 13Before John Carpenter's Halloween, there was Black Christmas, and no it's not a Tyler Perry holiday special. It's a slick little slasher set in a 1970's sorority house during Christmas break, when many of the girls have gone home. Suddenly mysterious phone calls start to plague the ones still there, and one by one a murderous, unseen prowler starts to murder them. The phone calls themselves aren't overly threatening, but instead sound like the nonsensical babbling of someone who is a couple reindeer short of a sleigh, making them all the scarier. I remember watching this years ago and being far more creeped out at the phone calls rather than the actual murders. That is a perfect example of using atmosphere to get under your audience's skin rather than straight up gore, and a testament to the fright films of the 70's and 80's, which really seemed to have all the atmosphere vs. gore dials in the right positions. This positively drips with tension and ambiance. The silences in between screams are almost deafening in their vacuous anticipation of terror to come, and strange as it sounds, there's actually a nice Christmas-y feeling in places where the fear hasn't yet struck, despite it being a horror movie. Olivia Hussey plays Jess, the main target of the killer with appropriate wide eyed intensity, Margot Kidder is briefly seen as the house mother, and horror regular John Saxon shows up as a suspicious Police Chief as well. I'd say this one achieves a state of suspense and atmosphere that can step up to the same plate as Halloween any day, it's just a little overlooked I suppose. The house they are in is the perfect setting, a sprawling Yuletide manor of creaky hallways, desolated basements, dark, dingy attic space and an uneasy thrum of awaiting gloom that gives the words Silent Night a new meaning. The poor girls just never know when a shrill telephone ring will slice through the eerie corridors, forcing them to answer it and hear an unnerving voice warble out \"It's me, Billy\" on the other end. PS: avoid the remake at all costs. It takes everything that was creepy and restrained about this classic and turns it into a disgusting nightmare.",

Even though the producers intended the film for cinema, \"Black Christmas\" has the look and feel of its precursors, the made-for-television gothic suspense thrillers between 1969 and early 1974.  This four year period featured inexpensively-produced but having hi-quality production values that older viewers will remember. These include, \"A Howling In the Woods\", \"When Michael Calls\", \"How Awful About Allen\", \"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark\", \"Home for the Holidays\", et al. \"Black Christmas\", produced at the tail-end of this short-lived genre, clearly displays the same suspenseful and moodily atmospheric elements involving human angst, fears, anxieties, and complicated, sometimes destructive relationships.  In one small aspect, \"Black Christmas\" is a transitional film set between the television gothic supsense thrillers and the onset of the slasher genre epitomized by 1978's \"Halloween\" and 1979's \"Friday the 13th\".  The violence was certainly more graphic than its television precursors, but not gratuitous.  Foul language sprinkled throughout \"Black Christmas\" would never have made it past the television censors.  And look again at \"Halloween\".  It's reliance on atmosphere, moodiness, suspense, and the fright of awaiting something that is surely around the next dark bend of the house harkens back to the early 70s gothic thrillers.  \"Black Christmas\" is from a unique genre long gone and will probably not return, but for those seeking quality shockers without the schlock will no doubt find repeat viewings of this suspense film noir satisfying.",

Basically its Christmas time, as the title suggests and an unknown killer has found his way into the attic of a sorority girls house and begins killing them one by one. Kidder's performance of the drunken, outspoken Barb is fantastic, followed closely by Olivia Hussey, who is truly beautiful in this movie. The camera work and direction is first rate, the first person perspective, heavy breathing - which most will know from Halloween, Mr Clark did it here first, and in my opinion, did it better than JC. It's not full of gore its full of suspense and wonderful creepy atmosphere, as I mentioned before, the phone calls really will put you on edge, as will the 'eye' scene.

            "content": "Halloween (1978) is often credited for kick-starting the slasher film craze that went into hyper-drive after the subsequent success of Friday the 13th (1980). But it could be reasonably argued that there were much earlier films which could more accurately be said to have laid the groundwork for this sub-genre such as several Italian gialli such as Mario Bava's Bay of Blood (1971) or Sergio Martino's Torso (1973). But it should also not be forgotten that the Canadian film Black Christmas touched on many of the ideas that would become slasher clich\u00e9s in later years and should most certainly be considered a hugely influential and significant work. For my money, this one tops all of the aforementioned movies and remains one of the absolute classics of the horror genre. Set during the Christmas holidays, a psychopath surreptitiously enters a sorority house and hides out in the attic; from here he commits a series of brutal murders.This one scores in that it manages to combine what was a pretty original horror concept in 1974 within the framework of a story populated with well-rounded characters and a sense of realism. The cast is great and all do fine work here. We have a commendably serious performance from Olivia Hussey as the main protagonist, better still is Margot Kidder in a scene stealing role as the constantly drunk live-wire Barb, Marion Waldman puts in an amusing turn as the alcoholic dorm lady, Doug McGrath is very funny as the idiotic inept cop at the station, genre favourite John Saxon is great as ever as the police captain and Keir Dullea is suitably odd as the slightly unhinged music student boyfriend of Hussey's character. This type of top drawer talent and properly thought-out characters are very welcome in a sub-genre which would go on to be synonymous with paper thin characters who were little more than cannon fodder for a maniac. In Black Christmas we have an actually rather disturbing killer who is even more frightening in that he stores the bodies of his victims in the attic totally unbeknownst to any of the other characters. He also indulges in some highly creepy obscene phone calls to the girls in the house \u2013 these were practically as disturbing as any of his acts of murder. In fairness, the film is not overtly violent and much of its fear factor comes from the more psychological end of the spectrum.In amongst all this is another surprise \u2013 humour that is genuinely amusing. The scene where Saxon confronts McGraths dozy cop about the questionable name of the sorority house he had witlessly taken down is comedy gold. Director Bob Clark's previous film, the quirky zombie film Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things (1972), was far more directly about eliciting laughs but it sort of failed to be scary at all. With Black Christmas he delivered a far superior product and truly directs this one with great skill. The festive atmosphere really works in this one's favour too with the snowy Christmas background adding a lot of additional atmosphere. This is also a film which is not afraid to ultimately hold back information and never feels the need to explain absolutely everything. This mystery which can never be fully explained adds additional intrigue to proceedings and ultimately winds up with a rather bleak, yet very effective ending. In summary, Black Christmas is a genuine horror classic and a film so well made that it rewards repeat viewings.",

The pacing is sloooow. The killings are boring and the whole idea is mishandled, with too much time spent with the stupid police officers and the sorta seedy side of the gals, such as the scene with that old woman finding a bottle of alcohol in the toilet, which adds nothing to the movie. The good cast of actors overacts shamelessly. But the worst part of this bland movie is the ending. The woman just killed her boyfriend and she's in shock and the police leave her alone at the house?!?! Now come on! That's totally ridiculous!

Not a lot of blood but one fantastic and surely heavily influential stabbing with blood and crystal and glass and nail varnish combining in a truly ecstatic few seconds.

Clark melts the snow away with a jet-black comedic strike,as the pile of bodies look out on the Christmas scenery.Only working for the first week of production, (with clever editing making him appear more prominent) Keir Dullea hits icy notes of doubt as Jess's boyfriend Peter,and Margot Kidder pours merry cheer as Jess's close friend Babs.Advised by a psychic to take the role (!) the elegant Olivia Hussey gives an excellent performance as Jess,thanks to Hussey bringing across Jess's thoughtful, rational solutions to closing the book on this bloody Christmas carol.",

As a young student , Olivia Hussey, is not willing to become the next , then it happens a cunning plan : she and the cop mount a scheme to finish the astonishing massacre by finding out the murderer , as they set up a wiretap at the sorority house to chase the psychopath . Black Christmas will ROCK you too!.If this movie doesn't make your skin crawl... It's on too tight. Christmas is coming early this year. And it's murder .The sort of Christmas you don't dream of. It was the night before Christmas, and all through the house, a creature was stirring...The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, but it was hard to say that St. Nick would be there. This year, a Christmas of another color brings a killer on the loose.Have yourself a scary little Christmas...Not at all like the ones you used to know.He knows when you're sleeping, he knows if you're awake, HE KNOWS...It's beginning to look a lot like...bloodshed! Christmas is almost here, and an axe-wielding psycho is terrorizing a sorority. As it happens, the mad murderer also makes obscene phone calls -- and he lives right above the girls...A classic Slasher movie with thrills , chills , bloodletting , intrigue , and lots of killings . The usual plot is plain and simple , at a Sorority House a stalker is committing a number of murders , who's the killer? The movie is a fair murder mystery at a college in which a killer goes around to slice up as well as hack people who are relentlessly butchered . The film is rated \u00a8R\u00a8 for profanity , obscenity by dirty phone calls , bloodshed , gore by stabbing and neck slitting , though the original script for the movie featured even murder scenes that were more graphic . The picture is regarded as being one of the first slasher films , being actually the first : A Bay of Blood (1971) by Mario Bava , though others as Psycho (1960) by Alfred Hitchcock , and Peeping Tom (1960) by Michael Powell had already established the seed of this popular sub-genre . The cast is pretty good giving decent performances , full of known Canadian actors as Olivia Hussey , Keir Dullea , Margot Kidder , Art Hindle, Andrea Martin and the recently deceased John Saxon as an obstinate cop . It had an inferior remake : \u00a8Black Christmas\u00a8 2019 by Sophia Takai with Imagen Poots , Aleyse Shannon , Donoghue and Gary Elwes .The motion picture was well directed by Bob Clark in his usual style with plenty of grisly murders and vivid images , though sinister at times. Bob was a good writer and filmmaker , a craftsman who made several successes and working with notorious actors and frequently casts Kim Cattrall . He directed all kinds of genres as comedy , terror , Costumer , Musical ,drama , Thriller . As he made terror as \u00a8Children shouldn't play with dead things\u00a8, adolescent comedy as \u00a8Porkys I and II\u00a8 , Sherlock Holmes movie as \u00a8Murder by Decree\u00a8 , drama as \u00a8Turk 182\u00a8, thriller as \u00a8Loose cannons\u00a8, and children movies as \u00a8Baby geniuses\u00a8 , \u00a8A christmas story\u00a8 , \u00a8Karate dog\u00a8, \u00a8I'll remember April\u00a8 , and several others .

            "review_title": "A splendidly scary & spooky 70's seasonal slasher landmark",
            "content": "Made a good four years prior to John Carpenter's phenomenally hair-raising terror movie watershed \"Halloween,\" this superbly scary and suspenseful ahead-of-its-time seasonal slasher trailblazer laid the basic groundwork for the countless similarly plotted holiday-themed horror entries which followed in its influential wake throughout the late 70's and up until the mid 80's.The then fresh and novel, now stale and generic premise centers on a frightfully maniacal cackling lunatic who escapes from an asylum and holes up in the dusty attic of a nearby college sorority house on December 24th. At first the babbling, profanity-screaming nutjob taunts the sorority girls with disturbing obscene phone calls before proceeding to pick off the hapless lasses one at a time. Eventually a token lovely coed (sympathetically played by the astonishingly gorgeous Olivia Hussey) has to face the murderous kook on her own (said only lady left heroine is called in slasher movie parlance \"the final girl,\" which later became a huge clich\u00e9 in subsequent slice'n'dice features). Director Benjamin \"Bob\" Clark, who had previously helmed the superior zombie pictures \"Deathdream\" and \"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\" (Clark's latter efforts include the first two uproariously raunchy \"Porky's\" films and, amazingly enough, the disarmingly sweet yuletide treat \"A Christmas Story\"!) masterfully creates and sustains a genuinely eerie and nerve-jangling atmosphere while establishing such standard body count movie components as hand-held subjective camera shots of the killer on the prowl, bravura murder set pieces (suffocation with plastic bag, impalement on hook, and, in the single most stunning kill scene, a comely honey being stabbed to death with a crystal unicorn ornament that's brilliantly inter-cut with an angelic children's choir singing \"Sleep in Heavenly Peace\" with positively haunting and harrowing results), a creepy mystery wacko whose true identity is never revealed, a few red herring secondary characters (notably Keir Dullea as Hussey's neurotic, violently temperamental pianist boyfriend), a riveting last reel showdown with a brave and resourceful heroine asserting her proto-feminist strength and independence by doing in the killer all by her lonesome, and a socko surprise ending.Cleverly written by Ray Moore, the neatly twisty script further adds several riotous dollops of bawdy humor to leaven the unnerving tension and an intelligent reason why the initial murder victims aren't immediately missed (they left early for the holidays). Reginald Morris' strikingly crisp and agile cinematography vividly captures the stark bleakness of the severely cold wintry landscape, thereby greatly enhancing the overall literally and figuratively chilling mood. The cast all turn in bang-up performances: Margot Kidder vamps it up hilariously as a hysterically brash and slutty tramp, Marion Waldman likewise amuses as the outrageously vulgar den mother, John Saxon is properly stalwart in the first of many concerned police chief parts (a role he reprised to perfection in \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"), \"The Brood\" 's Art Hindle lurks around the edges as a hunky frat boy, David Cronenberg regular Art (\"Videodrome,\" \"The Fly\") Hindle pops up as a helpful cop, Doug McGrath supplies side-splitting comic relief as a geeky desk sergeant, and a pre-\"SCTV\" Andrea Martin is engaging as a mousy sorority sister. Smart, absorbing and above all profoundly frightening, \"Black Christmas\" will most assuredly give you the willies any old time of the year.",

            "content": "Sitting down on Christmas Night I wanted to watch something suitably seasonal so chose this classic '70s horror flick. I was expecting something very dated, overly leery, badly acted and with lashing of fake blood, thankfully I was wrong on all counts. With the exception of the scene where the police try to trace a phone call on a non-computerised telephone exchange it didn't seem that dated.Set in a Sorority house as college breaks up for Christmas and the girls prepare to go home. They start to receive a series of obscene phone calls and one of them disappears; the viewer knows that she has been killed by an unseen killer and dragged up to the house's attic. The police aren't interested at first believing she probably just went off with a boy. Eventually they take an interest but they are looking in the wrong places and never thing to search the house itself; the only person to look into the attic is promptly killed and isn't missed as she was meant to be going away.As the phone calls continue the police start to suspect the boy friend of the girl receiving the calls as the caller knows personal things that were said in the privacy of the house. Only once the police have realised the caller is on another line in the house does anybody realise they are dealing with a psychotic killer rather than just a pervert with a telephone.Director Bob Clark did a great job keeping things tense and avoids the current clich\u00e9s of giving the killer unnatural strength or supernatural abilities to survive anything. There is no back story explaining why he is killing people which makes him creepier than some better known movie killers who have a mythology spanning several films. He also avoided gratuitous sex and nudity so if you go into this expecting to see showering sorority girls you will be disappointed, if you just want a good solid thriller you should have a good time. The actresses did a good job, especially Olivia Hussey as Jess, the main girl in the story and Margot Kidder as Barb, a girl who likes a drink and has a rather dirty mind, her joke to the policeman about a new telephone exchange was hilarious and perfectly delivered.",

The protagonist is well-developed (unlike many 80s slashers which were populated with shallow cutouts) and there's a subtle commentary on changing dynamics between the sexes in the wake of the sexual revolution that doesn't become preachy or tiresome. But best of all, it's just good spooky fun, relying more on suspense and dread than gore to freak out the audience.Best of all is the film's fairy tale like nature. Like John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN after it, BLACK CHRISTMAS feels a bit like an old tale, fuzzy at the edges and yet so powerful in a primal way. The ending scene, which in some ways defies logic a bit, is also unsettling, saying much about the presence of evil in the world.A great movie.",

            "content": "It's the Christmas season at a sorority house in the Northeast wherein an ambiguous psycho hiding in the attic makes crank calls to the girls and slays them one-by-one. John Saxon plays the local detective.\"Black Christmas\" (1974) obviously influenced \"Halloween\" (1978), e.g. the closet scene, but was influenced itself by psycho slasher flicks like \"Psycho\" (1960), \"Dementia 13\" (1963) and \"Silent Night, Bloody Night\" (1972).Honestly, the 2006 remake has a more absorbing story which, to me, is the best indicator of a quality movie. This version is dull by comparison, particularly the first half, but it picks up steam in the second. And the open-ended climax is interesting.But I strongly prefer the female cast in the remake; they're just all-around superior IMHO. Of course Olivia Hussey is attractive in this rendition, albeit cold, and Lynne Griffin as Clare is winsome, although her part is small. Andrea Martin (Phyl) comes across as a shorter version of Cher with short, curly hair. Unfortunately, Margot Kidder as Barb is one of the most obnoxious characters in cinema, a real turn-off (so is Mrs. Mac, but less so). Thankfully, Barb's only prominent through the first half.The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in Toronto.GRADE: C+/B-",

But goddamn this movie truly is tasteful and classy horror, with well acted characters that make smart decisions and say smart things that a real person would do and say, and a truly terrifying psycho killer! This movie absolutely puts to shame all \"slashers\" that have come after it. Seeing a brooding atmosphere set up like this really makes me understand just how much my standards have been lowered by the current offering of horror movies out there. I've just gotten used to the mediocre and accepted it as normal, but Black Christmas is true home invasion horror, like I've never imagined. And this might be the creepiest psycho killer I've ever seen.I could see how this generation might be put off with the slowness of some of the movie. From my perspective, it wasn't slowness, it was absolutely necessary scenes to properly build an atmosphere where the actual terrifying scenes are extra terrifying, but that's getting rarer and rarer to see in modern films.What a movie.",

Many of the scenes were creepy as the darkness and shadows of what's around the corner made the film work so well! Directed by Bob Clark(of \"Porky's\" and a \"Christmas Story\" fame) his very early work before he became famous with comedy movies, paints a somewhat dim and cold take on the Christmas holiday.The setting is at a university just before the holiday break and the story involves a group of sorority girls who gather at their pledge house for one last party before Christmas break. All of a sudden things change and go dark as one of the girls go missing. And to add suspense and complicate things strange and obscene phone calls start to happen(oh that voice was just so creepy and strange!) Really this film is a cult slasher classic that helped spark the genre. Many of the film's murder scenes are filled with blood and gore as the plot twist towards the end of the film before finding out the killers identity.

            "content": "Based on a series of Canadian murders and the urban legend of calls coming to a babysitter from within the house (also see When a Stranger Calls), Bob Clark and A. Roy Moore created what many feel is one of the precursors to the slasher film genre.Bedford is a small college town, complete with a sorority house filled with victims, err, characters. While they're celebrating at a holiday party, Jess (Olivia Hussey, who was told by her psychic to do this movie) gets a phone call from \"The Moaner,\" a crank caller who has been bothering the other sisters: Barb (Margot Kidder, Sisters), Phyllis (Andrea Martin, SCTV) and Clare (Lynne Griffin, Strange Brew). Barb is a real firecracker, provoking the caller, who tells the girls that he will kill them all.Clare goes upstairs to pack and is suffocated by plastic wrap by an unseen killer and placed on a rocking chair in the attic.The next day, Clare's dad comes to take her back home for Christmas. The girls and their housemother, Mrs. MacHenry (Marian Waldman, Phobia), are surprised, as they thought she already went home. While all that is going on, Jess tells her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea, 2001: A Space Odyssey) that she is getting an abortion. He argues with her but can't change her mind.Meanwhile, the police get involved after learning that another girl, Janice, has gone missing. Jess also tells Chris (Arthur Hindle, Porky's), Clare's boyfriend, that something is up.While everyone else joins police lieutenant Fuller (John Saxon!) to search for the missing girls, Mrs. Mac is killed inside the house. Sadly, her life of hiding booze and yelling at everyone was cut short. As the girls return home, they find Jess' body and get another obscene call, which she reports to the police, who decide to bug the line so they can trace the calls. Then, Peter sneaks into the house for another argument.Black Christmas is unafraid of using holiday traditions to allow its killer to get away with murder. While carolers sing outside, Barb's screams go unheard as she is stabbed to death by a glass unicorn.Another phone call happens - one that quotes the argument Jess had with Peter. And while that's occurring, Phyl goes to check on Barb and is killed. Finally, Jess keeps the obscene caller on the line long enough for a trace, which reveals that the calls are coming from inside the house. She goes upstairs, armed with a fireplace poker, to get the rest of the girls, only to find their dead bodies. The killer chases her into the cellar and when Peter appears outside the window, she assumes that he is the killer and murders him with the poker.The police arrive to find Jess sitting with Peter's dead body. They're convinced that he is the killer, although they can't find Clare or Mrs. Mac's bodies. After she is sedated, the cops leave while one officer remains behind to wait for forensics. Then, we hear a voice whisper, \"Anges, it's me, Billy.\" Jess' phone rings, which means her fate - and who the killer is - will remain a mystery.One of the most frightening parts of the film are the obscene phone calls, which were performed by Clark and actor Nick Mancuso (Under Siege), who stood on his head while recording to make his voice sound more insane. Mancuso would come back to record a \"Billy Commentary\" on the film, which is on the recent Scream Factory! release.Warner Brother studio executives hated the ending and demanding that Clark change the final scene to have Chris appear before Jess and say, \"Agnes, don't tell them what we did\" before murdering her. However, Clark stuck to his guns and kept the ending that he believed in. The studio further tinkered with the film, calling it Silent Night, Evil Night in its original release.When NBC aired the film as Stranger in the House on the January 28, 1978 edition of Saturday Night at the Movies, it gave stations the option of airing Doc Savage, as the Ted Bundy murders had just occurred two weeks earlier.There's an urban legend that this was Elvis' favorite horror movie. It definitely made an impression on Steve Martin, who told Olivia Hussey \"Oh my God, Olivia, you were in one of my all-time favorite films\" when she was being considered for Roxanne. She thought he meant Romeo and Juliet, but he told her that he meant Black Christmas, claiming that he had seen the film 27 times.There's another urban legend - how many can one film have - that says that Halloween was originally intended as a sequel to this movie.Clark would go on to direct Porky's and a film that failed at first before becoming a holiday tradition, 1983's A Christmas Story. Yep - he pretty much made both the happiest and darkest films about the Yuletide, which is pretty awesome.I love this movie. It's a true classic that's unafraid to go against conventions even as it creates them. Nearly every actor and actress in this movie went on to do more and play their roles perfectly here.",

There's some good POV work, which I guess is the inspiration behind many of the similar scenes in Halloween, but overall it's all a little too soap opera, with endless scenes of Sorority dullards wittering senseless prattle.

            "content": "OK, you've probably heard that Bob Clark's (RIP) \"Black Christmas\" is basically the original slasher movie, the inspiration for John Carpenter's \"Halloween\". Well, let me just say that - in response to the tag-line - my skin did actually crawl a little bit during some of the phone calls! Of course, that doesn't even begin to identify what makes this such a scary movie. Aside from not knowing the killer's identity, some of the scenes towards the end really catch you.But that's only one cool aspect. The cast includes Olivia Hussey (Juliet in \"Romeo and Juliet\"), Keir Dullea (Dave in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"), Margot Kidder (Lois in \"Superman\") and John Saxon (Roper in \"Enter the Dragon\"); no doubt when Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea appeared in their most famous roles in 1968, they never imagined that they would co-star in this sort of movie. Director Bob Clark is most famous for \"A Christmas Story\" and the \"Porky's\" movies; seriously, what kind of person can lay claim to directing movies as different as these, plus \"Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things\"? But the main point is that this is the mother of all slasher movies. Like \"The Jazz Singer\" to sound, like \"I Haven't Got a Hat\" to the Looney Tunes, like \"I Love Lucy\" to sitcoms, everything started here. No matter how you look at it, \"Black Christmas\", for lack of a better word, is DA BOMB! Not only do the cast members truly have something about which to proud, but it goes to show what we lost when Bob Clark got killed in a car wreck earlier this year.PS: the special edition DVD includes an interview with Olivia Hussey (and she still looks quite good after all these years). She didn't see the completed film until many years later, as horror flicks scare her. Well, I think that it's practically a guarantee that at least one scene in this movie will scare you. Because as Olivia Hussey notes, the idea of there being something creepy out there is scarier than knowing what's there.",

            "content": "A classic mystery 70's horror slasher film one of the best slasher films that evolves around Christmas hollidays. Black Christmas (1974) is one of the most influential slasher movies of all time. John Saxon is this movie from a A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) My Favorite Horror Movie of All Time. Black Christmas I watched now the second time around I like this film a lot. The ramake I watched the first time around I like the ending a lot more than in this movie. The ending is kind a chilly.In my theory I think there were two killers I know that Peter Smythe (Keir Dullea) was the killer because he broke in to basement and it is weird that this guy knew where Jess suppose to be. I think they were 2 killers since Billy could not kill Jess, Peter decied to kill her.The story takes place in a sorority house on Christmas hollidays, where the residents are throwing a Christmas party before they depart for the summer. Little do they know, however, that a perverted killer has made his way into the house, and is preparing to pick them off one by one. The movie was inspierd by a classic urban legend of a babysitter who learns that the threatening calls she's receiving are coming from inside the house. It was a movie called When a Stranger Calls but I hate that film, I prefer the remake.Actress Olivia Hussey as Jess Bradford the heroine did a great job a wonderful believable performance I love her. I wish there would be more fight in the film with an assaliant on the end of the movie, but it is what it is. The kills are brutal, great effects, grousome death scens. Margot Kidder dies in this movie I wasn't happy about this. Olivia Hussey is a bad-ass she really did a good acting performance. The actress deserves more. Jess Bradford deserves to be one the best survivors out there. I love this my mstery great slasher film. John Saxon was great as Lt. Kenneth Fuller.The second remake is coming this Friday out and I can say the second remake will suck! I watch the trailer it will have nothing to do with the original except the title. It is Rated PG-13 as a family film so it is not worth it to see it. Black Christmas 70 movie is a cult classic. Bob Clark and A. Roy Moore the both helped developed the story in the remake. They bot did a grest job. In the movie Billy is preferening Billy and Agnes what they did. Really psycho, creepy and scary. In the park they found 13 year old girl probably Billy's first wictim. Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) disappeared. The killer was stalking her than he killed her with a plastic bag. You see her body stahed in the attic. He killed Mrs.\nMacHenry and he stashed her body too. Phyl and Barb are both killed.I will never understand why horror movies like Black Christmas the original classic are not made anymore. They are not made. I love the remastered version. I love the phone calls that sorority girls recieve. This movie is really great constructive. So I have been talking a lot about this movie it deserves a proper review. I don't own this film in my collection, because it is over 40 years old. I download and I saved the film on USB key so I can watch it whenever I want.I like this movie a lot Olivia Hussey is the best heroine she deserves a great recognition. This movie gets 10/10 R.I.P. Margot Kidder your missed I love her in Superman I and II. That is my review of Black Christmas more a Black classic movie.",

A horror film set in a sorority during Christmas break at the college, it is filled with equal parts Christmas cheer, Christmas melancholy and Halloween style horror!\"It's me Billy\"...I loved the horror film House on Sorority Row, which I saw at a young and impressionable age during a Halloween party sleepover. That will probably remain my favorite sorority horror film, but this is a very close second and I can't help but wonder if one didn't influence the other.The story takes place on a college campus (filmed on the Toronto campus in 1974 this is almost like a time capsule of the times) at the start of their Christmas break. A group of sorority girls have a small party with the girls with those still left in the house before they head off on their separate Christmas adventures. There is Barb, played by Margot Kidder, who has a potty mouth, likes to shock people, drinks heavily and is unnaturally fascinated with fornication particularly that of zoo animals! There is Jess (played by Olivia Hussey), who is dating a concert pianist Peter studying at the local conservatory and who is pregnant but wants to abort the baby. There is Claire who is dating a hockey player and all around good guy...she is to meet her father to be taken home the next day, but ends up being the first to go missing. Then there is good girl Phyl and their house mother Mrs. Mac...who seems to have a bottle of booze stashed everywhere in the house for her enjoyment...(tank of the toilet, encyclopedia \"B for Booze\"). (Personally, I would need a lot of alcohol to deal with those sorority girls as well!). The girls have been getting persistent obscene phone calls...including during the party. When Claire doesn't meet her father for their rendezvous, he goes to the sorority looking for her. Eventually he and her fellow sorority sisters go to the police to report her missing. The police station is busy as there is a missing girl from town and desk sergeant Nash, doesn't take them too seriously as he says, \"I don't know if it's any consolation but 90 percent of the time when girls are reported missing from the college they are at a cabin somewhere with a boyfriend.\"It's not until Claire's boyfriend a well liked hockey player shows up that it gets the attention of Lt. Ken Fuller (Jon Saxon) and the police start to take them seriously...including the prank phone calls.This film has all the elements of a great horror film, it builds suspense, delivers on the horror and leaves you with that haunting unfinished feeling perfect for a Halloween night!\"Just tell her to put down the phone and walk straight out of the house.\"-Lt. FullerThe haunting ending as the wind roars and the phone rings...no music, just the end credits! It leaves you with that great tingly, butterflies in your stomach feeling.This is a great must watch for any horror night like a Halloween sleepover!",

It's a spine tingling thriller from a confident director at the top of his game, along side a great cast of scream queens, although they may not all be able to fully save the convienence laden script, there's just a few too many plot holes to make this a true stand out contender, but as a whole Black Christmas will satisfy those slasher cravings in an otherwise slasher-free holiday season.",

Then when I read about the original (which I recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day) I saw that the real money is on Black Christmas, which apparently beat everyone to the \"the caller is in the house\" punch. So I Netflix that, and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its \"very long wait.\" All this time I am getting more and more eager to see it! Then one day, out of the blue, it finally arrives! ...And it's a total snore.Sure, maybe I had elevated expectations, but I don't think it would have gained more had I seen it fresh. The thing is it's Christmas in some Canadian college town, and there's this sorority having a party. We see some killer-POV shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic. So we KNOW he's in the house. Then we're introduced to our characters\u0097-Olivia Hussey as the mousy, whiny, Canadian-accented Jess. Margot Kidder as the annoying, overtly aggressive alcoholic Barb. She's so annoying even her mother dis-invites her for her Christmas festivities. There's also this irritating Janis Ian clone (\"Phil\") and this alcoholic den mother Mrs. Mac, seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house. We also meet Jess's highly-strung boyfriend Peter, played by Keir Dullea of 2001 and Bunny Lake is Missing fame, though halfway through the film I was still asking myself \"Which one's Keir Dullea?\"So it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls, but this was before email, so they couldn't ask him to send a photo. Then\u0097-well, you know how they say those plastic dry-cleaning bags are not a toy? One of the sisters finds that out the hard way. Don't worry if you don't catch the first 14 shots of the plastic-encased corpse face as it reposes in the attic\u0097-there'll be 28 more interspersed throughout the film, obviously there to make you say \"Oh my God! There's a corpse in the attic!\" Though after the first hour that changes to: \"How come the dumb police haven't found the rather prominently-placed plastic-encased corpse in the attic?\" Especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house. Really, any time before CSI came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime; the cops are so dumb. Fortunately some of them look like John Saxon.Anyway, after a lot more darn boring human drama, the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavy-looking trap door that rests atop it (those wily cats!), for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble. Now we have two corpses up in the attic\u0097-hey, why don't we have 75 more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now TWO corpses in the attic?So by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously, and tap the houses' phone and station a cop outside. They inform Jess and her pal Janis Ian that if the obscene caller calls back, they need to keep him on the phone. Jessica, who has grown even more whiny, mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller \"Who is this? What do you want? Who are you?\" after like the first 89 calls, when it is clear that he is not going to answer her. Isn't that like a sign a developmental disability? The inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something? And what's he going to do, suddenly say \"Oh yeah, hi, it's Bob from the Laundromat?\" Dumb Jess.Spoilers! Anyway, soon Janis Ian and Lois Lane (Kidder) are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces (this film's idea of gore), and idiot Jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked. Hello? Are you being stalked or what? Then the cops realize that the killer is in the house, and call Jess and tell her \"don't ask questions, just do as I say\u0085 walk to the front door and get out.\" So what does moron Jess do? Starts screaming \"Phil? Barb? Phil? Barb?\" Hey, great idea sister. Now why don't you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking? Of course she does, and sees her former friends, all splashed with ketchup, prompting this viewer to scream at the screen: \"Have a clue now?!\"Now, obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place, and that it doesn't move to the same pace we're used to, and seeing a plastic-covered corpse in the attic like 206 times probably WAS scary back in the day, and people weren't used to being stalked by psychopaths, so they wouldn't think to, you know, lock the doors or windows. And they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there. You see, people were stupid back in the 70s. We have to understand that. One of the big shocks is that we don't even see our proto-Final Girl kill the psycho. But believe me, that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for.

I feel that this film is slightly underrated and overlooked and some people don't realise how good it actually is. I have seen This Film a few times now and it still holds up really well. This film has everything, great acting, likable characters a nice location, and a story that works very well. Since this is such an old film i'm sure that a lot of people have seen it so i don't have to explain much of the story. Its about a crazed killer stalking a bunch of girls at their sorority house on campus and the killer starts killing people one by one. This may sound like your typical horror movie but believe me its not. This movie works well because of its atmosphere and its creepiness. I found this to be a very dark and chilling film, it was also suspenseful and had some mystery behind it, and I quite liked the mystery, it makes a nice change because most horror films just have a bunch of kills. But there seemed to be more to this film than just killings. I guess I just thought this film had more of a story to it than most horror films do.There are a lot of chilling and creepy scenes in this film that will make your skin crawl and my personal favourite were the weird phone calls. I thought they were done well, and the killer spoke in a way that made your skin crawl. He was creepy and his voice was creepy. The actor that played the killer did a good job and I thought this film had some good idea's like the killer hiding in the attic of the girls sorority house, I thought that was a great idea and I found it creepy that he was up there watching people out the window and nobody knew he was up there and, the heavy breathing from the killer is also very creepy especially when we don't see him. I liked him as a villain and I liked the lead girl Olivia Hussey, she looked great in this film and I found her character likable and she played her role well and the rest of the cast were good too. I also liked how things were sometimes filmed from the killers point of view as he quietly crept around the house, this added to the creepiness in my opinion. I liked the whodunit aspect of the film and I thought the twist was clever and the ending was effectively Creepy. This is a classic film and deserves a watch, its highly recommended.

            "content": "For those movie lovers who appreciate the subversive take of the horror genre on the Yuletide season, \"Black Christmas\" is one of the all time great Christmas themed chillers. Producer / director Bob Clark had already done the cult favourites \"Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things\" and \"Dead of Night\" (a.k.a. \"Deathdream\"). He'd move away from the genre after this, but certainly ended this string of titles with one of the best and most memorable on his resume. Of course, he would return to Christmas fare almost a decade later with the much more upbeat \"A Christmas Story\".\"Black Christmas\", written by Roy Moore, tells the story of a sorority house being menaced during the holidays by a stealthy and supremely creepy psycho, identified as \"Billy\". We never really learn much about him, and he's kept off screen or in shadow most of the time; the only part of him we ever clearly see is his eye. It remains to be seen if the few girls remaining in the house (most have left for their vacations) can survive the ordeal.It has naturally been mentioned many times how certain elements in this story would be popularized in subsequent movies like \"Halloween\" and \"When a Stranger Calls\". If one is already familiar with slasher movies before viewing this movie for the first time, they can hardly fail to notice that it won't play out in a way they're used to. The final girl in this case is nice enough but hardly \"innocent\". The atmosphere both in and outside the house is excellent (Carl Zittrer's music is a big help in this regard). Clark goes for a largely subtle approach, emphasizing the atmosphere and creepiness, utilizing a little bit of gore, but mostly going for a classic \"old dark house\" type of feeling.The sense of humour is a great asset, as well, with scene stealing Margot Kidder, as the vulgar sorority sister Barb (who also displays a touching vulnerability at one point) supplying much of it. Douglas McGrath as dim bulb police officer Sargeant Nash and Marian Waldman as secret drinking house mother Mrs. Mac are both a hoot. Lovely Olivia Hussey of \"Romeo & Juliet\" fame is leading character Jess, who already has her own problems to deal with, including her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"), a temperamental musician. Andrea Martin is wonderfully appealing in a very straight-laced performance as her friend Phyl. And John Saxon has a great presence here as the compassionate and dedicated Lt. Fuller. Fans will also recognize actors such as Art Hindle (\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" '78, \"The Brood\"), Les Carlson (\"Deranged\", \"Videodrome\"), and Lynne Griffin (\"Curtains\", \"Strange Brew\") in supporting roles.The movie builds slowly to a scary climax, which actually isn't quite as scary as the ultimate reveal right at the end, that plays out behind the closing credits. This helps to cement this movies' status as a horror classic. While it was a hit here in Canada in its time, it did take a while for its reputation to grow elsewhere. It's one of the movies I would easily recommend to new fans of the horror genre. 42 years later, it still works extremely well.Nine out of 10.",

I wish I had something more to say about this film, its just it left a bad question mark for me and thats why Im giving this a 6/10 rating instead of 8/10.........",

A mysterious and unknown killer is lurking in and around their house killing them one-by-one.This horror/thriller gets more intense as it goes and it gets bonus points for addressing contemporary issues. You have to wonder if this movie was attacking conservative Christian values or just trying to elicit shock and awe.It's Christmas time and folks are being murdered. The main setting is a sorority house where there is drinking, cussing, and an open assault upon the idea of virginity (Barb (Margot Kidder) labeled one of the girls a \"professional virgin\" LOL). Then there is the main character.Jess (Olivia Hussey, who reminds me of Kelly Macdonald (Margaret Thompson in Boardwalk Empire)), is in a committed relationship and she reveals to her boyfriend that she's pregnant and she doesn't want to keep the baby. That is a touchy topic in 2019 so I can only imagine how sensitive and risqu\u00e9 this must have been in 1974.Furthermore, when her beau insists that they get married and keep the baby, she stiff arms him saying that she doesn't want to marry him and she still doesn't want the baby. She doesn't do any of this in an aggressive feminazi way. She is very rational about the whole matter and not the least bit condescending.For such a delicate matter they covered it well. The dichotomy was on full display as she was never seen without a cross pendant around her neck and she was the only one seen enjoying the Christmas carol \"O Come All Ye Faithful.\" In other words, her Christianity was not to be doubted yet marriage was a no and abortion was a yes. But the implication wasn't that marriage would always be a no and abortion would always be a yes. Just at that time in her life it was.As deep and even complicated as this was, this was a side story however while the main story was a maniac killing sorority girls. The main plot thickened and thickened as the police got involved and tried to tighten the dragnet around the killer.I think the movie was well done overall. It clearly wasn't a big budget film, yet they had very good actors and a good screenplay. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, how it unfolded and how it played out.",

Unknown to them, a man has gained entrance into their sorority house and settled upstairs in the attic. Not long afterward, he kills his first victim named \"Claire\" (Lynne Griffin) by suffocating her and then propping her dead body up on a nearby rocking chair. Naturally, being quite puzzled by her absence, several members of the sorority go to the police to file a missing person's report. Unfortunately, the desk sergeant \"Sergeant Nash\" (Douglas McGrath) doesn't take it seriously--and this creates all kinds of problems from that point on. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that, while it certainly didn't have the blood and gore associated with the slasher films of today, it managed to maintain the necessary excitement the old-fashioned way--by utilizing mystery and suspense to keep the viewer interested. So much so that it was nominated for the award of \"Best Feature Film\" in Canada not long afterward and a Saturn award for \"Best Horror Film\" a year after that. Likewise, from what I understand, it has also been remade twice--once in 2006 and again in 2019. Be that as it may, I thought that this was a pretty good horror movie and I have rated it accordingly.

Billy is never seen but his childish screeching voice can be heard through prank calls to the girls in the fraternity house. One victim is suffocated through clear plastic and left rocking in a chair in the attic while her father arrives searching for her. Bob Clark previously directed Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things but here he is backed with chilling atmosphere and better writing. Olivia Hussey is the central focus and Kier Dullea plays her overbearing boyfriend. She is pregnant but decides on having an abortion. Dullea is a failing and frustrated pianist who is against Hussey having an abortion. Dullea is also chief suspect for the murders as well. Other personalities emerge including the lovely Margot Kidder in a drunken spree spewing comedic disrespect to all who will listen. Her murder scene amongst swan and unicorn ornaments is a highlighted stylish scenes. John Saxon plays the police chief whose staff provide comic moments. Marian Waldman also provides comic moments as the house mom at the fraternity house. She is crass and seems to have liquor stashed everywhere. Pointless heartbreak that no one need to live through but viewers will enjoy experiencing. Score: 8 / 10",

I bought the DVD a while back ago assuming that it was the 2006 version but by looking at the trailer thank god I got the original version and not the 2006 teen trashy version! Not much over here that is new but you can that a movie like this was the one that would set the 'rules' for future horror movies and slasher flicks. The movie goes straight into the action and does not waste in any time , although it does tend to drift off in a few places the good part was that we introduced to a tense atmospheric moment which but the tone right again. There also some genuine creepy moments that stand out and the odd funny moment here and there . There are also good uses of camera which helps dramatically to its quality and really make this movie stick out. Olivia Hussey was undoubtedly the star of the show but having said that Margot Kidder was amusing and John Saxon's performance was worthy as well. To conclude although Black Christmas did not exactly make my skin crawl , it did however jump out moments and also the fact that it annoyed some bible thumping Evangelical watching this makes me more happy as I hate Christmas and this movie just feels like a kick in the balls to old Santa, one definitely for horror movie fans who can do with some decent horror during this 'cheerful' holiday.BLACK Christmas: 6.8 OUT 10IF THIS MOVIE DOES NOT MAKE YOUR SKIN CRAWL ...

For the most part, the movie plays out as a mystery with elements of a psychological thriller. It sees the members of a sorority house harassed with obscene phone calls and picked off one by one by an unseen killer. The film is really good at getting you to engage with its enigma, trying to guess who the killer may be while wondering when he is going to strike again. This is a large part of why the picture is as successful as it is, even if it is relatively slow between its more intense sequences. It's genuinely rather suspenseful at times and its madman's maniacal screaming is actually somewhat upsetting. The protagonist is absolutely iconic and the film's attitude towards sex and abortion is wonderfully ahead of its time. It all builds to a brilliantly ambiguous finale that really does get under your skin, leaving you craving closure and callously refusing to provide even an ounce of it. It's a fantastic way to end the experience. Overall, the movie is suspenseful, unsettling, engaging and entertaining. Its restrained use of violence is surprisingly effective and one of its most shocking images - a manic eye peering out from the shadows - is still burned in my memory. It gets better every time I watch it. It's easily one of the best slasher movies ever made; it's easily one of the best Christmas movies ever made; it's easily one of the best movies ever made. 9/10.",

With red wine being sloshed and chestnuts roasting on an open fire, the festivities turn fearsome when a killer is let loose inside a sorority house. With each of the female tenants meeting their timely fate, it's up to damsel in distress Jess (Olivia Hussey) to put her abortion debate with boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea) aside, and catch the killer herself.I love Black Christmas. Even if time hasn't aged it well, it's still the perfect remedy of genuine scares and humorous bravado, without ever being trashy or pastiche. It's great fun to spot the standardised tropes we've all become used to in horror movies. And wow, there are so many here including horny young girls, implausible 'don't go in there!' plot points, seven absurd fatalities, melodrama screams and glimmers of German expressionism, maniacal phone calls, a stoic detective, an Oedipally complex serial killer and, best of all, Carl Zittrer's clamorous score which comines distorted sound of cutlery clanging together and ominous analogue synths.Alongside all this genuinely nuevo scares, horrophiles will relish in spotting the homages Bob Clark fits into the movie, with callbacks' to the POV killings from Michael Powell's Peeping Tom, psychoanalytical paranoia stemming from Hitchcock's handbook, and the same eerie claustrophobia as Robert Siodmak's fantastic 1945 mystery The Spiral Staircase.Far from formulaic, Bob Clark's Black Christmas is the precursor to the Slasher sub-genre it would spawn, and it's still better than most of it's derivations today.

Worried about the girl, her father and her friends go to the police for help and the detective involved discovers that maybe the girls' disappearance, a murder of a child and that of the obscene phone calls share a common interest.I remember when I use to think that Halloween was the begin all and end all of slashers and even to a extend horror films. Though, that was up until I discovered this Canadian little gem. Well, this has got to be one of my favourite horror films I've come across and I finally got around to updating my video copy to that of DVD. It's one of a few horror flicks that still are able to raise goosebumps whenever I watch it.Simply this is an old-fashion horror tale working with atmospheric subtleness and conjuring up such a sombre mood, where it's exhausting in its slow-building suspense. You might think that it all sounds familiar and it sure does, as you could class this as a blueprint for the slasher genre. Yes, before 'Halloween' was even thought up this film was setting up the trend to come, just that 'Halloween' was advertised better than 'Black Christmas' and from that pick up momentum in its popularity. It was one of the first films to cook up these standard clich\u00e9s and stereotypes you find in these movies. But when compared with most in its field this story will rather deal with atmosphere than violence, and that didn't bother me because director Bob Clark did a sensational job in keeping this slow-burner genuinely gripping with many effectively memorable scenes. The violence is rather timid and implied with little blood, therefore it goes for a psychological imprint by leaving in up to your imagination to picture what happened off screen, although there are two deaths we do see, which stand out in a very stylistic manner. Actually a lot of things are left up in the air, leaving you to use your own insight to come up with the answers and images. Sometimes the uncertainty of the outlook can work against you, but here it seems to fit in neatly. I thought the whole ambiguity of our killer (we don't even see him and there's no motive) and that of the ending goes down well, but it's one of those ones you'll like or be totally disappointed with.The customary plot focus basically that of a few collage students where we learn some elements (the abortion issue) that drive the motivation factor that's formed around its murder-mystery tone. I really wouldn't say it's a straight-forward stalk and slash film, because the mystery of the disappearance, murders and the obscene phone calls seem to level out instead of focusing on one particular aspect. This helped woven a nice dose of reality to the situation and characters. Now what does take front stage, are definitely the blood-curdling phones in a perversely harassing manner. The jittery voice(s) and the lurid context being said over the phone are intensely unnerving. It might build on its high-strung suspense, but the in the script there's a nice amount of amusing dark humour that's worked in with great timing. The character's interactions and perks are believable and the chemistry amongst them was more than sound. The performances were great (there's no bad exceptions) with each one fitting their roles perfectly. I would even go to say that there wasn't a weak character in the main leads, as they all had their own complexities and contain strong personalities. Margot Kidder stands out as alcoholic lout Barbie and you've got the also impressive John Saxon as the more than competent Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller. Olivia Hussey is gorgeous as the concerned, but strong-willed Jessica and Keir Dullea nails down her irrational boyfriend Peter.Director Clark draws tightly such a dreaded mood with the wintry backdrop and within that of the almost empty and bleakly lit sorority house. The dark presence of this house just takes you out of your comfort zone with its hidden layers. There's prominent work in the camera placement that moves well with the sweeping shadows roaming the house and the POV shots are eerily staged to perfection with the constant heavy breathing backing it up. They provide some quite inventive shots, as there's a lot of movement going on in the panning and frame shots. The chilling but underplayed piano score knows when to make the sudden whispers turn into quick rush of terror and the sound effects played a big part by chiming with preciseness to make you feel hellishly uneasy. Even when it's dead silent with only the ruffling winds it still succeeds in stamping a terrifying mark. It's clearly a dynamic catalyst of the genre! A truly stark and quite stylish horror film that gets under your skin by suffocating you with a heavy blanket of menace. Highly recommended!",

Set during everyone's favourite time of the year, Black Christmas takes a total 180 approach on a usual upbeat holiday and makes it dark and mysterious. This film may have introduced the first person killer camera angle which has since been done better by recent films. The other camera angels are also well done and you can tell a lot of work went into that. The movie also uses a lot of phone calls that come with profound language and suspenseful leads (Sounds like Scream, right?). Lastly, I like how the killer is always kept a mystery. We don't truly know exactly who the killer is and we never visibly see the person.As much as I like the novelty behind this movie, I can say for certain that Black Christmas is INCREDIBLY boring. You will not believe how many scenes drag, how long we focus way too much on the police officers and the investigation of the murders, the killings are slow and unimaginable, and the dialogue will put you asleep standing up. The build-up to the climatic parts of the movie, which is basically the last 15 mins, isnt worth the trouble to sit through.Olivia Hussey eventually becomes the main character after it's not really determined who our main lead is at the beginning. She clearly acted well and did her part and she's absolutely stunning, but I feel her performance was wasted.Black Christmas has seemingly become buried in time. With some cool horror elements that have been copy and pasted into other horror franchises and a bar that was set for future horror movie directors, the unique history and nostalgia behind Black Christmas is undeniably intriguing. But as a movie of its own, Black Christmas mostly flops, and that is why I lead to believe that this film has been lost in time and why, for example, hasn't resonated with a younger crowd, or hasn't had too much of a cult following (not denying there's a cult following, because I do believe there is one but it's minimal in size).If you're a history of horror buff or wanting to learn more about it then take notes from Black Christmas, but be warned, this movie is awfully slow paced and it'll take a lot of patience to sit through the dialogue and suspense.",

The humour is wonderful and dark, the killer is a really nasty piece of work, the cast - Kidder, Dullea, Hindle and particularly the great John Saxon are on fine form. Above all this is a genuinely nerve tingling and a good police thriller that maintains a strong pervasive sense of fear and evil at Christmas - whilst still oddly feeling very Christmassy.

            "content": "So, for my expectations going into this, I didn't know what to expect, but I knew my expectations were high. I heard so many good things about Black Christmas that I hoped it would be at least good. Aside from knowing the general plot and knowing what happens in the 2006, and 2019 remakes (watched the killcounts) I had no clue what was going to happen in the story, and I'm happy I didn't know much, because the story here is very unpredictable, but I'll get more into that soon. So, all in all, my expectations were high, but not unreasonably high. Luckily, I can safely say that Black Christmas succeeded by expectations greatly.The plot for Black Christmas is basic, no doubt, but nonetheless, is still very effective. The basic plot is that a sorority house gets creepy and obscene phone calls while one the members of said sorority goes missing. Sounds pretty basic right? Well, that's because it is, but as I say every time I review a movie with a basic plot, a simple plot does not immediately equal bad or uninteresting. While I tend to enjoy movies that have more complex plots, I don't instantly dislike a movie if the story is simple. Black Christmas utilizes its simple story and creates an incredibly effective psychological thriller with it. Black Christmas does a great job at showing what the main characters are doing, and what the Caller is doing, and doing this creates a extremely strong sense of paranoia, which will stick with the viewer until the movie ends. I'll say this now, I don't count Black Christmas as a horror movie, or a slasher, which is how many people think of it when they hear the name \"Black Christmas\". But the phone calls are genuinely disturbing and haunting. The phone calls are spread out through the movie, which creates a sense of dread every time that damn phone rings. Each phone call is mentally taxing and by doing this, the viewer can relate to the main character, Jess, and understand they're point of view of the situation. The ending is the part I'm most mixed on, but it didn't ruin it for me, or even make me take off any points. I like the mystery and the fact that they never explain who the Caller is, but I would have liked to have known what went down at the end. We are left to wonder what happened, and I don't know if I like that, especially when you put that on top of the fact that the Caller's identity remains unknown. While the latter part isn't bad, mixing the two unknown aspects just feels like they didn't want to bother with answering questions, but this is a nitpick for me.The characters are some of the best I've seen in this genre. Everyone is likeable (aside from Barb) and, unlike most thrillers/slashers, you don't care if someone dies because everyone, aside from the final girl, is always a bad person in someway. But even the side characters I didn't want to die. And Jess was a great final girl, who felt very realistic and was easy to root for throughout the movie. A praise I can give for every character, likeable or not, is the fact that everyone feels so realistic and down to earth. All the decisions made feel real and like what the characters in this situation would actually do. I also have to give the writer praise, the way comedy relief is woven into the story is buttery smooth. The comedy relief doesn't feel out of place or unfunny, almost every joke lands, and even when it doesn't, it doesn't come off as desperate or cringeworthy. Imagine if when Jess hangs up the phone after an obscene phone call, she says, \"So, that just happened.\" Man that would be terrible but also so funny.The cinematography is amazing. Even Black Christmas is 48 years old, it still holds up visually. I don't think I was watching a remastered version or anything like that, the entire atmosphere starts off feeling cozy and Christmassy, but soon devolves into paranoia, fear, and an overall feeling of feeling unsafe. Aside from the great atmosphere, most of the shots just look good. I love the first person shots with the Caller.Even though the cinematography still holds up, what about some other aspects? Starting off with the acting. A movie like this, you would expect to have bad acting. A low budget horror film from the early 70s? That doesn't sound like it will end well, but wow, the acting here is actually really good! There were no bad performances, and while the characters were written realistically, the actors also played them incredibly well, and helped bring out that writing. The only part that doesn't hold up as well, but also does at the same time, is the sound design. I LOVE the sound design. The creaking of the house, the slamming of the doors, just everything, but you can tell the movie is old when you hear the sound design. Lots of sounds sound edited in, and you can tell because the sounds that aren't edited in, suddenly become quiet and then become loud again. This isn't too common though and does not take away from the experience.Overall, I loved Black Christmas. A classic for sure, and a masterpiece in tension. So many scenes had me on the edge of my seat, which a lot of movies can't do to me. I do agree that this is a Christmas movie and Halloween movie at the same time. I think the rewatch value here is high because I already feel like I could rewatch it. I highly recommend you check this out. Especially if you are a big horror fan because this is basically a must watch, but it's also great for those who are new to horror, or just like watching a horror movie every now and then.",

            "content": "Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! And have a slashin' good time! The slasher sub-genre was most proficient during the mid-to-late 70s, with 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Halloween' and a plethora of spicy Argento features to add a worldly aesthetic. However, one film that innovated the tropes and traits commonly found in the aforementioned titles, was Bob Clark's Black Christmas. A horror \"slasher\" (if you can classify it as that...) where an anonymous serial killer remains secluded in a sorority house, gradually picking off the girls one by one. Just in time for Santa to come down that warmly lit chimney and deliver them coffins wrapped up in cute little bows.To say that Black Christmas was revolutionary and a blooded sprout for the blossoming sub-genre to come, would be an understatement. A nameless unknown killer that exhumes mental instability? Check. An expendable cast of characters that stupidly investigate ominous sounds by themselves? Check. Excruciating tension with every camera movement? Absolutely! Surprisingly, now that I've witnessed various films during the conception of a horror movement, it's incredibly easy to see how influential Black Christmas is. Not for its innovative concept, as other simpler thrillers utilise slashing techniques with efficiency ('Psycho'), but rather for its technical proficiency.Clark's direction, whilst unpolished, is solid throughout. Taut camera pans to explore the darkened hallways of the sorority house. Minimal sound editing to heighten the suspense. Excellent use of shadows to illustrate the antagonist's anonymity. Sublime POV perspective to place the viewer in the shoes of the killer. And a ramped up conclusive act that will have anyone watching perched on the edge of their seats eagerly anticipating to unwrap the plot twist, even if that narrative turn was predictable from the offset. The camera can be visible on specific occasions, mostly through reflections in picture frames as it glides through hallways. Emphasising that unrefined quality of Clark's novice-like direction. It does give the feature some flavour, perhaps not the jolly festivities one was yearning for. More egg nog than champagne.Yet what really injected some holiday spirit into the story, were the characters. Uniquely all acquiring a distinguishable personality that made them different and relatable. The shady drunk friend or the intellectual gal who has all the common sense (that is until she goes wandering by herself...!). The point is, they were all memorable, and that's a rare achievement in slashers. The second act, where the campus police become involved, does stagnate the overall pace with minimal storytelling momentum. Fortunately the third act immediately picks it back up for an explosive bauble of...slashing.So despite the lack of actual slashing, overall unrefined quality and inconsistent pacing, it's an extremely enjoyable horror flick that takes a gentle holiday season and turns it into a crazy murder-sesh. Perhaps my new annual Christmas film? We'll see...! I am sadistic after all!",

I don't want to make it sound like I hated the film, but it just wasn't one that really hit me. When I saw that it was playing at my local theater, I decided that I would check it out on the big screen to see if that altered my thoughts. The synopsis is during their Christmas break, a group of sorority girls are stalked by a stranger.We start out inside of a sorority house in college. Christmas is right around the corner and the winter break is starting. They're having a party and a good time going on inside. We then see someone stalking outside of the house. They climb up the side and enter into the attic through a window.Inside we see that one of the sisters, Barb (Margot Kidder), notices that the front door is open. She closes and goes back to the party. The other sisters are Jess (Olivia Hussey), Phyl (Andrea Martin) and Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin). Barb has a bit of a drinking problem. There's a phone call for her and it's her mother who scolds her for drinking too. She tells her that she can't do the original plans and invites her and her sisters to come skiing. Everyone agrees except for Clare. Barb and her do not get along as Clare is more reserved. She calls her out for being a virgin and Clare goes to her room.The phone then rings and they have been getting prank called by someone who does heavy breathing and says some inappropriate things. Barb calls the person out this time and he yells some things are her. The house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) then shows up. She has bottles of alcohol hidden throughout the house and takes drinks whenever she can, which is quite funny.Clare plays with the house cat in her room while packing and hears something in the closet. The crazy person is in there and he attacks her. He kills her with a plastic bag and pulls her up into the attic. It should be pointed out that he sets her up in a rocking chair with a baby in her arm right in front of a window. He rocks her as well as speaks with her, but we don't get a good look at him.Clare's father, Mr. Harrison (James Edmond) arrives the next day to collect her. She doesn't show up to where they're supposed to meet. He's not very happy with what he is seeing from her sorority sisters, Mrs. Mac or the place that she is living. He also says that he didn't send her to college to drink and be loose.Jess then goes to see her boyfriend, Peter (Keir Dullea). The night before she called him and he was short with her. He lives in a conservatory and he wants to be a concert pianist, so he doesn't get a lot of sleep as he practices a lot. He has a big performance later that day. Jess drops on him that she is pregnant, but she is going to have an abortion. This upsets him that she made this decision without him and he wants to change her mind. She doesn't want to hear it thoughClare is not at the Christmas Party and this makes Mr. Harrison quite upset. They go to the police, but they won't do anything at first. It isn't until her boyfriend, Chris Hayden (Art Hindle) comes down to the throw a fit that Lt. Ken Fuller (John Saxon) gets involved. There's a 13 year old girl who goes missing around this time as well. A search results in a grisly discovery and Jess reports the obscene phone calls to the police. This leads them to tapping the phone so they can trace where the calls are coming from. It leads to quite a shocking discovery as we see other members of this house fall victim to this madman.I can say, much like how I felt after my second viewing, I do enjoy this film more and more with each viewing. After my second viewing I did know that this film is interesting is that it is regarded as influencing Halloween. There was almost consideration of making more horror films around holidays like this. Something I have to give this film is that basing it around Christmas is great. You have students going away for the holidays or just going home for them, so people can go missing and no one notices it.The killer in this film is quite creepy as well. The prank calls he is making are quite unnerving if I'm going to be perfectly honest. What I find interesting is the remake uses the things he says in this one to expand the story of the film for that one. I almost like that we never really figure out why some of things are said or who the names correlate to. I do like that he incorporates conversations from the house though, because it points to Peter as the prime suspect.I've heard debates whether this film is a slasher or if it is proto-slasher. There aren't very many kills in this one. They're spaced out quite a bit and it really focuses more on the mystery of who is doing it. That almost makes it feel more like a giallo. The issue then becomes though the ending of the movie. I don't want to spoil it, but that doesn't really mesh with how those films normally end. This does give us quite a bit of police procedural.There are still some glaring issues with this film for me though. The first is how no one discovers the body of Clare. She is positioned right in front of a window and we shown that you can see her from the street. I get there could be frost on the window, but at the end of the film, no one checks the attic. This is just kind of laughable to me after everything that goes down. The next issue I have will be with the pacing.I've already kind of touched on this. I just feel this film is a bit boring. It gets right into it, we get our introductions to the characters and the first murder is right there within the first 15 minutes. We do go through quite a bit of a lull before anything else happens. I like the investigation aspect of trying to find the missing girl. We just get a lot of drama aspects and kind of shy away from the horror for just a bit too long. I do think that the film does find its way and builds tension, but just some lulls I have issues with.The acting of the film is good. I absolutely love Hussey. She is quite young in this film, but I love her determination here. This film is actually ahead of its time here as she is a modern woman that is going to abort her pregnancy because she isn't ready for motherhood yet. This is actually very relevant now and she won't be told what to do by Peter. Dullea I think is good and it is interesting, because he really shows us toxic masculinity. I get part of it is the time this film came out, but that doesn't change it. Kidder is solid as the drunk and actually brings some good humor, the same with Waldman. It was fun seeing Saxon and Hindle in this film. I think that the rest of the cast really do round out the film for what was needed as well.I'll move next to the effects of the film. To be honest, they really aren't a lot of them as they do hide quite a bit. I do like the look of Clare after she's been killed. The blood in the film is a bit orange, but I chalk that up to being the era of the film. Mrs. Mac's death is also pretty cool as well. I'd say that overall, they were done practically and look fine to me.Now with that said, I give this film a lot of respect for its significance and its place in history. My rating does seem to be keep coming up with every viewing I have of it, so that is it too. I like the idea of this film, but I would have liked them to go a bit farther. I don't need everything explained, I just like more than what we got. It does get a bit boring as it focuses on some things that can bog it down. The climax and ending are good. The acting really does carry the film and the depth of the main characters is still socially relevant. It is a bit light on the effects, but they're done practically so that really does help. The soundtrack of the film really doesn't stand out, the Christmas music does set the mood of the time of year. I do think that this is a good movie and actually, it does have some socially commentary that is relevant. I would recommend this even if you don't like horror as it is has a good mystery.",

When one sister goes missing, local police don't give the case much thought until it's almost too late.Written and directed by Bob Clark (who would, amusingly, go on to direct the perennial holiday classic A Christmas Story almost a decade later), Black Christmas is an efficient, low budget proto-slasher with a nice blend of character moments, tension-breaking humor and moody suspense. Rather than observing in fist-balled terror from a distance, the audience takes a direct, active role in the murders thanks to an persistent hand-held, killer's-eye perspective during the bloodiest scenes. While an obvious gimmick, this approach does add a unique dimension to the screen and lends the killings an intimate, face-to-face quality that feels different to its many peers and imitators.The cast is surprisingly human and relatable for the genre, from the most experienced players (Margot Kidder as a wise-cracking, foul-mouthed lush) to the relative rookies (first-timer Lynne Griffin, whose last suffocated gasp is pictured on all the promo materials), and tackles a number of social taboos between all the stabbings.

I'll start with the films flaws, as there isn't much of them. I never found the film to be super entertaining in anyway, there are a few dull moments. However, it is very easy and engaging to watch, as the mystery at hands become more and more interesting as the film plays out. The film can be a bit tough to follow at times as well, as there are quite a few things going on at once, but perhaps the biggest flaw of the film is also something relatively small, that being the sound quality. Its irritating at times how loud it can be and how quiet it can be at other times. I'm not entirely sure if it is the quality of the film itself, or the film quality due to the streaming provider I watched it on, but a remastered version would be nice. Besides that, the film is quite smart. It isn't like other horror films at its time, not like the ones it is claimed to inspire. This is not a slasher film, contrary to what many believe, though it does serve as an inspiration for them. What this film has going for it though that other films that imitated it lacked, is the sense of psychological horror that it had going for it, and the unsureness of it all, which I always find quite brilliant. The cinematography is quite good, and very nostalgic, and the acting in it is quite good as well. Standouts for me would have to be first Margot Kidder as Barb, who provides an incredibly underrated performance, Olivia Hussey, John Saxon, Marian Waldman, and Keir Dullea. In the end, Black Christmas is a shining star among 70's horror, and despite it being nearly half a century old, it still remains to be frightening even today.\nMy Rating: 9.25/10",

            "content": "Before violent holiday horror movies like John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" and Sean Cunningham's \"Friday the 13th\" hit theaters and shocked audiences and critics alike, there was \"Black Christmas\" which combined key ingredients that only a few years later were fully developed in \"Halloween.\" Some trademark slasher elements in \"Black Christmas\" include extended POV shots from the killer's perspective, a string of bloody murders using a variety of sharp instruments and of course, the familiar climax involving a confrontation between the killer and the final girl. It's important to note that \"Black Christmas\" also acts as a precursor to phone horror movies like \"When a Stranger Calls\" and \"Scream\" where the killer stalks and harasses their victims with obscene phone calls.As a horror movie, \"Black Christmas\" has aged remarkably well where the disturbed killer is a terrifying and mostly unseen presence whose deadly stalking skills rival that of Michael Myers from \"Halloween.\" Like \"Halloween\", the film contains a number of jumpscares that are effective, even today. A film like \"Black Christmas\" is highly recommended for fans of slasher movies and film buffs who want to learn more about the fundamentals of the slasher genre which can be traced all the way back to the early 60's with Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" and Michael Powell's \"Peeping Tom.\" While \"Halloween\" tends to be regarded as the first official slasher film of its kind, it's important to note that Halloween's formula derived its trademark elements from previous horror films like \"Black Christmas\" before taking full shape in \"Halloween.\"",

            "content": "This film was promoted in 1974 with the tagline \"If this picture doesn't make your skin crawl, it's on too tight!\", and practically wrote the rulebook for all future slasher scary movies, including Halloween (released four years later). It was only because of the 2019 remake coming up that I thought to watch this 1974 original again, and I'm glad I did, directed by Bob Clark (Porky's, A Christmas Story, Baby Geniuses, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2). Basically, during the Christmas holidays, an unseen and disoriented man climbs up into the attic of a sorority house. One of the sorority sisters, Jess (Death on the Nile's Olivia Hussey), answers an obscene phone call from a mentally unstable man. It is implied that the caller has been calling the house regularly, other girls gather as the voice (Nick Mancuso) screams and curses them on the phone. Foul-mouthed Barb (Superman's Margot Kidder) takes the phone from Jess, she provokes the caller, who in turn threatens to kill her. Clare Harrison argues with Barb, she is worried that the caller could be a serial rapist. While in her bedroom packing for Christmas break, the stranger lures Clare into the closet, where she is suffocated by a plastic bag, and her dead body is placed on a chair in the attic. The following morning, Mr. Harrison (James Edmond) arrives at the school to pick up his daughter, but she does not show up at their agreed meeting place. At the sorority house, the housemother, Mrs. \"Mac\" MacHenry (Marian Waldman), is surprised by Clare's absence. Meanwhile, Jess meets her boyfriend, Peter (2001: A Space Odyssey's Keir Dullea), a neurotic music student. She tells Peter that she is pregnant and planning to get an abortion, angering him. In town, Mr. Harrison, accompanied by Barb and another of the girls, Phyllis \"Phyl\" Carlson (Andrea Martin), attempt to report Clare as missing, while Jess tells Clare's boyfriend Chris Hayden (Art Hindle) about Clare's sudden disappearance. They learn that another local girl named Janis Quaife has also seemingly vanished while walking home from school. While a drunken Barb is put to bed, Mr. Harrison, Chris, Jess, and Phyllis help search for Janis, hoping also to find Clare. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mac is lured up into the attic, where she discovers Clare's body. The killer throws a crane hook into her face, hanging and killing her. Janis's disfigured body is found by the police in the park, Jess returns, while the search for Clare continues. Jess answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with the police, only for Peter to appear and surprise her. He tries to persuade her into marrying him for the sake of their child, but Jess refuses. Peter leaves emotional, while Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller (A Nightmare on Elm Street's John Saxon) arrives to bug the telephone. While Jess is distracted by a choir of children arriving at the house carol singing, the killer enters Barb's bedroom. Barb is murdered her with a glass figurine, but her screams are drowned out by the singing children. After the children leave, Jess answers another unnerving phone call, and mentions the conversation between her and Peter. Lieutenant Fuller theorises that Peter could be responsible, due to the caller's knowledge of the argument and his mentality, but Jess doubts it. Moments later, Phyllis enters Barb's room and is ambushed by the killer, who murders her off-screen. Jess answers the telephone again, she stays on the line long enough to be traced by telephone company employee Bill Graham (Leslie \"Les\" Carlson). Sergeant Nash (Douglas \"Doug\" McGrath) instructs Jess to leave the house immediately, as the calls have been traced to be coming from within the sorority house. Jess arms herself with a poker and ventures upstairs, where she discovers Barb and Phyllis's maimed bodies. The killer appears and pursues Jess through the house, she locks herself in the cellar, while Peter appears outside one of the windows. He smashes the window to get to Jess, who proceeds to bludgeon him with the poker, assuming he is the killer. The police arrive, alerted by Jess's screams. They discover her barely conscious in the basement, with Peter's body next to her. They put Jess to bed and discuss the murders, unaware that the bodies of Clare and Mrs. MacHenry are still in the attic. While Jess is resting, with a policeman standing outside. The killer climbs down from the attic into her bedroom, Jess's fate is unknown, and the telephone begins to ring as the credits roll. Also starring Michael Rapport as Patrick, Leslie Carlson as Graham, Martha Gibson as Mrs. Quaife and Robert Warner as Doctor. Hussey and Kidder among the other young actresses give good performances as the victims to the maniac stalking them on the phone and in the house. This is a good slap in the face to the traditional festive movie full of happy families and joy, it feels creepy, and the kills are reasonably inventive, the bag death being the most memorable (featuring in both remakes), overall it's not a bad seasonal slasher horror. Good!",

Rarely do I get my bones chilled or my brow wetted to such an extent while watching horror. Few film's from the genre have gripped me both in entertainment and in suspense like this one did. Not to mention, it boasts some of the better performances from scared women and questionable men that you'll find in the slasher arena. The blocking is tremendous and so is the cinematography. The sound design is tops, though, as the voice on the other end of that miserable phone will haunt me for some time.",

            "content": "The plot is simple--a crazy man hides in a mostly empty sorority house Christmas Eve.  He begins to stalk and kill the remaining girls.  This sounds like just another slasher thriller, but it's not.  For starters, it came out 4 years before \"Halloween\" started the slasher craze and it's an intelligent, very scary movie--how many slashers can you say that about? \nThe film was shot in Canada on a low-budget.  With the exception of John Saxon, everybody was basically unknown (Margot Kidder made this before \"Superman\").  There's no sex, no nudity and very little blood and gore. Still, I've seen this movie at least 8 times and it scares me each and every time.  All during the movie, even when the characters are inside, you hear the wind blowing through the soundtrack.  It makes you feel the cold and chill the characters feel.  Also there are the obscene phone calls the girls in the sorority house are getting--they're deeply disturbing and the frightening music playing during them makes them worse.  A truly scary horror film--back in 1978 NBC cancelled a showing of the film--even edited they thought it was too disturbing to air!  That should tell you something.SPOILERSThe most terrifying moments in the movie--the phone calls (especially when you hear the killer pleading to be stopped);  when Olivia Hussey is grabbed by her hair; the opening murder and Margot Kidder's murder.Only complaint--the ending.  It was original back in 1974 but it's an overused cliche now.A definite must-see.  DON'T see it alone.  A commercial bomb when released this has deservedly acquired a cult following.",

            "content": "A seriously disturbed man stalks girls at a sorority house over Christmas break. It is sure to a very Black Christmas for most of them ...The film opens to the POV of a prowler outside of a large Victorian house which is a sorority house for women attending classes at the local university. He crawls up an outside ladder leading to the open attic. A bunch of the sorority sisters meanwhile are having a holiday party downstairs. After a terrifying and crude obscene phone call, one of the girls goes upstairs and is murdered by the prowler with a plastic bag and put in the attic to sit by the window.Our main characters include mostly the sorority sisters - Jess, the film's fiery heroine, Barb the house drunk, Phyl the level headed intelligent one, and Mrs. Mack, the house mother who is our comedic relief character always looking for booze anywhere she can find hidden around the house. After a few more phone calls, the killer starts coming out from his attic to attack the girls left at the sorority house during winter break. With only one girl left alive, will the killer be stopped or is she destined to be murdered?Black Christmas might be the best horror film I have ever seen. I rate it so high not only for it's quality, but for setting the tone of my favourite subgenres - the killer in the house and the slasher film. Pretty much every one that comes after this has used elements from this story. When A Stranger Calls and Halloween definitely found inspiration from this terrifying classic. Black Christmas still does it best - I have yet to see a film that musters the whole \"the calls are coming from inside the house\" routine the way that Bob Clark did in 1974. The moment that line and truth is revealed, the viewers heart sinks with the realization that our characters are in serious danger.The filming locations are set in my hometown of Toronto. I recognized most of the places which was nice, including the police station in the east end and the University of Toronto campus. The house they used is actually the film's biggest plus for me. Not only is the exterior eerie with the winter winds blowing and snow on the ground, but the inside is equally creepy with turns and dark corners and that attic where the killer hides out. Super effective location to make a movie like this.The acting is so superior for a horror film and for a low budget film like this, very unusual. Olivia Hussey is our final girl Jess and she plays the heck out of the role. She is such a strong female lead and is a unique one with her noticeable British accent. Marion Waldman as the house mother is one of the best things about Black Christmas. This lady is constantly seeking out small bottles of Sherry that she has hidden around the house, and is constantly grumbling around the place clearly so over her job as the head of the house. Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin are the supportive female characters and both were perfect for their roles.Everything about this classic is so creepy to me. The obscene phone calls are so manic and crazed that I still get goosebumps thinking about them. The murder scenes are well done, but it is the shadowy figure coming out from the attic each time that sets them up to be as effective as they are. The thing that is always talked about is the ending and how up in the air it is when it comes to figuring out the killers identity. Following an amazing chase scene involving Jess and the maniac, we are left to wonder who the actual killer is. Was it Jess' neurotic boyfriend, one of the other frat boys we see, or some crazed maniac who is perhaps named Billy? We never find and probably never will.Black Christmas is a film to be seen by all and should be studied by any horror director who is looking to make a movie in this genre. It is a perfect masterpiece.10/10",

It has a mysterious killer, a big house to work with, faster paced and better characterization. I felt like a kid hiding under the covers during some of the brutal scenes. It could be very creepy like when the killer would taunt them or talk about sexual content that I suspect he was performing on the bodies.The music even became an entity that reached a pitch at climatic scenes resulting in nearly turning my hair white.I can't say there was ever a dull moment. I watched it dozens of times and have never been bored by it. It always has the characters involved in parties or on a hunt and noting around. I nearly suffered whiplash.Black Christmas may be ignored by critics at its release, but now has the cult following it deserved.Special mentions to Marget Kidder who was a delight and my favorite character.

            "content": "I saw Black Christmas when it was under its alternate title Stranger In the House and knew this was a classic. It crawled under my skin unlike any other horror film (with the exception of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). I don't know if there is a distinction between scary and disturbing but the film works on the latter. The premise cannot be more simplke: a lunatic is prowling around a college sorority house around the Christmas season, picking off one girl after another. Without knowing any better you'd think that this was a rip off of Halloween but it predates the John Carpenter film by four years. Halloween was probably heavily influenced by Black Christmas,especially the numerous Point of View shots. What distinguishes the two is that we have no idea who killer is or why he is killing girls. There are hints that this is a demented boyfriend who goes crazy when his girlfriend aborts his child, but nothing is clearly explained. It makes the killer all the more frightening because there is no apparent motive and we fear for each female left inside the sorority house. It is a film that I find more frightening than The Exorcist. The demonic possession of a 12 year old girl I find implausible but a lunatic in a house (especially if one recalls the Richard Speck killings of several student nurses) is terrifyingly plausible. There are scenes that still send a chill down my spine. The cast is outstanding and are more than just walking meat bags to be killed off. We feel their deaths more than any other slasher flicks. It's hard to believe that this is the same Bob Clark who will go on to make A Christmas Story. Although many see Halloween as the originator of the modern slasher flicks it was Black Christmas which ranks as one of the best.",

            "content": "Black Christmas, if nothing else, is a genuinely frightening film. Some have labeled it a \"classic\" but I'm not so sure I can go that far. True it clearly inspired numerous more successful films, but it's just \"good\" when taken on its own.Our story is simple enough. A deranged killer has snuck into the attic of a sorority house just as many of the girls are leaving for Christmas break. This guy is a real wacko. He begins calling the young women on a regular basis and threatening them in often obscure but VERY SPOOKY outbursts of jibberish. Then, he begins picking off those who remain behind one by one. The bulk of the latter half of the film centers around a police detective (John Saxon) trying to get to the bottom of everything and save the lives of the remaining girls. This film works mainly because of two reasons. First of all, this film has an atmosphere of gloom set over it like few I have ever seen before. Even though it's Xmas, and people should be having fun, the characters and the audience as well seem to know something terrible is going on around them. A prime example is the duality we are presented with when the group of carolers are singing to the beautiful Olivia Hussey while Margot Kidder is being stabbed to death in her bed at the same time. The second major factor that helps this film get its point across is the absolutely demented phone calls this killer makes. Wow! I have never heard anything more psychotic in any film that I can remember. These calls really make the case for just how screwed up this guy is. His multiple outbursts and different vocal tones will be ringing in your ears for a while after the film is over.The acting was decent, but I don't think anyone was particularly outstanding. The film had a noticeably restrictive budget, but Clark does what he can. This film sets quite a different tone than his later successes like Porky's and A Christmas Story. It makes me want to check out some of his other thrillers made early in his career.One thing about this film that also can give you the creeps is knowing that this sort of thing has happened in real life! Perhaps the most well-known incident like this was when Ted Bundy, one of America's most famous serial killers, dropped in for a visit to a sorority house at Florida State one evening. The results were very similar to what happened in this film. If you think about it, these houses full of young (and often attractive) women would seem a real beacon to these types of killers. Especially in a college town like the one I live in.Makes you wonder if or when this type of thing could happen again...7 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.",

            "content": "\"Black Christmas\" was a pioneering movie. It's safe to say that this was one of the first if not THE first slasher-flick of all time. As such, the movie has a lot going for itself. Everything that would later become a clich\u00e9 is established here: the POV-shot of the killer entering rooms, the creative ways of picking off victims one by one, the final girl, etc. \"Black Christmas\" invented it all. On top of that the movie has top notch direction and an artful cinematography, which is sometimes reminiscent of Dario Argento's work. The acting is fine for the most part, and the mysterious killer and his creepy phone calls give Michael Myers a run for the money. So, if we take all that into consideration, \"Black Christmas\" is a genuine horror masterpiece.However, a lot of time has passed and a lot of slasher movies have been made since 1974. If you watch this movie now for the first time, it won't do much for you. You've seen these ideas before and probably in a more shocking way. \"Black Christmas\" may have been the first movie to do it, but other movies were the ones who made the basic slasher-elements famous.That's hardly director Bob Clark's fault, of course. It's just that if you're not a cineaste, you won't care too much about whether or not this movie was inventive when it first came out. All you'll care about is whether it can surprise and entertain you still, and truth be told, if you've seen the \"Halloween\"- and \"Friday The 13th\"-flicks or any movies of their ilk, then \"Black Christmas\" probably won't blow you away.However, if you do care about historical movie facts, then you must see Bob Clark's true holiday classic (the \"false\" one being \"A Christmas Story\" from 1983). After all, \"Psycho\" is also respected for the effect it originally had on audiences mostly. Even Hitchcock's masterpiece seems tame and predictable from today's point of view, so why should you be more critical when it comes to judging \"Black Christmas\"?

            "content": "It's hard to write a review for Black Christmas. On one hand I thought much of the movie was a pathetic attempt at an emotional slasher film, and on the other hand there were scenes that were some of the best kill/scares in the history of horror movies. It's almost like Black Christmas flirts with perfection then jumps back to lame subplots. Yes, I understand that this film literally invented the slasher genre, but, no, I cannot call it perfect\u0097I can only call certain aspects perfect.As I said, the main standout flaw is the complete lack of focus. The movie starts out in a sorority house, but from there jumps to a lot of other places to focus on characters and subplots that don't really matter to the story at all. The whole subplot of Clare's father coming to the sorority house was completely pointless by the end of the film, and just takes away from the actual story. The subplot between Jess and her boyfriend should have been cut much shorter, in order to, once again, focus on the actual story. Most of all, the subplot of the missing child still has nothing to do whatsoever with anything else in the film. I don't understand why the director takes 20 minutes to go into it, when in the end, like all the other subplots, it is nothing important. It could have easily been a passing reference instead of its own section of the film. The police scenes, also, added nothing to the story except take away from the amazing atmosphere. Everything the police scenes added could have been done with phone conversations, instead of taking up half the movie time to show things the audience could have guessed. Without all these subplots the movie would have been much, much more effective and tense.Another problem I had was the title of the film is Black Christmas, but other than the opening and one of the death scenes, nothing in this movie referenced Christmas at all. Most of the time there wasn't even snow on the ground. It would have been so much more emotionally effective if it played into the Christmas nostalgia more than it did, but the movie made the ability to play Christmas songs more of a gimmick than a plot point.Though I'm being negative with almost every aspect of the film, I really did enjoy part of it\u0097the actual story. When the movie isn't trying to have five different subplots that go nowhere, the actual core story is done to perfection. The killer, the kills, the girls, the sorority house, the phone calls, the ending\u0097all truly perfect, and by far the greatest slasher of all time. It's sad to see what is really a beautiful minimalist horror story turned into a bloated crime drama with more pointless subplots than kills, and that is the only thing holding this film from perfection.Overall, I wish I could go in and just watch the actual plot happen in Black Christmas, but I can't. Still, as much ranting as I did, there is something there that makes it better than so many movies that I've rated higher. Something that Hollywood forgot four decades ago. Maybe it's the fact this movie has very little blood, but is still very effective. Or, maybe, it's that the core plot was actually thought out, truly terrifying, emotionally captivating, and also something original that had never been done before it. I think that is it.4/10",

            "content": "An excellent horror film, which manages to build up a quiet, considerable power.  While it may not be out-and-out BOO! YIKES! scary (very little is these days), it combines narrative and subtext to an agreeably creepy pitch. Imagine an episode of THE X-FILES without the gloss, or alien nonsense, or enervating conspiracy theories, or even Mulder and Scully.  Even the amusing accents (the film is Canadian) cease to grate after a while.The story is set in a placid all-girl sorority house on campus in some Canadian university, at Christmas time.  The girls are having a sedate party with some boy friends.  Outside a breathing camera lurches towards the house...  Like Argento's SUSPIRIA, this all-female community is the site of the most horrific repressions, anxieties, fears, waiting to burst out, both within (figured as alcoholism, unwanted pregnancy) and without (rapes, murders, obscene phone calls).  Cleverly, though, the girls don't go hysterically loopy - everything remains externalised - much more chilling, even if it lacks the full on psychogynaecology of the Italian masterpiece.For example, one girl's mother is clearly indifferent to her, gold-digging, she claims, after other men.  Another is a virgin who has previously, we deduce, lived in a very repressive, rigid family atmosphere.  Indeed, one of the noteworthy things about BLACK is how these girls are away from home for the first time - they have cut away from authority, patriarchy and tradition.  The film is not necessarily a reactionary plea, however - the girls' substitute authority figures - boyfriends - become the locus of the terror; and although their self-made family verges on the parodic (with their seemingly jovial, frustrated alcoholic housekeeper as mother substitute), it is a genuine, if finally useless, structure of support.I suppose the film could be seen as an examination of the deep traumas buried underneath the vociferous self-confidence of contemporary feminism - after all, it was directed by the man who would make that radical treatise on gender relations, PORKY'S.  The main plot centres on the lead's right to have an abortion, and the terrifying phone calls - a horrifying, babbling cacophony from the beyond - seem like the pleas of a dying child, or the malicious threats of an Id-mother.  The idea of the disembodied or unreferential voice (those things denied a presence in the film, and maybe our society; e.g. the psychological trauma of abortion), miscommunication, misread signs, disinformation all suggest a culture where all recognisable meaning has gone haywire.  As this is the film's anxiety, we may feel that it is somewhat right-wing.On the other hand, it's thematic interest is the family, set in a family away from a 'real' family.  The BLACK of the title in relation to CHRISTMAS suggests diabolical overtones, a distorted mirror of the Holy Family celebrated at this time.  Maybe the film is reactionary - charging newly independent women with destroying the structures of family and tradition, and unloosing untold terrors and demons.Or maybe it's very sympathetic to the characters' plight.  Patriarchy in all its forms pervade the film - the unseen killer/rapist; the ineffectual police lieutenant; the self-obsessed boyfriends; the downright idiotic cop. The only clever, likable characters are the women.  And, as in the case of Barb, their rejection of family is not necessarily willed.  The path to independence is certainly not made easy in this culture.The great thing about BLACK is how it shows the sheer ineffectuality of trying to specify the unspecifiable.  It is obviously madness to think that Peter could have committed all these crimes, and yet it is quite reasonable to demonise him - he reveals the monster beneath the sensitive New Man. The heroine discovers that she can rely on no-one but herself.  Even this isn't enough.  Notwithstanding the unreassuring ending, she still has to deal with the fallout of her actions, which are by no means resolved.  There is still the issue of the abortion, which is one reason the demon is not dead. There were obscene phone calls and rapes before she knew she was pregnant: the fears may be subjective, but the inability to connect everything makes the film the more scarily effective.As a horror film, BLACK's excellence derives from the disparity between the hysteria of the subject matter, and the cool film style, suggestive, sinister, yet withdrawn.  The breathy point of view camerawork may seem tiresome after HALLOWEEN and its dozy imitators, but here the idea of something submerged, concealed, unknowable, unconquerable, not even human, never mind the cartoon slasher we're used to, is superbly realised, slowing down time.  The images of the first dead girl, with the doll baby in her lap, and the cat purring beside her, will haunt me for a long, long time.",

            "content": "I'm not even sure what sequence number can I assign to this year's re-watch, but what I am sure about though is that \"Black Christmas\" still remains my favorite slasher of all. Bob Clark did a terrific and highly creative job, and got hated back then, but eventually, deservedly it became a cult classic, and, more importantly, a huge influence to the genre - beginning with John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" which, in early stages, was meant to be a sequel to \"Black Christmas\".It's a bit of a slippery topic, about wether it's a slasher or not, but I made up my mind the first time I watched it - it is. What makes \"Black Christmas\" so enjoyable is the simplicity of the production, there are no over-the-top kills, no goofy chase scenes, no unintentional humor. Instead we get presented a contained, straight-forward, but unnerving story that's rooted in reality. The atmosphere feels pseudo claustrophobic and vulnerable. Bob Clark takes his sweet time to build the story, the characters and create suspense - by general slasher standards I'd deduct that \"Black Christmas\" is quite the slow-burn, but trust me, it's a value instead of a flaw. Despite an awfully tiny budget, \"Black Christmas\" feels polished and confident. The entire cast is almost unexpectedly terrific, with Olivia Hussey and John Saxon being the highlights & Marian Waldman provides a warming and healthy humorous character as the Sorority house's mother. The villain, the killer, mostly portrayed in back then extremely rarely used POV style, is just perfect for a slasher flick. The ambiguity surrounding him is all the character needs & his terrifying voice is an icon on its own. All the while the aforementioned qualities keep the movie going smoothly and creepily, even visually, given the budget, it's very creative - mad props to the cinematographer.\"Black Christmas\" is, without a doubt, an overlooked movie if not also underrated. I might love it more than most of its viewers, but I'm telling you, it's a landmark in the horror genre that still has the ability to provide enough kicks. My rating: 9/10.",

            "content": "In the weeks leading up to Christmas, a sorority house is harassed by obscene phone calls that serve as a prelude to chilling murders.Released in 1974 to respectable box office and mixed reviews, the film helped pave the way for future films such as John Carpenter's Halloween and Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th. But even taking its influence on future films out of the equation, Black Christmas is a chilling and well made thriller.Bob Clark strikes a good balance between character based moments, humorous moments, and suspenseful moments to build a film where the scares come organically from build up and release rather than through overuse of jump scares. Clark makes good use of the perspective from both the killer and the women in the sorority house, and we never learn anything about the killer other than whatever insane rants he divulges over his obscene calls that are so loosely constructed they may or may not contain the truth.The movie is anchored by great performances as well. John Saxon does a good job of playing the investigating officer Lt. Fuller, and Margot Kidder as the house's brash acerbic Barb brings some subtle hints of humanity to what could have easily just been a hate sink for the audience to want to die, but easily the best performance is Olivia Hussey as Jess. Jess is a fantastic protagonist who we see dealing with the dilemma of terminating a pregnancy despite her boyfriend's objections, and she brings that inner struggle to her performance quite well. She also conveys a caring nature thatmakes her an endearing character who we like spending time with.Black Christmas is a classic for a reason. From its well defined characters to it lean but creepy atmosphere it's a film every horror fan needs to see at minimum once.",

            "content": "This is definitely one of the best of its type; a crazed killer stalks a coed in a sorority house and unmercifully butchers her closest friends and any passersby that just happen to get in his way. What separates this from the typical slasher fare is an above-average script, above-average acting, and really good direction. Director Bob Clark, the director of such films like Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things and Murder by Decree, seemingly does everything right in this one and makes all the right choices(well, most of the time at least). His flair for creating hauntingly eerie scenes that stay with you is first-rate. Take the first murdered girl(happens in first ten minutes). We never see the killer but just his eyes. The girl is saran-wrapped in a dress bag and set in a rocking chair with an old doll. Her presence is filmed in such a stark manner as to really set the mood of this whole film. Clark then effectively builds tension by the girl's father looking for her - as no body is found - the coed, played by the beautiful Olivia Hussey, consistently receiving phone calls from what is some sick sex pervert on the outside, the police are then brought into the mix, and finally some red herrings that throw the viewer off track a bit at the very least. All this goes on with snow, caroling, decorations, and Christmas atmosphere like one might expect in a small college town of a similar ilk. The first death scene is for my money the most effective shot and running scene in the entire film, but there are other equally brilliant shots that Clark uses to shock and create suspense. One scene in particular has Margot Kidder getting acquainted with the man with the creepy eyes with cuts(no pun intended) to children singing mellifluous carols at front door for Hussey. The acting all around is pretty good. Hussey is adequate. Kidder is too. Andrea Martin is along as well. The main policeman is John Saxon. He is pretty good and seems to flourish in roles like this in the seventies. Many films have tried to create the same effect as Black Christmas, but so few have come close at all to reaching the level of this - at least in this genre. An impressively shot film with good locations and a very effective ending.",

The ending was also well done in my opinion. All movies have flaws, though. To start off, the whole calling while inside the house idea was a bit unrealistic. In the calls, the man can be heard screaming. There's no way no one couldn't hear him screaming while inside the home. Next, the movie felt a bit slow at some parts.

            "content": "Whilst it's widely thought that it was John Carpenter's Halloween that initiated the slasher genre those who actually know anything about horror know that it was actually Bob Clark's Black Christmas made in 1974. In fact, Clark and Carpenter worked together on a project after Black Christmas was made. Clark said to Carpenter that he no longer worked in horror but that he had had an idea for a horror film that was never realised. This would be based around the occasion of, you've guessed it, Halloween! Carpenter then later asked to use the idea for a film he was to due to work on and the rest is history. This isn't to say that Carpenter ripped off Clark but this explains how The Babysitter Murders (the original idea for Halloween) suddenly morphed into the masterpiece we now know and love.In fact, the opening shots of Black Christmas are similar to those of Halloween- the killer's point of view camera shot. Halloween reveals who this person is (and it's one hell of a reveal) but Black Christmas doesn't. In fact, the killer isn't revealed fully throughout the entire film which is the first reason that Black Christmas is so revolutionary.The story involves a group of female students on the night before they leave their sorority house to go home for the holidays. They start to receive very disturbing phone calls and things start to get dramatically worse soon after.Another reason to love Black Christmas is that the extent of the killer's mental instability is shown by the first girl he kills. She is suffocated and then placed in a rocking chair in the attic where the psycho is hiding out. Throughout the film we see him ranting and manically rocking her.Arguably some of the most disturbing sequences within the film are when the intruder calls the girls. They don't know the calls are actually being made by the killer who's in the attic within the same house. From the calls we come to learn that the person making them is called Billy and that he seems to be playing out incidents from his past, incidents rife with cruelty, abuse and possibly murder. Bob Clark used five different actors for the calls. These phone calls are some of the scariest, most disturbing and unsettling sequences I've ever seen in a horror film. They were even cut when the film was first released in the UK.Theres also the fact that Black Christmas was the first film to use the now established trope of a killer's phone calls coming from inside the same house as their potential victim(s). This was years before When A Stranger Calls.Another great thing about the film is the humour contained within the movie especially from Margot Kidder's character, Barb. It's amazing that such an unnerving film can still have genuinely funny interludes but without forsaking the movie's tension.But maybe thats because the film is extremely tense indeed. Theres a certain sense of doom to the proceedings that are depicted in the movie. A great example is where Olivia Hussey's character Jess has just found out that the calls are coming from the sorority house, that Billy is ensconced within it but so are two of her friends (the audience knows otherwise as we saw them get dispatched earlier). On going upstairs (even though the police have phoned and demanded that she leave the house immediately) she enters one of the girl's bedrooms to discover their dead bodies- and the killer looking at her through a crack in the door. This sequence is one of scariest in horror history.Add to this one of the most warped endings I've ever seen in a horror movie and you have a masterpiece.Theres only two horror films with the ability to give me sleepless nights. One is The Exorcist, the other is Black Christmas. Essential.",

            "content": "I think it is fascinating that 'Black Christmas' very clearly precedes the embodiment of the slasher genre (which began officially with 'Halloween' in 1978) yet so-called film critics often fail to acknowledge this fact. Although I did not find the movie to be 100% satisfying, it was certainly an original piece of work at the time it was released and therefore  deserves to be credited with being a major influence on such horror classics as 'Halloween', 'When a Stranger Calls' and 'Scream' among many others. In relation to the film itself, on the positive side it was atmospheric, undeniably creepy (the telephone calls are probably the most frightening ever filmed)and was free of the usual sex and extreme gore which often spoils such pictures. The abortion angle was also an intriguing and surprisingly adult issue to embrace in a movie of this type. In addition, it was endowed with a strong cast, making it interesting to see at least four reasonably well known actors appearing in what amounts to a fairly low budget shocker. Olivia Hussey seems an unlikely actress to appear in a film of this kind given some of her other roles, but her off-beat casting works very well. Margot Kidder made a star making impression to follow her effective performance in Brian De Palma's 'Sisters'(1973)and John Saxon got to play the police man role which he seemed to then enjoy repeating in other subsequent horror outings (i.e; 'Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Blood Beach' etc). However, I did not think that Keir Dullea was entirely well cast in the role of the boyfriend. He is certainly a talented actor with a gift for playing intense and even unbalanced parts but he seemed wasted here. He also appeared too old for the 20-something character he was representing. (I believe Mr Dullea was around 38 years of age when the movie was made). Other criticisms are that the film was a mite too slowly paced, and it was also highly improbable, especially in that the killer remained undiscovered for so long. Finally, I found the end to be a silly disappointment and rather succeeded in diminishing the overall effect of the film by its lack of any adequate explanation/conclusion to events. (However,to be fair,this is true of many horror films). Generally speaking, 'Black Christmas' is a reasonably effective shocker of its kind which will certainly appeal to fright fans (like me)and has deserved more attention over the years for being such an inspiration to future horror classic horror  (although I doubt if anti-horror film purists would agree with this credit).",

Plot twists, this is before call trace and shows the age of this film, where they have to wait to trace the caller and find out he is calling from the house. I could see this one coming right from the get go.  The comic relief is awful, the 70's must have been the I don't care rude and crude generation that reflects today's social decay.  The swearing, perverseness, drinking, and rude comments had a shock humor element then, but in today's Jenny Jones, Jerry Springer society make one's eyes roll.  It seems in that era of filming everyone has to yell, for many of us who work customer service just find it idiotic, not funny, or even amusing. (explains why so many disgruntled customers have the 70's styled mustaches, leather vests and boots). I work at the Post Office and see this daily, and with my experiences with unbalanced people I find the caller's messages scary.  They must have experience with these phone calls or studied mental illnesses. The caller rants, rambles, repeats himself, and goes on a senseless tangent. A different sense of reality.  Everyone in this film has a problem, the drinking bit is too much, and builds little character development.  The unbalanced boyfriend ending, and the cops too stupid to check the rest of the house is a little too much. 6/10",

There are a handful of times that you wish things would speed up but perhaps Bob Clark is just building the suspense, because once things begin to happen you'll be far more ensnared than you'd otherwise be.The story concerns a sorority house where the girls receive prank calls from a psycho. When Clare (Lynne Griffin) goes missing, her father (James Edmond) shows up to locate her. Since Clare didn't make it home her sorority friends grow more concerned with the obscene caller and wonder if he is to blame for Clare's disappearance. But Clare's loss is just the beginning as the girls get picked off one-by-one.STORY: $$$$ (The script is really quite strong. Characterization is not forfeited for blood and guts in this tight little slasher. Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea play a couple who bicker over her pregnancy, Margot Kidder is a lush who seems to be following in the footsteps of their alcoholic house mother Marian Waldman. You will like these characters. Suspense is in large supply as well. Director Bob Clark has a knack for placing you on the edge of your seat and then giving said seat a swift kick at the right time to jar your senses).ACTING: $$$ (The acting is generally strong along the board. Genre favorite John Saxon is terrific as usual in the role of the town sheriff but he is upstaged in the acting department in his own precinct by Doug McGrath as Sergeant Nash. McGrath masterfully portrays the rube desk sergeant who is the butt of every joke. The scene where Margot Kidder leaves him the sorority house' phone number is a riot! Keri Dullea is effectively pompous as Olivia Hussey's emotional unstable boyfriend and Miss Hussey shines as the mother hen even though she opts not be a mother. Art Hindle, man-fur and all, does a fine job as Clare's jock boyfriend while Margot Kidder gives one of her best performances as the crass Barb).NUDITY: None",

            "content": "Canadian director Bob Clark's Black Christmas (1974) gets a lot of love these days from many horror fans who cite it as the inspiration for John Carpenter's classic, Halloween, and some even claim it to be the original slasher film\u0097the one that started the sub-genre that spawned not just Michael Myers but countless other masked maniacs. Whilst I am not in total agreement with them (Mario Bava's Bay Of Blood, for example, follows the body count style of the genre and was made in 1971), I do agree that this film must have been highly influential on Mr.Carpenter, who obviously modelled some of his film's scenes on Black Christmas's best moments (although Halloween is still the superior movie, in my humble opinion).Clark sets his seminal shocker in a sorority house during the Christmas holidays, where a group of young women are killed one by one by a crazy, ranting maniac who has also been scaring them with a series of sick telephone calls. Starring Keir Dullea, Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and cult movie favourite John Saxon, the film has no shortage of talent in the acting department, and Clark delivers quite a few stylish directorial flourishes that really help to crank up the tension.From the get go, Black Christmas introduces plot elements and visual techniques that were to become a staple of stalk 'n' slash movies for years to come: creepy POV shots; the careful framing of shots to reveal movement in the background; the killer's heavy breathing on the soundtrack; the final victim frantically fleeing from the maniac (after having discovered the mutilated bodies of her friends). We also get to see where When A Stranger Calls (1979) got its 'We've traced the call... it's coming from inside the house' moment from\u0097the exact same thing occurs in Black Christmas!Also particularly effective are the telephone calls made by the maniac; a mixture of unintelligible ranting, guttural moans, violent threats and crude obscenities, they are very unsettling and help convey exactly how demented the (unseen) murderer truly is. Another factor that adds to the creepy vibe of the film is the fact that we never get to find out who the killer is or why he is attacking these seemingly innocent girls. Even at the end, Clark gives nothing away about his identity. By not giving us any background details, or any motivation for his actions, he turns the killer into a 'bogeyman' (another idea borrowed by Carpenter for his movie).Unfortunately, there are also several things that let the film down slightly.Firstly, there is a lack of any really likable characters: Hussey's heroine is rather selfish, Kidder's character is a loud mouthed drunk, and Dullea plays a rather dull and obsessive pianist. Worst of all is the drunken house mother, a nasty woman who thankfully meets a suitably violent end. At least Carpenter had the good sense to make some of his victims a little more likable, thus actually making the audience give a damn about whether they lived or not.Clark also neglects to put in any real scares; creepiness the film has in spades, but genuine shocks are in short supply. And with the few deaths being rather bloodless, the 'yuck' factor is also kept fairly low (unless you find endless shots of a body with a plastic bag over its head particularly nauseating).Lastly, Clark tries to inject some humour into the proceedings, but fails spectacularly: Kidder's weak prank about fellatio is desperately unfunny and the drunken house mother's search for booze is truly cringe-worthy.Black Christmas is a film that all horror fans should see, since it helped to define a whole horror sub-genre, but to say it is better than Halloween is definitely going a step too far.",

It's obvious being made in the mid 70s that the Italian Giallo (POV shots) was popularly used and Bob Clark's earliest entry with Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things also had influence on this film.The innocence of Jess, played by Argentinean Olivia Hussey (real name Olivia Osuna) was perfectly cast opposite of her sorority sisters, like loud-mouthed Barb played by the late Margot Kidder and the outrageous Marian Waldman as the house mother! Supporting actors such cult veteran star, John Saxon and Crononberg's The Brood leading actor, Art Hindle.The rest of the interior location are excellent in creating (although the house is insanely large) claustrophobic and dark. Strong dubbing of the murderer's voice still create a distrubing chill today.Roy Moore wrote this script in his late 20s Bob Clark was not a beginner,he was building a grouping of filmwork. This film precedes the similar plot twists of Halloween and When a Stranger Calls. They are some weak spots in the story but the chill feel of shots, oddly though behind cheerful imagery of Christmas.This is definitely a film that should be seen and appreciate by filmbuffs and horror fans.",

            "content": "The Plot = A group of young college girls decide to stick around they're sorority house for the Christmas holidays, not knowing a mysterious psychopath is hiding in they're attic, making obscene, disturbing phone calls, and that's just the beginning, he eventually proceeds to slaughter the kills one by one in a brutal fashion.Many consider Halloween as the first ever slasher movie but it isn't \"Black Christmas\" is but sadly this gem never managed the popularity \"Halloween\" and remained forgotten for years well until they made that not very good remake last year.Black Christmas was and still is bleak movie that packs a punch and gave me genuine goosebumps from beginning to end. I loved the dark imposing claustrophobic feel, the film handled its now known slasher formula like a freaking pro, tossing our way with full force moments of pure shock, a baffling whodunit, hard hitting plot twists and an expert use of the \"killer is in the house\" motif. The film's firm execution in terms of its conventions. Personally, the element that got under my skin the deepest had to be the killers' phone ramblings. I mean this dude was a hands down, to the core loon. He leaped into these bizarro monologues, taking on different voices (a man, woman, child), going on about things that only he understood while taking the random dramatic pause to slip in a heart felt \"I'm gonna kill you\" in there. What a CLASS ACT! The phone calls butcher boy (or girl) made, established him early on as one crazy mother to be reckoned with and since we never really got to see the lad throughout (apart from his heart warming toying with his victims' cadavers), that turned him into a constant thick cloud of doom spread wide about this tale. You didn't see him but man did you feel him! The acting was top of it's range in this movie Olivia Hussy (Jess) was solid from beginning to end, Keir Dullea (Peter) played his creepy, neurotic part well, I really enjoyed the house mother Mrs Mac she was great and stole every scene she was in, Margot Kidder was the stand out in this movie and brought in some much needed humor as the alcoholic and chain smoking drunk. Actors always come through when they play themselves. Another statement to that rule applied to John Saxon (LT Fuller) who once more played John Saxon...he was wonderful at it as per usual. Doug McGrath (Nash) was responsible for a few straight chuckles as the incompetent cop.Okay the murders may not be gory but they're still nasty and quite brutal like We get a girl being choked by a plastic bag, a semi blood wet stabbing and after the fact damaged corpses. Although not too graphic, the film still hit hard via the viciousness behind its dirty deeds.The directing was top notch Clark set up an unsettling dark mood from frame one, exploiting his creepy setting fully while giving us hints of slick style on the way (loved the killer POV shots and the slow motion). He also liked to inter-cut murder sequences with mundane events which made the scenes quite effective. And I have to give the man extra credit for two things: 1- That very scary shot of the eyeball (you'll know when u see it) killed me and the ending (which I won't dare give away) was brilliant.All in all Black Christmas is a definite cult classic because it's a well rounded horror flick.",

Also known as SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, directed by Bob Clark of PORKY'S fame, this one involves psychotic killer who hides in the attic of a sorority house and starts killing off all the \"girls\", one by one.  \nI say \"girls\" because most of them look over 30 instead of 20, especially Margot Kidder as the slutty one with the foul mouth.  (Check out Brian DePalma's SISTERS if you want to see Kidder in a terrifying role)The film does just fine until the last 15 minutes or so when Olivia Hussey goes upstairs to look for her friends and doesn't follow police instructions to leave the house.  What a dumb bitch.  Anybody who is THAT dumb deserves to be killed.It's also pretty obvious 40 minutes into the film who the killer is, but director Clark tries to pull a fast one at the very end of the film by implying that it's not him.  It looks like Clark wants to have it both ways, casting doubt upon the whole thing and trying to leave it open-ended like he does.  There's no gore being shown and very little blood, making the whole thing look pretty tame by today's standards.   In fact, the only thing missing is the ax-wielding Santa.  But no matter folks, that'll come in a later film.The Critical Mass DVD has filmographies for most of the cast along with a short, uninformative interview with Saxon that doesn't reveal much of anything, and no extras from Bob Clark.  At least not in the DVD version I saw.  Maybe Clark was embarrassed by the whole thing, who knows\u0085  He should be.3 out of 10",

            "content": "Pre-dating what is generally considered the ultimate Slasher film by several years - the original \"Halloween\" - \"Black Christmas\" is a highly-underrated, and amazing horror-slasher flick which would set the standard for practically every slasher film to follow - from the ringing telephones, the 'don't go upstairs', re-hearings and of course a strong female lead.\"Black Christmas'\" strong female lead is the equally underrated Olivia Hussey, whose fantastic accent is a special bonus to her calm and sympathetic character Jessica. While the majority of slasher films all feature a female lead (though there are exceptions like \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2\", \"Prom Night 3: The Last Kiss\" and \"Friday the 13th VI: Jason Lives\" which all have a male lead) not every female lead is as terrific as Hussey's Jessica. (Exceptions being Neve Campbell's Sidney from the \"Scream\" Trilogy, Heather Langenkamp's Nancy from \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", Lar Park-Lincoln's Tina from \"Friday the 13th VII: The New Blood\" and of course Jaime Lee Curtis' Laurie from various \"Halloween\").Jessica's resourcefulness, and cool personality makes her a character that you really care about, and the fact that she has various real life stories going on (abortion for example - something I don't think has been featured in a slasher since \"Black Christmas\") makes her a very likable character. The majority of the characters in \"Black Christmas\" are actually very realistic and likable. Margot Kidder's Barbie provides a lot of the comic relief, but has the most tragic death also. Andrea Martin is excellent as frizzy-haired (though its nice frizzy-hair) Phyllis. John Saxon is always great in his performances, and his role as Lt. Fuller is no exception. Keir Duller does a good job of playing perhaps the most unlikeable, but very realistic, Peter, Jessica's over-bearing and high-strung boyfriend. Marian Waldman is a riot as the house-mother for the sorority girls, Mrs. Mac.The plot, pacing and general story is probably nothing new to anyone who has seen \"Scream\" or \"Halloween\", as previously mentioned, many slashers take a least a note or two from \"Black Christmas\", which does everything splendidly. Great direction, interesting camera angles, a couple of good jump scenes, and then there's the telephone calls...perhaps one of the most disturbing things in all slasher movies.So overall, \"Black Christmas\" is an amazing slasher-horror film, setting the stage for a myriad of followers over the years, but thirty years later, does not seem out-dated or cheesy. Sure, there's not a lot of gore, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. And for the pre-cursor to the likes of \"Halloween\" and \"Scream\" to be this good, then it's certainly worth a watch, even if just to watch for all the things in the film that will eventually become standard conventions in slasher films.",

Clark used a lot of vetern film making tools to add a lot of depth and mystery to this film. The story was very fresh, original, and stays on track with great pacing. Black Christmas was not only a Christmas classic, but sparked a lot of influence towards John Carpenter's Halloween, Wes Craven's Scream, and Sean S.

The supportive cast complimented the leads well, because they actually had purpose, unlike most supportive characters in horror and/or Christmas films. I like how Bob Clark made the killer a complete mystery; he didn't even let us see his face! The phone calls and actual physical violence he portrays was vicious, and very creepy.The screenplay by Roy Moore was right to the point, and unfiltered, which I can really appreciate for this kind of film. Some dialogues and scenes got a tad stale, but the screenplay was above average, and carried great merit.There was only a few things that I could really nit pick in this film. The story definitely was original and inspiring to other film makers, but I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a few disposable or dry scenes. Other than that, there's other minor things you could fault, but it's not something that would really bring the rating down.Overall, Black Christmas is a must watch every year before Christmas!

I still feel that the film is an accomplished piece of work and established a structure and screen language that have been much imitated. The characters are intelligent and screenwriter Roy Moore even takes a shot at the abortion issue.The obscene phone calls made by the killer are truly obscene (much use of the word \"c**t\"), and his psychotic rants are rather amusing, if not a little disturbing. The killer's POV, which opens the movie, is effective, and the image of a suffocated victim lurking by a window is a memorable one.The film doesn't scare me, though, or make me uneasy. Perhaps I've seen too many horror films. I can't fault Clark for his direction or Carl Zitter for his atmospheric score, more a soundscape than a traditionally structured series of compositions. I simply found the film a bit slow the last time around.Clark's \"Deathdream\" is one of my favorite horror films of all time (see my review), and it was made before \"Christmas\". Certainly, \"Christmas\" is a larger scale production, but, for me, it does not possess the intimacy of \"Deathdream\" and the sense of crawling horror. It plays more like a mystery than a horror film and lacks the tragedy that made \"Deathdream\" so effective. Bob Clark may have thought so, too, because \"Christmas\"'s score sounds exactly like \"Deathdream\" (same composer), there is a creepy rocking chair (like the one \"Andy\" used in Deathdream\"), and the house exteriors look like the house exteriors in, yes, you guessed it, \"Deathdream\".Still, a very good movie, but not, for me, a horror classic.",

            "content": "Black Christmas, also known as Silent Night, Evil Night (the title they initially gave it for the first American screenings so movie-goers wouldn't mistake it for a blaxploitation film), is generally considered to be one of the first classic slasher flicks, and apparently even had a hand in inspiring John Carpenter's Halloween. But you might know director Bob Clark from a very different Christmas movie - one that will probably be playing on at least one 24-hour loop on some basic cable channel this week - A Christmas Story.It's a shame that this movie didn't get the recognition it deserved at the time, but it has gone on to become a cult horror film in the years since. It's smart, well-acted, wonderfully shot, terrifying, and even genuinely funny at times.** SPOILERS! **I knew I was in for a treat during the opening shots, moving seamlessly between the inside and outside of the beautiful sorority house and showing POV shots of the mysterious killer making his way around the home (I especially loved the shot of him climbing the trellis). There's a great theme throughout of happy, celebratory, or even just mundane things going on in the house while the killer lurks within... super creepy. I think the whole \"Babysitter and the Man Upstairs\" legend in general is TERRIFYING so the use of it was great - it's one thing to know that the threat is outside trying to get in, but what about when you're locking it inside with you? The search party coming by and almost cheerfully reminding the girls to \"just keep your doors and windows locked and you'll be safe!\" was a chilling reminder.The phone calls were surprisingly scary - and surprisingly vulgar. The killer's alternating between multiple voices/personalities, seeming to scold himself at times, crying, screaming... the calls became more and more frenzied and his incomprehensible fury makes him unrecognizable as even a human threat. There's no way to know his background, his motives, which makes him terrifying in a much less tangible way. We can't relate to him, we can't see our own pain or shortcomings in his motivation, which makes him completely unpredictable and alien.I enjoyed that, aside from the (possibly unrelated?) girl being killed in the nearby park, the main characters don't have any idea that murder is afoot until it's too late. The victims themselves have NO idea, but even Jess (Olivia Hussey) has no indication that anyone has been killed until she finally swings Barb's bedroom door open in the last 15 minutes or so - we're the only people privy to that information.Speaking of which, the kills - surprisingly few, really, considering its status as a slasher film - are all creative and well done. There's no lingering on blood spurting from knife wounds, no over-exaggerated looks of horror that go on for too long, no shirts being ripped open for no reason besides showing a hint of breasts. They're quick and effective but still fun. My favorite is probably Barb being stabbed with her own crystal unicorn grabbed from behind her bed - shot beautifully and the juxtaposition of Jess listening to a young choir singing carols downstairs is just awesome - but the image of Clare in the rocking chair with the plastic garment bag sucked into her mouth is classic for a reason. That reveal definitely got a gasp from me, and the occasional return to the attic - showing his hand rocking the chair her corpse sat in, or her cat innocently licking the bag she was contained in - was a cruel reminder that the search for her was hopeless.There's no denying that there's a strong feminist undertone to the whole film - or, really, far less subtle than that. This movie taking place in the early 70's - and just a year after Roe v. Wade was decided - is important context for its content. Women being terrorized by a dominating and violent male presence is par for the course for countless horror and slasher films, but it feels more relevant here, more close to home. Barb's murder being the most intimate - taking place in her own bedroom, practically in the throes of sleep, with one of her own belongings - was no accident considering we saw her crassness offend multiple male authority figures (Clare's father and a local sergeant, most obviously, but she fights back - verbally anyway - against the crazed prank caller, too).In addition to the more direct threat of the looming killer, we have more pervasive examples of men attempting to silence women in a variety of ways. The bumbling sergeant first ignoring Clare going missing because she's probably shacked up with some guy and then ignoring the prank calls because it's \"probably one of your boyfriends playing a joke\". Clare's father is basically just walking disapproval throughout the entire movie, turning his nose up at Mrs. Mac's language, posters around the sorority house, and Barb's attempts to be humorous in her slurred, drunken state.And, more directly, there is Jess informing her boyfriend, Peter (Keir Dullea), in no unclear terms that she is pregnant with his child and seeking an abortion. Again, the freshness of Roe v. Wade in American society informed his hateful response - \"don't you think about anyone but yourself\", and later \"let's get one thing straight: you are not going to abort that baby\". He's outraged at the idea that she dare make a decision about her own body without his express approval, and is pushed further into his own spiral of deflecting blame when she rejects his very matter-of-fact marriage proposal. He's belligerent to the point of being rightfully suspected as the killer - especially after seeing him destroy that piano after his unfavorable recital.The irony of such gruesome acts being carried out during what is supposed to be the happiest, coziest time of year is constant but not obnoxiously so - it's more something that we notice rather than something that is being told to us, if that makes sense. The warm glow of the colored Christmas lights, the metallic tinsel on the wreaths, the campus emptying out as people scurry off to see their families... it all feels incredibly nostalgic until we remember there's a goddamn psychopath holed up in the attic.Which leads us to the ending, which is amazingly dark, even for a horror flick. There is so often some kind of humanization of the villain, or maybe a dramatic standoff between the final survivor and the killer. We almost get that, or at least we think we might, when Jess is cowering in the basement after Peter smashes his way in. When the police find her slumped over with a dead Peter on top of her, we think there's a chance - albeit small - that the nightmare is over. Jess has not only defeated her would-be killer, but she's defeated this domineering male presence that is trying to control her. But as the camera pans away from her, sedated in bed, and glides by the attic - mumbling and giggling echoing off the walls - and eventually outside, we hear the phone ringing and ringing as the credits roll, and we're reminded that evil often does prevail.Ultimately, a brilliant and sorely under-appreciated film. Go watch it now, get into the Christmas spirit!",

There is not a lot in common between the two movies that I can think of: madman killing people, heavy breathing/mysterious killer and nice POV camera work. I liked the POV in this movie, but it wasn't as effective as in Halloween because we see from the killer perspective before he commits a murder, therefore there was not really any suspense in those scenes, since we know where the killer is. In Halloween, the POV is used to create suspense when the killer is prowling, but it's not used before the murders, the fear of the unknown is what works best for me in those cases.Also, some people seem to think this movie invented POV in horror movies or the slasher flick. This is far from the truth, people should check some of Mario Bava's work or Peeping Tom. It was still an interesting stepping stone for the genre, but nothing innovative.Still, I found the first half chilling and interesting, but after a few murders, the movie became a little tedious because of the dumb script and predictable plot in the second half. Still, this movie gave me some chills in the first 30 minutes, I liked the bleak ending and the nice camera work and atmosphere, so it all adds up to a superior horror movie, well worth seeing but not quite a classic.7/10",

            "content": "Black Christmas is set in a girls sorority house around Christmas, one of the girls Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) is spending the festive season with her father at home but is brutally killed in her room before she meets up with him. The next morning & her dad (James Edmond) raises the alarm & contacts the police who organise a search where they find the dead body of a young child, meanwhile the sorority house has been receiving obscene phone calls which they tell the police about. Lieutenant Fuller (John Saxon) decides all the clues point the the sorority house with very good reason as there's a killer on the loose inside...This Canadian production was produced & directed by Bob Clark & I have to say I think Black Christmas is vastly overrated, considered by some to be the very first slasher film ever made I'd personally say it's more of a thriller although I can see why some would say that. The script by Ray Moore is very serious & tries to build tension up & remain quite taught but I have to say I was pretty bored by it. It takes ages to do anything & then we get the god awful ending, some people complain about horror films not having much of a story & Black Christmas would almost certainly give those people more ammunition as the killer is never seen, the killer's motives are never revealed neither is the basic question of who he is. I'm sorry but even Jason Voorhees & Freddy Kruger had back stories, at least they had some sort of motive no matter how flimsy it was while here in Black Christmas there is nothing. Some may like the ambiguity & sure it works well enough for most of the film but I'd have liked some sort of pay-off, some sort of explanation, some sort of twist, some sort of story behind the killer & a proper ending, you see Black Christmas doesn't so much as end as just stops. On the plus the plus side it's watchable, the character's are good & more human than in a lot of horror films although for me that's just not enough to want to sit through 100 minutes of this again.Since it was Chritsmas Day only a few days ago Black Christmas was an appropriate film to sit down & watch last night & director Clark does a really good job here & the films best asset is it's atmosphere & style, there are some great point-of-view shots from the killer's perspective & there's definitely a creepy chilly atmosphere to it. The film looks quite gritty & is far less glossy than the average Hollywood flick which helps it as well but despite some good visuals & a nice dark atmosphere I still didn't like the story & that's what really sinks Black Christmas for me. The body count is low & there's absolutely zero gore. Was it just me or did anyone else have problems understanding the obscene phone calls? I mean the guy speaking sounding like he was doing a bad Donald Duck impression! The ending doesn't work either on a factual level, the cops wouldn't leave Jessica alone in the house after what she had just gone through & considering what had just taken place they wouldn't have left the house anyway let alone not even bother searching the attic.Technically the film is well made & is pretty impressive, shot on location in Toronto, Ontario in Canada. The acting is fine, the likes of Kier Dullea, Ovlia Hussey, Margot Kidder & genre favourite John Saxon put in good performances.Black Christmas is considered by some to be the very first slasher film ever made which I can see why while other's claim it's the best slasher ever made which I can't agree with at all as I think it's one of the most overrated, I'm not saying it's a bad film by any stretch of the imagination it's just one that I personally didn't like & can't see why so many people do despite their reasoning. Remade by Hollywood as Black Christmas (2006) which I actually prefer as it has more of a story.",

Not only do these work against the tone of the piece, they also distract from the main plot. The plot itself is so tedious that we have to wait until the last twenty minutes for the police to work out the killer's been in the house all along... something we were shown from the very beginning. This irritating game of catch-up is only expounded upon by the \"twist\" ending, which must be obvious even to an amoeba, and a hundred times more obvious to anyone who's seen that particular episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.To make matters worse, when this movie was shown on American TV they changed the name to Stranger In The House. Wow, what a sensible network decision that was! I wonder if the same network changed the name of Citizen Kane to It's His Sled and Planet of the Apes to It's Earth All Along Really, You Know. This is not even to mention the classic character stupidity, with Olivia Hussey being told to leave the house by the police. So does she get out and leave? Guess.

            "content": "Say 'Slasher Film' and most people will probably say 'Scream', 'Friday the 13th', or 'Halloween'\u0085what's more, most will probably be referring to the franchises each of these has spawned rather than have a particular movie in mind. The fact that (despite the inevitable and tired re-make) most people don't know about/haven't seen 'Black Christmas' is certainly criminal as in terms of chills, suspense, and quality of filmmaking it is far ahead of virtually every other film in the slasher genre. What's more, 'Black Christmas has the prestige of being (after respectful nods have been made towards 'Silent Night. Bloody Night' and some Italian gialli) the film which kick-started the genre.As befitting a slasher film, the set-up will be familiar: a group of teenagers, here composed of a group of Sorority girls and a few boyfriends, are picked off one-by-one by a maniacal killer. In addition, other slasher tropes like the menacing phone-calls-coming-from-inside-the-house, the holiday theme, and the (kind of) final girl really do put most viewers in a state where surprises are not to be expected. However, 'Black Christmas' certainly raises itself above the imitations that followed in presenting a realistic and engaging atmosphere which captures the suspense of what is, when looked at without cinematically desensitized eyes, a scary idea: a mentally deranged person killing without apparent motive. The realistic touch comes from the pared down direction which is reminiscent (or should that be prescient?) of Carpenter's approach in Halloween, the time taken to build up a relationship with the characters, the absence of over-the-top Tom Savini-style \"kills\" (which have the effect of distancing the viewer from the fact that someone has died), and a thankful absence of the strained conservative moral message that teenagers should listen to adults and avoid drugs and sex before marriage etc.It is a wonder this film is not more widely recognised. I believe it is due to the fact that it doesn't present us with a tangible figure of fear like Myers, Voorhees, Freddy, the Fisherman, or Ghostface etc who, even though masked, nonetheless localise and personify fear and in doing so suggest ways to combat it. In contrast, 'Black Christmas', apart from a startling eyeball shot, offers us nothing to hang our fear (and our consumerist franchise fetishes) on. As such, while 'Black Christmas' and its killer may not have entered the pop-culture lexicon, this has meant that the film has retained its power and sense of discomfort and maybe, like the killer, the film belongs in the periphery where most people don't look.",

            "content": "It would be an exaggeration to suggest that \"Black Christmas\" gave birth to the slasher genre. It is, however, without any doubt one of the best of the early examples of the genre, and it's very obvious that it provided at least some inspiration to what I would still consider to be the absolute best of the genre - John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" which came out a few years later. Carpenter (at least in his first Halloween film) learned a lesson from \"Black Christmas\" that a lot of later slasher films forgot - the \"horror\" isn't in blood and gore and overly and unnecessarily graphic violence, and you don't need naked young women to keep people watching! There are no naked young women in this (although there's sexual content in the phone calls) and \"Black Christmas\" actually contains surprisingly little blood and gore. Really there's only one scene - the only murder that's actually depicted, and certainly by modern standards it's not particularly graphic. The film creates its horror and suspense through the use of atmosphere and setting - and by letting the viewers in on what's happening from the start. We may not know who the killer is, but we know that the killer is in the house - which makes this all the more suspenseful, because at literally any moment of any scene set in the house, something could happen. That really very little does happen only heightens the expectation.The story revolves around a sorority house just before Christmas. As the movie opens, while a party is going on inside, a stranger (whom we never see) climbs the side of the house and gets into the attic. We're than introduced to the fact that the girls in the house have been getting a series of creepy obscene phone calls. The story builds from there as the first girl is killed, and while it takes a while for anyone else to die, that sets the stage for a truly creepy movie watching experience. The ambiguous open ending also provided obvious inspiration for later similar films that left similar open and ambiguous endings, but perhaps kept returning to the well too often.The cast is pretty decent. Apparently the producers tried to recruit some pretty big name people for this (I understand, for example, that Bette Davis was approached to play the role of the house mother) but couldn't get them. In the end, we got early film appearances from people who became fairly recognizable in later years, especially Margot Kidder, who played the drunken Barb. This is certainly deserving of recognition as an influential film that helped in the rise of a genre that has sadly now often chosen to focus on blood and gore more than story. (7/10)",

            "content": "Now this is what a slasher flick should be. Four years before the unprecedented success of John Carpenter's landmark American horror film \"Halloween\" in 1978, there was this little gem from Canada called \"Black Christmas,\" directed in 1974 by the late Bob Clark (\"A Christmas Story,\" my #4 favorite film of all time and Clark's possible anti-thesis to this film), and was arguably the first true slasher film (1974 was also the same year that American filmmaker Tobe Hooper directed the landmark \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\").\"Black Christmas\" is an expertly directed horror film, there's no question about that. The story is incredibly simple, yet stylishly executed. It's deliberately and excellently paced by Bob Clark, who skillfully injects the film with a wicked sense of dread from the get-go, undercut with some slickly timed dark humor (a lot of which is actually quite hilarious). Said humor is appropriately biting and deserves some well-placed laughs but unlike most movies to mix comedy and horror, \"Black Christmas\" doesn't sacrifice one for the other. In other words, what starts out as a serious thriller doesn't devolve into a mindless, gore-filled slapstick comedy (like \"Evil Dead II,\" which I love by the way). First and foremost, this is a horror film - a seriously effective and scary one at that.Upon having watched \"Black Christmas,\" there's no doubt in my mind that John Carpenter and company watched this film at least once (and took some very, very good notes) and it most definitely played a hand in influencing the directorial style of \"Halloween\" (although it's widely known that Alfred Hitchcock's landmark 1960 thriller \"Psycho\" had the most influence on \"Halloween\"). (Even though I've never uncovered any information pertaining to this claim, anyone who watches \"Black Christmas\" and then re-watches \"Halloween\" will see some of the elements that undoubtedly influenced the latter film. I love \"Halloween,\" by the way, and having this information on-hand makes me appreciate both films even more as seriously scary horror flicks.)What makes \"Black Christmas\" such an important staple in the horror genre is that a lot of the slasher movie elements that most likely first appeared in this film were later used, and popularized, by \"Halloween\" just four years later down the road. Most importantly, is the fact that many times throughout the picture, the film is shown from the point-of-view of an unseen killer. We many times see his actions as he goes about the prowl for potential victims, in this case the residents of the Pi Kappa Sig sorority house. We also hear his breathes as he stalks the house sisters, and he is always that unseen-but-always-felt presence in the room, like something horrible is lurking just out of sight in the shadows.The women of the Pi Kappa Sig house are preparing to leave for the Christmas holidays, but a few - Jess (Olivia Hussey), Barb (Margot Kidder), Phyl (Andrea Martin), and house mother Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) - decide to stay behind. However, someone has been making obscene phone calls to the house and scaring the living daylights out of the women. And it isn't long before the unseen presence begins to systematically eliminate the women in some particularly gruesome and creative ways. It's up to the police, led by Lt. Fuller (John Saxon), to try to find this psycho before he kills anyone else.Even though \"Black Christmas\" does feature some particularly gruesome and shocking scenes of murder and mayhem, it actually contains very little gore (it's possible that it, like \"Halloween,\" took a few cues from \"Psycho\"), the film still works largely through the power of suggestion - like what you don't see is far more terrifying because your mind allows you to fill in the gaps. Additionally, there's also a very low body count.It's entirely possible that Olivia Hussey was probably the original scream queen, although, like the actress has said herself in interviews included on the 2006 special edition DVD, she actually doesn't do any screaming in the movie. All the characters in this film are three-dimensional and likable, especially Margot Kidder's drunken party-girl Barb. She was probably my favorite character. Kidder, who is probably most famous in the cinematic world for her work as Lois Lane in the \"Superman\" series films - \"Superman II\" (1980) saw her at her best, in my opinion - gets some of this film's best lines and also provides some of the best comedic moments. This is another aspect of \"Black Christmas\" that I find so ingenious: to create so many likable characters so it's much more tragic when the Unseen Killer begins offing them. It's just a shame that its many, many like-minded imitators (or even its 2006 remake) over the years didn't follow the same pattern.\"Black Christmas\" is a film that I've wanted to see for a long time. All the good things I've heard about it are true. This is one scary fright flick that helped give birth to a new sub-genre of horror, and later influenced \"Halloween,\" \"Friday the 13th\" (1980) and my favorite slasher flick of all time, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984). It's also pretty funny, which admittedly, I was unprepared for, and made my appreciation for this film even greater. But make no mistake, the first order of business in \"Black Christmas\" is horror, and scaring the living daylights out of you, which it does in spades with suspense, easily identifiable and memorable characters (especially Margot Kidder - go, Margot!), Bob Clark's sharp direction, and minimal gore. So don't let its imitators fool you. \"Black Christmas\" is one holiday-themed horror film that has you re-thinking those yuletide celebrations.I dare you to watch it alone.10/10",

The audience witnesses one of the girls, preparing to leave, becoming a victim of the killer, and her disappearance is what sets off the mystery. Marian Waldman, as the dipsomaniac house mother, steals the film, obviously emulating veteran comic Patsy Kelly with her boisterous manner. Then there's John Saxon as the police lieutenant, perplexed by the incompetence of his sergeants and doing his best to solve the mystery.The young Margo Kidder is very funny as an extremely sarcastic and foul mouthed student, very sexually graphic in her manner and not someone who will be told to act like a lady. Ironic, it's the sweet looking hussy who is pregnant out of wedlock, threatening to get an abortion and threatened by her boyfriend who is against it. The young Andrea Martin, long before she became famous for her comic portrayals and show stopping stage roles, is their nerdy friend, staying put even though there is danger around.This is one of those films I have avoided watching simply because I don't think that the holidays should be exploited like this but I did find this much better once I got into it. Taking it several steps beyond the TV movie thriller very popular at this time especially those surrounding sorority girls in jeopardy, this manages to take a rather exploitive premise and makes it gripping. It's not the gore that becomes scary. It's the frightening phone calls with sound effects and screams that will really keep you on edge. I may not wrap this up to put it under my Christmas tree, but I am glad that I did not avoid watching it when the opportunity came around.",

Christmass vacation has just started in this small college town(actually Toronto!) so most of the girls have left the sorority house leaving few behind.At the beginning of the film we see some unknown person climbing up into the house. This,of course, is the killer. The girls start to receive very disturbing phone calls(from inside the house!). This guys voice still gives me the creeps. The girls are not threatened at first. They think it is just some sicko pervert(sorority houses probably get a lot of calls like that!)but the calls get more violent and numerous. Eventually,the girls start to come up missing. When the dead body of a young girl is found in a nearby park, they get downright scarred.This movie has a great cast and a great sense of style. Olivia Hussey was a classic 70's beauty(she became popular after doing Romeo and Juliet). She add class to this movie. Margot Kidder is hilarious as the raunchy fowl mouthed Barbie. That fellatio joke is classic! This movie has some very funny moments but it does not distract from the horror. John Saxon, horror movie icon, plays the police detective. Kier Dullea(from 2001: a space odyssey)plays his rather dry self but it is adequate for the part.We never see the characters face in this movie. It is the atmosphere and the sense of unknown that makes this movie scary. This movie has no real gore yet it has some of the best death scenes in horror. Wait till you see how Margot Kidder dies, it is rather unique! The first girl that he kills he does so by suffocating her in a plastic bag. He then sticks her up in the attic. She is shown from time to time in the the attic on a rocking chair---creepy! This movie also has a creepy ending.This film is one of the greats of the horror genre yet it seems to be often overlooked. The problem might have been timing. It was made right after The Exorcist and and the same time as Texas Chainsaw. I think it got overshadowed by both of these films. No doubt it had a huge influence in the slasher sub-genre that would continue with Halloween and Friday the 13th. Bob Clark is a rather diverse director.

            "content": "The movie starts out with a prowler/killer approaching the Phi Kappa Sigma Sorority house. The girls are throwing a Christmas party, they have no idea that a stranger has gotten into the house. Later that night, they start getting strange phone calls from a guy using 3 different voices. One is a perverted voice, the other Billy; and someone named Agnes. Barb( Margot Kidder) answers the phone, and she just laughs it off like who cares. Claire ( Lynne Griffin) who is leaving for the break to meet her father, doesn't take it lightly, leaves to finish packing upstairs. While packing she is suffocated with a plastic bag, and taken up to the attack. When Claire's father comes the next day and explains she didn't show up; red flags are raised. Jess( Olivia Hussey) gets Barb, and Phil(Andrea Martin) to file a report at the police department. The first time they go the Desk Sgt. Nash( Doug McGrath) doesn't take it seriously. When a girl is murdered in the park close by and the calls are still happening, Lt Ken Fuller(John Saxon) gets involved. The calls still come and this time they seem personal like only someone close to her would know.Jess, has her own problems, especially how will she tell her boyfriend Perter(Keir Dulla) she's pregnant. She goes to the conservatory, and tells him she wants an abortion. When she tells him he flips, he is high strung and orders her around. He's control freak who is threatening; and could go off like a firework . When Jess gets back she gets another call, and it sounds so much like Peter; that it's chilling. Peter is weird he sneaks in the house to take a nap, and approaches Jess like a creep. When I first saw this movie I thought Peter was the killer, but who's Billy? While watching this movie I notice that the killer wears the same clothes Pete wears. I also think he and the killer look alike, i.e. when Barb gets killed the killer resembles him to a T. I do think he made some of the calls from the upstairs phone; because he was in the house at the time she receive one.That one she got got the phone company involved. When Jess was on the phone to the police Peter started down the stairs. Jess had no idea he was there; and too me that's a little unnerving.When a tap is put on the line on the two phones downstairs. Lt Fuller and lineman Graham(Les Carlson) tells Jess in order to catch the person, she needs to keep them on the line. Phil has a talk with Jess before she goes to bed. Jess thinks it could be Peter, but isn't sure. Phil gives her some advice, then goes to bed. Ten minutes later a call comes in, and they get the location. Sgt. Nash phones Lt. Fuller and tells him the calls are coming from inside the house. When Nash calls Jess and tells her the news, she warns Barb and Phil. When she discovers they have been murdered, and the killer is still in the room. Jess fights back and escapes to the basement. It's about two minutes later, Peter shows up and knocks on the basement window. He eventually gets in, but Jess doesn't trust him. She ends up killing him with a fire poker. Afterwards when they find Jess, people in the background think he is the killer or is he? I loved this movie especially the joke on Sgt. Nash. One thing this move has in it is a little comic relief, especially the Fellatio joke on Nash. There were others, but that one had me going for awhile.I didn't see this movie until after the re-make came out, the original is always the best. Too me I think there could have been two killers Peter and Billy. Peter was just so creepy, and was always around when someone was killed. The whole sneaking in the house to take a nap; WTF-WHO DOES THAT/? This is a fact, this movie is a must see. If this movie doesn't give you the creeps, check your pulse.",

The atmosphere is creepy and builds tension, the characters are developed, there is even a marginal attempt at humor, but ultimately I was disappointed. My biggest objection is the unresolved ending. I realize this begs for a sequel, but the story is so simple, that a second film really has nowhere to go. Another problem is the movie is very claustrophobic, with the camera constantly tracking the unseen killer throughout the sorority house. John Saxon seems wasted and his screen time insufficient. \"Black Christmas\" would make a superior short, but at 98 minutes, it is way too long for such slight material. - MERK",

But finally, the killer just does not create the same sense of doomsday that Michael Myers does.All in all, an entertaining and early slasher film for which it deserves credit, but it's not the opus that some reviewers would have you believe.",

            "content": "Black Christmas isn't the horror film that started it all. In fact, it isn't even perfect horror to begin with, however, it's certainly one not to be missed. Directed by Bob Clark, creator of the childhood comedy A Christmas Story, Black Christmas is undeniably a somewhat agitated and graphic film for the time it was made. It features above marginal acting as well from Margot Kidder, John Saxon, Keir Dullea and Olivia Hussey. The film has a great advantage though of good acting by the female leads played by Kidder and Hussey and there isn't a lot of gore, which proves Clark relies on good Hitchcokian suspense to scare, making the film not to be hampered by typical gatutus sex, nudity, gore, or sleaze.The story is about an obscene phone caller that dials up a sorority house. Finally the police trace the calls... and he's in the house!!!! Along the way, Black Christmas has the sorority girls go vanishing one by one. Still they don't really get it, going about their drunken holiday revelry without a care. The movie has several very interesting plot twists, but perhaps for new viewers it's now predictable and sometimes frustrating, such as the entire concept that we never really see the killer, who hides in the attic the entire time. Suspicions are cast on the crazy-boyfriend-as-a-potential-suspect (Dullea) of the coed (Hussey) that survives the longest, but his creepiness is never fully explored.Overall, while Black Christmas is innovative but made a strong attempt at suspense and terror, it would easily inspire many latter-day horror movies like Student Bodies, When a Stranger Calls, Silent Night, Deadly Night, Halloween, just to name a few, its progeny wouldn't always improve on the formula. Highly recommended!!!",

This movie may have came out before Halloween, but it's inferior in every possible way to Carpenter's masterpiece. For starters, the amount of plot holes in this film is large. One glaring one being when Billy makes the phone calls and screams at the top of his lungs from supposedly in the house, nobody hears him. I can't fathom that. They must of been deaf. I'm still also confused as to how Billy can make those calls inside the house. How can he dial the same number from a phone inside the same house? Aren't all of the lines connected? Why would the phone ring? It makes no sense to me. I also found it funny how the cops didn't seem to bother checking around the house to find any bodies...as the body upstairs of the first girl murdered is shown at the ending.All and All, I felt this movie was poorly written. It didn't scare me one bit. If anything I laughed multiple times at the bad acting and incoherent rants from Billy. It gets a 4/10 from me, and that's being generous.",

There's no doubt this is the film that started all the 'stalk and slash' films and it's clear to see this film's influence on Halloween and while I respect this film a lot I really can't say I enjoyed all of it. There are some really great moments scattered throughout the film but at the same time I feel there are some pretty slow moments. The greatest thing is the terrific atmosphere that Clark's able to build from the terrific opening scene. I liked that fact that Clark went for atmosphere over gore and the final thirty minutes are full of suspense. The problem I have is the first hour, which is just too slow for me. I don't mind a slowly paced film but I thought everything dealing with the search of the missing girl really took away from what was important and that was the killer and the phone calls. The performances are better than average and of course there's John Saxon who's always worth watching. Again, the film has a lot of respect from me but there needed to be a few more changes to make it real good.",

            "content": "Before I sat down to watch \"Black Christmas\" (1975) for the first time, director Bob Clark had been two for two with me. I had loved his previous two flicks--the zombie gut-muncher \"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\" and his living-dead Vietnam vet horror comedy \"Deathdream,\" both from 1972--and so was very stoked to see \"Black Christmas,\" a film with a great rep and a loving cult behind it. Now that I have finally seen the film, I'm aware of what this cult has known for decades: This movie, besides being highly influential, is also intelligently scripted, well acted by all, deliberately paced and, ultimately, extremely suspenseful. Concerning a psychopathic nutjob who not only makes obscene phone calls to a sorority house (possibly the creepiest phone calls in screen history; you'll be thanking heaven for modern-day \"caller ID\"), but who also hides in the attic and does some occasional butchering, the film is the template for a raft of more famous slasher flicks that followed. Margot Kidder, Andrea Martin and especially the gorgeous Olivia Hussey (I just love the way she says \"Hello\") are all very fine, and John Saxon, here playing a police lieutenant, gets a chance to show how very appealing he can be when NOT playing coldhearted dirtbags. I must confess that the first time I watched this film, the open-ended finale left me a little annoyed (I guess I needed a bit more closure); I didn't mind this ending the second time I watched the picture, however, and even thought it kinda cool and freaky. To make things even better, the \"Special Edition\" DVD that I just watched comes with almost two hours' (!) worth of interviews, plus other features. It is truly a godsend for all members of the \"Black Christmas\" cult.",

            "content": "~Spoiler~ Black Christmas is a mainstay of slasher cinema. It is one of the early films that set the standard for what would come. But if you are going to enjoy the movie, I must warn you of the hype. Black Christmas was said to have been better than Halloween by many people. I had heard this on numerous occasions before watching the film. I should have known that was untrue (Halloween in one of my favorite films). That stigma may have hindered my enjoyment of the movie somewhat. Now, don't let my complaints lead you away from the picture. Regardless of a little over hyping, it is a must-see. I wouldn't say that Halloween is in any way, shape, or form a copy of Black Christmas, but John Carpenter may owe a bit to the film. The opening shots of the film beautifully utilize the POV shots we are used to seeing in countless slasher films. And of course the holiday title is something Bob Clark should be thanked for. What Clark did differently was to break almost every slasher film rule before they were even written. In a normal flick, the people who have sex get it first and the heroine is always virginal. Not so in this case. The first girl killed is the virgin and our heroine is far from virginal: she's pregnant! It is very unconventional and impressive in that regard. Also impressive is John Saxon, as always. The man is a genre icon. Actually, the acting from everyone in the film is superb. I found that to be another surprising factor. But with names like Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, and Art Hindle I should have expected quality performances. My main complaint is the pacing and the ending. The film crawls along a bit before really picking up and the ending isn't justified. I like the fact that the killer does not die and his motives go completely unexplained. I thought that was brilliant. The problem with the ending is that there is no reason why the girl is left alone in that house. Why did everyone just disappear? Shouldn't she have been rushed to the hospital? Much like the ending of Poltergeist (where the family stays in the house one more night), there isn't sufficient enough reason for what happened. But the final shots would have lost their impact without a helpless girl still in the house. So despite a few flaws and its hype of being better than Halloween, I would say you couldn't go wrong revisiting this holiday classic. Avoid the remake AT ALL COSTS!",

            "content": "Random thoughts about this chilling classic: Several years before John Carpenter's wildly overrated Halloween, there was Bob Clark's Black Christmas, quite possibly the best, most underrated horror/ thriller ever produced. Presumably, Carpenter shares this adoration, as Halloween is, at times, a scene-for-scene ripoff.Sweet girl Claire is the first one to be killed in a surprisingly brutal burst of violence by a psycho killer stalking a sorority house at Christmastime. Her dead body, with a plastic coat bag wrapped over her head, is a chilling sight (one which was, unfortunately, revealed on the front cover of the original video box!) Her father then shows up to search for her, around the same time another girl is attacked in the park, and ..... a string of obscene, threatening phone calls plague the missing girl's sorority house.Margot Kidder's character amusingly gives the psycho caller a tongue lashing of his own, before he very calmly states, \"I'm going to kill you,\" and softly hangs up the phone. Chilling and intentionally humorous, not an easy combination to pull off. Indeed, the film's first two thirds are also played largely for intentional humour, to give the audience a chance to breathe in between acts of violence by the unseen killer - which only make his violent outbursts even more shocking.Peter's right eye brightly lit by a lamp, while the rest of his face is largely darkened in shadow, as Jess tells him she's pregnant; then later, we see the killer's left eye brightly lit twice, while the rest of him is in shadows. Silhouette of killer's hair looks similar to Peter, but his clothing is different. Was that director Bob Clark showing us the killer, or providing us with a red herring? And why did Peter go around at the back of the house, and smash his way through the basement window to get to Jess, immediately after the killer was chasing her? Good timing on his part, or incredibly poor timing? One of my favourite scenes has John Saxon's Lt. Fuller walking into a pitch black piano room, silhouetted in the doorway, switching the lights on to see Peter's piano, smashed to bits. Fuller walks toward it in complete silence, and we can see the gears turning over in his mind as he imagines the possibilities of Peter being a violent killer.Strikingly beautiful photography in the wintry setting, and inside the sorority house, is another major asset.Hauntingly beautiful, minimalist music score (which, according to composer Carl Zittrer, was accomplished by lightly strumming wooden forks over piano wire) added to its already odd atmosphere, without distracting from it.I cannot think of anything I would change about this film, nor can I think of any other movie with so many unanswered questions, yet which still contains such a satisfying ending- an ending which still sends a chill down my spine. As we recap the scenes of the crimes, the telephone starts to ring and continues endlessly in the silent night.That ending recap, incidentally, was copied almost identically four years later by John Carpenter in Halloween. A vastly inferior film, in my opinion.",

This are 3 very big firsts, because they have shaped the horror genre very drastically.  So this is like a monument to the whole genre of horror.  Is it worthy of this title?  Yes, it was a very daring, slick movie that was overlooked when it came out, but it has now quickly become a classic.  People are finally recognizing it for what it was.  It isn't fair to compare this movie to Halloween.  Halloween had a much bigger budget, and more polished shooting.  The guys that made Black Christmas didn't have very much to work with, but they still pulled something tremendous off.  The gore is basically non-existant in this film, but there is a fair amount of suspense to it which is a plus to most people. Now what really makes this movie shine is the atmosphere, it is really straight to the point and very dark.  The movie begins immediately, there is no beating around the bush!  And the movie also ends very abruptly leaving you in question at times.  That is another plus.  Basically, all appreciators of the slasher genre should check this movie out, if they haven't done so already.  I don't know if others will enjoy this though, as it doesn't have much else to offer.",

I know, I know...how could this be, how can you be a \"true horror fan\", blah, blah, blah - well kiss my ass, I just never got around to this one (or tons of others that I'm now making an effort to go back and revisit...). So with that out of the way, I'll give you my honest opinion...BLACK Christmas is not a bad film by any means. It definitely deserves it's place as a classic slasher film. But, with all of the similar films that I HAVE seen, although BLACK Christmas is obviously one of the originators, it's still like many of the other films I've seen in the slasher genre - and personally the 70's-80's slasher films are not among my favorite of the horror-genre overall. I prefer the more exploitative films of that time frame as opposed to the suspenseful horror films of the time - so my mid-grade rating of this film is based strictly on my own personal opinion...The long and short of this one is about a psycho that sneaks into a girls dorm and starts making obscene phone calls and picking off the \"tenents\" one-by-one. That's pretty much it.Not necessarily a bad premise - I've seen films work with a lot less, but like I said before, there's not much in BLACK Christmas that I haven't seen before. There is a noticeable lack of gore, which is another gripe of mine with the slasher films of this time-frame (yes, I'm one of those...) and the film dragged in a lot of places. Anyone who is into the classic slashers should definitely check this one out, but I personally just didn't find it as \"scary\" or enthralling as most others - sorry... 6/10",

Normally most horror movies don't do that, it'll get you scared, but don't get to you like Black Christmas did, this movie just gave me everything I could want from a horror film. Those calls were just so beyond creepy, the voice, you knew what was coming to these girls for the holidays and it wasn't going to be peace on Earth. My only problem with this movie... \"Whatever you do... DON'T GO UP THOSE STAIRS!\" said by a policeman, what does the girl do? Oh, she goes upstairs, but I guess we wouldn't have a movie if she did the sensible thing.Some sorority girls are spending their Christmas vacation at the house and are just going to enjoy the holidays together. But after some disturbing phone calls with men heavily breathing, making foul sexual suggestions, and even involving blood curdling screams, the girls have a bit of a scare when the mysterious stranger won't stop calling. Something else has happened, one of the sisters has gone missing, when the girls along with some of their friends try to figure out how these calls and the disappearances of other sorority sisters, the might not want to know where the call is coming from.Black Christmas is a classic and should definitely be watched in the dark, this movie just had me scared and wanting more. It makes you wanna just stay in your room and unplug the phone, we all get prank phone calls at least once, but this is our worst nightmare is when those calls are just more than a mear threat. Olivia Hussy was a great selection, I've only seen her in Romeo and Juliet and the TV mini series IT, I didn't know as a teen she could be so great for a horror movie. Like I said there are some clich\u00e9's that I was a little angry with, but this movie does deliver some good scares and will not disappoint you, it's a true sleepover classic.8/10",

            "content": "\"Black Christmas\" is an important movie for the Horror genre because it generates opinions of all kinds. People might love it or might not find the greatness about it. Many other people haven't even watched it. But something for sure is that the movie is one of the most important moments in Horror history. A killer on the loose terrorizes an all girl Sorority House with obscene/disturbing phone calls. Little do they know that the deranged killer is hiding in the attic. The believed prank calls take another twist when the caller threatens to death one of the girls. To make things worse, a local young girl is raped and murdered by a killer on the loose. Could it be that it's the same man that is making the calls? The first phone call presumes that a girl has been raped because the caller uses obscene language towards a girl's intimate parts and later makes sounds involving a choking. This all happens on Christmas eve! To make things worse, the hider manages to get down the attic and murder one of the sorority girls. This is where hell breaks loose. Then, one by one these girls and their housemother find terrible fates at the hands of the deranged intruder. The calls continue but each time get nastier and scarier. Police traces the calls and find the shocking truth: the calls are coming from inside the house. It seems that the housemother had two different lines in the house. One of the extensions was in the attic, where nobody would ever enter. The attic is filled with old, dusty toys and old furniture. Also, there are photographs that may be from the killer's family. It seems that the killer lived there before it was used as a Sorority House. The atmosphere surrounding Christmas is more than tense. First, the missing girl that later is found dead, then the missing sorority house girl that seems to have vanished from earth but nobody knows that her dead body is wrapped in plastic, sitting on a rocking chair in the attic!. The prime suspect is Peter, the boyfriend of one of the sorority girls. Many clues lead to believe that he's doing the phone calls but nothing is sure. Meanwhile people wonder what's going on, 7 people have been murdered by a mysterious lunatic. A series of events lead to a confrontation with Jesse and the hider from the attic (who's name is believed to be Billy). Will police come before Billy kills Jesse? How will things end in this mysterious situation? Who really is Billy? Watch \"Black Christmas\"'s ending to make your own conclusions. Your brain will have a hard time trying to figure out a satisfactory conclusion. What a fantastic suspenseful, mysterious Horror movie this is. The events are displayed in a suspenseful way that increases the scare factor. There are very tense moments that carry the whole movie. The highlight is the infamous, classic moment of the \"eye in the closet\". That's one of the most frightening moments in Horror history; not because of what's visually displayed, but because what it means for the movie. Also, the phone calls are incredibly disturbing, nerve tensing, and can scare the audience without showing anything. The voices are chilling plus the obscene dialog and yells add more tension to the situations. This is a sui generis movie that has been copied over the years. The acting is perfect. Olivia Hussey delivers a believable, tender, strong, performance as Jesse. She knows really how to scream and how to deal with a maniac. I totally bought it. She was perfect enough to carry the whole film. Special mention for Margot Kidder as the drunk, rebel Babs. She was the comedic part of the movie. Too bad she found such a terrible fate. Keir Dullea plays really good his part as Peter, the paranoid but aggressive boyfriend. The man's acting is powerful. And John Saxon did his all time role perfectly. He can't do wrong. The rest of the cast is great. Marian Waldman and Andrea Martin play supporting roles at perfection. You really feel bad for the characters as you get to know them and generate feelings towards them. The death scenes are perfectly done. There's minimal gore but the scenes are very effective. The glass unicorn death scene is a classic scary moment. As many people know and recognize, BC set the standards for the slasher genre. John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" is obviously inspired on BC. The killer's POV, the score, the Holiday setting, the situations, etc. Carpenter centered his movie on the killer, giving him a personality while Bob Clark used the killer as an element to increase the tense atmosphere. Black Christmas is a perfect Horror movie. First of all (and most important) it is scary, tense, suspenseful and dark. There ain't no room for Christmas miracles or presents. The killer is as menacing as you can get. Probably the most deranged villain on these kind of movies. I wanted though to know more about him but that's what makes this movie great: that you can figure out whatever you want. Your imagination may create a creepier situation that the real one. The ending is great. It leaves too much for your imagination and still is scary. Watch this gem and give it the credit that it deserves because it's one of the most important, influential Horror movies of all time. No room for Christmas songs or Santa Claus, \"Black Christmas\" will send up shivers up your funny bone. Believe all the hype towards it.",

The seasonal slasher went on to leave an impression on John Carpenter, who years later gave us Halloween. So, do I expect to be disappointed with a remake of such am iconic cult classic? It is hard to get excited over teenage slasher films these days, but Glen Morgan reinstalled that excitement. Billy Lenz has just been released from a mental institution and is looking to find his childhood home where he was abused by his mother. However, the house is now occupied by sorority sisters. With the students unaware of the troubled history of the house and a deranged killer seeking revenge, it's a race against time for the college girls to survive.\nAn aspect of this movie that makes it stand out is that it delves into Billy's back story and it gives the film more depth. The sorority sisters each have something different to bring to the table, this makes it easier to get a bond with the characters. As the producers were responsible for films such as Final Destination, I was hoping for gory scenes and I received them. Overall, yes, it is predictable at times, but it is worth the watch and has a decent twist at the end.",

I wasn't expecting a film better than Halloween, as no horror can surpass it, IMO. I WAS expecting a creepy movie with some similar elements, though...and boy did this movie disappoint! The phone calls were nowhere near frightening or unsettling, and they actually made me laugh a few times. There was no build-up before any of the murders...I never once gripped the arm of the sofa, or felt the urge to yell, \"look out, he's in the room!\", which is what makes slashers so enjoyable. Th 'red herring' wasn't a very good one, because, well, WE knew it wasn't him, because we follow the murderer into the house in the very beginning, which made the revelation at the end kind of, erm, pointless. The movies was decently acted, though at times a bit overacted...John Saxon was the best thing about the movie. Overall, I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this 'classic' horror flick. I'll stick to Halloween, and many other look-a-likes, any day of the week. 4/10",

This film is reminiscent of 'Halloween', so now we know where John Carpenter got most of his ideas (heavy breathing, POV shots) from.The main difference between this and 'Halloween' is the fact that the killer is never actually seen in full - the most we ever see of him is his eye peeping through a crack in the door.  The death scenes are also far more inventive - the first girl to die is killed using the plastic surrounding the dry-cleaning in her wardrobe (Michael Myers isn't intelligent enough to do that), and her dead body is glimpsed throughout the rest of the film sitting in a rocking chair in the attic.  The most disturbing aspect of this film, however, is the way the killer rants down the phone (from inside the house!!!! - top that Scream!)- they make no sense at all and serve to make him all the more creepy.The ending of this film is a total shocker, almost totally unexpected!  I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it, but let's just say it'll have you checking all those dark corners in your house for things that go bump in the night!!!I saw 'Black Christmas' over the Christmas period in 2000, when UK TV station Channel 4 decided, in their infinite wisdom, that what the schedules really need at Christmas is a slasher movie.  I'm glad they did show it, as I had never even heard of it before..... which is a bit surprising considering the cast of Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea (post-2001) and Margot Kidder (pre-Superman).If you can find this film in your local video store (probably under the title 'Silent Night, Evil Night'),go ahead and rent it - I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

            "review_title": "Silence is the scariest!",
            "content": "I have often wondered why there are so many bad horror movies these days. Movies that instead of focusing on suspense and real chills, just pour endless amounts of blood in your face, thinking this will do the trick, and hopefully become a cult classic. Film after film, more and more horror movies are becoming increasingly similar, and you can almost guess the whole entire plot of the movie, no more than 10 minutes into the film. Everything in horror these days is all about over the top special effects, numbingly loud thumping music, that is supposed to get you scared. Black Christmas (the original) is (IMO) one of the best and scariest horror movies ever made. Why? you ask. Let me tell you. There are so many reasons. First. In horror today, when someone (usually the pretty girl) is walking towards a door or a room (thinking someone will be there) - and they are. The film makers feel the need to spoil the moment with ridiculously loud music that is (intended) to get you all hyped up for the big surprise. When they don't realise that this spoils 99% of the scene. For instance, 10 minutes into the movie, one of the sorority girls \"Claire\" goes up stairs to her room, to pack some things, preparing for a trip. While entering the room she is greeted by the house cat \"Claud\". While packing, Claire hears a strange meow. At first she just ignores, but the meow gets more and more intense and chillingly creepy. She then notices that the meow is coming from the closet (not far from where she is standing) at the end of the room (and the closet door is open). She paces towards the closet (with a terrified stare) quickly realising that the meow is not coming from the house cat, asking \"Who is that?\" several times. The thing that makes this scene 'GOLD' is while walking to the closet and asking \"Who is that?\" there is no music! - just dead silence. This makes the scene and situation seem more real and 1000 times more scary. The viewers are at the edge of their seat, hanging on to pure silence while she walks further and further to the closet. This is far more terrifying than continuous loud music, that spoils the moment, because you know by the music when the killer is going to approach. That scene is horror at it's best and everyone should see the film for that scene alone. Secondly, the entrance of the movie is shocking. The camera is filmed like a documentary (like the camera is the stalker, walking nearer and nearer to the house) While spying on his victims he realises he is able to climb to the top of the house where he can enter the attic. The directer's captured this amazingly and it gave off that feeling, that raw, real, scare, that this really could happen to anyone. One of the standout scares and scenes that stick in your brain are the chillingly disturbing phone call scenes. The girls receive numerous phone calls from the same man, only there's a catch. It's not your typical Scream phone call were the killer asks \"Are you alone?\" and \"What's your favourite scary movie?\" he talks with himself, displaying what appears to be a severe split personality. The phone calls get more and more scary as the movie goes on. Especially near the end were the killer actually goes crazy portraying more than 4 different voices and characters - the horrific sound of his voice will haunt you after the movie is over (which I guess is great for the Creator, as all the best horror movies make long lasting impressions). The last thing I will say is there are a lot of people, reviewers, saying the end was disappointing because they still don't know who the killer is. Huh? lets get this straight. The killer isn't a person in the movie who is coming across nice, nor is he pretending to be a close friend - in fact he doesn't know any of the girls at all. He is merely a deranged, dangerous man who passed a sorority house and thought it would be fun to hide inside their attic and hack them off 1 by 1. I will not spoil the rest of the movie for those who haven't seen it. All I will say is if you want a great horror movie that when the credits role you will be afraid to walk upstairs, THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU. You will also be staring at your attic door for about a week.",

            "review_title": "BLACK Christmas (1974)",
            "content": "I had read quite a few reviews of BLACK Christmas (1974) before purchasing it, never having watched the film before. I certainly felt elated afterwards that it was very much worth picking up. I am saying this because, having grown up on Alan Frank's book HORROR MOVIES - in which this was not mentioned at all! - I didn't quite know what to expect. It's certainly one of the finest 'slasher' films I have ever watched, not that I can say I'm a rabid fan of this sub-genre.As with most of the landmark horror films of the 1970s, BLACK Christmas was a low-budget production but the film is very well-made and this factor never becomes a problem. The screenplay by Roy Moore was fairly original for its time, though it's since been copied ad nauseam: the mostly young cast does extremely well here - it helps that many were professional actors, making the audience care for the characters' fate - which cannot be said for virtually any of its contemporaries (not even John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN [1978]). Again, it skilfully integrates generous doses of humor to offset the generally high-strung and claustrophobic mood. Tension is admirably built-up and sustained throughout, particularly during the last half-hour. The murder scenes, though not too many in number, are certainly very effective - and thankfully done without the need for extensive use of gore.Technically, the film is also well up to par: Reg Morris' cinematography superbly captures the sinister atmosphere of the house making it a major character in the proceedings, as well as the killer's state of mind through a frequent use of the subjective camera. Expert editing keeps the audience on edge throughout, but it is at its most effective during Margot Kidder's death scene (a veritable Argento moment) and the finale. Carl Zittrer's unusual and largely dissonant score is very unsettling, and another big plus. The killer's attitude reminded me a bit of Andy Robinson's psycho in DIRTY HARRY (1971), and the weird and pretty haunting sounds he makes (the girls themselves dub him 'The Moaner') were probably inspired by Mercedes McCambridge's demon voice in THE EXORCIST (1973) - but they are even more impressive, and scary, for not showing the person making them!The comedy element of this film is worth a special mention: from the posters hung up on the walls of the sorority to Marian Waldman's boozy antics as the contemptuous house mother to Margot Kidder's turtle anecdote during a party and her 'telephone exchange' scene at the Police Station (which, later on, is also beset by a trigger-happy old man who literally shoots one of the officers in the ass!), the film is quite hilarious at times - which, in a film of its type, is not easy to come across and even harder to pull off! Still, BLACK Christmas' most memorable comic foil is Douglas McGrath playing a baffled cop put upon by just about everyone, including his own colleagues and superiors; these scenes are far better handled than the sorry attempts at comedy in Wes Craven's THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972), that's for sure!The leading roles are nicely filled: Olivia Hussey projects more than just beauty as the strong-willed heroine; Keir Dullea essays his relatively difficult role admirably; Margot Kidder is impressive in what she has to do, and probably influenced her later casting as Lois Lane in SUPERMAN - THE MOVIE (1978); John Saxon is suitably commanding as the Police Lieutenant intent on capturing the madman. If there is one thing about the film which I find unsatisfying is the lack of sufficient clarity in the killer's backstory (reminding me of Dario Argento's OPERA [1987] which I have only watched for the first time a couple of weeks ago). I know this was probably done on purpose but, usually in this type of film, all the plot threads are neatly woven by the end - whereas here we rather emerge from the whole enthralling ordeal (echoed, to a certain extent, by HALLOWEEN's conclusion) none the wiser!Much has been said of the film's Original Aspect Ratio. The end titles clearly give this as being shot in Panavision, so I don't know why anyone would prefer to watch it 'full frame'. Actually, once I had watched it I couldn't envision the film in this way, and sure enough the scenes that appear in the documentary are not as effective for this very reason! The DVD supplements are extensive but, all in all, something of a mixed bag: the two Audio Commentaries are very interesting, even though quite a bit of info is repeated verbatim elsewhere on the disc - also, Bob Clark's track (which is fuller than the John Saxon/Keir Dullea one) quite often suffers from poor audio making his comments hard to understand; the three interview segments, two of them with Saxon and another one with Clark, deal with the rest of their work as well as their obvious fondness for BLACK Christmas; though it basically covers all grounds, the documentary disappoints slightly due to the amateurishness of its production (it certainly pales in comparison with Blue Underground's or Laurent Bouzereau's efforts which grace numerous DVD editions of classic films) - still, my favorite bit is the greatly moving anecdote involving Edmond O'Brien's failing health which prevented him from taking the role later filled by John Saxon; numerous trailers and radio spots (narrated by a familiar voice later to play a prominent part in Clark's MURDER BY DECREE [1978]) are great fun, as is the photo gallery which features a good selection of stills, posters and behind-the-scenes shots; finally, the alternate credit sequences and reversible cover art are nice to have, too.The disc also includes a special preview of MURDER BY DECREE by way of its theatrical trailer (which, apparently, is in pretty bad shape!), announcing it to be coming soon on Critical Mass DVD. Does anyone have any idea when this will be released and what supplements will be included - the film is certainly intriguing and Anchor Bay's DVD (that was only released in January) seems to be quite satisfactory, but who knows if it could be improved?Having watched BLACK Christmas, I'm certainly interested in catching up with other Bob Clark horror films, particularly his two earlier efforts - CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS (1972; coming soon on R2 DVD from Anchor Bay UK) and DEATHDREAM (1972; aka: DEAD OF NIGHT).",

            "content": "'Black Christmas' is a 1974 movie directed by Bob Clark and starring Olivia Hussey. Clark had a prolific directing career but would be most well known for another holiday project directing, 'A Christmas Story' in 1983. Keir Dullea and Margot Kidder costar here in a film about a crazed killer picking off girls in a sorority house one at a time. The film was made in Canada for less than one million dollars, and while it received mixed reviews at the time of its release, it has gone on to achieve cult status as well as being labeled one of the best horror movies of all time by some. The film would inspire 2 remakes from 2006 and 2019.Hussey stars as Jess who lives in a sorority house with a bunch of other girls and their house mother. In the film's first scene we witness a figure crawling into the attic. It is Christmas time and there is a holiday party in progress when an obscene call comes in from someone ranting and moaning nonsensically. Following this a girl goes missing although we are witness to her murder. As a search begins for the missing girl when her father arrives the next day our mysterious killer keeps picking off girls one at a time until only our \"final girl\" remains. There is a side story as Jess reveals to her boyfriend she is pregnant and intends on getting an abortion. All the missing girl drama starts happening before the couple can resolve anything, but the police speculate the boyfriend, Peter, played by Dullea, may actually be the killer. All of these elements factors in as the final scenes unfold and the killer attempts to bag the last remaining girl in the house.Despite a few off kilter performances this is actually a pretty well crafted horror movie. It is a very early example of the slasher film, but it does not fall prey to many of the tropes as that sub-genre was still in its infancy in 1974 and had not really developed any standard. The directing is quite good and I enjoy how the film maker shies away from any standard explanation or resolution to the film. In our modern age especially with the slasher film writers feel like they need to explain everything such as the killer's backstory and what makes them tick and where they come from etc. Sometimes what makes more interesting, compelling cinema is leaving things mysterious and unexplained. This is a good film for the genre and does a job of taking the urban legend regarding the killer is in the house motif and spinning it into a fully realized holiday themed, horror film.Eric's Grade: B.",

No over the top trends, just spot on real sets and costuming.Secondly, I don't think I have ever seen so many real firsts in one film. Everything eventually shows up in Hollywood years later. Really amazing when you see so many franchise ideas packed into a single film.I found the casting interesting also. Lots of folks you'll recognize for sure.What you will not see is a lot of special effects blood and gore, but you will get an earful of profanity that may offend folks with what I call a \"PC ear.\" So be forewarned. The UK release had the censor remove most of it BTW.I think this is a must see classic!",

The calls grow increasingly more macabre as the film moves on. Soon, a girl in the sorority goes missing, and everybody goes on the search while the calls continue. There is a killer on the loose, and as time moves on, he grows more and more blood hungry...Black Christmas isn't the best slasher movie ever made, but it's the movie that started it all, and for that it deserves respect.Black Christmas borrows it's basic plot from the most famous urban legend of all time, and adds a bunch of characters and plot developments to make it more interesting. The plot is pretty good for a low budget slasher movie, and it's still creepy today. Many of the devices used in most slasher movies came from this film including the point of view shots and the tension building silences. Though Halloween started the slasher boom of the 80s, it wouldn't have been made the way it was had it not been for Black Christmas, and fans of Halloween should recognize that. The movie uses many creepy build up scenes to build tension and makes the smart choice of never showing the killer's face. We only get to hear his deeply disturbed voice through phone calls, and an eyeball through the shadows. It is especially creepy that we have no knowledge of the killer's identity or his motive, however a motive can be put together by anyone with an imagination through the phone calls. Bob Clark, who went on to do the famous Christmas film A Christmas Story, did a very good job with this film.The acting is pretty good. Keir Dullea gave an intense performance, and Canadians Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin were both funny and dramatic.Overall, Black Christmas isn't a great classic, but it was the first slasher movie ever made, and it is the reason that most slasher movies are the way they are.7/10",

If you think that horror movies are not really scary and you're just wasting your money, rent Black Christmas and you'll literally be screaming through the movie. With The Omen you can have fun with it because it can't happen but once you watch this murder-massacre movie, you'll want guards behind your house. There were some excellent performances by Olivia Hussey as the main character and Margot Kidder was a supporting actress in this movie. In my opinion it was scarier than \"The Exorcist\" and should have won Oscars for Bob Clark for \"Best Director\", Olivia Hussey for \"Best Actress\" and Margot Kidder for \"Best Supporting Actress\".

            "content": "While having grown in popularity and recognition in the past years, Black Christmas is an under appreciated horror gem from director Bob Clark, the same who would later bring the much beloved A Christmas Story. This I feel is a better film, capturing a more timeless sense of Christmas cheer than the overly sentimental Christmas Story, but putting a psychotic murder mystery twist on the season.Black Christmas is set in a sorority house as the holiday break sees most of the residents leave to spend time with family, with a few staying behind to look after the house. However a deranged stalker takes refuge in the home with them, making obscene disturbing phone calls and picking off the remaining residents one by one. The characters are well written and performed authentically, all are smart and interesting making you care for them (unlike a lot of horror movies these days), and the casting is amazing. Olivia Hussey plays Jess, who has a secret between her and her boyfriend Peter (played by Keir Dullea, Dave from 2001 A Space Odyssey), Margot Kidder as the crass alcoholic Barb, Andrea Martin (pre SCTV stardom) as the reasonable yet timid Phyl, Marian Waldman as the frumpy boozing house mother Mrs Mac (easily steals a lot of scenes with her secret sherry stashes), and John Saxon as the police lieutenant Ken Fuller investigating the harassing calls.The film is innovative in more than just being a prototype to the future slasher genre which would explode in the 70's and 80's, with first person POV shots from the killer, a goosebump inducing experimental soundtrack made up broken piano sounds that creeps throughout, and some tropes that would later become famous with films like When a Stranger Calls and Halloween. There is also little blood through out the movie, with some kills being more about tension than execution as they build up to the moment. The film is a slow burn in tension with characters becoming uneasy over days as well as the phone calls getting more personal and insane, so if you're looking for a gory kill a minute horror you might not be very impressed with this film.However if you're looking for a creepy Christmas horror to experience this year I'd gladly recommend you check out this unique early slasher. And don't bother with the remake, even if you're looking for gory kill a minute horror it does not deliver and is absolutely bland in comparison.",

            "content": "It's not a movie with a great or original story (which horror movie does anyway?) or approach but this is simply one fine and effective genre movie, with a fine premise, good settings and some wonderful genre moments.Amazing thing is that director Bob Clark started his career with movies like this but soon continued on making movies such as \"Porky's\" and \"Baby Geniuses\", which is obviously a totally different genre. A waste of his talent? Well, in all honesty horror movies from the '70's are definitely better ones than the ones from the '80's of '90's, so I'm not too sure about it actually if Clark would had continued to direct horror movies during his later career those movies would had been as good as this one, mostly in terms of style.'70's movies of course have a very distinctive style and atmosphere. Some of the best and most classic horror movies also date back from the '70's. Movies such as \"The Exorcist\", \"The Omen\", \"Don't Look Now\", \"Halloween\" oh and I can just go on and on. This movie wasn't the first slasher and it also wasn't the most influential or best known one (credit for that still mostly goes to John Carpenter's \"Halloween\") but it's nevertheless obvious that this movie inspired later film-makers and is a fine example of the genre from the '70's.It's a really effective horror movie, that features all of the right required ingredients. It doesn't make this the most original genre movie with its style or approach but it's simply one fine executed one. The movie has a good dark and mysterious atmosphere and it also really knows to be scary in parts. Especially the phone calls within the movie, which play a key part, are really scary. I don't know what it is but phone calls are always scary and effective material for horror movies. Just think about movies such as \"Scream\", \"When a Stranger Calls\" or \"Sorry, Wrong Number\".What also helps the movie is its atmospheric musical score from Carl Zittrer, who used to work a lot with Bob Clark during his career.The movie also really has a great cast with actors you wouldn't necessarily normally expect in a genre movie such as this one. Margot Kidder is really great in this movie, in a fairly early role from her. The movie also stars Keir Dullea, who unfortunately doesn't ever star in that many movies.A great movie for the fans of the genre, as well as to everyone else for all that matter.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

We weren't disappointed. The film was shown in one of the larger theatres not the small venues they also had. The theatre was quite crowded although not full.From the beginning where we follow the serial killer through his eyes into the sorority house the film packed a punch. Billy is truly one sick crap. No we never get know who he is nor do we ever see him except in one scene that was truly disturbing all we see are his eyes. At times there were shadows in the background that made no sounds. But we heard his voice and it was truly disturbing.That the film does have a certain cheese element and lapses of logic does not take away from the fact that this film should rank up there with the best horror films. Suggestion and not seeing the killer are far better than seeing some crazed guy in a hockey mask come at you. It is not the first but many that came after pay homage to Black Christmas. Think Halloween. Before that there was Psycho and Peeping Tom (that ruined Michael Powell's career). And going back even further there was The Spiral Staircase (1945) where a deranged killer stalked girls with disabilities. Pretty daring for its time.Margot Kidder in particular stands out in the cast. This was before Superman. One should also see her in Sisters another truly creepy film. Sadly she has passed away. Also good was Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea was just creepy and disturbing. John Saxon also appeared as did Andrea Martin before SCTV.But it was the atmosphere created an atmosphere of dread and the voice of a deranged killer that you never saw.

If you don't know the plot, here it is: Sorority house during X-mas break, where we learn the girls have been receiving obscene phone calls, inter-mixed with some unknown intruder scaling up a wall to an open attic window. What follows are some of the most intense, and downright harrowing phone calls, switching from sexual innuendos and pig noises, to what seems like different characters screaming out names that make no sense (not at first, anyway). The story progresses with Jess (Hussey), seeming to be the recipient of the calls, telling her boyfriend Peter (Dullea) that she is pregnant, but does not want to keep the baby. Peter flips out, and starts to act a little cuckoo himself. Enter John Saxon as Lt. Fuller, who while investigating the disappearance of a 12 yr. old girl, keeps a tab on the strange calls coming in to the sorority house. I'll leave it at that, as the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat until the harrowing ending, which answers nothing and everything at the same time. If you haven't watched this film yet, go find it now. It is well acted, intense, and at times flat out disturbing. This is proof that all the crap that's being thrown out today cannot hold a flame to a movie that was made 30 years ago, with no sex, and limited on-screen violence. What makes this movie is the fact that the killer is never shown, and you really have to pay attention to his babbling on the phone, and with your imagination you can start to piece together why this dude is really off his rocker (no pun intended!). Please keep in mind that this movie predated Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc... by quite a few years, and you can notice some of the quirks that would become standards of these types of movie. However, none have, and ever will, match the creepiness of the \"eyeball scene\" and others. It still gives me nightmares. In closing, this is more of a serial killer movie than anything else, and when you think about people like Ted Bundy who actually went into a sorority house in Florida, and killed young women, it just makes it all the more terrifying.If you have an attic, nail the door shut.9 out of 10 stars.",

The story reminded me a bit of the movie House On Sorority Row (1982), it's basically the same, with the exception that you get some answers in that one. I rated that one slightly lower though, the quality was just not there. In Black Christmas you don't get clear answers in the end and that's always a turn off for me, I just don't like open endings where they keep you guessing, I don't see the point of that. So besides the suspense building there isn't much good to write about Black Christmas. It's a mystery to me why it scores so high on here, but then again I get that a lot with other movies also.

            "content": "Haunting, dark, atmospheric and suspenseful are probably the best adjectives to describe director Bob Clark's underrated horror film. Before there was \"Halloween\" in 1978, four years earlier came this terrifying slay ride (pun intended) from the man who would give us \"A Christmas Story\" in 1983.Set in a sorority house during the Christmas season, a group of young women are stalked, taunted and mercilessly seen by an unseen madman living in their house's attic. The tension only escalates as the girls are picked off one by one and the phone calls are garbled insane gibberish, filling the film's main heroine with dread as she becomes the 'final girl'. Can she and anyone else survive the terror of the night?The film's cast is impeccable from Olivia Hussey plays main protagonist, Jess, to Margot Kidder (four years before she would become Lois Lane) as the foul-mouthed Barb, Andrea Martin as levelheaded Phyllis 'Phyl', Keir Dullea (best known as Dave Bowman in '2001 a Space Odyssey') as Jess's unhinged boyfriend, Peter, and John Saxon as the policeman assigned to watch the town and ultimately solve the murders. The cast displays a quirky chemistry and genuine sense of mistrust as the tension ramps up in the narrative.The story is simplistic in its narrative: murders occurring in the sorority house and everyone is under suspicion. However the film is original in its format with inventive techniques as POV shots from the killer's perspective (soon to be overused in later horror films), obscene phone calls that taunt the surviving girls ('Scream' would borrow the phone call angle, but put its own spin on escalating tension) and a limited use of violence in order to scare the viewer with what is not seen rather than what does happen. Most audiences and critics were unsatisfied with the film's ending as there are questions left unanswered, but this makes \"Black Christmas\" so different from its successors as it begs us to wonder what happens after the credits. Any horror fan should definitely see this little gem and I promise it'll haunt your dreams.",

Plot is interesting and sometimes even funny, mainly because of those old people saying such bad words all the time-- come on, old women from a convent aren't supposed to be that rude. What bores me the most is that it took too long for something nice to happen, along with that annoying telephone ringing all the time. However, last scenes are suffocating. That scene with a girl in bed, supposedly sleeping, creeped me out, since ANYTHING could happen to scare the spectator. Happily, directors in that era weren't that mean with us. Surely this film inspired \"When a stranger calls\" and some others, but it is no big deal after all.",

            "content": "Reputed classic that 'Black Christmas' is, I especially appreciate the small details that make the film all the more rich. The house used as the chief filming location was a super find. Director Bob Clark arranges some great shots, some accordingly inspired directly by Roy Moore's meticulous screenplay. The care for hair, makeup, and costume design is gratifying, and set design and decoration too. Characterizations are built with sharp personalities, and there's some wonderfully smart dialogue and small character moments that in the first place do much to round out the picture, and secondly, lend a measure of cheeky humor. Even before taking into account the slasher horror, there's a lot to like about this movie.I admit I'm surprised by the film's relative lack of eventfulness. I suppose I'm used to slashers being a total bloodbath, but in this case the title is more about the gnawing unease surrounding the events, and shock at the murders that do take place. Though employed sparingly, I quite like the somewhat discordant, ambient chords in Carl Zittrer's score that help to form that little measure of atmosphere. I'm less impressed with some aspects about the course of events that at best could be chalked up to seeming carelessness in the screenplay, or at worst, unimaginative writing that demands contrivances for the narrative to work. There are several astoundingly poor decisions, outright blunders, or oversights on the part of characters that strain suspension of disbelief, even through to the very end. Then factor in a killer with no discernible rhyme or reason to his activities, and a B-plot that produces admirable feminist thematic content - with the trade-off that it mostly feels very out of place in the feature.I do really like the cast, with more noteworthy names and faces than I knew. I think everyone involved puts in a swell performance of admirable range, and nuance. The climax is executed very well, and I love the uncertainty in the ending. There's rather a fair bit to enjoy about this picture - so I'm a bit remiss that I find myself wanting to like it more than I do. For all its strengths, a questionable screenplay leaves me very skeptical, and put out. Why, though imperfect, most things about 'Black Christmas' are done very well: characters, dialogue, scene writing, technical craft, direction, and so on. The real killer here isn't on the other end of a phone, it's the narrative. I had such a hard time engaging with storytelling this spotty, increasingly so, as to dampen my enthusiasm about those many elements that are done well. It's a shame, really.It's not altogether bad, but as I see it, the flaws reduce a potentially excellent slasher to solidly average tedium. I can understand how it's gained a cult following in the years since its release, but I plainly disagree with how well it's regarded. You could do a lot worse, but there are also countless better horror films to enjoy. 'Black Christmas' is ultimately modestly worthwhile, if you chance upon it, but there's just no reason to go out of your way.",

            "content": "Sometime after I became reacquainted with horror films during Halloween season in 2017- about a month after I saw IT in theaters- I was up late in the living room one night after my parents went to bed and browsing through a horror and B-movie streaming service when I came across Black Christmas (1974). I did not know what to expect, but what followed the next 100 minutes not only didn't disappoint me like most modern films do, it actually managed to DISTURB me a bit and keep me away from the attic for about a week. With that, I believe that Black Christmas stood the test of time and may very well be one of the most disturbing films ever made. Black Christmas is truly a great horror film worthy of recognition.Directed by Benjamin Robert \"Bob\" Clark (of A Christmas Story fame) after two other low-budget horror films (Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things in 1972 and Deathdream A.K.A. Dead Of Night in 1974), Bob Clark reached the height of his horror career with this film, as it manages to go above and beyond in terms of story, cinematography, editing, acting, dialog, and soundtrack. Black Christmas was initially released on October 11th, 1974 in Canada before being released in the United States on December 20th later that same year under the title \"Silent Night, Evil Night\". It was later rereleased in American theaters on December 26th, 1975 bearing the title we all know and love.First, the STORY. Black Christmas tells the tale of college girls who are staying at a sorority house during the holidays when a stranger with some form of psychosis sneaks and breaks into said house through the attic (where The Stranger, dubbed \"Billy, spends the majority of the entire film) and eventually starts to kill them off one by one. Unlike Clark's last two films, the idea behind the antagonist isn't supernatural like a zombie or vampire, but rather something very close to a mentally-ill person with a home invasion involved. This approach WORKS, as it is a concept that is grounded in reality. It COULD happen to someone in real life. This becomes nightmarish when at the end of the film, little is revealed and we still know close to nothing about \"Billy\"- his motivations, backstory, and what he LOOKS like all withstanding. Making the killer as enigmatic as possible was another thing that worked; it really enforces the idea that the unknown is terrifying.Then, we have the EDITING. The film sets the tone right away using two of your five senses with a long and aged shot of the house with eerie Christmas carolers singing \"Silent Night, Holy Night\" in the background as the title fades in with the opening credits. THIS is how you establish an ominous and atmospheric mood. It WORKS. Bob Clark's Black Christmas is a VERY dark and disturbing motion picture, and it has been said that John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) started out as a POTENTIAL SEQUEL to this film. Carpenter and Clark were discussing the film while working on an unmade/unreleased project, where Carpenter asked (Clark) if there was going to be a sequel, and what it would be about. Clark told him that he had no plans to do a sequel, but if there were to be one, the Stranger/killer would've eventually been caught and would've escaped from a mental asylum on Halloween the following year...and he would call it \"Halloween\". The Halloween that materialized in 1978 had a catchy minimalist soundtrack that is iconic amongst horror fans, but Black Christmas's soundtrack (by Carl Zittrer) was constructed using a piano with forks, combs, and knives onto the strings of it to warp the sound keys, as well as distort the sound further by recording the sounds onto an audiotape and make the sound slower. If this isn't a well composed piece of minimalist music, I don't know what is. I also want to point out that the smallest things, such as the distant sound of a dog barking in the background adds on to the unnerving nature of the film. I can't fully explain it, but it WORKS.Next, we have the CINEMATOGRAPHY. Right after the opening credits, a shaky POV shot (later used in Halloween) is shown approaching the house, climbing a trellis into the attic, and lurking around the house. We mostly see the killer as a shadow on the wall in some shots and his POV in others. the former is especially effective during the shot where the killer is carrying his first victim up to the attic. We are shown the first floor from the stairs as the camera pans up, revealing The Stranger's walking legs as he walks out of frame, leaving us with only his shadow carrying the body and eerie sound effects in the background. The most iconic scenes that are the CLOSEST we get to ever seeing \"Billy\", we see him about to stab someone with his ENITRE BODY (sans left eye) framed in shadow, and we later see that same eye peeking through a crack in the door. This approach strengthens the enigmatic nature of the character, and that works too. Another scene that disturbs me the more I think about it, is a scene after his second kill where he abruptly starts SCREAMING and TRASHING the attic (shown through POV) OUT OF NOWHERE. This particular moment is one of the most disturbing scenes in the film.The ACTING and DIALOG. The characters aren't poorly written and have some development at best, while certain others are disposable. Our (deconstructed) final girl Jessica Bradford (Olivia Hussey) is pregnant by her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea) and wants to get an abortion despite his urging against it, thus setting him up as an effective red-herring. (Margot Kidder)'s Barb steals to show as she (and to a bigger extent, the house mother) spend most of the movie getting drunk and becoming memorable out of it. John Saxon and the other actors did an excellent job. Their dialog is well-written and adds depth to the characters. \"Billy\"/The Stranger, on the other hand, interacts almost exclusively with the other characters through a series of nonsensical yet disturbing obscene phone calls. The noises he makes on the phone are HORRIFYING, partially because it seems as if multiple voices are coming through the other line mixed in with grotesque-sounding animal noises.In conclusion, Bob Clark's Black Christmas is an underrated classic that is worthy of the recognition it gets, and personally deserves more, ESPECIALLY considering that Halloween (1978) wouldn't have existed without it. The combination of the overall tone, music, acting, and special effects make Black Christmas into a well-crafted masterpiece, and even though it's been nearly 50 YEARS since it's initial release, it STILL holds up as a film.If you plan on buying a copy, look no further than the Scream Factory 2-disc Collector's Edition from 2016. It includes a restoration of the original negative and interchangeable audio set-up on the first disc, and a bonus disc with the 2008 Critical Mass Blu-Ray and EVERY special feature included in past home video releases. A true essential in terms of a Christmas movie gift.",

            "content": "Here is a film that is not usually present in Christmas day-time programs although its action happens around Christmas and has even a scene with a choir of children singing carols. Filmed in 1974 in Canada Black Christmas is a combination of seasonal movies and horror, more precisely one of the first films of the 'slash' sub-genre.Film director Bob Clark is author and this is one of the first in a career that will still includes some successes of the genre, and even a second film (A Christmas Story) with the theme of Christmas. Clark demonstrates that by 1974 he already mastered many of the secrets of the trade and assimilated the lessons of the masters of the previous generations and especially Hitchcock. The film takes place in one of those American sorority houses. Thrill is induced at the beginning by mysterious and threatening phone calls, because shortly afterward the home tenants begin to disappear one by one, and the bodies to accumulate. I will not tell more so that I do not take away the pleasure of watching for those who still are interested to see the film.'Black Christmas' deserves to be viewed primarily by enthusiasts of the genre, but not only them. I can not say it is a film that time has not made \u200b\u200bits mark , but interestingly good as its parts are now more visible. At launch it was almost 'destroyed' by some critics, for example that of New York Times. Although some of the critic's objections are deserved (acting seemed pretty sketchy to me), I believe he lost sight of the exact build-up of the atmosphere, using the enclosed space to create the feeling of claustrophobia and daring approach to social topics such as the right of women to decide about abortion (in general it can be said that this is a feminist film). Of course, the 1974-75 critic could not have anticipated that the film will open the way to other horror films that take place in the student environment such as the series 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' . But there are at least two scenes close to masterpiece that he should not have missed. In one of them a girl's father and the mother of another girl - both disappeared - search their daughters at night in a frozen park. A body is found. To whom it belongs? The whole scene is rendered in its profound horror just filming two parents, there not need to see any body to understand whose death has been confirmed. Groovy and psychologically excellent. The second great scene is the final and I will not tell anything about it, so that I do not deprive anybody of the pleasure of a viewing which I recommend.",

Enveloped with a chilling sense of dread, filled with rich characters you actually care about, and scoring high marks on all fronts, this Canadian horror is the slasher film that inspired every other slasher film.Directed by Bob Clark, this story remains relevant today coz it presents a scenario that many women around the world still find themselves in. Things may not be as extreme for most as it turns out for these characters but the threat, harassment & the psychological trauma of it all is more than relatable & just as tormenting on the emotional scale. As for Clark's direction, it's brilliant throughout.The film employs POV camerawork to show us events from the killer's perspective and heightens the tension & suspense with gripping, nail-biting intensity. Editing is immaculate, for its 98 mins runtime simply flies by. Humour is aptly integrated into the narrative. Terrific sound design keeps us on alert at all times. And acting from the entire cast is excellent as well, thus leaving nothing to complain about.On an overall scale, Black Christmas is an unnerving, unsettling & uncomfortable chiller with a simple & straightforward plot that is exceedingly well told. A work of first-rate craftsmanship that is accomplished on both technical & storytelling fronts, this timeless classic is one of the best films of its year, one of the greatest films of the 1970s, and is undeniably one of its genre's finest offerings.

It has a similar set-up, with a slow pace. I liked the pace, have nothing against it, but I did think that the film broke the suspense many times by cutting away to other things. There was one scene that really scared me though, and it's the scene right before a girl screams at the body in the park, when we hear the 'stranger' laughing in the attic and then he goes crazy hitting the body of the murdered girl and we see the body of the woman as well. The shot of the girl's face covered in the plastic sheeting is horrifying as well. Ultimately, I enjoyed this, but honestly I did expect better. I do think that the original Halloween is better (although Olivia Hussey beats Curtis, simply because she's just too cute). I also liked how the film starts with one character, making me think that was the lead and then it transitions into another. All in all, good, and although more kudos for this it isn't THAT much better than the stylized and trashy version of the remake.

It's also a time where we believe we are the safest, however as an old saying goes s... happens, it doesn't matter what time of year it is. This is one of my favorite horror/Chirstmas films of all time if you can believe that.This film was not just one of the first slasher films but also one's set in a season. The fact that this was set up in the Christmas time was a risky move and I felt it was a good risk, who'd of thought Christmas in the horror genre could be a great combo. Let alone the fact this was the late great Bob Clark's first Christmas film where his second is of course my favorite Christmas film of all time \"A Christmas Story\" so two in a row isn't bad.The production value is great, it was made on a low or modest budget and I really felt they used it well and right. The setting was in a neighborhood and a Sorority House that looked like any house and neighborhood I'd pass by which gives the film a sense of familiarity; let alone most of the film takes place in the Sorority House.The cast is good Margot Kidder as Barb is a character you love to dislike because she is practically a dirtbag on wheels, but she just has some really funny spitfire lines. John Saxton is good as the level headed Lt. Fuller, tirelessly hunting down the elusive killer.But I mainly really like Olivia Hussey as Jess. This is one of those underrated actresses I really like (and on a sidenote \"Romeo and Juliet\" one of my favorite movies). I'll level with you sometimes I like actors and actresses that are under the radar a lot more than ones that are in the limelight way too long.Anyway back to the jist of things, the character Jess I really like she's good protagonist that is fraking gorgeous with the warm persona to boot, smart, has desires/ambitions, but most importantly is a person that can hold her own whether it be standing up to her blowhole boyfriend (Jess deserves someone better). I like that little drama with her character which made her sympathetic in my book, she has this dilemma and she chooses to deal with it a certain way but of course her boyfriend disagrees and is a complete dirtbag to her just spouting horsecrap to her. I'll admit at that moment I wanted to punch him and yell \"Frak You\" because I always believe a good significant other should always respect and understand the others feelings in certain matters no matter what. But most importantly hold her own physically against the killer.But what makes this film great and hold up is in it's suspense and creepy, moody atmosphere it invokes which I'll admit gave me the chills. The music is great I really like as the killer first enters there's some sort of eerie tone, as well as the end credit some of Silent Night which has a dark tone to it.I really like the plot it's a simple but it feels plausible, whose to say something like this can't happen; it also made me concerned as to how safe our secure our neighborhoods and homes are. Like in most suspense thriller has always been in being one step ahead of the protagonist. Throughout the film at the moments when nothing really happens yet, we always have that looming fact in our head that the killer in the house and up there, and he's about to do something any minute. In moments like that I'm always thinking \"Don't go up to that attic.\" or \"Cmon get the frak out of house, don't spend another night.\" We just constantly feel unsafe and hope the protagonist can find out this fact on time before it's too late.It's true we never really see what the killer looks like but this is a great think because this gives the killer the element of enigma, the crazed killer is simply who he is evil that's all we need to know. The cinematography is great I love the point of view shots which are great, where we are literally seeing the perspective of the killer. This really adds to the suspense because it adds to the step ahead element, from just some actions or even those noises he makes like in those creepy phone call scenes, it really gives you an idea how truly crazy and psychotic the antagonist is.And I like the feeling of isolation, from the fact most of this film takes place in the nighttime, the snow, the cold, and moments when a character or certain character is alone. Once again you feel unsafe because in times like that you know that the killer could possibly make his move and usually does. But it's also a time where all the chips are down for the protagonist and we hope he/she can successful fight back and survive.Black Christmas will make your skin crawl.Rating: 4 stars",

It's brutal '70s horror, but not without some nice splashes of levity to keep everything fresh (the dumb cop is classic).",

I have been a horror film fan since i was 6 and had seen all the classic horror/slasher/gore films long before ever seeing Black Christmas.  However, none of those films actually scared me like Black Christmas (or \"Stranger in the House\" as it was called in the U.S.).  I first saw Black Christmas when I was in my second year of college and even though I watched it surrounded by friends and others in a brightly lite dorm, the weird, dark atmosphere of the film and the extremely bizarre phone calls made me uncomfortable and still do when I think about it years later. The scenes of the killer wandering around the attic making strange noises and playing with the body of the first victim also rank as the most frightening moments in my own film experience. Some of the comments here compare it to John Carpenter's Halloween but in my opinion Black Christmas is a much more effective and scary film.  If you are looking for a disturbing and frightening film, you should seek out this forgotten classic and watch it alone late at night.  You won't regret it.",

            "content": "One of my favorite scenes is when Jessica (The Gorgeous Olivia Hussey) finds some of her sorority sisters dead in a bed, and the killer's eye is peeping at her through the creak in the door. The whole chase scene down the steps afterward is edge of your seat material, some of the best I've ever experienced. Especially when you think Jessica is completely out of harms way, and the killers arm comes out of nowhere trying to grab her! I still freak at that scene! Enough could never be said at how amazingly eerie the phone calls are, even uneasy at times. The switching of voices sends chills down my back.Another great moment is Margot Kidder's death, while the Christmas caroling continues outside the house.There are a couple of plot holes that bugged me a bit...Okay, why on earth would Peter (Jessica's boyfriend) ever go looking for her in the basement of the sorority house at the end? You hear him yelling outside before he breaks out a window, but that doesn't make sense. Even if the doors were locked and he was yelling for Jessica, he already broke in once before (when Jessica and the others were at a search party for Clare), and it was never indicated that they weren't locked that time. Even so, it still makes no sense what so ever that he would look in the run down basement that looks like none of the girls have ever stepped a single foot in. I feel this entire scene was just made to make Peter look like the most ultimate Red Herring, but I think enough evidence was already pointing to him to totally steer the viewer away from the twist ending.Another thing that got to me was how they build John Saxon to act like a convincingly real cop, only to later make the whole police force to look like a bunch of backwoods Rosco P. Coltrane rejects. Early on Saxon is doing what a lot of cops do, asking questions that had already been answered. Like when he asked of the last time who and when someone had seen Clare, he said \"Last time she was seen was this morning\" when Jessica had already stated it was the night before. Subtle little bits like that won me over...What didn't was these cops knowing there is a second phone line in the house, and they didn't even think of that from the get go? Better yet, once they realized the calls WERE coming from the house, they never thought of checking the attic, or not even once looked for it? Come on! It was right above the girls rooms! Nevertheless, I did love the downbeat last five minutes of the movie. I guess many people felt cheated with the outcome, I kinda thought it was genius, I just didn't think the whole last ordeal with Peter and Jessica was needed at all for the ending to be so effective. Peter could've entered the house in a more believable way...",

The music, cinematography, and set design all help in creating a tense, ominous sorority house atmosphere. The scream queens, especially Margot Kidder, are all awesome, likable characters that we care about their fates in a horror mystery setting. The plot twist near the film's conclusion is sublimely used. A rewatchable horror film since it never looses the eerie, unsettling ambience with each viewing. We never see the face of the killer and his motives for killing sorority girls are unclear, along with an ambiguous ending.

Some have even said that 'Halloween' ripped this movie off.Personally, I don't see the comparison. Yeah, he wears similar clothes and kind of breathes like Myers. I dunno. Not really.All I know is that the original 'Black Christmas' is far superior to that re-imagined garbage. I could only stomach about 20-minutes of that.I've seen this '74 version once on VHS a long time ago and wasn't impressed - it failed to scratch my itches so to say.The fact that this movie is freely available online means that it no longer generates any revenue for whatever \"now defunct\" distribution company it was conceived out of. (Movies of yesterday go away to die as well.) Sorry director fella, Bob Clark, but your little project is no longer a cash cow, or much sought after anymore. 'Black Christmas' is a nowhere movie today. What is sought after though is the elusive novelisation by Lee Hays. It's hard to obtain.Check out this guy with the fuzzy hair. He looks like something crossed between Ron Jeremy and Richard Masur.For some reason the curtains, carpet, and buildings, in this movie look British.And the Asian looking one, with the funny accent, sounds like the one who didn't want to be disturbed, unless it was Greco.'Black Christmas' was superseded by 'When a Stranger Calls' so I guess that movie was inspired by this one with the whole obscene phone call business? Well, it's blatantly obvious at the end when it's like, \"Ma'am, the call is coming from inside of the house.\" Thieves.20-minutes in and I just find this whole affair bland and cloistered. The budget for this movie must have been no more than a grand? It's all filmed in the one spot.It's like it is set in gelatine and you just tread in treacle and get nowhere.Nothing appeals to me.Look at this Mr Peabody guy, who's he? Mr Harrison he is. He reminds me of classic British actors from the 70's & early 80's.And Mrs Mac also looks like any British sitcom actress. (Upon further research she's that one from 'Deranged' who gets shot in the pillow. There's a scene in that movie in her apartment with a photo of her dead husband who also looks British to me.)The prettiest girl out of all of them gets killed first - Clare.Okay, so Mrs Mac, and her drunken foul-mouthed tirade on the staircase, managed to get a chuckle out of me. (There's a lot of aggressive behavior by most cast members in this. It's a hard lined approach in their line deliverances by everyone bar the Asian looking one with the funny accent.)A constipated piano player on Valium plays the decoy killer in this = false lead.Droll judging panel observing him add to the dullness of this movie.College students who are way too old to be college students.This Barb chick looks, and acts, like the madam of the house.(And as if that fuzzy haired guy at the start would be allowed on campus at the ripe age of 50.)\"Peter, I don't want to marry you! I'm in love with Greco.\"This whole movie's investigation hinges on one desk clerk officer.And it's crap watching this a month after Christmas as it's not Christmas anymore! (I hate anything Christmas related when it's not watched in December. Don't feel right.)So, to all you little carollers, harping your little lungs out at the door here, SHUT UP ALREADY!Wow, the Asian looking one, with the funny accent, handed them a few Canadian loons. Hey big spender.Don't tell me they killed off Phyl? She was so innocent and likeable.The problem with this movie is that the killer's uninspiring and has no backstory so why should I invest interest in his character if he's so generic and plain?He just came off the street, climbed up a dorm, settled in the attic, and harasses contributing members of society for no reason? His reason is non-existent.In this scene here the police gave the Asian looking one, with the funny accent, a direct order to walk out the front door and what does she do? Goes upstairs. Now, ain't we a clever cookie?And Thingo said he'd be there in 5-minutes! It's a long 5-minutes, guy.Turns out Greco's the killer and follows what's-her-name to England in that Stephen King movie the next day after the credits have rolled.\"I told you the first time I met him that he was a twit, Audra!\"",

            "content": "Really good horror movies stay with you for life.Any idiot with a camera can pull you into a one-off scare with a ghoul's mask and a horrendously loud stab of music, but it takes real chops to pull off something as cumulatively horrific as Bob Clark's 1974 indie masterpiece. Watching it is like being at the center of a really macabre jigsaw puzzle that keep getting more forbidding and gruesome until you realize the last piece has your name on it.There are many exhaustive reviews (deservedly so) on this site that detail the plot, so I'm going to summarize the pieces of the puzzle that make it such a delight to return to time and again.1) The Sorority House - Just one look at this thing could send you running for the hills the way Clark, Art Director Karen Bromley, and DP Reg Morris have portrayed it. A look at the house in the daylight without the ominously warped lenses, dreary lighting, and blanketing snow reveals nothing remotely forbidding. But the thought of having to stay overnight there, as it's portrayed throughout the bulk of the film, with the majority of the occupants gone on winter break...chilling stuff. It's a character unto itself.2) Carl Zittrer's score - Quite possibly the most effective horror music soundtrack ever composed, it's a wonder for several reasons. It's economical. It uses what it needs to when it's needed. Zittrer tore up an old piano and raked the strings with a variety of odd objects, neatly echoing male lead Keir Dullea's avant garde mashing on the keys, when the character wasn't brooding ominously. Then there are the ghostly carols: \"ooohs\" and \"aaahhhs\" bent, slowed-down, sped-up, played backwards until they're ready to send you over the edge. Turn out the lights and turn up the volume on the newly remastered 5.1 soundtrack and watch your skin crawl.3) The Phone Calls - My god. Hey, there are a ton of menacing phone call movies, but nothing like this. The caller in \"Black Christmas\" doesn't just pant or moan or blare obscenities....he does all of this and more. \"Could that possibly be ONE person?\" Lynne Griffin's Claire asks the other girls early in the movie. It's a valid question, because the caller seemingly has a background soundtrack going while he's going out of his mind. Was he using a tape player? Probably, but who really cares? The point is this: the guy is obviously OUT OF HIS MIND. He's not trying to threaten, he's not trying to scare or pull a prank. He's merely letting the contents of his demented psyche loose in a torrent that's loaded with the organized chaos of a Jackson Pollack painting or John Zorn track on steroids. He laughs, screams, and sobs...many times all in the span of five seconds. The jarring vileness of these (many) calls was really toned down in the TV cut (\"A Stranger In the House,\" which is how I first saw this --- and even hacked to pieces for late night TV it was disturbing - NBC would run it near the holidays in syndication after SNL, I remember).4. \"Wrapped in Plastic\" - Way before Twin Peaks, Black Christmas played with the idea of a killer \"preserving\" his kills with transparent casing. This is particularly morbid when they're stored in the attic of the house you happen to be occupying.5. The Totally Canadian Humor - With as much gloom and doom as BC has going for it, you'd think it would never make you crack a smile. But then again, it has two of the funniest, least self-conscious actresses playing supporting roles: Andrea Martin and Margot Kidder. And the late great Marian Waldman has the role of lifetime as a uniquely foul-mouthed, hard-drinking housemother who keeps bourbon in the toilet tank. And need I mention Doug McGrath's bumbling Sergeant Nash? His performance generates laughs and pathos simultaneously...he's a rube you can't help but pity, in a nice way.This film has an impressive fan base, and yes, it did fail when it was originally released. I hale from Peoria Illinois and it even hit our theaters a bit softly....but....the theater owners were shrewd enough to bring it back each Christmas for a limited late-night run. Why? because they knew it scared the crap out of the few who DID see it.It still does. And what better endorsement can you give a horror film?",

It's set on a holiday, there's a killer on the loose, the police are searching for him, he kills young girls, etc. It even has an ending like Halloween. Whether intended or not, Carpenter is just a rip-off. This film is way scarier than Halloween, the acting is better, the direction is perfect, and the writing flawless. This is one of the first movies that uses the now-tired line \"Jesus, you scared the hell out of me!\" I laughed when I heard it because every movie says it now, but this actress actually said it believably. This movie will scare you. Near the end the officer working on the case discovers that the obscene phone calls the girls are getting are coming from inside the sorority house they are staying in.

Eventually, there is a murder. \"Black Christmas\" is a whodunit but with a twist ending that I find mildly dissatisfying.Much of the plot consists of routine chitchat and the comings and goings of the girls. So viewers will need to find one or more characters entertaining in some way to maintain interest in the plot. The elderly house mom who likes to sneak a drink from a cleverly hidden bottle provides comic relief. What these people don't know, but we viewers do, is that the killer is somewhere inside the large multistory house, watching and stalking them.Many scenes take place at night, and most are dimly lit, with spooky side lighting. The usual Christmas carols, peaceful and reassuring, are punctuated by the discordant sounds of piano strings that signal that the killer is nearby and/or active in some way. Adding to the tension and terror are sound effects, including the whistling of wind through the trees, footsteps of the killer, and his hesitant breathing. Several scenes are photographed from the killer's POV. Casting and acting are generally acceptable.The subplot about the outdoor search party seemed distracting and irrelevant to me; it could have been left out. Scenes at the police station also detract from the appropriately claustrophobic atmosphere of the sorority house.Despite an unsatisfying ending, the excellent color photography, music, and sound effects throughout the plot magnify suspense and mystery. Which renders \"Black Christmas\" a must-see for Horror genre viewers. And the film inaugurates a script formula that was so successful that it has been copied many times by other movies since this film first appeared some forty years ago, to render it a must-see for film historians.",

It is then that when Bodies start to pile, that the they grow closer to finding out the person responsible.I found the film to be borderline average.

For 97 minutes (1 hour & 37 minutes), the film does an alright job in conveying a creepy atmosphere. The killer being kept out of sight was suspenseful as with the brooding feel felt in the house scenes.I much prefer the 2006 remake over this, it's gruesome, short to the point & improves on what this film lacks. I'm not saying this film is terrible, but too much time is spent on the talking scenes & characters & less on the horror, gore & scares.Overall, it's not a bad film. Hey, it's better than that abysmal 2019 remake by Blumhouse. While the dark, brooding mood & suspense is there in this film with some not bad kills, it does unfortunately lack in horror sadly & of course is a bit dated.

            "content": "Black Christmas was a good movie. In fact, it could have reached Hitchcockian greatness if not for two flaws: 1.) Why did the police decide Peter was the killer after Jess killed him? Hadn't it already been established that he had been in the room when one of the calls had been made? This is more than a nitpicky point -- it shakes the foundations of the whole story.2.) Now, this one is more subjective. I had trouble rooting for Jess because she was such a vicious ice queen. In all honesty, I felt sorry for Peter. First, his girlfriend tells him that she's pregnant, going to have an abortion, and there's no damn way she'll consider otherwise. As a result, a crucial recital goes down very badly. And on top of it all, the poor guy gets killed and he hadn't even killed anyone.Sure, the guy may have been a trifle high-strung, but Jess comes off as plain selfish. If she was planning to have an abortion and would consider no other option, why did she even bother to tell the guy, especially on the day of his recital? By the end of the movie, I was rooting for \"Billy\" to go psycho on her ass.Women with major moral flaws were often featured in Hitchcock's films. However, he worked it so we cheered for them in spite of their flaws. This movie expects us to cheer for the heroine because of them. Thirty-one years on, it doesn't wash.",

The film has a strong cast like Olivia Hussey (Franco Zeffifelli's Romeo and Juliet), Keir Dullea (2001:A Space Odyssey), John Saxon (Enter the Dragon) and Andrea Martin (Cannibal Girls). The film is well made, it's has the right atmosphere and it's quite frightening. One of the best horror films of that era, especially when it doesn't end with the easy way out.

            "content": "The attic of a girl's sorority house during the holiday season becomes a nesting place for a grunting maniac, who scales the trellis one evening and begins to murder women amidst the snow and good cheer of Christmas carols. The madman uses the telephone to call the girls and taunts them with noises and deranged ramblings in a very unsettling manner. Olivia Hussey stars as the main innocent girl who is on the receiving end, with Margot Kidder as one of her no-nonsense loudmouth friends. The dependable John Saxon takes on the part of a police lieutenant who tries to help.The first thing I want to say about the film is that it's not unlike everything we've seen since in later slasher movies. Every clich\u00e9 is present: the heavy-breathing psycho, the obscene phone calls; the terrified girl on the other end who is incredibly stupid; the grisly murder techniques; the killer's point of view shots... There is a sense of the familiar here, and I was almost prepared to give the movie a half-star less rating until I reminded myself .. this film came first, BEFORE all those other clones. Director Bob Clark has said that John Carpenter liked this film, and we can see some of its influence in Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, which often gets all the credit. But it's not the fault of the more rare BLACK Christmas that it spawned all the copycats which make it seem like one of them itself; I'd imagine this trend setter felt much more cutting edge in 1974, and that's why I gave it the extra boost it deserves. There is good and bad here ... I have yet to enjoy Margot Kidder in anything, and her drunken sleaze-mouth character here is annoying, as is the fat female den mom who's got a bottle of booze hidden everywhere in the house ... but not to worry. The killer, who's identity is a mystery, manages to be scary just through his eerie phone calls and creepy sounds. The idea of all this gruesome mayhem as a parallel to the joyous Christmas events happening on the side achieves the proper disturbing effect. The look of the large spooky house from the outside, complete with the image in the attic window, is haunting. The movie is not completely original, but it deserves extra credit for setting up so many now-patented and tried and true horror film clich\u00e9s. *** out of ****",

            "review_title": "Black Christmas: A Frightening Holiday Slasher",
            "content": "After \"Psycho,\" and \"Peeping Tom,\" people wonder whether movies like \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" or \"Halloween\" invented the slew of slasher films that we get today. But hardly anyone gives credit to a 1974 film directed by Bob Clark that guarantees some serious chills. It's frightening, and weird, and yet, \"Black Christmas\" goes unnoticed. Perhaps the older genre fans have set aside a place in history for the film, but the more contemporary audiences hardly know it exists. This is where my review of \"Black Christmas\" begins.A figure approaches the Pi Kappa Sig sorority house. He climbs up the ladder to the highest window, and isolates himself in the attic. Below the attic door is a party. The sisters of the sorority (including Jess, Clare, Phyllis, and Barb) are enjoying themselves one last time before Christmas break. Many of them are leaving for the holidays while the rest stick around over the weekend to clean house with their house mother, Mrs. MacHenry(also known as Mrs. Mac). But as the obscene phone calls from an anonymous voice continue, and the girls quickly begin to disappear, the yuletide festivities are coming to a close and terror is setting in.Many movie buffs know Bob Clark for his classic comedies \"A Christmas Story\" and \"Porky's,\" but don't let the fact that he directed \"Black Christmas\" fool you. The film is dark, and sincerely one of the scariest movies ever made.As I've stated before, the importance of the film lies within the fact that it was released four years before \"Halloween.\" So, which film started the slasher saga? The argument has lasted forever. However, comparisons should not be drawn between the two. They are their own films with their own significance to the horror genre.The ingenious idea of inserting such a happy time of year into a time of fear and despair works extremely well. Since the film is set around Christmas time, the feeling of the holiday is evident throughout. There are decorations everywhere, as well as Christmas trees and snow. Throw the color of red onto snow, and the mood easily changes.Thanks to Roy Moore's script, not only does \"Black Christmas\" have a load of atmosphere, but it is also host to a series of some of the most profane, shocking, and outright creepy phone calls of all time. During the first call, the killer uses very foul language, and when Barb challenges him, his tone changes, and we hear a rather humanly voice simply say \"I'm gonna kill you.\" From then forth, we are scared not just for ourselves, but for the sorority sisters also.You see, the characters of the film have such likability. Barb is the life of the party, but she means well. Poor Jess has a struggling relationship with her boyfriend Peter, who joyously accepts that she is pregnant but immediately becomes furious when he finds out that she's planning an abortion. These characters feel real, even when there's some comic relief from the house mother and the police department. You don't want to see them die.Telling from the phone calls, the killer keeps everything under wraps. We don't know who he is or what he plans to do, but he gives himself slight recognition of his identity by simply nicknaming himself 'Billy.' The rest of the time, we never truly see the face of the villain. In fact, we don't see much of him period. When we do feel his presence, it is in his perspective, from his point of view. While he's freaking out in the attic, we're freaking out in the attic. When he's killing somebody, we become him. It's an uncomfortable and horrifying notion, and that's why it works.In terms of acting, the cast is above average. Olivia Hussey (whose star quality was projected in \"Romeo & Juliet\") makes for a terrific Scream Queen as Jess. Also, the early Andrea Martin and Margot Kidder keep things going as Phyllis and Barb. The appearance of genre vet John Saxon as Lieutenant Fuller is also worth noting, as well as Keir Dullea (\"2001: A Space Odyssey\") as Peter.All in all, it's a shame that the subordinate remake of this fright-fest got minimal attention and the original film got no attention at all. Thankfully, a DVD release has fixed the problem, and more fans have found a place in their heart for the film. It's still not as popular as \"Halloween\" is, but \"Black Christmas\" is a horror classic. It will scare and shock you, and equally provide you with a healthy dose of entertainment. This one's a must-see!P.S. The \"eye behind the door\" scene still keeps me up at night!",

            "content": "Bob Clark, whose life was cut short earlier this year by a freak accident, will always be a genre hero; after all, this is the man who gave us the controversial Vietnam-horror allegory \"Deathdream\" (1974), the playful Romero homage \"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\" (1972), and the celebrated holiday comedy, \"A Christmas Story\" (1983). \"Black Christmas,\" a seasonal slasher that predated \"Halloween\" by 4 years, establishes the formula with grace, subtlety, and skill, threaded with Clark's strong sense of small-town Americana (shots are composed with the biographical artistry of a Norman Rockwell painting). An obscene phone-caller is harassing the girls of a sorority house; one of the girls and the housemother (an inspired comic performance by Marian Waldman) go missing; and our protagonist, Jess (Olivia Hussey) is looking to get an abortion, much to the objection of her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea). Happy holidays, indeed! Roy Moore's screenplay takes a simple premise and lets the layers play out naturally--the collegiate and small-town humor still resonates today, and the characters are played with a minimum of exaggeration (as I said about the Clark-produced \"Deranged,\" we feel like we KNOW these people); my only complaint is that not all of the characters are well-integrated, and some disappear for long stretches at a time. Otherwise, we have some iconic figures that clearly influenced Carpenter's babysitters: Hussey as the Final Girl, Margot Kidder as the hard-drinking joker, and Andrea Martin as the straight- yet-slightly-gawky good girl. The legendary John Saxon is his usual excellent self as the local police captain. And Clark/Cronenberg regular Les Carlson (\"Deranged,\" \"A Christmas Story,\" \"Videodrome\") has a small role that is the crux of most of the film's suspense (he's the phone-company employee tracking the source of the obscene calls through switchboards as high as the stacks at the Library of Congress). \"Black Christmas\" is one of the best slashers out there, and certainly one of the most influential (next to \"Psycho\")--raise some eyebrows at this year's holiday gathering by putting this on right after \"A Christmas Story\" (and vive la difference!).",

And got away to the basement and peter broke the window and got into the basement but Jesse was scared because she thought he's the killer. The police found peter dead and Jesse in shock and thought Jesse killed the murdered but billy was still at the attic with his first two victims. Claire was staring out of the attic window the whole time but no one just happened to see her nor did they check the attic.

What a lot of people don't know, however, is that Mr. Clark has approached the holiday season from a much darker perspective. And his 1974 slasher, Black Christmas, is surprisingly effective.I'll be completely honest. I expected shoddy acting and lame scares to abound. Black Christmas does have its fair share of the preceding, but it also generates a somber, brooding atmosphere that's heightened by the frenzied piano stylings of a college student, named Peter, who appears to be on the verge of mental collapse. This guy is dating one of the sisters who lives in the sorority house where the bulk of the terror takes place\u2014this comes in the form of harassing phone calls and some odd, funhouse-mirror-style first-person perspectives\u2014and he's meant to be suspect number one. The elusive psycho's identity is never revealed, and it's clear that screenwriter Roy Moore wants us to believe that Peter is, in fact, the bad guy, but some last-second revelations result in the old switcheroo. This, along with a number of other strategies used in Black Christmas, seem frighteningly clich\u00e9d in this day and age, but I can only imagine that they were fairly groundbreaking during their own time (okay, so Psycho is really the movie that spawned the modern slasher, but let's at least give credit to a movie that's notably more tense than most of the horror to emerge from contemporary Hollywood).As previously disclosed, this isn't to say that Black Christmas doesn't have faults. Some of the acting\u2014and corresponding character responses\u2014 to what's going on in and around said sorority house are completely unbelievable. The father of a missing sister, for example, calmly explores the campus when his daughter doesn't show-up for a rendezvous they had planned early one afternoon. Even after the police get involved and it's somewhat clear that foul play is afoot, this guy never exhibits any urgent sense of emotion to locate his daughter. There's also the presence of a pointless old woman who, for one inexplicable reason or another, lives in the sorority house. She curses and has liquor stashed in books and septic tanks throughout the home. I'm guessing she was meant to serve as some sort of comic foil, but she's more of an annoyance than anything else.That's Black Christmas in a nutshell. Would I recommend it as a cozy little holiday horror movie? Sure. It's certainly not bad, and it has its creepy moments, but don't expect the reinvention (or invention?) of the wheel.",

It's time to bring up all that turkey you've tried so hard to keep down.Dear me, what have women done to Mr Moore to cause him to write such an impassioned love letter to the great God misogyny? He doesn't like them one bit in this picture and nor, it seems, does Bob Clark, the director. The stabbing scene is a little too long and lovingly composed, you know what I mean? Women are portrayed as drunks, promiscuous, baby killers, foul mouthed, amoral, men hating, jealous, covetous, venal and unprofessional. They are also seemingly deaf, unable to hear a man clambering up a drain pipe which would bring the rest of us outside like a shot. The only virtuous one is dispatched straight away. The rest are stupid. We are led to believe that after being told to leave the house immediately after being informed of the location of the obscene calls our heroine would march right up the stairs.Why is it that the calls always have to be coming from inside the house in these films? Why not surprise us by having them come from the bottom of a swimming pool or a zeppelin? How about the MIR space station? Seeing as it hadn't even been launched during the seventies it would have been quite a plot twist. But no, *yawn* THEY'RE COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE! Dan-Dan. And why is the cop who guards the house always dead in the car? Didn't he notice the very obvious sight of someone jumping down from the side of the house and opening his car door? No, they are hired by the police department for their myopia and narcolepsy and complete lack of professionalism such as failing to search an entire house after they know a killer's been hiding in it. They must be desperate to go and get some turkey, providing they can keep it down, that is.And why do killers always have to have nasal problems? It seems to be a given that any one suffering from any sort of mental illness in films must also have bronchial pneumonia and the stumbling gate of a werewolf with a club foot. So they didn't get what they wanted for Christmas. Go and sulk in the corner of the sofa like the rest of us instead of running up someone else's phone bill and sculking around their house with one eye. The only stranger we want to see coming through the window at Christmas is Santa Clause and even then this guy would probably throttle his reindeer. Sheesh!The nastiness of this film has to be seen to be believed. A man we know has lost his daughter is treated with sadistic contempt by the writer (through a woman, of course.) It's a fascinating reminder of how the medium can be mis-used by those whose sole interest is making money.",

However, I love slasher films in general and Black Christmas sadly was remade in 2006, leaving this nostalgic original thrill-ride behind in the dust. What people forget often is that this one is way better in terms of characters, plot and soundtrack. I will say that the phone call they got in the first few minutes was incredibly disgusting and seemed over-the-top even for a horror film, but aside from that, this is one slasher you won't want to pass up! Nothing says Merry Christmas like a crazy maniac making prank calls and killing girls in a sorority house!",

            "content": "Finally, a second viewing of a slasher classic, or at least a father to the slasher genre, though not the only one; 'Psycho' (1960), 'The girl who knew too much' (1963), 'Reazione a catena' (1971) and maybe even the elusive 'Delitto al luna park' (1952), if one is willing to interconnect the giallo with the slasher - they all amount to one big happy bloody (this one is relatively not so bloody, by the way) family to me. This one I remember as being particularly atmospheric and creepy, but I never rated it higher than 7 out of 10.After having seen it again just the other night, a theory entered my mind: the piano player did it after all! I have several observations to substantiate this, but first, a few things which director Bob Clarke has stated (if I may believe the - very interesting! - list of trivia here on IMDb): 1. 'Clark (-) insisted that the ending be ambiguous', which means Clark m\u00e1y have had a certain explanation in mind. 2. 'Clark considered it to be more of a psychological horror film than a slasher film', which will fall exactly in line with my theory. 3. '...The ending of the film forces people to think independently' Again, not a debunking, nor a confirmation, so...So, Peter did it, I'm thinking now. Why? The ending (in \u0082the attic', which could be metaphorically observed as 'the mind', the 'top floor') is a way to mess with the viewer and offers an insight to the schizophrenic mind. Next, all the times and places when and where Peter could be at the times of the calls and the murders pan out. In other words, he has NO alibi(s)! Then there are the strange coincidences. Peter shows up behind Jess just after she received a call and the reason he wouldn't kill her right then and there, is because he may still hope for her to choose to have their baby. This 'baby' (/abortion) motif that haunts Peter is also is very important to my theory, as the caller's voices refer to it many times - 'baby Agnes'... When he is finally convinced Jess will not have the baby and she tries to escape, he makes his final move. Which brings us all to the basement (scene). How coincidental would it be that Peter would just show up there, let alone that he knows Jess is there?In terms of general logics it is very strange that the whole house wasn't searched when Clare went missing, when some even feared she might have hurt herself. I mean, it is just common sense then, to check the attic and the basement (if not by the police, then certainly by her roommates and friends) - another little sign? I'm really unsure about that part. All in all, my theory does agree with Clark's statement that this is a psychological horror; Peter is both the brilliant and savvy artist, \u00e1nd the demented and traumatized killer - a schizophrenic if I'm not mistaken.Perhaps the film should be considered a hermetic, atmospheric piece of modern art, disguised as a slasher (oops, that term wasn't even invented yet in 1974!) with comedic elements - \u0084I know(!); something dirty, ain't it?\" Personally, I didn't know whether to love or hate those 'funny parts' (the silly cop, the drunk lady of the house), but there's always next time...In any case, it is a most artful thriller of the eeriest kind, I was way off with my first rating; 9 out of 10 this time around.",

            "content": "Every time a remake is released (which is almost every week) these days I feel more compelled to seek out the source material to see why it needed remaking in the first place, as in 90% of cases the remake is worse or just as lousy as the original.I never saw the remake of Black Christmas, it looked altogether too teen-y for me and I'm not a big slasher flick fan anyway. But I did read something that said that it was a remake of perhaps the first slasher flick, which at least piqued my interest as it is always interesting to see where certain genres originated.After viewing what is immediately evident is that 35 odd years ago it was apparently unsettling enough to simply set up the kill and then have the killer do the rest. There are no intricate 7 minute \"creeping through the halls\" or red herring scares here, the victims decide to do something, enter the room in which they will do that thing, and the killer does the rest quickly and in straightforward fashion.Nowadays to achieve the same result the filmmakers have to build the tension or ramp up the gore, guess which one they normally go for ('eh Eli?).The supposed big twist (copied by Scream) is actually made evident in the very opening scene, as we are introduced to \"Stalker-Cam\" (TM) as someone cases a house from the outside, while a party seems to be going on inside. Said individual then climbs up and into the attic of the house.It turns out we are in what I think they call a frat-house in the US, a communal dorm for students, in this case all female with a middle aged, seemingly alcoholic dorm mother.The girls are having an end of term party before either heading home or settling in for the Christmas holidays. The party is interrupted by an obscene phone call, as the girls are all in their late teens / early 20s they put the phone on speaker and have a chuckle. Of course some are offended and others get into the swing of things and actually try to talk back to the caller, but ultimately no harm is done and they hang up, thinking that's that.Seeing as the film doesn't waste time in building tension or suspense, we get a fair bit of time spent getting to know the individual girls, there are no cardboard cut-outs here (I'm talking to you Friday the 13th remake!), there are drunken sluts, naive young women and other normal girls, same as every group of students. They are beset by the usual circumstances that occur to the age group, horny suitors, teenage pregnancy, busybody adults and the allure of alcohol and mischief.When quite suddenly (to them at least) a member of their number goes missing, they don't just shrug it off as so many crappy horror movies do today by saying \"Oh, she must have gone to the shops\" or \"She'll show up\", they treat the disappearance seriously, and as they care for their missing friend so too does the audience care more.The crank calls keep coming and they keep getting more and more disturbing, I would question why the girls keep listening but it is a movie after all. In between a small collection of bodies builds up, again this isn't a 73 dead slash fest as many are today and the remaining girls come across all sorts of roadblocks when trying to solve the issue, not the least of which is incompetent police work.When the ending comes it is in keeping with the rest of the flick, straightforward and basic, and there is no realllll surprise unless you have never ever seen a horror film in your life. What would concern though is the outrageously terrible police investigation that follows that wraps everything up so nicely whilst ignoring so many events and incidents.Again, this was the 70s, maybe they just didn't care too much back then about the details.Final Rating \u2013 7 / 10. You aren't going to see anything new, but I'd rather watch this than most big budget horror remakes churned out these days.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",

This film is about a telephone killer who terrorizes a sorority house and kills several young ladies. It is a truly creepy film, a lot creepier than watching some guy with a hood on stalking a load of women with an axe. After all, what's more scary-a knife wielding maniac in front of you who you can at least fight or a mysterious anonymous psycho terrorizing you over the telephone?There are good performances throughout particularly from Margot Kidder and John Saxon and this is a horror I would urge anyone to check out.One more thing-the ending is frightening. The movie was scary throughout but after the film ended I felt a sense of unease. And that is what a good horror movie should be about-scaring the audience to death.If you suffer from a nervous disposition then do watch a little bit of this film but if you are the nervous sort, do not watch the ending.

Olivia Hussey is convincing as Jess, the lead female, who has to deal with a pregnancy, a highly strung piano playing boyfriend, and a weirdo who calls on the phone.One thing that really bothered me in this film - I wish Peter would have gotten rid of that coat.

            "content": "Created when both Canadian cinema and slasher movies were in their infancy, Black Christmas is a film that effectively creates a creepy atmosphere with solid production values. It follows a familiar plot where a college sorority is receiving obscene phone calls, before each of the girls is murdered in the house. Eventually, the police trace the calls and they're finding they're coming from the house, too. I wondered if this movie started the clich\u00e9- I just looked it up and see the urban legend goes back to the '60s. It's not much of a surprise that the calls were coming from the house, even overlooking how well-known the clich\u00e9 is now- for one thing, the killer is clearly in the house, and at another point, it's mentioned there's two lines.Some parts of this movie are well-done. Take the fact that one of the girls is killed while children are downstairs singing Christmas carols. That's juxtaposition reminiscent of the baptismal scene in The Godfather, though not as great. The movie is a little silly after the call is traced- Jess could have saved her skin instantly by taking three steps towards the door and going out to the police. Instead, she goes up the stairs. Reminds me of Tippi Hedren asking Hitchcock why she would go into the room at the end of The Birds (1963). Hitchcock's reply: \"Because I told you to.\"I heard this movie described as a whodunit, but it's not much of a whodunit. The movie leads you to believe the protagonist Jess' boyfriend Peter is the killer even before the police identify him as a suspect. Then it's revealed it's not him... it's not entirely clear who it is. It could just be some random guy. That was kind of cheap, and the implication that he killed Jess, while cold and creepy, wouldn't have been as satisfying as the damsel-in-distress killing the bad guy. Oh well- Black Christmas works, and is a fine film for what it is.",

I did like the sicko's voice during the obscene phone calls and the scenes in the attic were creepy enough.  Had to watch the ending a few times cause I thought I'd missed something.  Turns out I didn't.  It's just bungled and falls rather flat. \nPerhaps this film was considered innovative at the time of its 1974 release, but it certainly hasn't aged well.  Worth checking out if you're a true fan of the genre, but there's nothing here you haven't seen before.  A far cry from what I consider Bob Clark's best horror film, Deathdream, a.k.a.

Sure, to today's audience it may seem a bit slow and dated but to the true fan, this is a masterpiece of the genre. A madman hides in the attic of a sorority house, telephones the girls from upstairs and eventually starts killing some of them.So many elements have been lifted from this film and utilized to great effect, think of When A Stranger Calls, Halloween, Scream and countless sorority slashers to name a few, this movie has to be termed as somewhat of a groundbreaker. Filmed with a low budget, director Clark relies solely on mood, lighting and atmosphere to give the film it's edge. He succeeds brilliantly. Apart from a rather tedious 10-15 minute segment involving the housekeeper of the sorority the film absolutely keeps it's tension filled grip on the viewer and doesn't let go at all. I even found myself shouting at the tube, telling the girl \"don't do this, don't go there\", and I can't remember ever doing this before or after. Watching it alone (plus, it was at Christmas time) the film totally freaked me out. Acting is way above average for a slasher flick. Olivia Hussey, besides being a total knockout, is very good in the lead role. Margot \"Lois Lane\" Kidder is a delight as the foul mouthed drunk, Keir Dullea fairly creepy as Hussey's not-so-sane boyfriend and genre favourite John Saxon is good as always. For the most part, the humour goes down well also. One particularly funny scene involving a not so bright cop, but that seems to be a regular in Clark's films. If you're a fan of horror films, it doesn't get much better than this. Highly recommended.",

Bob Clark, director of the excellent CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS and DEATHDREAM, told Carpenter that he was not going to do a sequel, but, if he was, it would be called HALLOWEEN. Carpenter's opening is very similar in style to Clark's opening, as if the killer POV camera work and the killer lurking out of the frame. Olivia Hussey is not the virginal heroine (her character is pregnant and determined to abort the baby) and a lot of film books and reviews incorrectly identify Keir Dullea as the killer when he is obviously not. I have heard complaints regarding the ending and the unknown identity of the killer because most viewers have been conditioned to have everything explained to them & tied up in a neat little package, a la the ending of PSYCHO, but that only makes the film more unique. It was one of the first and the acting is superb for this type of effort. In a fair world it would be every bit as popular as HALLOWEEN, but given the amount of posts for this film, it shows that BLACK CHRISTMAS is very much appreciated by horror fans. I read an interview with Bob Clark on FANGORIA'S web site that a remake of BLACK CHRISTMAS is in the works, as well as a remake of DEATHDREAM and either a remake or sequel to CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS. Another great Bob Clark film worth checking out is MURDER BY DECREE, in which Sherlock Holmes takes on the Jack the Ripper slayings. It's a shame that Clark turned his back on the horror genre after BLACK CHRISTMAS and directed crap like the PORKY'S movies and LOOSE CANNONS. If he would have kept his hand at horror, I predict that he would have been one of the biggest names in the field today.",

Although pretty well done overall, it does have some problems. The film is lightly based on an urban legend - it concerns a Christmas holiday murderer who primarily targets those living in a sorority house. The killer may or may not be involved in some other murders around town, but the focus here is on the people living in the house.The acting is fairly well done by all of the cast, however, some of the characters are very one dimensional. We only see one side of their personality - the conservative virgin, the vulgar party girl and the inept policeman are perfect examples. There are others who are a little more fleshed out and have more depth to them, but the movie does suffer from that shallowness as many horror movies do.Unlike the slashers that came later, BLACK Christmas is very tame in it's graphic violence. Many of the murders take place off screen although the aftermath is generally seen. Although very little blood is filmed, the movie does have a fair amount of bad language so be warned if you don't like profanity or sexual references. It's definitely not suitable for kids.The film is really genuinely creepy in parts, especially in the interactions between the killer and the girls living in the sorority house. The ending is quite creepy as well.Parts of the movie don't make a lot of sense though. I don't want to get into any spoilers here, but lets just say that certain things should easily be heard when things are quiet. And of course, you have the character who stays and puts herself in danger when she's knows that things are quite amiss - one of my biggest pet peeves with horror movies. The film is pretty well paced overall which made it enjoyable to watch. Although some reviewers disagree, I actually did like it's final scenes but I wouldn't want to live in a town where the police don't think things through to a logical conclusion.If you like your horror tame, this one would be a pretty good choice if you can handle the vulgarity. There are other \"entry level\" horror films that are better, but this one is okay. I don't know that a seasoned horror buff who likes their movies bloody and violent would like it though.",

Horror films from the 70s to the present are my favorite, but it's usually quite difficult to find the good ones amongst all the junk. I had gotten to the point to where I thought I had seen all of the great horror pictures of this time period...including...THE CHANGELING, AN American WEREWOLF IN London, THE DEAD ZONE, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, EVIL DEAD 2, THE THING (1982), HALLOWEEN, THE SHINING, SUSPIRIA, THE DESCENT, DEAD-ALIVE(aka BRAINDEAD), THE EXORCIST and THE BROOD...to name a few, so obviously I was skeptical that this film BLACK Christmas that had passed me by for almost my whole life could actually be as good as all my fellow IMDb reviewers were stating. But being a huge fan of Bob Clark's A Christmas STORY, I took a chance and purchased this DVD right out and to my surprise all of the hype didn't even begin to do this film justice. It's been compared to HALLOWEEN and John Carpenter's film is certainly one of the best of the genre but BLACK Christmas...dare I say it...is actually better..scarier and more original. First of all I was impressed by how good the film looked for its age. BLACK Christmas is a class act, with pretty fine actors, a great script and an excellent crew behind the camera. It's hard for a film to scare me after all the films I've seen but my wife and I were often creeped out by BLACK Christmas. There is very little gore and you don't see much of the killer which proves sometimes less is more...WAY MORE in this case. BLACK Christmas is now in my top five of all time horror flicks. See it if you like a good scare. BOO!",

Until a mysterious stranger makes weird phone calls as he torments the girls then sneaks into the attic of the house as he starts to kill some of the girls one by one. The police are concerned by strange murders going on especially the discovery of a dead 13 year old girl in a park but can the cops find this psychopath or will he have his bloody hands on the entire household? Suspenseful and masterful psychological horror slasher flick from Canada and writer-director Bob Clark who would later give us \"Porky's\" and \"A Christmas Story\". It's a true masterpiece of the slasher genre in the 70's with \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", \"Halloween\", \"Torso\" and Mario Bay's \"Twitch of The Death Nerve\" (a.k.a. Bay of Blood) but this was before \"Halloween\" hit the screen 4 years later. The film also stars John Saxon who is one of cult cinema's best actors, it's a scary and chilling skin-crawler that will keep you guessing till the very end. Unlike most slasher movies which uses gore, this one uses characterizations and tension rather then just brainless blood-buckets. This is a true underrated horror masterpiece that every horror fan should seek and paved the way for other slasher flicks like \"Halloween\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", \"Friday The 13th\", \"Maniac\", \"Sleepaway Camp\", \"The Burning\", \"Scream\" etc. as it ranks up with \"Psycho\".",

For starters it is directed by none other than the genius behind one of the most beloved Christmas classics in the history of Christmas classics, A Christmas Story (1983). Yes, the man himself, Mr. Bob Clark. I bet you're thinking to yourself, \"Self, I bet the movie this week is going to be a sweet, fun filled romp that will transport me back to when Christmas was chock full of magic and wonder.\" Well, you'd be wrong. Instead, The Mock Films Blog is proud to present the one, the only (unless you include the lack luster remake from 2006) Black Christmas (1974).Why, you may ask, did I choose a horror film for this joyous holiday season? Well, honestly, if we can call Die Hard (1988) a Christmas movie then we can do the same for this one. (Merry Christmas. On with the blog.) The film revolves around a group of happy-go-drinky sorority sisters getting ready for Christmas break. Little do the naive ladies know, someone other than Santa will be paying them a visit this year.What makes this film so great is that it's as funny as it is scary. Clark puts his signature subtle humor that we saw in A Christmas Story and applies it to this much earlier work. Margot Kidder as the loose cannon is really amusing, along with the booze hound house mother played by Marian Waldman. But for all of its goofiness, the scares are just as strong. From the creepy POV of the killer wandering through the house unnoticed, the disturbingly graphic prank calls made to the sisters, to the solid gore effects,this is a nasty little jump scare flick. Although, it might be a rough watch for those who are bummed out easily during the holidays (go watch A Christmas Story marathon. Bob Clark thought of you too).\u2014",

            "content": "Black Christmas is a very underrated and un-recognised Canadian horror film from director Bob Clarke (probably most known for the raunchy comedy Porkys). This came before Halloween, Friday the 13th, When A Stranger Calls or A Nightmare on Elm Street. This is what started the slasher genre. This created the killer's POV shots, the creepy scores and the obscene phone calls.There really isn't a huge plot here, it is basically about a group of girls in a sorority house are being terrorised by obscene phone calls. No one has any idea who it is calling them. Slowly, each one goes missing and everyone becomes more aware of what is going on.Despite the minimal plot, this is THE slasher film. It has an extremely creepy score that will have the hairs on your neck standing, very effective cinematography (the house is perfect), a great group of younger, great camera work and older actresses/actors and it packs a walloping twist at the end. The lack of gore or violence suits the movie PERFECTLY. If they had shown the killings in full detail, it would not have been as good. One murder (involving a glass unicorn) is the stand-out, being one of the most recognised murder scenes in horror movie history.Many people consider Halloween the original slasher, that is not the case. BLACK Christmas is the ORIGINAL slasher. But it is much more than that. Instead of a cast of complete asses, we have a group of smarter people. They die not because of idiocy, but because of accident or just the wrong place in the wrong time. There is also some great humour tied in. Margot Kidder being the funniest of them all.The movie gives me the chills, especially the ending, which is the greatest in my opinion, of any horror movie. I urge anyone who considers themselves a horror fan to see this.5/5.",

            "content": "This is kind of a incredible film for 1974. It's a well wrapped movie with some all round decent performances. The plot is simple yet very effective and I don't think I've been scared of a killer in a genre like this for a while. The acting, mostly voice acting for the killer is chilling. It's really emits the sense of insanity above anything else. After watching so many horror movies, I can't believe I thought the things that I did. Especially the later sections of the movie really grab onto you.Now as for the beginning, the movie starts off pretty much right away and is very engaging at the start. Then it does get a bit tedious and drawn out around the beginning-mid section which is probably my least favorite of the movie because nothing really happens.Regarding gore this film has a very light amount. But stil enough disturbing images, especially the ''second'' kill Clare is done very effectively. So for its age, it still did a great job at being somewhat scary. Also what really helps this movie is that its pretty barebones, no special fx, no crazy plot. It's very grounded and real. One of the only caveats is the amount of plotholes and characters that ''need to be alone''. Though it wasn't that annoying. I guess the main offender in this would be Phyl.Barb was one of my favorites throughout this film and seemed to be the lead in the first part of it, Jess gradually took over and became the lead girl which was an interesting shift. That said, Barb was one of the only ones that had some comedic relief in her dialog, though I still think this movie lacks in that department. Most of it is very dry and serious.As with many slashers, the killer is important, but not here. You're not gonna know, its completely kept to your imagination. Which in this case definilty works in favor.The cinematography and directing is honestly really good as well, filled with moments where as a viewer you get real claustrophobic with slow zooms, and long ended shots. One of my favorites is of course the final scene with Jess in bed.That said this movie suffers mostly from some annoying plotholes and ''convenient'' events.All in all this is a must watch for slasher fans, and will still be pretty thrilling if you aren't one. 6.5/10.",

            "content": "It's the night before Christmas Eve at a campus sorority house when the phone rings. The muffled breaths of the caller can be heard on the other end. Soon, heavy breathing turns into lascivious outbursts, cries that egg on Barb (Margot Kidder) while unsettling the rest. Soon, nobody can find Clare (Lynne Griffin), which leads her father (James Edmond) to contact the police, lead by Lt. Fuller (John Saxon). With the disturbing calls continuing into Christmas Eve, and Jess' (Olivia Hussey) boyfriend upset, it soon becomes evident that there's more to the night than just carol's and Christmas lights.When an unsuspecting world received Black Christmas, the term and sub-genre slasher wouldn't insert itself into the mainstream canon for another 4 years. Pre-dating John Carpenter's Halloween, the aforementioned cannonball to the eyes of American cinema, our film aptly embraces the first person perspective alarmingly introduced with such films as Peeping Tom and Psycho. While the former, Michael Powell's compellingly voyeuristic tale, ultimately ushered in the perspective that would end up widely used in the genre, it wasn't until Bob Clark's holiday slasher that we would see its use popularized in film.What Black Christmas does exceptionally well is assert an uncomfortable gaze over its viewer, one that helps peel backs its grainy, exploitative layer with a razor sharp masculine fixation on the female body. We witness the sorority house from afar, only getting closer as our peeping tom does. Even when we're invited in before he climbs through an upstairs window, it's always through the perceived eyes of our voyeur. The masculine gaze controls much of our perception as he slowly preys on the sorority sisters, a light cascading across a peering eye. When Claire is strangled, her body is propped up by a window with her eyes peering out and mouth agape, echoing the sexually deranged moans of our caller.It's these perverse and sexually driven calls that push our film forward, filling every frame with tension on what we already know. Bob Clark frames the horror with staircases, doorframes and windows, utilizing these as the eyes of our killer. While we don't know who it is, we know where he is; yet this understanding only adds increased value to the terror that presses down on us. It's a pressure that weighs so heavy it rests in our stomach, a feeling Jess carries with her as she tells her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea) of her pregnancy and impending abortion. When he tells her what she can and cannot do with her own pregnancy, he stares at her with the same fixation as our killer.Writer Roy Moore plays between the killings and a male-dominated state of mind with a juxtaposition that reverberates even more so today. Peter tells Jess that she can't kill the baby, while she never implies that it's a baby nor uses the word kills. We then shift back to the sorority house, a home that is devoid of male governance, save for the looming eyes of our intruder. The dominating male gaze echoes the dominating male voice that pushes Jess away, further into our place of murder. These transitions spur on the ominous dread that hangs in the air as each kill unfolds, our now final girl clinging to a hope we know doesn't exist.The world that Bob Clark and Roy Moore bring to life is reminiscent of its time, yet mirrors those that we live in today. Its morally strong lead, and similarly dueling views, both literally and symbolically, helped usher in the sub-genre that films like Silent Night, Deadly Night and Night of the Demons would inevitably destroy in the years to come. Black Christmas works as a powerfully affecting, unsettling piece of pre-slasher filmmaking that establishes itself as an important piece in horror cinema.",

The soundtrack is horrifying with it's various screams, vocals, and the constant Twang of the piano. The atmosphere is haunting with the various camera angles showing you the killer's point of view and the consistent image of the first victim in the rocking chair with the plastic bag still wrapped around her head flashing across the screen at various moments and then there's the telephone calls. The terrifying screams, moans, and various voices that the killer uses during these calls will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. The most terrifying aspect of this film though is the fact that you never find out who the killer really is. The viewer is lead down a particular path and falsely believes that they know the identity of the killer but then the film betrays the viewer. This is sheer cinematic genius and one of the essential elements for true terror. This film set the benchmark for future films such as \"Halloween\" \"Friday the 13th\" and \"Nightmare on Elm Street\"...ESSENTIAL VIEWING!",

Eventually, the terror increases as the sorority sisters are, one by one, viciously murdered by a psychopathic killer.Let me just say: With the proper viewing atmosphere, Black Christmas can, easily, be one of the creepiest and frightening films around. Stick yourself in a dark room with no light but the Christmas tree, make sure it's nice and snowy outside, and empty the house. Have all of those, and prepare to be scared out of your wits. Unfortunately for me this time around, all I had was the dark room and empty house. No tree, no snow. But, that didn't stop the film from being nearly as chilling. In addition to the chills the film delivers, it also succeeds in its technical aspects. Moore's script is very good, with a nice even flow throughout. It manages to flesh out the 'important' characters and make them seem more complete, even though some of the other characters are pretty much forgotten. Also, though some don't, I very much liked the lack of resolution. The late Bob Clark's direction, of course, was also damn fine. It worked well and took full advantage of the beautiful sorority house. The acting, on occasion, failed. Olivia Hussey, whom I never found to be a GREAT actress, was for the most part good, but still seemed a bit over-the-top on occasion. It wasn't enough to distract from the quality however, and can easily be overlooked. In the end, Black Christmas (1974) is a success of chilling slasher cinema that fans of such films as Halloween should truly love.Obligatory Christmas-Horror Elements:Subgenre: SlasherChristmas Carols: The soundtrack is primarily made up of holiday tunes.Snow: That there is.Person in a Santa suit: Yes, we see a Santa-clad person a few times.Violence/Gore: It's not as 'bad' as the remake, but there is a bit. The deaths are certainly better here.Sex/Nudity: None, although the phone calls are pretty graphic.Scares/Suspense: Endless. This is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen and it definitely stirs deep.Mystery: Absolutely. This is one of those rare films where the mystery lasts long after the credits roll - -Final verdict: 7.5/10. See it! -AP3-",

I'm also one of the biggest fans of John Carpenters Halloween. It's not only my favourite horror movie of all-time, but my favourite movie of all-time period.I respect this film. It was neat. A lot of scenes I noticed were done in Halloween. It was well made. However, it wasn't scary. It didn't have major fear factors in there. One of the biggest things a slasher/horror movie needs is the killer to be intimidating or creepy.Also, a great score would've been fantastic. Unfortunately, it was missing good music as well in my opinion.This movie isn't frightening in the least bit. I got a few chills in the last 30 seconds of the film, but that's it. I don't know what all the hype is about. I respect what it has done for slasher movies, but if you can't go back, watch the film and truly be creeped out after decades, then its not a classic.This movie isn't a classic. Rather a stepping stone for art work such as John Carpenters Halloween. I would never compare Halloween to this movie. Never has a slasher/horror movie been done so well as Carpenter & Hill created Michael Myers in 1978.I could honestly say Tobe Hoopers Texas Chainsaw Massacre scares the living hell out of me until this day. Same goes for Exorcist. Halloween, not so much anymore considering i've lived with it since I was a child.6/10 Overall - See it for a history lesson on how American slasher films came to be.",

The locations are well used and the suspense builds well. The tense final segment is effective.Bob Clark later did teen sex comedy Porky's (1981), and there's much Porky's style comedy here. However it weighs the film down and dampens the suspense. The gags of Mrs Mac having booze hidden everywhere, Barb (Margot Kidder)'s jokes about turtles having sex and the fellatio telephone exchange, and the antics of the character credited (appropriately) as 'Laughing Detective' seem try-hard and drag on too long.Also weakening the film are the unbelievably dumb cops. The detectives openly mock dim Sergeant Nash (Doug McGrath) yet the detectives also screw up so badly it becomes distracting. The most obvious blunder is never properly searching the house even though Clare is still missing. There are big logic lapses. After threatening calls and a local murder, characters go back to joking like there's no danger. Even if Mrs Mac really would leave while a student is missing, no one reports her not arriving at her destination or tries to inform her of the murders in the house. Near the end the boyfriend (Art Hindle) of the still-missing Clare, and Clare's father, sit casually chatting beside the catatonic Jess (Hussey). Shouldn't they be searching for Clare who is still missing?",

Its Christmas time and a mysterious evil person starts making spooky phone calls to a girls sorrority house and one by one the pours souls are put away, resulting in a brand new obscene phone call for each murder. This stars Olivia Hussey (Juliet from the 60's remake of Romeo and Juliet), Margot Kidder (Clark Kents best gal). Andrea Martin (SCTV) and John Saxson as, who else, a police detective. This was ten years before Saxson appeared in his most familiar role as Nancy's dad in A Nightmare on Elm Street.  The sub-plot deals with Hussey's character, who is pregnant. She wants an abortion, but her boyfriend, Peter, objects to this. This subplot ties in to the obscene calls and keeps you guessing to the very end.  The highlight is the Italian-style, dark and gloomy atmosphere and tone that Bob Clark has established. This amps up the spook factor and makes up for the lack of gore. This movie certainly paved the way for \"Halloween\" and \"Scream\" among   many other horror films. Theres also a nice mix of humor, largely due to Margot Kidder and the dopey police sergeant, the same one from Porky's. Black Christmas combines many of the right elements in a good Horror movie with good scares, chilling music, and humor. If theres any downfall it would be that it is quite dated and this shows during a pivotal point in the movie where the Police put a tap on the obscene calls, but are only able to get a read by having Hussey's character keep the caller on the line for an extended length of time, but this does help build the drama and horror, however.  Theres also a lot of profanity, for 1974, very strong language, but this adds to the realism of life in college sorrority.  Highly Recommended for any horror film buff.",

            "content": "3 years before \"Halloween\" forever changed the horror film genre, \"Black Christmas\" was the original slasher film...and what a weird-ass film it is! There is a killer hiding in the attic of a posh sorority house, a killer whose face we never see and whose motives are never revealed. The film begins almost immediately with the sickest, most obscene phone call ever put on film. It's not so much what the caller has to say (although, for 1974, it's pretty graphic, sickening stuff!) but how he says it; his (or her?) voice changes with every sentence, sometimes two or three voices overlapping each other. It is indeed a chilling thing to hear, reminding me very strongly of Reagan MacNeils Legion of voices in \"The Exorcist.\" The call ends with the mans voice, now speaking in a normal (but no less frightening) baritone, informing Margot Kidder that he is going to kill her. The spree begins almost as soon as the call ends.All of the characters are rather offbeat, and all of them suspect. Olivia Hussey is the surprisingly non-virginal and newly pregnant heroine. Keir Dullea is her moody and slightly obsessive piano playing boyfriend who refuses to allow her to get an abortion. Margot Kidder is the drunk, rude sorority sister with a mouth only slightly less foul than that of the obscene caller, who continues to phone and torment our confused and increasingly frightened Miss Hussey. The girls continue to disappear, but no bodies are ever discovered and no one has any reason to climb up to the attic, where a display of horror awaits. There are some ingenious killings here: a plastic bag, a hook on a rope, the glass horn of a unicorn, all very wince-inducing. The climax obviously went on to inspire \"When A Stranger Calls\" and can be appreciated anew here.It's not a flawless film, however. I personally hate ambiguous endings. I want to know who did it and why, and although it really is not necessary (real life killings oftentimes have no motive and the killer no history with his victim, after all) it still left me feeling irritated. I also had a serious problem suspending my belief when, at films end, the cops simply leave our heroine alone in the house to sleep her drugged sleep. True enough, they think they have caught the killer...but the girl is in shock, she's just committed a murder of her own (albeit, one of supposed self defense), and I'm supposed to accept it when they turn off the lights and just leave her there? What the hell? Okay, reshoot the last ten minutes or so, and I'll stop griping about the fact that we never find out who the killer is.I'm not sorry I watched it, if that's any consolation to you hopeful horror fans looking for some lost oldies but goodies. It's a good film. It could have been really great, but just fell a few inches short, that's all.",

Bob Clark did a fantastic job with the casting and character development. Oliva Hussey and Margot Kidder was what steered this film forward with their fine performance and natural attractiveness. John Saxon, who most know from A Nightmare on Elm Street, had a major role and was also top-notch. Perhaps my favorite part of the movies though is the psycho phone calls that the sisters get. Many films have tried to duplicate the phone calls, but none have been able to match the insanity and effectiveness that Black Christmas achieved. I could rave forever about Black Christmas, even the ending, which many people may not have liked; I thought it was definitely a good way to end an incredible horror film.",

However, it wasn't cheesy at all and it is still terrifying to this very day.I thought the story was incredible. It's really simple but it accomplishes so much and instilled a lot of fear in me. I've heard a lot of people say how Halloween ripped this movie off and I don't see that. I definitely see how Halloween was influenced by this film but that doesn't mean it isn't its own film and a great one at that. I would call them equal films. Both have great stories.The acting was very good and the characters were portrayed very well. The atmosphere is probably the creepiest part about the film, it was executed so well. This is definitely one of my new favorite movies and I am bummed that I waited so long to see it.Every horror fan owes it to themselves to see this movie immediately.

We are not sure who it is and the ending is shocking. The killings are brutal. It's crazy to think that the guy who directed this went on to do such hits as \"Baby Genuises...\" He should have stuck to horror!

Made in Canada, it pre-dates all those \"phone call from a mad killer\" movies and sets the standard which those films that followed really never matched. (The one exception being \"Halloween\"). The setting is a sorority house on a college campus at Christmas holidays. The terror and murder that is visited on those girls that are still left in the house is unrelenting.  The story is basically a simple one.....horrible phone calls which result in horrible deaths.  That voice on the phone will totally unnerve you...it lingers with you long after you have seen the film. Margot Kidder is perfect as a hard drinking, hard edged student and Olivia Hussey is truly beautiful as the gentle girl in love with Keir Dullea. In fact the whole cast, some of whom are unknown to American viewers, is quite good.  Look for Andrea Martin from \"Second City\" as one of the sorority girls.  The downbeat ending will leave you weak, as will the scenes with Hussey and Dullea when she rushes to the basement to escape.  Why do people always go to the basement instead of leaving the house? If you like films that scare the bejeesus out of you, then don't miss this one.  It is available on tape but don't watch it alone, and for God's sake, don't answer the phone!!!",

I think that it is best to be watched late at night with the lights out for full effect. I thought that there was good amount of gore in the film. as well as having a a good psychological feel to it so that you are on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen. The killings were done well especially one one with the girl having been suffocated with a plastic bag.I recommend this film for fans of all the 80's slasher films. such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980.

            "content": "Being a horror film afficiando, I headed off to one of my local videostores to catch up on horror films that I ought to have seen for one reason or another. One of the films I picked up was this one, having read that it was probably the first slasher flick, which qualified it to my list. After watching it, I thought that it was very unsettling, but was it REALLY scary? And was it any good? Well, sort of. The problem with the film is that one, I couldn't care less about the characters, and when they go about acting like total idiots I even caught myself mumbling: \"if he/she/it gets killed now he/she/it's got him/her/itself to blame\". This keeps the film from really being scary, plus that, and this probably wasn't the case for the audience when it was released, the ending is so unbelievably predictable that it's plain silly.WARNING! SPOILER!I mean, if you have a long cameraroll that drifts from he bed where the heroine lies across the hall, doesn't that give it all away? And they basically signal that it's coming, I mean, why else would everybody leave the room? I called it right when the scene started!END OF SPOILERNow, don't get me wrong, it is a pretty good film. Now it's time to compare it to the other film of this kind, John Carpenter's \"Halloween\". There are similarities, but there is one significant difference. In \"Halloween\", we know who the killer is a couple of minutes in, in \"Black Christmas\" we don't. And that makes a bigger difference than one might think. One film which is a big ripoff of \"Black Christmas\" though is \"Friday the 13th\", which is built up in a similiar fashion, but is indeed a MUCH MUCH worse film. But back to \"Black Christmas\" vs \"Halloween\", the question now is, which one do I prefer? The answer is easy, I'll pick \"Halloween\" any day of the week. Why? Easy, Carpenter is a much more skilled director than Bob Clark and it shows in a major way. Clark manages to build an effective mood, but the mood Carpenter builds is more menacing than Clark could build in his dreams. SPOILER!Second of all, in \"Halloween\", the characters act more human. When they are given a chance to escape they take it, they don't go out to investigate.END OF SPOILERNext is the camerawork. It is similiar, but it's far more slick in \"Halloween\". The same goes for just about everything else in the film. But back to just \"Black Christmas\", the film is definitely worth the price of rental, since it is after all a sort-of classic. I personally don't think it's good enough to be classic in terms of quality, but does belong on the cult classic list since it helped spawn the genre that \"Psycho\" laid the building blocks for. But it's definitely not a masterpiece. According to me, anyway.",

The atmosphere is jolly and carefree, except for an ongoing series of menacing telephone calls, and, oh yes, we've just seen someone climb into the attic with apparent ill intent. Kidder does some scene-stealing as the bad girl, Hussey illustrates one of the downsides to having beautiful long '70s hair, and Keir Dullea does a nice turn as the creepy boyfriend. Director Robert Clark knows that the unseen is far scarier than what can be seen and he ratchets up the tension beautifully, making good use of ominous shadows, and putting in nice touches like replacing the sound of a distraught woman's scream with the piercing ring of yet another ominous phone call. This is a terrific, well-made little movie that is genuinely sleep-with-the-lights-on scary. Don't miss it.",

            "review_title": "Other movies have borrowed heavily from this holiday horror film, but there's a reason for that",
            "content": "It's ironic in a way. \"Black Christmas\" predates pretty much every single slasher horror film (including the one I consider the first in the genre, \"Halloween\") but you can see so many elements in this film that have been borrowed or distilled into familiar horror tropes that at first, it will seem kind of routine. For this reason, you might be wondering what the big deal is about if you're just a casual movie viewer. There's a lot more to it than just an ancient ancestor of your \"Friday the 13th\" and your \"Prom Night\" though. It goes without saying that if you're a true fan of horror cinema, this is a must-see. The plot, as you might expect happens on Christmas Eve/Day. It follows a group of sorority sisters who are stalked and murdered by an unknown killer hiding in the attic of their sorority house. Sounds basic? In a way it is, but it's the details that make this movie stand out.As a fan of horror movies, I have a great deal of admiration for this film. I enjoy seeing the beginnings of the horror genre. The cast of characters gradually being reduced in numbers as the movie comes along, the building tension, \"the final girl\", the various kills and the escalating terror as the sorority sisters slowly realize that there is something very wrong happening. It's like looking at the skeleton of an ancestor to Tyrannosaurus Rex and looking at what bones are going to gradually turn into which ones and what traits were deemed unnecessary so they were dropped until the creature in front of you became this legendary killing machine. From a fan of horror films, this historical aspect ranks about 3rd on my list of \"favourite things about Black Christmas\". I'll get to #1 in a bit, but my #2 isn't the familiar aspects. It's the sort of precursors to some of the familiar tropes in slasher films that are quite different in their primeval state. For example, the main character in the film isn't very clear at first. Are we going to be following the killer? Is it going to be Margot Kidder's character, the sarcastic, drunken girl who appears to kick-start the plot? Usually the protagonist of the film is \"the virgin\", so maybe it will be Claire (Lynne Griffin), who leaves the party early when she is offended by Barb's lewd remarks? Maybe it's Jess (Olivia Hussey), the recipient of the obscene phone call that is our first clue as to who the killer might be? Just as there are some points in the film where your familiarity with slasher films will help you deduce some developments, the fact that this movie doesn't adhere to many of the clich\u00e9s (because it predates them) makes it often unpredictable and unconventional as far as films of the genre go. You'll be surprised to learn, for example, that the killer in this film does not have a signature weapon, that we don't really learn a lot about who he is and that there's really not much blood in the film. Just when you think you've got this movie figured out, it throws you for a loop, and I like not knowing where a plot is going to go.You're probably wondering what the main appeal, my favourite thing about this movie is. Well, it's the fact that the film is genuinely frightening. There's a very naturalistic look about the film that brings home the terror. The movie doesn't begin with a fresh face going to college for the first time and being introduced to a slew of characters, some of which act funny from the start to indicate they might be the killer later. It starts at Christmas time. All of these characters know each other, they're all busy doing their own thing, and it's like you're coming in uninvited to peep in on the action (in a way that's similar to the killer). When we hear the phone ring and learn that it's a strange man making lewd phone calls, and that he's been doing this for a while, it's not really a grandiose shock to the characters, they've heard it before and yeah, it's creepy, but it's not a big deal. It really feels like these people have a life outside of the events of this movie. We hear several off-hand remarks of other crimes that have happened around the campus, and we have no way of knowing if they're connected to this plot at all. This helps make the identity of the killer even more mysterious. Has he been murdering people for a long time and he's just now coming into contact with these sorority sisters? Is this the first night and the other events are just coincidences in the same way that you have coincidences all the time in real life? A lot of it can only be guessed because like the characters in the movie, you don't really get big bits of exposition explaining the who, the what and the why of this plot. This lingering uncertainty as to what exactly is happening, and why, makes the conclusion of the film incredibly intense and unsettling. There are images of the killer that spook me every time I see them.\"Black Christmas\" is a movie that does suffer because it has been imitated so much, but there's a reason it hasn't been forgotten. It has some really genuinely frightening scenes, a lot of tension and also several humorous scenes to throw you off. I really like the comedic moments because just like in real life, when you get genuinely scared you do manage to find little nuggets of humour to try and steel yourself. You have probably heard some things about this film and wondered what the big deal was about, but watch it again, really watch it and I think you'll agree that it really is something special.

Not many know of this movie (yet), especially where I live (Italy), where it's rare to find (until Dec. 5, when the DVD is going to come out... I hope), but it's a real treat for horror movie lovers, and it takes you back to a time where Final Girls were still believable, the horror movies were thought out and original (heard that, Michael Bay?), and suspense, not gore, was a priority.The obvious inspirer of 'HalloweeN' (along with Italian thrillers 'Profondo Rosso' (1975) and 'L'Uccello Dalle Piume Di Cristallo', (1970) which also use the technique of the killer's POV), 'BC' conserves intact the power to scare you silly with a very simple storyline and almost no blood.The actors (which other than the above mentioned include Keir Dullea, Art Hindle and John Saxon) are also really great, and there is a subtle sense of humor throughout (just a quote: 'These broads could hump the Leaning Tower of Pisa if they could get to the top of it!'), and let's admit it, Christmas has always been a little *too* cheery, hasn't it?

In fact the least nasty of the bunch is probably the heinous killer who has some story to tell about Agnes and Billy which as many other reviewers have indicated, comes off less as an attempt to terrorize than as some little kids intending an attempt to entertain (however feebly!) or kids making \"prank\" calls and struggling not to laugh as an accompaniment or kids dead set on simply sending \"everything but the kitchen sink coming down the line\" as one reviewer comprehensively put it.On to accentuating the positive: The color is very richly saturated and the set design and lighting are nothing short of lushhhh, like Barb (Margot Kidder)! As a result, while you'd probably be making a mistake to date any of these sorority sisters, you'll make no mistake dating this picture: this is 1974 all right in all it's glory, with fashion palette ranging from mod to retro and in fact what makes this film really juicy is the heady flavors of '74. Why you can almost hold the aroma in your hand which emanates from the chicks of patchouli, rose oil and from the dudes English Leather, Brut and the like with which you'll be juggling the stench of blood, egg nor, the house mother's \"B for Booze\" which - charming if hardcore woman that she is, this broad drinks from out the toilet without any kind of rinsing of the bottle I guess she figures if it's a battle to the death between e coli and her saliva she's nothing to worry about with the egg nor, Xmas tree, various other fixings, etc. and the booze the other girls are drinking too, cause the house mother is by no means the only one drawing refreshment from the \"tis\" punch bowl! Kier Dullea is an evil conservatory composer/pianist whose blatant atonality and extended techniques while one would hope could convey a sense of menace yet even sweating and squirming on the piano which is practically smashing literally to bits during his performance he puts the jury assigned to hear his recital to sleep. Philistines! This movie is so funny cause of its 1974 vintage with all the young women being so potty mouthed, each wanting to be more outrageous and provocative than the last. well at least two or three of them would give any woman a run for her money in a contest for which of them is the sauciest lady of them all, verbally/orally that is. Visually though you may find yourself musing, \"I wonder who put up the poster that is the \"peace\" sign made of the pelvis and legs of a man and woman - the woman's are spread as the man appears to penetrate her from above, his legs tightly clamed together. By today's admittedly different standards it is the female of the species, aside from the \"bespectacled\" (as the reviewer who spoke of the kitchen sink called her one - i.e. Andrea Martin) one and maybe a couple of the others who bent over more in the direction of soft spoken, who would be charged with sexual harassment in this day and age! Is this a sorority house or a museum of erotic art? The place is, as a rule choka block with knick knacks - carousels, a collection of glass swans, etc. Ah the good old days! Were they so good?!?!?! \"Black Christmas\" raises this question without doubt.Well for one I was disappointed not even to see a composer credit in the credits for the spicy piano music. The IMDb indicates that the composer recommended sexy John Saxon for the roll of the top cop. Wouldn't it be funny if this composer actually in this instance proved to be the first cause of Mr. Saxon doing the many and various copious cop rolls he was eventually fated to you might say specialize in - let's call it of course a sub-specialty of cop in horror rolls! The last 2 shots were kinda cool. I didn't \"get\" who it was outside, I guess another ineffectual cop and why he didn't react to the phone ringing!! I'll give it a 10 for being an outstanding \"time capsule\" cause it really is more interesting in this way than many another bad movie or even good! :)",

            "content": "A psychopath stalks young girls at a sorority house during the holiday season in \"Black Christmas\". This Canadian made horror movie is by far the best of it's kind I've ever seen. It falls under the categories of \"killer is in the house\" and \"holiday horror\", therefore is compared to such classics as 'When a Stranger Calls' and 'Halloween'. The thing is that Black Christmas was made before both of those, yet never got recognition over the years. The plot is pretty simple. A group of sorority sisters get obscene phone calls around Christmastime. It all seems fairly harmless until we see one of the girls murdered and then stored in the attic by the killer. The rest of the characters go to the police to report her missing. After receiving more disturbing phone calls, the cops tap the phone to find out what location the calls are coming from. As the movie moves along, we see a few more people murdered leading to the shocking scene in which the lead character jess is told that \"the calls are coming from inside the house\".The plot sounds simple and has been done to death in eighties slashers, but Black Christmas TRULY does it best. So many things about this movie are done so right. The caller is not your average deep voiced creeper. His ramblings range from high pitched squeals about \"Billy and Agnes\", and get even more twisted towards the end. The sounds the killer makes when he's alone with the dead bodies is so unnerving, I've never watched anything like it. The suspect list is short and really only includes the boyfriend Peter. We see throughout the film that he is a very troubled guy and you really start to believe that he is the caller/killer.Despite this being a creepy horror flick, there are a lot of laughs especially from the character of Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) and Barb (Margot Kidder). Mrs. Mac is the house mother who loves her booze and loves her cat Claude. She has to be one of my favourite horror characters of all time. The acting is top notch from Waldman and Kidder, but also from our leads Olivia Hussey/Andrea Martin/John Saxon/Keir Dullea. Black Christmas is one of the most frightening and terrifying horror films of all time. It's got the premise of a slasher flick, with out the blood and gore. It uses shadows, creepy phone calls and a mystery in the story that leaves us in fear and with many unanswered questions. This film by the brilliant Bob Clark should be seen by all!10/10",

If you are a fan of ground breaking, CGI free original and pure horror this is the perfect film for you. After being at the upper end pricewise it has come down significantly in price.

It's based on a urban legend about a teenage girl babysitting children who receives telephone calls from a man who continually asks her to \"check the children\". If that doesn't sound like the perfect Christmas flick for the entire family, then I don't know. The actresses are both gorgeous and talented, but what I loved most about this movie is that unsettling voice that you keep hearing through the phone. It's genuinely disturbing and I didn't even understand everything he mumbled. The contrast between the Christmas/ holiday spirit with the dark atmosphere works perfectly. The movie isn't really that graphic but again, that voice will possibly haunt you for a while. Another interesting element is that we look through the killers perspective, which allowed to killer to keep his identity secret from the audience. The Slasher genre may have become a bit repetitive but don't let that stop you from watching this classic. Now I'd love to write some more but I have some calls to make.",

This movie was about a sorority house that becomes victimized during Christmas after an obnoxious prank caller would call up each time he would kill his prey.  The only problem with this movie that I have is it does not release the identity of the killer.  The boyfriend of one of the tenants had me fooled for awhile but at the end it left me guessing again.  And who is Billy?  Otherwise... I would highly recomend this one to anybody that likes a good scare, but don't watch it alone, this kind of crazy stuff is something that could happen anywhere.",

Catching up with it again now as an adult, it still sends shivers through me - even if I know what to expect.Before Bob Clark began wasting his time with low-brow comedies he fashioned several low budget horror films, of which this is the best and most adult. His skill in putting the screws to the audience's nerves is aided & abetted by a soundtrack that itself promotes unease, rich photography, and a solid cast.  While the story of a sorority house plagued by an unseen killer has been done to death (no pun intended), Clark did it years before the stalker film cycle of the late 70's / early 80's, and with much more talent than 99% of them.  The final 15 minutes are out-and-out terrifying, and the final scene, while open to debate - still haunts as a macabre joke.The story? It's Christmas, of course.  A sorority house is tormented by bizarre, schizophrenic obscene calls.  Soon, people begin to disappear. Who is responsible? Watch it. Just keep the lights on.",

BLACK CHRISTMAS is one of those movies that is an unsung classic and is most appreciated by horror buffs. I tried to get my friends to watch it, but they are all into gory, graphic horror opuses like SCREAM and URBAN LEGEND. Unfortunately, those movies have very few scares and are just cheap rip-offs posing as tributes to great films like this one. There really isn't anything to complain about for this movie unless you don't like movies that rely on suspense and hinted-at violence.One reviewer said this movie wasn't a slasher movie because BLACK CHRISTMAS wasn't gory enough. The gore in slasher movies is what ruined the entire horror genre. BLACK CHRISTMAS, HALLOWEEN, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the older films rely on suspense, mind-numbing suspense and require your imagination. People are spoiled by the gore effects in films now, sometimes the effects are gratuitous and don't move the story along at all! BLACK CHRISTMAS' story moves along briskly, dragging the viewer into it, making the movie seem so real!

            "content": "Here's the one I watched on Halloween but couldn't understand due to all the ruckus going on at the party. And now that I have sat down and watched it properly, I see exactly what makes this one such a classic.Black Christmas is one of those old school horror movies that knows what it's doing, unlike mostly every horror movie that comes out these days. The build-up is long and it sets a tangible mood - this is not a movie trying to rush itself into the blood and gore, which is not really one of the focal points of this movie anyway. Yes, there are stock characters, and there is some thin human conflict going on between them, but you actually care about these characters, and you don't really want to see them die. What a novel concept, right? This makes it all the more disturbing as the stalker's phone calls escalate in insanity and as the bodies begin to pile up. The acting is really good for these kinds of movies, too, with great performances from all of the characters.And goddammit, those phone calls get really, really creepy! I mean, I know what you're thinking; \"oh, wow, a phone call, how can that be scary,\" but no, it is scary. I won't spoil the reasons why for those who haven't seen this gem yet, but the atmosphere of the whole thing is blackened, haunting, claustrophobic and memorable as Hell. This is all very believable, leaving no room for anyone to laugh and pan this movie off as unrealistic or silly. This could happen to anyone! And that, in a similar manner to Halloween, is perhaps the scariest thing about this movie.From before a time when horror equated to ridiculous special effects, gory amputated limbs and torture chambers, Black Christmas hits you hard no matter where or when you watch it, with a ferociously creepy mood, a calculating, dark atmosphere and just enough pizazz to have you looking under your bed this Christmas eve to make sure that there aren't any bogeymen coming to get you.

Hasn't anyone seen any of Argento's stuff? Geez. Much of the POV stuff had been done by him, including in Bird With the Crystal Plumage - which was done in 1970. Even Argento probably wasn't the first...almost everything new draws on something from the past. Don't get me wrong, Black Christmas and Halloween are both excellent movies, but even Carpenter said that Halloween was his Argento film, or somesuch.I guess what was new here (maybe?) was that no explanation was given for the killer's motivation, and that adds to the creepiness. This is something that Halloween took and ran with - so much so that Michael Myers has NO lines...I saw Halloween on TV in the early eighties when I was in elementary school - and I remember that part above all disturbing me: WHY did he kill? Why would anyone DO that? And why doesn't he TALK? :) I think when horror movies are wrapped up neatly it deflates any sort of hold they might have had otherwise (\"if it wasn't for those darned kids\").

Margot Kidder gives a wonderful, hilarious performance as the perpetually drunken sorority member. And Olivia Hussey is worth seeing as well for her solid performance. One major thing that should be noted is that this movie preceded Halloween by a good four years, and it seems obvious now how that movie was influenced by this one.

Hell, Cube & Saw kind of got the ball rolling on that, but at least those people had SOME kind of chance of living. Thanks a lot, Eli Roth. But I digress.Ah, the 70's slasher film. Is there anything more pure? Before the 80's came in and Friday the 13th perverted the original depth into mindless splatterfests, the slasher film moved on mood and atmosphere (Texas Chainsaw Massacre excluded, that movie is just f***in awesome). Bob Clark's Black Christmas takes the horror to not only a supposedly harmless environment such as the sorority house, but also to a holiday more harmless than baby holding a puppy that's licking a bunny. This harmless environment, in turn, gives the film and even more terrifying feeling, as if it was invading a world that God never intended it to cross into.All slasher villains have to have a gimmick, and have needed one ever since Michael Myers donned his stylish emotionless white mask. And although Myers will always be my favorite, Billy by far is the most intimidating one I've ever seen... er, \"seen.\" Why? Because all he is is a voice, an eye, and a shadow. That's it. When's the last time you watched a horror movie and didn't see the monster? Billy has no gimmick, and he doesn't need one, because he is f***in creepy all on his lonesome. He doesn't even have a standard weapon! Don't worry, I won't tell Agnes what we did.As far as the acting is concerned, stellar performances all around. John Saxon was way on in the movie, more than he was in A Nightmare on Elm Street (easily). Margot Kidder was a great drunk (I'm sure she's experienced). To the main point: I was concerned for the safety of EVERY character, a MAJOR rarity in the slasher film. There's usually at least one or two meat puppets you're couldn't care less about, but not a single one in Black Christmas. If you can find one, tell me who it is! Black Christmas is everything that I wish slasher films today would be. Moody, dangerous, dreadful, and with more depth than just a knife into the chest, Black Christmas easily presents what the slasher movie needs to recapture. Please, untie that guy from the chair and give him a chance. You'll still get him, just make it at least SEEM like you're not!",

Because it's all violence and a non-exsistent story.The story (warning, spoilers): The film opens at night with a small party occurring in a sorority house for a private school. We are introduced to all of the girls in the sorority house, the main ones being Jess, the heroine of the film, Barb, a drunken loud mouth, and Phyllis, Jess' friend and the peace keeper of the group. The girls have been receiving mysterious phonecalls from someone they call \"The Moaner\". The calls start out sexual in nature, but they gradually grow more macabre, with the man on the other end saying strange things in different voices. The shyest sorority girl, Claire, goes upstairs to pack, and when she goes into the closet, the killer dives out and wraps a plastic bag around her head. He then drags her into the attic, and puts her in a rocking chair. The next day, Claire's father comes to pick her up, but nobody knows where she is. It becomes a mystery as the police search for the missing Claire. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mac, the house mother, stumbles upon the killer and gets a crane hook in the face. Meanwhile, Jess admits to her boyfriend Peter that she is pregnant, but she's having an abortion. He begins to act strange, and shows off some anger problems. As Barb and Phyl are murdered by the killer, Jess gets another call. The police trace the call and realize that the calls are coming from in the house. Instead of going out, Jess goes upstairs and is attacked by the killer. She manages to escape and heads to the basement. There she runs into Peter, who she now falsely believes is the killer. He approaches her to talk, but Jess hits him over the head and kills him. The police feel the case is closed, and leave the house, leaving Jess alone to sleep off the excitement. As the credits begin to roll, we hear the phone ring once again.Now, this film has major plot spoilers, such as(warning, more spoilers): Police arrive at the home but make no effort to search it, despite two bodies having been undiscovered. (Also noteworthy is that an officer notes \"The local morgue cannot handle this many bodies.\") The deranged killer is able to repeat lines of dialogue from other characters on the phone, though it seems almost impossible he could have heard them despite being in the house. Despite the parent of one victim being around for the entire movie, no one suggests searching for his daughter when the mystery appears to be solved and she has not been found. Police leave the final potential victim alone in the house sleeping. (Sploliers end now)Basiclyy, this film is all blood and no story. Even though Halloween, (1978) is a rip-off of it, (in my opinion), it's all far better movie.",

The end is the slasher genre equivalent to \"it was all just a dream\". Basically, YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS DOING THE KILLING AND WHY! WTF!? HOW UNSATISFYING CAN YOU GET? Most, at least the entertaining, slasher films have a twist, or a reason, an impetus for the killer's motivations, that's 90% of the story, and why you want to watch. the production values were pretty decent, and the actors all did their parts decently, but with no central thread holding what they're trying to pass off as a story this is a big pass, and only for those who are horror film buff completeists.

A group of girls (including hotties Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder and former \"SCTV\" regular Andrea Martin) staying in their sorority house over the Christmas break are plagued by bizarre, obscene phone calls from a schizophrenic maniac hiding up in the attic who begins knocking them off, one by one.  Clark, famous mainly for directing \"Porky's\" and the much-beloved (and much more family-oriented) holiday movie \"A Christmas Story\", started his career directing horror movies (he also directed the psychedelic zombie flick \"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\"), and he knows how to create an unbearably creepy atmosphere.  He builds up so much tension and suspense towards the end of this one that it practically overwhelms you.  The freaky phone calls and the disturbing open ending are enough to stay with you for days afterward. Clark and writer Roy Moore also manage to inject some much-needed humor into the oppressively gloomy script, provided mostly by Kidder's profane, heavy-drinking character, Barb.  Art Hindle, Keir Dullea (`Dave?' from \"2001\") and horror movie veteran John Saxon also star in this sorely underrated thriller.HIGHLIGHT:  The chilling moment of discovery when the heroine finds out that `the calls are coming from inside the house!'

            "review_title": "A great slasher film - Sadly underrated",
            "content": "Horror films have a bad reputation for being completely senseless and lacking a sense of artistic integrity. I'm not going to lie, some of them do fall into that category. However, there are moments in cinema history when you get a film that defines the genre. Something that is so good that it transcends the usual trappings that hold films of its kind down. A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, The Exorcist, Alien, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are just a few of the horror gems that are well made and also very scary.The story is quite simple. At a sorority house, the girls are getting ready to go home for Christmas but begin receiving phone calls from a strange caller who won't give his name. The next day, many girls leave, but one who should have met her father doesn't turn up, which causes great concern for her safety. When another girl goes missing, the police begin searching the area and find a body nearby. Meanwhile, with only three students left in the sorority house, the phone calls continue, getting more and more menacing each time, but unknown to the remaining members of the house, the caller, and perhaps the killer, is closer to them than their nightmares could ever imagine.Keep in the mind that the killer calling his victims before he strikes them practically began here. Some might tell you it started with the original When A Stranger Calls, which was actually released a few years later, and it certainly took place before Scream, which was released in 1996. Black Christmas was the first to effectively use this technique and I must say this film uses it the best. While, menacing phone calls can get tiresome in some thrillers, the calls in this film generate fear and tension with each one that is made. They gradually become more violent and disturbing, to the point that they're almost unbearable. This isn't someone merely playing a game, this is someone with deep emotional and mental problems. The phone actually becomes a character itself because for most of the film it's our only link to the killer. We learn very little about him but what we do learn about him is through his acting out on the phone. I guess you can say the phone is an extension of his character.I also liked that this film believe less is more. There is very little blood and most of the violence is implied. Sometimes a visceral approach to horror can work but I think horror is most effective when they leave a lot of it up to the imagination. Your mind certainly creates a more disturbing image then they might've even shown.Speaking of the killer, he's probably one of the better ones to appear in a film of this nature. The most fascinating thing about him is you don't know anything about him throughout the film. The fact that he has randomly chosen to strike these girls makes him all the more frightening because it proves that sometimes crime is unexplained and completely unprovoked. You never really get a clear look at him, since he's merely a voice on the phone or cleverly shrouded in darkness but he's still a very powerful presence. The fact that he's seen rarely makes his few big \"appearances\" all the more terrifying. I'll provide two pictures of his most frightening exposures in the film and i guarantee when you see it, even after seeing these, those images will still stay with you long after the film is over.Halloween is commonly known for its effective opening scene which a steadycam shot that is supposed to be the perspective of the killer coming upon the house. That technique was made popular in that film but it was used first here and it's actually used often to great effect. The camera is constantly giving you the sense that danger is approaching and it's a very simple but effective technique. A lot of the film is seen from his perspective so it becomes very interesting to view a film through the killer's eyes.No good horror film can work without engaging leads and Black Christmas certainly has a pretty good cast. Olivia Hussy, who at this time was very popular due to her turn as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, is a very likable heroine. She differs from most because she's definitely flawed and is nowhere near perfect but it also makes her all the more human. She's able to carry the film and while she's not the strongest actress around, she certainly handles the task at hand very well. The rest of the sorority girl cast consist of mostly unknowns but Margot Kidder, who would go on to play Lois Lane, is featured as one and quite funny as the booze hound of the house. John Saxon, of A Nightmare on Elm Street fame, appears here as a detective and is always a welcomed presence in anything he's in.Black Christmas is pretty hard to find in stores. I had to get mine on amazon but if you can try to catch this film. It's simple, effective and very scary. It should be given more credit for its role in shaping the slasher genre and maybe with the release of the remake this year, the original will get its much deserved mainstream attention. Check out Black Christmas this Halloween season, you won't be disappointed.",

It's a frightening and scary picture.In January this year though, i bought the film on DVD as a creepy childhood reminder, it has lost none of it's power but now that I'm in my late twenties the effect isn't the same. but i will watch it at least twice every December.

Some argue that the first ever slasher made was Mario Bava's \"A Bay Of Blood\" which came out three years earlier from \"Black Christmas\". If you are a fan of the genre I would definitely recommend it since it does contain heavy elements common to the genre but nevertheless \"Black Christmas\" has a look that is considered modern even today. It has all the ingredients that make a great horror film: creepy atmosphere, tension that never lets go, nice camera work, eerie soundtrack and a nice mystery. There is even some dark humour thrown in. You will not be bored for even a second.

And then, the creepy, crude calls began.The creepiest moments were when a girl named Claire Harrison decided to pack her stuff and leave the sorority house and suddenly, she could hear someone was in the closet and when she approached it, she was suffocated with plastic and the killer dragged her body through the trap door of the attic. And when morning came, the girls went outside to go look for her, and sitting in the rocking chair next to the camera [ close to the window of the attic] was little Claire with a plastic bag over her head!!! The second one was when Mrs. Quate went throughthe trap door of the attic and before she could do anything else, a hook went through her head! And another was when Barbera ( Jess's friend) was murdered by the killer when he came into her room and got hold of the horn of one of the glass unicorn figures!! And the last one was when Jess thought the killer was arrested and gone, he still lurked in the attic with Mrs. Quate with a hook in her head the cat and strangled Claire Harrison. And then, the telephone rang again.THE COPS NEVER FOUND HIM AND THE OTHER TWO BODIES!!!!!!!!! And Jess and the cops thought that it was her boyfriend Peter who was doing all the murders! To make things sound scary, the killer never shows himself in this motion picture. The only thing we get to see are his light green eyes. And to make things worse, Jess receives calls that came from the upstairs when she doesn't know it. DARN IT! You can hear the victims being strangled, suffocated and murdered!!!

The results were original at the time, but even today, aware of all the clich\u00e9s attributed to Slasher cinema, the film is still quite chilling.Set in an old dark sorority house during the festive season, a group of girls are brutally murdered by the raving lunatic that resides within the attic (Margot Kidder among them, who also starred in De Palma's Sisters, 1972, then found success as Lois Lane in Superman, 1978). The film even manages to mix horror and humour involving a buffoon excuse for a cop, Margot Kidder and John Saxon's detective character. The red herrings are characterised very well leading you to wonder whether it's Olivia Hussey's eccentric boyfriend (Keir Dullea of 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968) or the \u0091escaped mental patient' that kidnapped and killed a young girl remains a mystery right up to the tense finale. During the film mechanics are used effectively, especially the now familiar \u0091caller is inside the house' routine. These are where the scares really lay. The foul-mouthed killer screams abuse at the girls down the telephone, occasionally snorting like a pig and mumbling something incoherent about a boy and girl called \u0091Angus and Billy'. The film ends with the fact that it is neither, but a deranged maniac who can only presumed to be Billy.The ending was intentionally left ambiguous for a planned sequel. It is even suggested that Bob Clarke, who then chose to do comedy, allowed John Carpenter to pick it up where he left it. As we all know what finally materialised wasn't Black Christmas 2, but the Daddy of the Slasher, Halloween (1978). This is one of the best Slashers, but definitely gets the award for the best psycho killer at Christmas, leading the way ahead of Silent Night, Deadly Night or Don't Open Until Christmas (1984).",

We are also aware that a psycho killer is lurking outside the house, and makes his way in through a window in the attic. Soon, he begins his reign of terror which includes threatening phone calls (oh god, I was freaking out during those scenes!)...and murderous attacks on the girls. There isn't a lot of blood or nudity, but this film is so incredibly frightening and scary and pumped with atmosphere, every horror fan should love it. Let's not forget that creepy piano score and the lovely girls, Olivia Hussey as beautiful heroine Jess (man, that girl can scream!!!), Margot Kidder (who does a hilarious job as Barb, an alcoholic chain smoker), and there is also Lynne Griffin (who was in \"Curtains\") and Andrea Martin (\"Cannibal Girls\"). This is an absolutely awesome movie! Rent it! Buy it! Cherish it!",

Something I'm amazed my millennial jaded mind thought capable of a 70s movie.There are elements of this movie that were brought up decades later in the #metoo movement in how women's safety when it comes to domestic cases, is almost always very poorly understood and resolved.It also happens to be on Christmas!

            "content": "The film opens with a creepy POV cam shot of a person spying through windows and proceeds to scale up the lattice to an open attic window.Four girls Jess, party animal Barb, Phyllis, Clare, and Claude the cat are harassed by a obscene caller they dub \"The Moaner\" alone in a sorority house under the care of a drinker house mother named Mrs Mac. The calls have begun a day before Christmas Eve. When everybody is getting ready to spend the holiday weekend with family or friends or boyfriends.This same day Phyllis has promised to go skiing with Barb and her parents, Clare plans are to be picked up by her father, and Jess wants to meet her boyfriend Peter before his piano recital whose stressed he hasn't slept for three days.But that night when our home invader kills Clare before she can say goodbyes to her sorority sisters and her boyfriend Chris and hides her body in the attic, and her father comes to meet her at the appointed time at the university, well, it puts a damper on everyone's holiday weekend plans because Clare will soon be officially a missing persons report on Christmas Eve.Between harassing obscene phone calls Mrs Mac, Barb, and Phyllis are forced to delay plans and reluctantly play host to Mr Harrison taking turns even. Jess goes to the conservatory to drop the big bomb on poor Peter before his recital no less, she is pregnant and wants an abortion. Peter disagrees and believes it is a choice they both need to make but his argument doesn't make much head way and Jess makes him promise to stop by the sorority house after the recital to discuss their future plans in greater detail. Hey, there is a pattern here stay tuned.Christmas Eve, Claude the cat found Clare and is kind enough to lead Mrs Mac to it. Clare is officially reported missing to Lt Fuller (John Saxon). Lt Fuller organizes a large search party of volunteers and police to comb a local park and the surrounding neighborhoods with the assistance of Jess, Barb, Phyllis, Chris, and Mr Harrison. They find a dead body of a girl but no Clare. Peter bombs his recital. Returning back to the sorority house it is evident to our trio of girls that Mrs Mac has left the building. Barb who is nearly obscene as \"The Moaner\" finally crashes from two straight days of hard drinking. Jess receives another bad call and reports the phone stalker to the police when in steps in Peter who had been waiting upstairs. They argue Jess isn't going to give her planned future but Peter wants to give up his doesn't want to be a concert hall pianist anymore and neither wants to work at the conservatory anymore he wants to get married.Lt Fuller arrives to set up the tap passing a departing Peter, learning that the sorority house has two lines, one in the living room and hall and the other in Mrs Mac's room. He also stations a patrol car outside. Two fails to track the phone stalker but the killer drops a quote of a statement Peter made that same evening. Uh-oh. Jess and Lt Fuller are coming to the same conclusions. Lt Fuller follows this lead to a destroyed piano in the conservatory and Jess's greatest fears are allayed by Phyllis who reminds her that Peter was visiting them when the phone stalker dialed them up making him the suspect impossible.This films suffers a lot of errors in continuity and gaping plot holes. If the phone lines are only in living room, the hall, and Mrs Mac's room how is the killer moving around undetected? There isn't a phone jack in the attic. And how come the girl's failed to hear him yelling from Mrs Mac's room? And how did he leave the house, kill patrolman Jennings, and get back inside the house undetected by the sorority sisters nor the search party outside? Yeah, he could of went back down the lattice from the attic window and again back up? Still... I ain't buying it. Unless our killer is a flipping ninja yeah that is what he is. *Gives self-induced facepalm* D'oh.This is a classic slasher maybe deserves a better rating but I didn't find it all that scary, but rather silly, I didn't appreciate how forcibly determined the film chose to misdirect me. Actually, it would have been an improvement to this film if Peter did indeed suffer a mental breakdown leading to a homicidal psychosis. Keir Dullea fit the role like a hand-in-glove.",

It was called \"When a Stranger Calls\" (for TV) and they must have cut some of Margot Kidder's lines like \"You f***ing CREEP!!!\" which she says into the phone with such power and conviction that it makes me crack up whenever I hear it. Yeah, I kinda made a sound bite from of it.I still had to grab a blanket, cover myself and put my feet up on the couch when I saw the video release a few years ago. Of course I only make it worse while watching it in the dark. The only other movie that even comes close in creeping me out is \"Omen\" when Mrs. Baylock's face appears as she goes after the mother. A 7 out of 10, this movie ranks in my top 5 of the most frightening ever.",

            "content": "Best known for directing \"Porky's\", Bob Clark also directed \"Porky's II\", \"Baby Geniuses\" and \"Baby Geniuses 2\". To be fair, he's also the director of a decent zombie film with an excellent title: \"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\". And of course of \"Black Christmas\", a film that has all good films should have: an inspired screenplay, good actors and excellent camera work.Olivia Hussey is the star of the film. She was mainly cast and admired because of her leading role in Zeffirelli's version of \"Romeo And Juliet\". \"Black Christmas\" isn't the weirdest film Hussey is in: you can also spot her in Metzger's \"The Cat And The Canary\", Kinji Fukasaku's \"Fukkatsu no hi\" (a.k.a. \"Virus\") and \"Turkey Shoot\" (a.k.a. \"Blood Camp Thatcher\"). You'd almost be more surprised she recently played Mother Teresa. Olivia Hussey is excellent in \"Black Christmas\" as Jessica (Jess) Bradford, the pregnant and terrorized girl in the sorority house. Don't be put off by the fact that \"Black Christmas\" takes place in a sorority house: this isn't the sort of film where scantily-clad bimbos are chased by a maniac with a set of knives. The film actually bothered about something called 'plot' and most characters have (at least a little) depth. A welcome change.Also noteworthy is the camera work. The hand-held camera allows us to look through the eyes of the killer, four years before John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" did the same thing. The cameraman had to climb up and down the occasional stairs, which often looks silly because of a hand-held camera, but \"Black Christmas\" does an okay job here.Back to the cast: Keir Dullea (\"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and a handful of cult movies), Margot Kidder (\"Superman\" and \"Sisters\") and Art Hindle (best remembered for being in Cronenberg's \"The Brood\", but also in Clark's \"Porky's\" films) are just a few actors in a film where most people do at least a decent job. A special mention should be reserved for John Saxon (who starred in more cult films than one could name), who accepted the role of Lt. Fuller when the original actor (Edmond O'Brien) seemed unfit for the role. Saxon flew to Ontario and rushed to the set, just in time for his first scene (in the middle of the night).One might argue why \"Black Christmas\" needed the subplot of the missing girl, but it's effectively used in a handful of scenes. The naive policeman is there for comic relief, but not the brainless sort of humour one often finds in horror films. If you look at the IMDb message board for \"Black Christmas\" (but don't do that before you've seen the film) you'll notice the film is vague enough about the identity of the killer, which allows the viewer to guess whether the killer is one of the main characters. So is (s)he? For the answer to that question, I refer you to \"Black Christmas\", one of the better horror films of the 1970s. Don't expect too much, just sit back and let the film work itself towards an exciting climax and finale.",

When I first viewed this film in early 2001 I didn't think it would be as good as I was told. The film mesmerizing.The way the film was shot was so original but is copied by later horror films like \"Halloween\". The plot of the story was good and was scary but is copied later. The film is largely overlooked as a horror film but it is worth the watch. Olivia Hussey\"s performance is way better than the over the top Jamie Lee Curtis who unlike Olivia can't live up to her beauty and elegance of the role.

After all, a truly good movie doesn't need to be remade, no matter how old it gets.Black Christmas definitely was good enough to stay un-reimagined. It will appear dated to some, but for me this really played in its favor. Older movies often have corny dialog, but it feels more genuine than many modern horror films. Characters that are truly terrified don't constantly make wisecracks or seem otherwise indifferent to their situation.The dark mood of the film was set very early, and was gradually built upon until the finale. It did not rely upon \"boo\" scares but upon ambiance, situations, and general creepiness to convey the horror.If you want to see the roots of the slasher genre, or are just pining for a unique and excellent horror experience, then Black Christmas won't disappoint.

There are a lot of gimmicks and emblems that you can get about it: the attempts to trace the source of the phone calls, the phone calls themselves, Jesse's slowly climb up the stairs with the fireplace pocket in her hands, her lonely fight and run from the killer through the empty, old house towards the basement, the killer's shapes and his frightening and staring EYE behind the door, his hide-and-seek in the attic and his hysterical personality. All this means a great proof in the history of the Cinema. The cast is all perfect, the colours are brilliantly composed and I have a special devotion to Mr. CLARK, the director, simply a genius. My compliments to his courage facing problems like abortion and violence between guys, on Campus. All my recognitions to the incomparable and beautiful Hussey's performance.

It was only recently that I have discovered that the identity of the killer was intentionally distorted so that we could never arrive at any definitive answer. Some might find this frustrating and annoying but it is the antithesis of the standard \"slasher\" flick. I cannot place this in that loathsome category. Since it was released before Halloween it cannot be lumped in with the rip off junk that followed in the footsteps of the John Carpenter film. He has obviously \"borrowed\" a lot from Black Christmas but it is hardly a copy. What is genuinely creepy and unsettling about Black Christmas is that it feels very plausible, with no invincible killer to be found in a hockey or some Halloween mask. It scares me more than The Exorcist. What distinguishes this from other films of the genre is that we sympathise with the victims. Each kill is shocking and disturbing. Many years ago I had the opportunity to meet Kier Dullea when he appeared at a Q & A for a screening of 2001 at the theatre where I worked. I regretted afterwards not mentioning Black Christmas (or whatever title it started with) and tell \"\" You were in the scariest film I have ever seen. \"",

I saw it some months ago for the very first time and was pretty in the middle by it (this is because i don't have the fear of horror-movies anymore and some movies take so long to get going and gets me a bit out of the experience sometimes) but this movie is creepy! First person camera, amazing kill with suffocation, manages perfectly to hide and revela VERY LITTLE of the killer's look! The sounds from the phone pretty creepy and disturbing to this day! Didn't see a lot call-slashers besides Scream but this one is creepy! That dead suffocated body on the chiar from the attick looks real as hell! Totally recommend this one as something for Christmas for horror, especially slasher fans! Didn't see the remake, but this movie still knows how to be scary, to have mistery and to let things unsolved letting the viewer wonder what followed! Yes, contains some spoilers but nothing major!",

It's about money and selling, stop with this Aristotle approach to everything movie people do, like their philosophy is law. Example >>> The first victim (who is smart but scared when hearing the phone call) hears something in the closet and is nervous. Instead of running out of the room screaming she walks ever so slowly to the closet and the camera shows the killers point of view through the plastic that covers clothes from the cleaners and uses that same plastic to kill her. No, I repeat NO ONE does that. That's the sensible college people? He needs to say they are sensible and then show them with no sense! No one checks the house and so forth. He stumbles around and whacks things in the attic that everyone would hear in a house yet nothing is done. He lifts a dead weight body through a two foot opening into the attic from below, NOT, NEVER EVER!!!Look, it is a slasher film without the slasher. What bothers me is the analysis and reverence some movies get at times and it is really unbelievable.It is an okay movie, John Saxon is always good. The rest, well, good for a look at the late 1960s early 1970s things. I know people will be scared and they are always scared and the funny thing in most of these movies if actors watch them or directors watch them they don't get scared, most anyway, that speaks volumes. Oh, all this killing and they dont go into the attic to look and check for more bodies, REALLY, REALLY. THAT IS MOVIES AND WE ALL WATCH AND PUT THESE PHONIES ON A PEDESTAL!Boring movie at a time when joy should be number one!P. S. The so called killer is almost 40 and in school, really.",

I contacted the author by e-mail, and he replied by saying \"Gosh-darn it....I STILL haven't seen that movie\". If you love well-made, classic horror, please see this movie. Scared the CRAP out of me when I first saw it in the '70's. Still does today. The scene that still fills the viewer with dread is when the heroine discovers her two friends dead in the bedroom, and when she tries to force the door open and falls down, we see what was blocking the door.....and he's staring psychotically at her through the crack in the door.....

It was a recommendation, 'My favourite horror movie of all time...the scariest movie I have ever seen.' So I had high hopes. I thought it might even scare me. I watched it with a friend, and by the end we both felt confused, and I was a little angry. The ending seemed almost incomplete. I didn't understand how anyone could end a movie like that. The rest of the movie was great. Good plot, incredible actors, and, although it is not a comedy by any means, there was a good deal of humour. We did enjoy it, to an extent; we walked around for week shouting 'Billy!' randomly; but we just didn't quite get it. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me, and I had to watch it again. I had to find out what was going on. I thought maybe I had missed something the first time. I didn't. But for some reason, I liked it more than the last time I had seen it. And this rings true for me each time. It just gets better and better. The ending certainly hasn't changed, but I love it now. It's the best and most shockingly unexpected ending I've seen since Sleepaway Camp. This movie has worked it's way into my head, heart, and to the top of my very long list of favourite horror movie. If you've not seen it, then I suggest you get a move on and get your hands on it as soon as possible. (In time) You won't regret it.",

I don't think that the similar ties to this and Halloween matter all that much they are different enough and they each build up the atmosphere of dread in their own way.I think that Black Christmas is the better film, the acting and direction in this film is excellent and the film takes its time to build the sense of danger rather than have the killer hacking his victims from the opening credits. The murders in this film are also more effective than in the remake because you don't see that much, the violence is implied rather than shown and it is far more shocking than anything in the remake.The fact that you don't know who Billy is or why he is stalking the girls in the house makes him a far more creepy and disturbing killer than those in the films that have followed Black Christmas - the unknown is far more scary than what you see, hence why all the slasher sequels in the 80's and 90's where not really that good when they start to focus more on the killer and less on the victims.The ending was nice and vague and I'm glad there was never a sequel as it allows you to ponder what happened after the credits rolled. To me the film has aged very well, even if the quality of the picture hasn't whether those who are used to the made slashers and repulsive gore of recent films will like it I don't know, but for me this is a classic well worth seeing.",

            "content": "Don't ever confuse this with the antagonistically wretched 2006 remake. The original Black Christmas is a masterful, progenitive slasher film that constantly tests my loyalty to John Carpenter's Halloween. Like that latter film, Black Christmas' strength is in its simplicity: a demented killer is making disturbing (and I mean DISTURBING) phone calls to a snowbound Canadian sorority house, sleepily populated by a skeleton crew of Christmas break stragglers. Little do they know, the calls are coming from inside the house.A major trick that elevates the simple plot, however, is that, even though we know from the get go that the calls are coming from inside the sorority house, the film is scant on so many other details that we feel as in the dark and uneasy as the characters. Our interest in the film is sustained throughout because we want to know what happens to these people.That brings me to my next point. Surely odd for a slasher film, the characters in Black Christmas are well-drawn and the performances that fill them are top-notch. Olivia Hussey (one of the most beautiful women to ever grace the screen) and Margot Kidder are, of course, the obvious stand-outs, as the grave and level-headed Jess and drunken, sailor-mouthed Barb respectively. However, there are other remarkable players here, including Marian Waldman in a delightfully hilarious role, genre veteran John Saxon, and Art Hindle, who went on to play a fantastic leading man in David Cronenberg's not-so-fantastic The Brood.Overall, the film is seeping with classic '70s style and atmosphere. Even the minimalist score, with its quiet, brooding sustained notes, reveals a bygone flair for film-making. Lastly, the phone calls the killer makes have to be heard to be believed. If you were scared by Regan's possessed ramblings in The Exorcist, Billy's psychotic shrieks will have you trembling for days.",

The term \"slasher movie\" barely exists. Now watch Black Christmas and you'll see just how innovative and scary it was and still is.An unknown figure breaks into the attic of a sorority house as it clears out for the holidays. Amongst those left are; Jess, who is pregnant and wants an abortion and Barb who is a foul-mouthed good-time-girl. Before long, the house mates receive some VERY obscene phone calls (which are virtually the sole reason for its rating). Then, one of the girls disappears...Whilst this may seem generic, it is still pretty groundbreaking by today's standards. Most of the killings are never shown and corpses are never found; the park-search scene is very effective for instance. Characterisation is strong; Jess' abortion and her boyfriend's despair at it is pretty dramatic. The level of humour is unusual, without edging into comedy. The killer himself (who we never see at all) is one of the most frightening characters in cinema; a nut-case who screams wildly, reenacts bizarre domestic situations and has a very disturbing back-story to do with a baby.The script is fresh, the direction is tight and is basically just damn scary. Black Chistmas is arguably my favourite horror film because of these reasons.",

Instead this film haunts your core with it's realism. The idea that a crazy man has snuck his way into your attic and is stalking the women living there is intense alone. What makes that scenario even more frightening is there is no mention of a reason for this man to do this to these innocent college girls. The score is a top 5 of mine in cinema history. A great mix of horror and classic Christmas songs. The actors on top of it are amazing or a slasher film. You build a strong connection with the characters thanks to the amazing writing.

I think that Black Christmas is a little bit inspired by a strange slasher film of 1973, \"Silent Night, Bloody Night\". But if B.C. has a merit, is to be original for this time, it has a twist-end and it's the first Canadian slasher, with good and popular actors (Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder and John Saxon). In 2002, the sequel from this film was supposed to be realized (by Bob Clark again, I think, and with Olivia H. and John S. back in their original role) and I was waiting with big fun for this but it didn't come (like in 1975 when B.

            "content": "The girls of a sorority house are being harassed by disturbing phone calls during the Christmas Holidays. In the first part of this Canadian film, the calls seem like a prank from a perverted stranger, but after the disappearance of one of the girls, Clare (Lynne Griffin), things start to get really serious. The police are involved, a little girl is found dead in the park and the viewers follow a stalker lurking inside the sorority house. Bob Clark using this original and interesting concept, manages to create a cult classic and a must watch for every horror movie fan.Although the movie earned a cult following for its creepy atmosphere, brutal kills and ambiguous ending (the last phone call just before the end credits), many fans do not dive deep enough. Do they miss an important clue hiding in the plot? Is there a hint somewhere that leads to a whole different interpretation of the characters?During the second act of the movie the viewers have a chance to learn more about the characters, their dreams, their motives and their behavior during extremely stressful circumstances. The girls of the sorority house are not the sleazy, boring and lustful teenagers we are used to watch in almost every other slasher film. As we get to know them, we discover that they are strong independent women who oppose the traditional and old fashioned men they are facing.Starting with Clare, as her father visits her room, he seems disappointed by some provocative posters, which were considered unacceptable for a young woman at the time. Barb (Margot Kidder) insults the psychotic caller, mocks a police officer with a hilarious joke and while being drunk, she provokes Clare's father as she is vividly describing turtle coitus. Our final girl Jess (Olivia Hussey) is definitely the strongest character. She refuses to marry her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea) after he devalues her dreams about her career, during a fight they have about her desire of an abortion. Bear in mind that ending a normal pregnancy was illegal in Canada during the 70s (\"Abortion Caravan\" - a feminist protest movement). Jess ends up killing Peter after he approaches her in the basement. That leads to Peter being mistakenly considered as the stalker and murderer of the sorority girls. Even the housemother (Marian Waldman), is tired of the pretentious disappointment of Clare's father and she is mocking him behind his back.Overall, many consider this horror/thriller a pioneer to the slasher genre, one of the most popular and successful genres in horror movie history that defined the early 80s with many big hits in the box office. In my opinion Black Christmas offers more to the viewer than the gore and the kills especially for those with an open mind.My favorite element of the movie is the characters. They are confident, self-aware, unafraid to speak up and really well written. The acting is also decent.My least favorite aspect of the film is some inconsistency in the plot especially during the phone calls. How can they not hear Billy screaming on the phone if he is inside the house?Fun fact, Black Christmas is also praised for its influence on John Carpenter's Halloween. Carpenter was openly a fan of the movie. Rumor has it that he contacted Bob Clark and asked about a sequel to Black Christmas with the title \"Halloween\".Black Christmas (1974) - 7/10 Stars.",

            "content": "Before Halloween was this little Canadian shocker in the 1974 that has long been overshadowed by Halloween which in part was originally perceived as a follow up to this film.The film takes place over the Christmas holidays which makes it the prefect horror to watch at Christmas, in fact the first time i watched it was about 2 days before Christmas eve!! It revolves around an unknown psychopathic killer picking off a group of sorority girls one by one in a pretty large and spooky house.Although Halloween is still one of my favourite horror films I can't help but notice that although it has stood the test of time fairly well it is a lot less scarier than it was all those years ago. This is not the case with Black Christmas. This film was made so well in so many aspects such as the music, the premise and the photography it still scares me to this day. In fact this is the only old school slasher film which I would have no hesitation in putting on to scare the living daylights out of someone in today's modern age.I seriously urge you to watch this film if you haven't done so already as this film is guaranteed to scare the crap out of you; and what ever you do \"don't go up the stairs!\"",

(The story behind how he got the role is really sad. You should seek it out.)There are too many red herrings that have no point to the story. The movie moves so incredibly slow. It keeps trying to take off and the lack of backstory and focus on the many flat jokes just yanks it down.I read all these praises about this movie and looked forward to watching this film. I don't understand the praise. Even amongst the genre it isn't that good. Compared to Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which came out months before this so don't think this is the first slasher, it is Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes.It doesn't hold up to movies of that genre's era. Many of the firsts people attribute it for, aren't firsts. POV cam was Alfred Hitchcock, the slasher (as a direct slasher movie) was probably Psycho and Peeping Tom in 1960. It could go all the way back to the 1910s.It didn't influence everything and is only famous because of the mishandling of its release and being around the same time as actual similar murders. Along with the spin machine that was Bob Clark.I don't enjoy criticising this movie. It is a fun watch up till the end. It didn't make a single piece of sense.You should watch it because of some of the great kills of famous actresses and the general story. It also has John Saxon. You can't go wrong with this movie to get a good scare. Just forget about the Swiss cheese plot.",

The decapitations? \"Black Christmas\" doesn't even belong in the horror section -- it should be moved to suspense/thriller. I realise we all have different likes and dislikes, and as a major horror buff, this didn't really match my likes. It had the potential to be a great film. The casting was good, the storyline was okay, and the camera-work was fabulous, but it just didn't work.To start with, the film doesn't have the timeless quality that makes a true slash flick, or even a horror. In 1974 this movie was scary, but even by the time I first saw it (1981), horror (and in particular slasher) had been sculpted and re-done with the two \"Halloween\" movies, and even a couple of the Jason Voorhies flicks. \"Black Christmas\" tries to imitate the true slasher king, \"Psycho\", in its picture scenes and mystery, but the conclusion of the movie misses the mark by a mile. I won't ruin it for others, but I will say this -- if you aren't extremely disappointed, you didn't get the movie.As long as you're not expecting a horror flick, you won't be that disappointed. Basically, it's not a half bad movie, but it's certainly not that scary. Tim Burton's \"Nightmare Before Christmas\" is far scarier than this one. 4 out of 10, and that's only for the incomparable Olivia Hussey.",

It will be worth every minute of your time.Black Christmas is a Canadian horror film and the second that I've had the pleasure of seeing. The first being The Changeling, which has a very similar tense and eerie atmosphere. However, Black Christmas definitely appeals more to a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour so it's definitely the funnier of the two films. The jokes are really well done and do a marvelous job of lightening up the mood at appropriate moments. But that's not to say that the film's more unsettling scenes aren't superb either. They're masterfully well executed, invoking mystery and suspense at every twist of the plot.The cinematography is fantastic. I am not sure if it was the first film to employ the use of a camera that could strap onto an actor's head but it's used to great effect in the opening scene of Black Christmas. The acting from Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, John Saxon and the rest of the supporting cast leave nothing to be desired. Everyone is clever and convincing as their characters. They feel very authentic and none of them had to resort to chewing the scenery, as is often the case with slasher films. I wish I could go into detail about the movie's more brilliant aspects, but it's far better than you go into this film knowing as little as possible. This film will keep you guessing right until the very end. It plays you like a fiddle the moment you press play but you'll enjoy every moment of it. Black Christmas is thrilling, terrifying and darkly humorous. A very different twist on your typical Christmas film.",

To be honest, the killings are not graphic at all (as to be expected of such an old film). I was a bit worried about it at the start (the film is made out to be a slasher movie) but it is not in the least bit gory.

The lighting is perfect the fact that the killer's face is never seen until the end, (but wait is she/he really the killer???) The acting is great and it has a fine cast for a slasher film, people who's fame really kicked in, or already had like Keir Dullea from Kubrick's 2001 which was prior to this. He was in his early 30s playing a kid in his early 20s. Margot's cocky and obnoxious sorority girl is great too.

            "content": "Christmas is known for the holiday of giving, but in this case it is the holiday for murder, as a loose killer enters a sorority house, hides in the attic and commences disturbing phone calls to the girls downstairs. The voice of the killer is elusive while at the same time quite chilling and unorthodox. Eventually, the killer begins picking off its victims one by one, and everyone is clueless as to who is responsible for these mysterious murders, suspenseful enough?Black Christmas clearly inspired countless clones, and like those worthless imitations, Black Christmas has its flaws and unexplained conclusions. The viewer never discovers the true identity of the killer, and though the motives are not revealed, eerie angle shots and offbeat music is replaced instead. Original? For that time, definitely.Spoilers...Spoilers...Spoilers\nFollowing one of the murders, the killer phones below and speaks with one of the girls depicting the horror and dismay inflicted upon its victims before their untimely deaths. Then, ambiguity is created as one of the girl's boyfriend closely resembles the killer by shadow, but this is only an illusion employed to hoodwink the viewer. Clever? You bet. Now, during the climax of the film, the girl goes upstairs against the orders of the police to get her sorority sisters until confronted by the killer. This scene is quite spooky, but nonsensical, because the girl was told that the phone calls were within the house, so going any other place in there is a stupid move. A folly on behalf of the director or a purposeful maneuver to show the lack of common sense on the part of the girl. Either way, the scene is set up for the viewer to take a look at the \"eye\" of the killer, and the vague revealing of its identity as \"Billy\" the other personality of one of the characters in the movie. The viewer is left trying to decide if the killer is the girl's strange boyfriend because of his lurking about the house, and his shadowing in the background, but it's not him! This is found out at the very end!The multiple voicings of the killer shows the schizophrenic mind of the killer at work, and motiveless reasons behinds its slayings. The killer takes great pleasure in tormenting its victims not only in its head, but also on paper. However, the killer lives on as we all find out with the girl escaping the attack, but lying drug induced in the house. Not very smart there, but the cops must believe the killer's dead, since the boyfriend was slain by the girl in self-defense. The bodies of the victims remain upstairs as entertaining tools for the killer, and adds more schizoids to its already depraved, twisted mind. An open-ending no doubt. Overall, the movie has its moments of dread and suspense via atmosphere and creepy score, but there are clearly loose pieces that are never clarified, unfortunately. Rating **",

            "content": "This is not just the godfather of all slashers, it's the godfather of all horror films. Black Christmas is a sharp edged gem that sadly never garnered the popularity that it's inferior ripoffs like Halloween did and in consequence never got the praise it much deserved. Depressing, really depressing.The director, Bob Clark, takes his time setting up a dark mood, and exploiting his eerie setting fully while giving us hints of slick style on the way (the killer POV shots and the slow motion). He also inter-cuts murder sequences with mundane events which makes the scenes quite effective. He gives us a solid script, excellent old fashioned suspense, and a strong atmosphere to rely on that oozes with an unrelenting creepiness.Character development sets this one apart from other horror films. Olivia Hussey is angelic as the film's resident Scream Queen. Her character, Jessica, is thinking about having an abortion; she's definitely not your modern day leading lady for a slasher film, which usually involves someone pure at heart, innocent and virginal. These troubles that Jessica goes through add depth to her character, making her impossible not to like and adding the reality of character flaws to the whole picture. The rest of the characters are given a lot of depth as well, and this really helps you sympathize for them.Music, like Halloween, is just as important of a factor as any horror classic. Perhaps it has to do with Peter, Jessica's boyfriend, being a pianist, that the scoring is a low and aggressive piano set. It's the part of the film that makes your creep bone crawl. Jessica receives a phone call from the killer, who shouts out \"Billy!\" \"Agnes!\" \"What your mother and I must know is...\" and other disturbing, seemingly meaningless quotes. His voice is dark, almost demonic, and uses multiple high and low tones that sometimes overlap each other. The question often comes up of whether or not the killer called \"Billy\", is possessed, or just very talented at what he does. The 2006 remake of Black Christmas, Black X-Mas, tries to answer every single question of what \"Billy\" is saying in the original, and explain his background. To do so completely destroys the purpose of Bob Clark's film, as the scariest aspect of Black Christmas is all of the things that you don't know. We enjoy wondering who the killer is, what his motive exactly is, where he came from, do we know him already? What is his motive? Where did he come from? Do we know him already? The film gives us just enough information and clues to chew on without providing straight out concrete answers. This allows the film to linger in our minds as we try to figure out what our own opinions are as to it's many mysteries. It's all in the mind, which is where the BEST creativity comes from (Blair Witch Project, Rosemary's Baby, etc). The lesser we see and the lesser we know, the better.Black Christmas was made before the thousands of clich\u00e9s of the slasher genre became typical, and has impacted American slashers like few others. Halloween has the mystery of who the killer is nearly down pat; it was a holiday horror with a stalker and anonymous phone callers. When a Stranger Calls took the nerve smashing concept from Black Christmas and used it for the opening act, where \"the calls were coming from inside the house.\" Many slashers to follow would use Black Christmas' \"Is that you?\" line when a character would wonder who is lurking about. Today, the creepy caller often gets spoofed (Student Bodies) or updated in the form of a less effective cell phone (Scream). This Canadian terror has influenced SO SO many artistic gems that it feels like a crime that it is rarely seen as the powerhouse it deserves to be acknowledged as. No doubt, if Bob Clark could've copyrighted the slasher movie concepts and clich\u00e9s that he created, he would've been just as famous as John Carpenter or Wes Craven, maybe even more.It's simple (like Halloween) and doesn't require any additions to make it stronger. It's damn near flawless for gods sake! It's a truly fantastic masterpiece of horror cinema, the best horror film ever made. We never find out the answers to the killings at the house. This may be frustrating to some, but it's really a concept of genius, keeping the evil untouched and ready to haunt our minds on the night of December 24th.",

            "content": "Having read several of the comments regarding this film and how it was so influential on many slasher films made since, I was expecting an outstanding thriller.  I must say I was not disappointed.  This was an actual scary movie!  The refreshing thing about this movie was it did not use extremely gory special effects or cheap sex scenes (although sexual innuendos are littered throughout the film).Aside from being a little dated (the 70's fashion was rampant) this film has really held up over time.  Having seen most (if not all) of the films referred to in the previous comments as having \"ripped off\" Black Christmas, it is obvious this film was indeed used as a blueprint for several of the \"slasher\" movies that followed.*** The following commentary contains SPOILERS ***Having said that I do disagree, however, with several comments made that John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" was a blatant ripoff of this movie.  Aside from a homicidal killer who murders girls during a holiday, I did not see a lot of similarities.  Granted the victims were killed in similar methods (stabbing or strangulation) but let's be honest - except in the numerous Friday the 13th movies where each sequel featured new and exciting ways to kill people (everything from hedge clippers to spear guns), there aren't that many ways a psychopath uses to kill someone in a slasher film (and stabbing and strangulation are pretty common).  But I didn't see Michael Myers playing with any of the victims long after they were dead (as the killer in this film did with Claire, the first victim, who he rocked in a chair from time to time).  I don't recall Michael Myers making repeated and lengthy obscene phone calls to his victims before he killed them.  In Halloween, there was no question of who the killer was at the end.  I didn't see the killer in Black Christmas wear a mask, steal his dead sister's headstone, or escape from an insane asylum.  So where, exactly, does the \"blatant ripoff\" occur?Slasher films all have a basic premise (psycho killer for various reasons stalk and kill helpless victims who may or may not have been a part of the killer's past) so you can pick any two films out of the slasher genre and draw similarities.  Granted \"Black Christmas\" was one of the first films in this genre and, as I mentioned earlier, there are remarkable resemblances between this film and others (most notably the opening scene of \"When a Stranger Calls\").  But I would hesitate to say any one slasher film was a \"blatant ripoff\" of another.  Even the original \"Friday the 13th\" had enough differences from \"Halloween\" to avoid the \"blatant ripoff\" stigma.The Bottom Line: Black Christmas is a very good and effective thriller with an undeniable influence on the entire slasher genre that followed it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good tingle of the spine.",

            "content": "Primary slasher film? I don't think so, Mr. Clark. \"Black Christmas\" had the potential to be as well-done as the ultimate in slasher/stalker films, 1960's \"Psycho\", but it fell short of it's mark with a weak, fairly non-existent ending. The build-up in the movie is well-done, with very little of the nudity and gore that marks the modern-day horror film, but the plot is full of holes, and the theory very lukewarm.Where this movie does excel is in the casting and acting. Olivia Hussey, probably best known for being the nude Juliet in the 1968 version of \"Romeo & Juliet\", brings her character to life in her portrayal. Hussey is always a treat to watch, as she is one of the most talented actresses to hit the screen in years, but her \"Black Christmas\" role falls shy when compared to her role in the 1979 remake of \"The Cat and the Canary\". Even her roles in the fourth installment of the \"Psycho\" series, and Stephen King's televised \"It\" were better written than this particular role.This movie made a name for itself in the mid-seventies with the abortion storyline, which is one of the many reasons it still survives to this day. No, it's not the worst movie ever made, but to call this movie a \"slasher\" film is grossly inaccurate. The focal point of a slasher film isn't the blood and gore (a requirement), but the ending, which should leave the viewer feeling vindicated. Me, I got up and changed the channel. A 3 out of 10.",

Taking the police's help, they bug the phone and trace the call. The most hair-standing moments are when the last survivor of the bunch learns that the calls are coming from inside the house, stupidly goes in search of the killer, and after finding dead bodies, hears the psycho ranting once more behind the door and can see the man's evil wide eye peering through the crack of the door. I won't reveal the ending, but it will scare the hell out of you. This movie proves that you don't need tons of gore to pull of a scary film.

            "content": "This movie scared the be-jabbers out of me, and that is saying something.The plot is simple: girls in a sorority house are menaced by a psycho killer who, for reasons known only to himself, has set up shop in their attic. It's the Christmas season and most of the girls have gone home for the holidays, but three of the sisters -- Jess (Olivia Hussey), Barb (a fabulously foulmouthed and over-the-top Margot Kidder) and Phyl (Andrea Martin) remain behind with their house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marion Waldman).It seems that the house has been plagued with bizarre phone calls. Not exactly obscene, the calls tend toward ranting gibberish, insane laughter, horrible screams, and some kind of unholy crooning. The calls are one of the truly frightening things in the film; they pour out of the phone like the soundtrack to a nightmare, and you find yourself wondering why the girls don't just hang up. Sensibly, they call in the police, who come to put a tap on the phone.The first girl to disappear is Clare Harrison (Lynn Griffin), whose father sounds the alarm when she fails to meet him to be taken home for Christmas. The father, played to jittery perfection by James Edmond, spends most of the movie nervously asking cops, sorority sisters, boyfriends, and anyone else he can find, if they know what has happened to his daughter. Unbeknownst to the rest of the sisters, Clare has taken up residence in the attic, where the killer has posed her in a rocking chair with a plastic bag over her head and a baby doll in her lap.Clare is shortly joined in oblivion by Mrs. Mac, who makes the mistake of clambering up into the attic to look for her cat and ends up staying for eternity, suspended from the ceiling by a chain -- attached to a hook embedded in her throat. The psycho picks the girls off in a leisurely way, eventually leaving only the luminously beautiful Olivia Hussey -- who, according to the Horror Film Rules of Conduct, should be a victim of the killer because of a subplot involving the fact that she is pregnant and wants to have an abortion. She argues with her boyfriend, Peter (in one memorable exchange, he calls her a selfish bitch and accuses her of aborting the baby \"...like you were having a wart removed!\"); Jess eventually comes to suspect that Peter may be the killer because the killer begins incorporating bits of her arguments in his calls.Margot Kidder plays Barb a little too broadly for sympathy; at the beginning of the film, we discover that her mother prefers to spend Christmas with a new boyfriend (\"You're a gold-plated whore, mother,\" Margot snarls into the phone, scotch in one hand and cigarette in the other); this serves to explain why Barb spends the movie drinking, smoking, dropping double-entendres, swearing like a pirate -- and having anxiety-induced asthma attacks. By the time the killer gets to her, you feel sorry for them both.There are several memorably frightening moments in the film, but one in particular will make you squirm. In a classic early-slasher-genre trick, the phone tap reveals that the obscene calls are coming from inside the house -- specifically from the housemother's bedroom -- and a terrified Jess discovers the bloodied bodies of Phyl and Barb. In the bedroom with the bodies, an eye stares at Jess from a crack in the closet door, and the voice of the killer taunts her from the darkness. Jess slams the door on the killer -- who immediately begins to shriek in a way that suggests damnation and rage unfit for human consumption. The shrieking continues as he chases Jess around the house; eventually I had to mute the TV because I seriously could not listen to the shriek. It was that horrible.The end of the movie is as bleak as the contents: Jess kills Peter with a fireplace poker because she thinks he's the killer; the police break in and find Jess and the dead Peter in the basement. A doctor sedates Jess and puts her to bed, then insists on getting poor hapless Mr. Harrison to a hospital (\"This man is suffering from shock!\" -- which made me want to say \"Dude, what do you think that GIRL is suffering from?\") leaving Jess alone and sleeping in a darkened room.As the police cars leave, posting only a single cop as a guard, the killer climbs, chuckling, back down out of the attic and the phone begins to ring.The movie is atmospherically creepy, and the voice of the psycho is enough to give a person nightmares forever; there are a few spots where the director took the easy way out (\"The calls are coming from inside the house!\" prominent among them) but on the whole this is a hell of an effective horror movie.",

It starts as harmless background noise and, by the conclusion, becomes an ominous sign of horror lurking just upstairs. Olivia Hussey, Andrea Martin, and Margot Kidder star as sorority sisters plagued by increasingly threatening phone calls and eventually a mysterious and brutal killer. Though the film is utterly simple and lacks any thorough explanations of the killer's identity or motive, it is surprisingly effective in how it takes just a handful of elements and combines them to create an undeniably frightening film. In the end, it doesn't need to unmask the person committing the murders, and for very good reason; what he does is far more horrifying than who he is.",

But Roy Moore's screenplay and intelligent actually turn this problem into an asset by the murder juxtaposing with - among others - the girls laughing very loud about a present they've just given to their landlord and a group of young kids singing Christmas Carols. Not only does it explain why the murder goes unnoticed, it also adds some very dark, sardonic humor to the proceedings.

The comedic parts are just as great as the scary scenes too. Like when Barb (Margot Kidder) is describing to a cop the address of the sorority house as \"Fellatio 20880\". The ending, in my opinion made the movie even better. (Spoiler alert) Jess (Olivia Hussey) kills her boyfriend, thinking he's the killer. The cops arrive and let her rest.

When I finally came around to see the real deal from 1974, I was not disappointed.Many have said it, but I cannot do nothing else but agree. It sure is groundbreaking. The plot is quite silly with an all-girls sorority house that is stalked by a psycho killer. We follow the protagonist Jess, who in some ways are one of the first \"final girls\" ever.As the film progresses, one after the other of the girls and some other unfortunates are getting killed. They also believe that this someone is behind some very disturbing phone calls that the girls frequently are receiving.\nThe tone of the movie makes up for the plot though. It has a good mix between fun dialogue mixed with stable horror sequences. Most of the fun is credited to the housemother Mrs. Mac who is played by Marian Waldman. Mrs. Mac drinks, swears and is all-round fun to watch. She gives the movie so much when everyone else is more serious but have very boring and colorless characters.The real strength to Black Christmas is how its crafted. The camera is used in groundbreaking ways when it functions as the first-person point of view of the killer. The well-made movements of the camera make you feel that you see through the killer's eyes. Ways that are still used to this day. But here it was fresh. It gives it that horror feeling we all have learned to love. Another strength is the sound. The year before in 1973, former Oscar-winner Mercedes McCambridge did a legendary effort as a voice actor to give us the horrifying voice of a demon in The Exorcist. I would say that the voice of the killer in this Christmas classic is in the same class. It is so well-made and horrifying. The kills in the movie are gruesome for 1974 but not in today's standard. But that voice is still so creepy, freaky, and disturbing. Good job.But even if much of the film is still well made in the eyes of a modern audience there are some instances that really shows that it was made over 40 years ago. For example, one of the girls gives a little kid alcohol at a Christmas party and fellatio is still a word not everyone knows.The conclusion is this. It is a well-crafted movie but with a thin story. But what the film really excelled in is effectively portraying a killer with the help of camera and sound. It sure is an important work of art for the horror genre, but especially for the subgenre slasher which it helped create.",

Also involved in the story is 3 boyfriends, Peter, Chris, and Patrick, a drunker house mother, Mrs.MacHenry, and Lt. Fuller and Sgt. Nash. The girls get obscene phone calls, from a serial killer, who is hiding in their house, killing the girls off.The acting for the most part was wonderful, especially from Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, and Andrea Martin, the 3 main parts. Keir Dullea, John Saxon, Marian Waldman, and Lynne Griffin did good too. This movie blends together a dark frightening atmosphere, p.o.v shots, and some of the most frightening scenes in horror cinema, to create Black Christmas, a frightening horror movie that will keep you guessing from beginning to end, and have you actually be frightened for the characters, who you know are being stalked.Just don't go into watching it expecting a lot of gore, b/c the movie is based on suspense.This movie is definitely worth the $15 plus shipping on amazon.com. I give it hands down a 10/10.",

How this film hasn't gotten the recognition that it deserves, I don't know. I bought it last year, and recently watched it again. It gets more and more worth every penny each time I watch it. I would do ANYTHING do see it released on DVD. I would run a hundred miles to see it on DVD. If two films who heavily \"borrowed\" from it can get on DVD(Halloween, When A Stranger Calls), why can't this? Warner Brothers, you haven't had a hit in a long time. This is a classic, and more than deserves the DVD treatment. This is stuck in your vaults, and should be let out. If not for the fans that have already started a following, then what about the future fans? What about the teens who think quality horror is a bunch of people stripping down and dying extremely bloody deaths? This is a BRILLIANT film(and I hardly use that term) that uses hardly any blood, and no nudity-yet it has a stronger effect. Now that I am off topic, I will stop typing. Thank you, and good night. :)",

            "content": "I've read and heard over the past couple years that this 1974 thriller/slasher is really the start or beginning to the horror/slasher genre, instead of the 1978 blockbuster hit \"Halloween\". Well, I realize that \"Black Christmas\" was 4 years before \"Halloween\"...this is true. But, folks, after viewing \"Black Christmas\" it still is NOTHING compared to \"Halloween\"!! Anyone can come up with a good plot idea for a slasher and/or low budget horror flick. It takes the right actors, but more importantly the right cinematography, lighting, music, colors, sets, etc...that truly make the movie. I'm sorry, but \"Halloween\" still rules as the \"granddaddy\" of slasher flicks! \"Black Christmas\" was a fun and entertaining slasher to watch...but most of the time I was laughing and found it funny. Margot Kidder was hilarious and the rest of the cast had their silly or funny moments as well. The only two true freaky and pretty scary aspects to the movie were the first kill (the guy popping out of the closet with the plastic clothes cover) and the phone calls and/or the bizarre/terrifying voices and/or things said to the girls when they answered. Other than that, this thriller was not that scary nor did it really have me on the edge of my seat.\"Halloween\" truly was terrifying and much more \"realistic\". It used freaky lighting, bizarre music (the unforgettable theme), and much scarier kills than \"Black Christmas\". Therefore, it was much more popular and remembered...making it an instant cult-classic. Because of that it also will always be viewed as the real jump-start to the slasher genre. Don't get me wrong, I loved \"Black Christmas\" and enjoy watching it too--as I'm a horror fan and \"BC\" is one of my favorite editions. But...\"Halloween\" is still in a whole different realm and a cut above the rest of the other slashers--and will always be the alpha and omega of \"Boogey Man\" flicks! ;-)",

            "content": "I don't know if this review will have spoilers, but just in case I thought I better warn of the possibility. The acting in this picture is excellent, and the movie is not only scary, but sometimes downright funny as well. Olivia Hussey is an excellent lead, although I couldn't tell if she was attempting an American accent at times(She's actually British). Margot Kidder was very,very good. I must be honest and say that two things bothered me about the picture, and kept it from achieving greatness.One was the fact that the picture clearly attempts to pin the murders on one particular character, so much so that it soon becomes obvious that this person could not be the killer. Otherwise, the movie couldn't surprise us at the end with a different revelation. I think that if the movie had presented other characters as possible suspects, it would've worked better. The second problem for me was the behavior of the Olivia Hussey character at a key moment after she receives a phone call containing information that is crucial to her being able to exit the house alive. While 9 out of 10 people would've taken that information and literally run with it, she astoundingly does the exact opposite, making her a prime candidate for a Darwin Award in my opinion. Although one could say that she was only thinking of her friends in those moments, her behavior was a complete bummer for me, and caused me to lose sympathy for her. Apart from those 2 issues, the picture worked for me. Again, I must comment on how good the acting is. You simply don't see such good work very often in a horror picture. The direction is also quite good, with some great atmosphere. How did Bob Clark go from this to sleazy trash like Porky's?",

Okay on its plus side its beautifully shot, the score is genuinely chilling and the acting is excellent throughout particularly Olivier Hussey and John Saxon - the film also exudes a sense of menace and it ends without having resolved the plot which I like but can imagine putting off some viewers. But the bad points are very bad. Firstly the ridiculous noises coming from the phone were more humorous than scary with everything but the kitchen sink coming down the line. For scary sounds watch the Exorcist. But the worse thing about this movie for me were the murders where the camera breaks away from the scene as soon as the murderer attacks someone. Indeed some murders (such as that of the bespectacled female) were not shown at all. This is poor in the extreme and as a viewer I feel short changed. Its not that I want to see acts of violence - indeed one of the scariest films was 7 where no violence was actually seen being committed - it was only the aftermath that was shown on screen but it worked beautifully and warranted an adult rating but this film could quiet easily have been given a PG certificate. It was that spineless and certainly wasn't adult entertainment.",

            "content": "That Guy Had One Creepy Sounding Voice ManExcellent start to a Gothic horror plot. A man walks across the scene, but who is he? And why is he there? The narrative is convoluted at times like this. NKE could symbolize a culture counterfeit in American society. And the songs ... no Christmas spirit like this anymore, that's for sure. Hot damn! This is what I mean when I say \"culture counterfeit.\" The first line we hear is \"Hey, who left the goddamn front door open?\" love @@@@ like this. This film is NOT trying to be a film, it's just happening and a camera seems to be rolling. Then the camera shifts. And I Love how we see the POV of the killer in this one. Bob Clark is right on the money. Though why are we informed about a 720 train into the city? We're never going to go there. And where is Mt. Holly, is that a city name where Barb want to go? Nobody clues us in on these details. Like why does Barb drink? Why does she compare her sex life with a turtle? What is she alluding to. I want to know these things. Anyhow, I love Jess's \"Hello's\" in this one. She must have of said hello a hundred times. I will be talking a lot about Jess and Barb as we go further. First, the sorority house. How is Barb comparing this to a convent? Clark gives us a good jump scare, and later comes up with some clever ideas. Old clothes and old jokes, that's what we get with this film, \"old tradition vs modernity.\" We all like to drink during the holidays, but stringing lights on trees and caroling seem far fetched today. What this film reminds me to do is brush. Why else have a lady brushing her teeth shot? I ought to brush more, okay. So, anyhow, Jess dates a musician in this film. And I wonder why? How does this tie into the story plot? And doesn't Mr. Harris realize that college is about drinking and partying, at least more than 20 percent of it is. And 80 percent of it is writing papers. I think he falls into the later category. Clark has a good visual eye, I will say that, and he happens to be one of my favorite directors. The film focuses on abortion and premarital marriage a little, and I wonder about why the director adds this stuff in during a time of sharing and love. Peter really doesn't like his piano does he? Lol! Clark uses a lot of nice mid-range shots throughout the film, and gives some nice ones of the conservatory. Every scene is straight forward with no real intention to try to make money off of what the masses want, it's just Clark doing what he does best. Peter is fed up and wants out of the conservatory. \"He is an artist, he is high strong.\" I'm reminded here of father Karras in The Exorcist when he says he is losing his faith. So the idea of this struggle is constant with Peter. He wants the baby, becomes desperate, and tries to force Jess into marriage. So that idea is there. And faith is never with any of these people as they continue along their path, they seem to have individual goals and reasoning. Jess wears a crucifix and wants an abortion, so what's the reasoning behind that? About the acting. John Saxon makes this film really hold together. And he looks so good on film, big fan. There are just too many other things that are inconsistent with the plot. I would like to know more about the sorority sisters, what their major is? I would have scripted a few things differently, sure. Though this is a graceful film. I just wanted more space. Where always in the same place with Clark. Some shots are the same. This film becomes hard to follow and doesn't flow well. I found myself lost towards the end. Still a very good film!",

This is one of the best early slasher films out there, if not THE best.The thing that makes this film so great is the fact that it came before them all and was the first slasher film to use all of the conventions we know so well. In the opening, we watch through the eyes of the killer as he circles a house where a group of sorority girls are having a party. We heard his heavy breathing as he climbs up the trellis of the house and enters through the attic, events we have seen countless times afterward. Thus begins the film, which captivated me from that one scene and didn't make me lose my interest until the powerful finale. From the first phone call immediately following that scene, to the killer's heavy voice at the end as a shot of the house is shown, this is a stylish and suspenseful film. As usual, lovely Olivia Hussey delivers a wonderful performance and so does Margot Kidder as a foul mouthed and drunken sorority sister. One by one the sisters are stalked by the psychopath and he could be just about anyone. Hussey even begins to suspect that her boyfriend has something to do with the murders, but as the audience knows, the suspects never end up being killers. Full of weird and frightening phone calls, some great performances and clever dialogue, this is thrilling and truly original horror film, one of the first of it's kind, which makes it better than ever. This has been an obvious inspiration for numerous slashers out there, including Halloween, which was originally planned as a sequel to this film. This is a masterpiece of tension and a truly horrifying experience. The unconventional ending is also a plus and a very unexpected way to end the film. Turn off the lights, grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy. This is a definite must see...",

If you're one of those people that think that any movie that takes place at Christmas time is a Christmas movie, you won't agree with me, but really the only thing that makes it Christmas is that it's Christmas break so everyone is leaving, and that kind of gives an excuse for why you can't find people you're looking for.

(previous to watching this i watched Ammytiville horror with out flinching) weirdly, i clapped at how it made me jumped.As the film progressed i became more joyful as the kills became increasingly twisted. (something i seek for when watching slashers) Another reason this movie is good is because the plot is original, unlike most 70's/80's horror's. The only reason i didn't score this movie a perfect ten is because their is a lack of character development in my opinion, with non of the girls in the house being a sole victim or taking a lead in the film. One last thing i put Black Christmas down on is the obvious lack of comedy, with all the film being directly focused on the plot with not many, or no, jokes, puns or funnies. However, i understand some fans may be happy about this.in summary, a must watch for any slasher fan with a spare 2 hours on their hand, but beware, this is not a film for those who are jumpy",

For its time I think it's extremely innovative and definitely would've been a massive inspiration for John Carpenter when he made Halloween four years later. The beginning of the 1978 Halloween is definitely influenced by the beginning to this movie where we have a POV shot of the mysterious killer making his way into the house. This movie can be somewhat slow in parts but if you stick with it you'll find it enjoyable. The tension throughout this movie is incredible.

Being as it was only the second year, I also did my best to only watch film that were new to me so that I could get the fullest effect.I love the feeling of being scared by a film, but as I've immersed myself further into movies I find it very hard to be frightened anymore. I keep looking to find a film that can fill me with that same uneasiness and terror that films like Psycho did when I was younger. I am often disappointed. There are many good horror films that I can appreciate on an artistic level, but which don't reach me on a visceral one, and oh so many more that can't overcome the obstacles of time and hype.I had never heard of Black Christmas until this year. I had wandered on to IMDb disappointed yet again with a film that vowed to pack a punch, when out of the wilderness someone pointed to this film as one that had made their skin crawl. Being as I had been disappointed so many times before with similar claims, I tacked Black Christmas onto the Netflix list as a late night gory romp. I can't recall the last time I have been so pleasantly surprised.Black Christmas may seem like an old story at this point in time... murderous serial killer is making calls from inside the house...gasp...but even under the modern microscope I have to applaud the film. Never once do I feel like the director is talking down to me. The audience knows what's going on from the start. The story isn't meant to be a twist, but rather it wraps us up in this fear of knowing what is going on and being able to do nothing to stop it.The writing is wonderful, fresh and well acted with a good balance of humor that doesn't feel like it's trying too hard. What's even more wonderful though is what isn't said and what isn't seen. There is a mastery to this film in how much it lets the audience imagine, the what ifs and the images that it plants in your head without showing you anything.To me the film is a perfect blend of mental and emotional stimulation. And even after countless remakes and copycats, there were still elements of this film that were new to me. It felt like a blend of all of my favorite horror films without ever losing its own originality and entity.It'll be a long time before I can find another one as good as this.",

Mostly i don't agree with them because the movie didn't scare me.......The direction is very slow than i expected... First 15 minutes of the movie are not much interesting... But as soon as the killer starts to kill one by one... the movie was very interesting........You need to have more patience to watch the movie... But at last I am sure you will be terribly shocked.... Watch the movie till the end titles appear.... It won't disappoint you....Though, if you don't like my review... Please watch this movie... It is very good..... BLACK Christmas is a Good suspenseful thriller.......I give this 9/10",

            "content": "Black Christmas easily marked the beginning of the slasher genre heavily influencing films such as Halloween, When a Stranger Calls and Scream. and tons of other films have ripped it off as well. This is probably one of the best horror films ever made with an A list cast, perfect direction from underrated director Bob Clark (Porky's, A Christmas Story, Murder by Decree), Top Nauch Screenplay by Roy Moore, scary cinematography and an even scarier score. PLOT: A group of sorority girls at Christmas time are receiving disturbing creepy phone calls from an unknown person. when one of the girls mysteriously disappears, the girls worry and contact the police who don't take them seriously. when a 13yr old girl turns up dead, the police finally take the girls seriously as more disturbing phone calls happen, among other things. truly a terrifying scary film with one of the best endings for a horror film ever made. I saw an interview with the great Olivia Hussey (Romeo & Juiliette, Jesus of Nazareth, Death on the Nile, etc.) who played heroine Jess Bradford and she said it best. its what you don't see in horror films is whats really scary. the idea of something happening as to opposed to todays horror films that point blankly shove the killer down your throat with gore to boot. not thats bad but not every single film. I my self prefer a scary gory film and this is not gory but boy is it scary. Olivia Hussey, Kier Dulliea (2001 a space Odyssey) and Margot Kidder (Superman, The Amityville Horror) give the best and most effective performances. highly recommended. Im just glad that Bob Clark has finally explained who Agness and Billy are....;)",

With a decent cast staring Margot superman kidder and John nightmare on elm street Saxon, I found it to be very creepy especially with the Christmas back drop(come on Christmas is creepy)This most scariest thing about the movie is the maniac,with his phone calls to the girls and that he just want to kill for his pleasure.If there's anyone who wants late night scare i would recommend Black Christmas.I also hear there will be a remake of this movie in 2006 which when released should put some focus on the original and receive the credit it truly deserves.",

The atmosphere, the music, the plot, the ending... all of it is absolutely perfect.But what really creeps me out about Black Christmas is the fact that it seems like a blueprint for serial killer Ted Bundy's attack at the Chi Omega sorority house in 1978. Bundy was known for loving slasher movies and he fantasized almost 24/7 about violence against women. In fact, he was once shown the movie Friday the 13th in prison and he couldn't finish it because he got too overstimulated. So it's no stretch of the imagination to think Bundy saw this movie in 1974 and enjoyed every single minute of it.Especially if he was taking notes.So if this movie wasn't creepy enough on its own, just realize it probably served as an inspiration for one of the most notorious serial killings in American history. A lot of the details from Chi Omega are pretty darn close, particularly what happens to Margot Kidder. And if that isn't enough to make your skin crawl, you must be a thicker skinned person than me!",

To start off with you have the setup with a bunch of sorority girls in a sorority house (kinda obvious). But while they have a little party our unseen killer climbs up into the attic something which at that time would have still been original and i strangely found myself freaked out by this even though it's been done before.Then we have the disturbing phone call by one that the girls have called the moaner, and the call is disturbing and extremely obscene. Then we see the first house girl die and i still don't know who made the noises.Then we have searching for the missing girl when she doesn't show up to meet her father which is worse when we already know she is dead. You then have the usual and some more depressing scenes and death of another. Another depressing thing is when Barb is killed i felt so depressed, i mean Jess is downstairs and if it weren't for the fact that she was listening to carol singers then she would have known sooner to get out of there sooner and also worn Phyllis (not sure of spelling). And when at the end she is told to get out of the house as the calls are coming inside, and she does the exact opposite and goes up the stairs, I just immediately thought that that's it for her, she is going to die. The eye scene had me freaked but not as much as the ending, I just thought so sad for her and what is even worse that the killer still being in the attic, i just didn't sleep for the next two days.This is the greatest movie ever in my opinion and if you haven't seen it and like scary, intense movies then this is perfect.",

The dark interiors of the sorority house, the winter gloom outside, and the blanket of snow all contributed to the creepy feeling that permeates the film. A couple things -- aside from Barb's incessant crude sex talk -- annoyed me: Mrs. Mac lost a shoe as she was being dragged into the attic -- did anyone find it? Why on earth did the police not search the attic? And what doctor or cop in his/her right mind would not have taken Jess to the hospital?When I saw Black Christmas for the first time, I was disappointed with the ending. Upon watching it again, I find the ending nothing short of brilliant. For isn't it more frightening to suspect the killer is still out there (or *in* there, as the case may be), and isn't it more chilling *not* to understand the motives for his actions?",

My parents went to sleep right before it came on and I stayed up to watch it (which they wouldn't have let me in any way if they knew this movie!). This was the movie that put a deep dread AND fascination in me for horror movies and suspense/thrillers. It terrified me beyond words, yet as good horror movies do they take you for a ride that thrills you to your core. Man, I remember the unbelievable dread at the end of the movie and after it was over I remember saying to myself \"That was the most scared I've ever been\".There have been times as an adult that took me back to the horror that this movie implanted in me as a child....One night, sleeping in my apartment alone, I was suddenly awoken by my door opening. I slept in almost complete darkness at the time. I jumped into the \"fight or flight\" mode and the flight took control...I screamed and screamed like a little girl throwing my pillow at the unseen attacker! I was able to turn on the lights and I came to find out that the wind (during the summer with windows open) was responsible for pushing my door open when it wasn't shut all the way. I woke up my neighbors with the screams and commotion I made and they called the cops thinking I was being murdered! LOL Man was I embarrassed! But after it was over I remembered that that fear I felt was so similar to the fear I first felt when I watched Black Christmas all those years before.Another instance when, I was a teen, I remember watching a news broadcast which told of a stranger living in the basement of a family's house for several months before the family found out. I believe the man was insane and would come upstairs in the dead of night to sneak food and use the bathroom. Apparently he would go upstairs while everyone slept and watch them. He didn't hurt them, but MAN! That gave me the same creeps that this movie did. It made me search every square inch of my house, during the day with a shotgun! I guess it just goes to show that a truly good scary movie like this one can really get under your skin! Some folks give this movie a four, three and even two star rating, which amazes me. There really is no film that compares with this one for the creepiness and dread. I think that the younger folks who are more used to the modern horror movies just can't appreciate, I believe, the genius of the suspense, dread and insane-ness of this movie.If you are twenty five and younger, try watching this movie by yourself, alone in the dark of night. You'll then understand that feeling of deep dread and \"creepiness\" that will make you stop the movie, turn on all the lights and re-check the windows and doors and the closets and under the bed...and maybe even the attic if you have the strength to do so!",

What I find most disturbing is the voice or the voices of Billy and his confused which seems to be repeating a pattern of behavior which began with a past event and seeking help at the same time (while he does not do anything about it).One point which worths discussing is the point on misogyny in Black Christmas. The movie has enough points which justifies the idea that slasher, as a genre, tends to be misogynistic at least in its tone. It is clear that the movie points out the increasing independence of women. Women in Black Christmas, including the housemother, are portrayed as decadent in some way. Even the housemother who is supposed to take care of the girls in the sorority house has an alcohol problem and does not care about the concerns of the parents.Especially the character of Barb and her murder is a classic case of punishment of a decadent woman with a phallic object - as some critiques would put it.However, leading character, Jess, is also different from the standard virgin heroine of slashers. She has a baby from a premarital sexual relationship and moreover she wants an abortion because she chooses her career over building a family. While this is true, she is also the girl seemingly most rational and reasonable.Jess is not killed at the end of the movie; however, since Billy is still in the house, it might be assumed that she will not survive the night, then we may stick to the classical interpretation of misogyny. But I think that by choosing such an independent and rational woman as its lead, movie opens the way for various interpretations.",

The acting and production values aren't the greatest but the elegant camera movement, framing, editing and incredibly moody score(s) elevates it above a typical thriller.At times, the film flirts with derailment with attempts at levity. Admirably it doesn't rely on too many jump scares to achieve its objectives. Rather, simple techniques such as repeated shots of the phone, stairs and the deserted upstairs hallway contribute to the atmosphere of dread. The open ended, ambiguous conclusion is perhaps the most rewarding element of the film. No tidy, neat endings wrapped in a pretty bow here. One can easily notice the influence this film has had on another, more loudly acclaimed thriller, the original '78 Halloween.Films such as these two titles from the 70's along with the original 1960 Psycho are why I stay away from viewing any new (post 1980) horror pictures. Simply put, watching modern, mediocre attempts come at the expense of enjoying masterpieces of the past by numbing ones sense of shock, ability to be surprised and over familiarization with plot devices (the '96 Scream inadvertently made this very point).It's ironic to have discovered that the best way to get the fullest enjoyment out of horror titles is to severely limit ones exposure to them and to only select from the best. Bob Clark's 1974 Black Christmas is one of them.",

Some say this film was the first to set the tone for the entire slasher sub-genre and I definitely see why. All the familiar elements are there like the subjective camera shot, stabbing scene, clever and rightful suspense, and the teenage women.The one thing I loved about this film was the killer. We never see the him, that is, anything that can identify him. All you see is shots of his hands, legs, and a couples shot of his eye. We never find out who he is, there's just a passing mention that his name is Billy. Having subtlety in a villain makes them more a effective sometimes. You don't know who he is but when you feel his presence, you really do feel it. It's awesome.What I didn't like was the profanity. This film has a serious obscenities problem. The guy in the Santa suit swearing in front of children, the sorority girls cursing to police, I mean, what the heck? About half the people in this movie swear too much and this was in 1974!

Margot Kidder was my favorite because she's always drunk and talking . It was pretty much a given that she was going to die. John Saxon was the father of Nancy in Nightmare on Elm Street. He comes across as a detective. I guess it's his look. Olivia Hussy was in Romeo and Juliet. She's beautiful and there's no denying her great acting.Two, the phone calls alone are scary. They didn't have to use gore or many jump scenes to scare you. The phone calls made my skin crawl, especially when he says, \"Just like taking out a wart.\" You find out he had been listening the whole time or that he might be Hussy's boyfriend.Three, you never find out who the killer is or why he did those things. The bodies in the attic were never found. And you think you got the right killer and that Olivia Hussy is safe but she's probably about to die.Four, the scenes were original. Cellophane, a hook, etc...",

It's the simplest of stories:  a psychopath holes away in a sorority house attic and makes shockingly obscene and bizarre phonecalls to the unwitting housemates, who he proceeds to knock off one by one.  Sound like old hat?  SEE THE MOVIE.  This film understands that what we HEAR is scarier than what we SEE -- and what is hidden is more terrifying than what is revealed.  The sick phone calls, in which the killer assumes about a half dozen personalities (crying baby, nagging mother, twisted sexual deviant, scared little boy, abusive father, calm killer) compose the most frightening soundtrack since The Exorcist.  No other horror movie since has utilized sound so effectively.  Only, perhaps, The Blair Witch Project, with its use of a baby crying, demonstrated at least a partial understanding of how a single simple poignant sound effect is all you need to scare the silly putty out of the audience.   But Blair Witch is nothin' compared to \"Black Christmas.\"  This movie was originally called \"Stranger in the House\" when I saw it as a kid. But you can now buy the special edition DVD under the title \"Black Christmas.\"  It's a must see.",

I have fond memories of how much this one scared me...on the same level as the exorcist.  The thing that was the most frightening about this movie to me was how the killer accessed the house from the attic - a hole in the ceiling.  I had this same type of attic opening IN MY ROOM!  Whatever critters that lived up there kept me awake many a night wondering if there was a psycho killer in my attic just waiting for me to go to sleep so he could kill me.  I also thought the way in which Margot Kidder's character bought it was spectacular!  I've only seen this movie twice - the first time was 15 years ago and the second was 10.  I know that I am a more experienced horror watcher now and this movie might not scare me as much as it did when I was 15 (after reading all these comments I have a nostalgic yearning to see it again soon) but I will always get a delicious chill down my spine when I remember the attic opening in the ceiling.",

            "content": "This is one of those rare, little-known horror films that deserves to be recognized for its inventiveness. Though the story might seem like a terrible horror movie clich\u00e9 today, Bob Clark's Black Christmas set the bar, and the mold, for the American slasher movie, and it set it extremely high. Released a full 4 years before Halloween, its impact on contemporary North American horror films cannot be overstated. The story, that of a psychotic madman terrorizing a sorority house, is simple, straightforward, and terrifiying. The twist ending has been criticized by some for its ambiguity, but I think that the final 15 minutes of this movie are superbly done and rank as some of the most frightening ever committed to celluloid.To quote a reviewer whom I think got it right, BC is \"cold, classy, and straightforward.\" It is an absolute must for fans of horror thrillers, as it definitely is THE prototypical slasher pic.10/10Paul Voorhies",

            "review_title": "Great slasher film, one of the best, but it's no Halloween...",
            "content": "A lot of people talk about this film like it is the true unsung hero of the stalker/slasher film genre, even over the well-known and championed Halloween. I do think this is a great film and it does put most slasher films to shame, but it never comes close to honestly beating Halloween in terms of overall product.Some great directing and camera-work, not bad acting, bizarre and manic killer with no motive other than insanity and a few nice twists to keep the viewer interested make this a must-own film if you are a fan of the genre. However, I must insist, this is not quite as good as Halloween. Michael Myers' relentless and emotionless stalking beats the cackling, manic, obscene phone calling killer hands down. Add a superior soundtrack and you have a superior product, in my opinion.I noticed a few people on the IMDb making such audacious comments as: 'Halloween copied/ripped-off Black Christmas'. If I may be frank, that couldn't be more wrong. The only real similarity comes with the camera-work at the beginning of the film. This camera technique employed the pan-a-glide camera and Halloween made much better use of it and the POV shot. I can't put my finger on it and don't know exactly why but there was something distinctly wrong with the shots where we are supposed to be looking through the killer's eyes. In Halloween it felt right, in this film it felt wrong. Perhaps something to do with over-use of the technique. Halloween didn't use it quite as often and didn't have to rely on it quite so much, as it has suspense coming out of its ears from the amazing soundtrack and terrifying on-screen killer. Also, Halloween used more static camera shots watching potential victims, implying Michael Myers was watching but not confirming it, whereas in Black Christmas you KNEW he the killer was watching, because you could hear his breathing and the camera moved around much more. I know this is not the same in the opening sequence of Halloween, but throughout the rest of the film I feel the techniques are superior than Black Christmas.Still, this film IS great and if you do like Halloween, or any films of this genre, I urge you to buy this as it is brilliant.Ultimately, I think the difference is that Black Christmas is the start of the 'slasher' film genre, whereas Halloween was more a 'stalker' film. In Black Christmas, the killer never STALKS his victims. Even the female protagonist when she runs from the killer, isn't really stalked by him as such, as she hardly even runs away until the end of the film. The killer in this film waits for his victims to come to him and the suspense works in this way, where you wait for them to walk into their demise. In Halloween, the killer is actively stalking his victims, following Laurie during the day, going to Laurie's friends houses at night and killing them. So in this respect I guess that if you are more of a fan of the 'killer hiding in the closet' type of movie, this is for you, but if you are more a fan of the stalker type of movie, you will prefer Halloween. Or ask yourself this: what do you find more scary: a killer who you never actually see, even in the final stages of the film, or a silent but deadly shape, who remains off-camera until he strikes, relentlessly stalking his victim for no other reason than that he is pure Evil?But again, I really urge you to watch BOTH! Last note: Female protagonist in this film is FIT. MUCH fitter than Laurie Strode, so that's reason enough why you should watch this!",

            "content": "While I agree there are a very few instances in \"Black Xmas\" where the influence on Carpenter's \"Halloween\" can be implied, it's not, however a blue print for Carpenter's more influential(and more brilliant) work in \"Halloween\". Beyond the first few minutes and some camera work at the end,I find the comparisons coincidental and not easily attributable to either artist to begin with. It's also quite clear that these movies are not even attempting to accomplish the same goals. An example of a film whose tactics and story were clearly \"lifted\" from this tale would be \"When a stranger calls\".That having been said, \"Black Christmas\" IS a fine film. Clark succeeds in establishing a paranoid mood from the start with his very well done hand-held camera work, creepy understated score, clever lightning, and some fine performances. In short, \"Black Christmas\" is very worth seeing, but leave the comparisons to \"Halloween\" at the door they're really not as applicable as some would have you believe.",

            "content": "This little Canadian film has to be my favorite slasher film. While Michael Meyers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface & Chucky have all become horror icons the killer in this has not. Its understandable. You never actually even see the killer which makes it all the more creepy and makes anything he does unexpected.The acting in this film is very solid. Olivia Hussey does a good performance as the \"head of the sorority girls\" as does Margot Kidder. The height of acting has to go to the voice of the killer. He is probably the creepiest horror antagonist ever. The way he uses 6 or 7 different voices while talking to them and the fact that when you first hear him, he's talking about raping them. There is nothing creepier to me than that.Anyway, the plot is that a sorority house has these disturbing calls from this \"psycho\" and they ask to put a trace on where the calls are coming from, but not before a few girls turn up missing.The part that really got me on the edge of my seat was when they completed the trace and you realized \"hey, the calls are sent to this address but they're also coming from it too\", something that other horror directors would shamelessly use as a clich\u00e9 in future horror movies such as \"When A Stranger Calls\".Overall this has to be the creepiest movie I have ever seen (and I am more or less a \"horror junkie\") and I highly recommend this to fans of films such as \"A Nightmare On Elm Street\", \"Halloween\" & \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\".",
