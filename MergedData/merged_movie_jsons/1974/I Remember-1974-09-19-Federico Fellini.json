            "content": "This film is a life journey. Filled with indelible images: The peacock in the middle of the snow, the awesome vision of the ocean liner--and the blind man crying out: \"What's it like, what's it like?\", the belly-laugh inducing introduction to each of the instructors at school, the beautiful people, the grotesques. Like life itself, the movie can be perplexing and enigmatic, sometimes magical, sometimes, in the face of the political climate and history, frightening as \"simple people just trying to live get caught up in the times they were themselves creating\". I don't think any film I've ever seen has so completely captured with such profound insight and simplicity the experience of losing a parent: The visit by the father and son in the hospital in which the mother realizes the awesome finality about to approach, and the son is blissfully unaware in his adolescent \"immortality\", and the total feeling of quiet and emptiness as the father sits at the dining room table, formerly filled with joyful, loud, noisy life--now emptier than could have ever been imagined before--this whole sequence comes as a powerful conclusion to a stunning film. With a final coda a la 8 1/2, Fellini embraces the audience, telling them not to worry--memories go on, life goes on, changed, altered forever perhaps, but it goes on, beautifully, enigmatically, magically.",

            "content": "Federico Fellini's \"Amardord\" is a series of sketches about his youth in a seaside town Rimini in the 1930s. In this regard it reminds another favorite film of mine, \"Fellini's Roma\". After repeat viewing, I can understand why many viewers may not like Fellini, especially his so called \"later films\" -\"Amarcord\" may seem too crowded, too loud, too vulgar, too bawdy, and too self-indulgent. It is all true, it is. But so is life - loud but tender, vulgar but touching, self-indulgent but full of humor, love and compassion to the film's eccentric characters. It's been said a lot about memorable scenes and images in \"Amarcord\": yes, the famous peacock that spreads its plumage on the snow, a magnificent ocean liner that is been greeted by the townspeople, a local tobacconist - a woman of such size and proportions that it could be simply dangerous for the teenage boys to try and make their dreams about her come true. I love \"Amarcord\" - always have - perhaps, Fellini played all the right notes for me or more likely, Nino Rota wrote his best musical score for the film which could be the best score ever. My favorite image in the film Gradisca's (local beautician) walk accompanied by Rota's music. What is it in the way Italian women walk, the way their hips sway? Monica Belucci in \"Malena\", Sofia Lauren in \"Marriage Italian Style\"? And Magali No\u00ebl as object of every man's in Rimini desire-Gradisca (\"Help Yourself\").Wonderful film - by the power of his magic, by the light of his memory, the great master saved the town where he was young and happy. We can visit it as often as we'd like and it won't go away and disappear - Fellini's Rimini is captured forever.9.5/10.",

            "content": "Amarcord is an episodic coming of age film from Federico Fellini. The film might have some autobiographical elements but it is a fee flowing almost anecdotal film of eccentric characters including some buxom women in the village of Borgo San Giuliano in 1930s Italy where Fascism is on the rise.There is buxom Gradisca who runs a beauty parlour and arouses men's passions. Volpina the thin blond good time girl, the rotund and even more buxom tobacconist, the tiger like blond schoolteacher. In amongst this is adolescent Titta who plays pranks including on his father who gets extremely irate and his mother who always has to come to his son's defence.The other boys in the town regularly touch themselves and the local priest is obsessed with whether the boys touch themselves and accuses them of masturbating as soon as he looks at them.The film has fantasy sequences such as when a Sultan checks in the Grand Hotel with his harem. It has dark sequences as when Titta's socialist father is brought in for questioning by fascists and abused.The film consists of little vignettes, it opens with a sequence of puffballs signifying that the winter is gone. There is a sequence where fog is so heavy a man cannot find his house even though he is standing outside it.The film in some ways accompanies Fellini's 81/2 and lacks the tight narrative structure of La Strada. It does feel bloated and also strangely empty. This is signified by the ending because it just ends.",

            "content": "I never thought of this movie as carnivalesque, but you could argue about that.  I like to think it is surrealistic in the way that your memory can distort history and all that you once dreamed of or was scared of.  Those memories evolve into caricatures of persons, their behaviour and caricatures of situations.  We not only see Federico's memories, but also the supposed memories of people once surrounding him.Also this is said to be Fellini's most accessible film.  Well, I was 15 when I saw it first, and it is still one of my favorites.  About 10 Fellini-films later I read that this won the academy-award for best foreign picture, which I never expected, but think is quite rightly.  The many surrealistic scenes stick to the mind for decades.  Hilarious, tragic, oppressive (upcoming fascism: so most of it must take place just before ww2), nostalgic, poetic: there's something for everyone (and every age) to appeal to, while Fellini makes no compromises.  If this was higher-paced, you wouldn't have time to appreciate the details, the photography and the music (Nino Rota).  Don't look for a plot here.The cinematography (Giuseppe Rotunno) has comparable feel with some films by Mike Nichols (Catch-22 (1970), Carnal Knowledge (1971), Graduate (1967)). Rotunno worked with Mike Nichols on three films: Carnal Knowledge, Regarding Henry and Wolf.  And with Fellini on 9 films (e.g. City of women (1980)).  I don't know if this is relevant, but Fellini is said to have had a conversation with Mike Nichols during the production of Catch-22. Otherwise I can't think of many films that are comparable with this fabulous collage of events happening apparently in spring, summer, autumn, winter and ends in spring to conclude some cycle (generation ?) accompanied by beautiful distinctive music. Why o why can't we vote 11 :(",

            "review_title": "More intelligible and informed comment",
            "content": "I wrote the previous review having just walked to my room after viewing Amarcord. I was ecstatic, and my comments were vague. Now that I have raved, I would now like to show a few of this film's merits.I had previously thought that Fellini as a filmmaker had died after 8 1/2. His films following that seemed utterly pretentious, as if the director had lost his touch and was trying desperately to figure out what people had liked so much about his films (the exemplary masterpieces being La Strada, Nights of Cabiria, La Dolce Vita, and 8 1/2). I thought that he had decided that it was off-the-wall flamboyancy and densely-layered symbolism that made his films great, and that he was mistaken. I still think this is true for his immediately post-8 1/2 films (Giulietta of the Spirits, Satyricon, and Roma, to be exact). Then, I have now discovered, he made a new discovery.To be truthful, Amarcord is not much like his pre-Juliette of the Spirits films, his Golden Age. It is, in fact, a lot like the three films of his that I truly dislike, again, Juliette of the Spirits, Satyricon, and Roma. Amarcord, like those films, is quite flamboyant - the colors are orgasmic, as they were in those three bad films, the sex is exaggerated (sort of as if these films all took place in that fantasy world where Guido from 8 1/2 had his harem), and the characters are sort of typical or stereotypical.\nSo what is different about Amarcord? Well, I think the difference is sincerity. In fact, I would say that Fellini's major trait as a director is not flamboyancy, but sentimentalism. UH-OH! That dreaded word! To call a film \"sentimental\" is an insult. I do not understand this. In all his best films, Federico Fellini absolutely loves his characters. Often, you will notice that a director loathes the characters of his film, either loathes or just feels cynical and indifferent. This is the trait of such much-ballyhooed films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, The Matrix, Lola Rennt, etc. Fellini's characters are his children. A couple of filmmakers have restarted this trend, Paul Thomas Anderson of Boogie Nights and Magnolia fame is the best example. While I think that he is still a maturing filmmaker, he is already a great one. And even towards his most despicible characters he shows love. Anyway, back to Amarcord, the structure of this film is exquisite. It has no real plot line, which is great. Plot is unnecessary. I would much rather experience a world than a contrived story. Fellini has realized this forever. Even his first film, Variety Lights (it was co-directed, actually) has a lack of plot. The wonderful characters just exist, and you exist along with them. Amarcord's script is revolutionary. How to describe it... Actually, I think of Roma as Fellini's failed attempt to make Amarcord. It is a tourists' guide of sorts to Rome. There, Fellini tried to make a love poem to Rome while also mixing in a decay-of-Europe theme, and it never worked. It felt awfully forced. Amarcord also has one very serious subject: the rise of Fascism in Italy. Many critics have complained about Fellini not criticizing the Fascist Party in this film, but rather treating it kindly, for the most part. In fact, all of the characters whom you fall in love with in the film, except for one man (who we identify, though incorrectly, as Fellini's own father), love and support Mussolini. Some people are absolutely outraged at this prospect, believing that Fellini is doing a great disservice to his country. This is nuts! I think we're lucky he had any of his characters criticize the Fascist party, because, truth be told, the people of the Italian countryside loved the Fascist Party until after the onset of WWII (see Vittorio de Sica's rather pretentious _Two Women_ to see this; he actually creates a very unbelievable character to oppose the Fascists in that film). The same goes for the Nazis in Germany. The fascist parties of Europe helped them out of the Great Depression (and consequently threw them into a horrible war), so it is no wonder they were beloved by their countrymen. To say different is simply revisionist history.I don't have much more I want to say, although there is plenty left to discuss. This film is a masterpiece. And though it may be sacrilige, this is my favorite Fellini film. 10/10",

            "content": "\"Amarcord\" was the first Fellini film I saw, about two years ago. It was on TV at 4 o'clock a.m. and I was very sleepy, but I watched it till the end. I wasn't disappointed at all, and I do want to watch it again.It's not hard to say why this is considered one of Federico Fellini's masterpieces. \"Amarcord\" (which means \"I remember\" in the Italian dialect of Emilia-Romagna, the region in which Fellini was born and where the film is set) is one of the most dazzling, personal films you'll ever see. Though Fellini denied that the film is autobiographical (but agreed that has similarities with his own childhood), he made some of the most magic scenes in film history. Nino Rota's unforgettable music score is perfect to highlight the story of a teenage boy's daydreaming (and many other people) in the fascist 1930s Italy. There's a sentence written by the Brazilian author Machado de Assis in one of his novels that is suitable for this magnificent film: \"O menino \u00e9 o pai do homem\" (\"The Boy is The Man's Father\").A well deserved Best Foreign Film Oscar (Nino Rota should've won too \u0096 he wasn't even nominated!). 10 out of 10.",

            "review_title": "Fellini's easiest film to like",
            "content": "Out of all of Fellini's work, this feels like the one that comes from the purest, most innocent, and most nostalgic part of Fellini's mind. Born from his memories of his childhood in Rimini, Amarcord acts as a companion piece to his previous film, Roma, as well as feeling almost like a prequel to I Vitelloni. Largely about a group of young boys in Fascist Italy, it's a collection of memories and events strung together in almost dreamlike fashion from the end of one winter to the end of the next. It's also warm and inviting and endearing, one of Fellini's easiest to like meanderings through his brain he ever made.The end of winter in this town of Borgo San Giuliano is marked by the appearance of little natural puffballs flying through the air. There's to be no more snow, and life is to return to the little seaside town, and the residents of the town celebrate the oncoming spring by building a large bonfire in the town's central piazza capped by the witch of winter. Fellini uses this mass gathering to give the audience an introduction to the town and its characters. We see the group of half a dozen boys that most of the movie's action is centered around, mostly Titta along with his mother and father and his uncle. There's Gradisca, the town's most attractive single woman and hairdresser that the boys lust after. There's the large female owner of the tobacco shop that gets her own share of fantasizing from the boys. There's the young girl Aldina, the schoolgirl that another of the boys, Ciccio, is in love with. There's also Volpina, the local prostitute. These people revolve around each other as they welcome the new year in displays of humanity that involve the lighting of fireworks, teasing around the bonfire, and general rambunctiousness.The movie follows Titta through school where we get portraits of his teachers, all distinctive and commanding in different ways. He goes to confession where the priest asks every boy about self-abuse. He gets into trouble when he goes to the movie with his friends and urinates on a local man's hat from the balcony, his father chasing him around and outside of the house with threats of violence. His mother reacts badly and mother and father end up yelling endlessly at each other with mother threatening to murder herself because she can't take it anymore (which he never follows through on).One of the most interesting sections of the film is the treatment of Italy's fascism in the 30s. Titta's uncle likes to wear his uniform with pride, and the entire town turns out when an important fascist official visits, waving Italian flags, and singing fascist anthems. The town seems unified under the fascist ideals, but that night someone places a record player in the church's belltower that plays an anti-fascist theme and the fascists go kind of nuts. They run around in the dark until they all pull out their guns and shoot mindlessly and viciously at the record player when a key shot knocks it from its perch. The view of Fascist Italy has been surprisingly bright and colorful and even fun (with Ciccio fantasizing about the large floral arrangement made to look like Mussolini's face presiding over a wedding with Aldina), but the second that the lights go out and the outlawed music plays, the darker side emerges. Titta's father ends up the focus as he, absent from the celebration that evening because of a fight with his wife, gets dragged in and questioned aggressively, including some bits of torture. When he stumbles home we see the love that he and his wife have for each other that gets forgotten in their more heightened moments.Throughout the film there's an undercurrent of unrealized goals, especially around sex, and that's one way that it ties into I Vitelloni. Fellini's recollections of Rimini obviously have a special place in his heart, but it also seems obvious that he's glad he left. What he showed he loved of Rome in Roma is very different from what he shows he loved of provincial Italian life in Amarcord. He seems to have seen life in Rimini as a beginning, not an end. The boys are all on the cusp of manhood, but they get thwarted in their pursuits of women like Titta's moment alone with Gradisca in the theater or his small adventure with the tobacconist, both undone by his lack of experience. Gradisca herself can't find any sort of future until she marries a carabiniere at the beginning of spring in the film's final scene and leaves the small town forever. Ciccio's love for Aldina is never anything more than unrequited, culminating in a fantasy of Ciccio driving a sports car and flipping her off as he drives off. The family takes the father's brother, Uncle Teo (Tio Teo in Italian, which amuses me) who lives in a mental hospital out for a lunch in the country. He ends up climbing a tree and shouting, \"I want a woman!\" at the top of his lungs for hours until they get the doctor and nurses from the hospital to coax him down. There's so much wanting in this small town in this movie, and there seems to be very little actual attaining.People are floated along by dreams, stories, and lies. The local street vendor, Biscein, maintains that when a wealthy foreign sultan came to stay at the Grand Hotel he made love to twenty-eight of the thirty women in his harem. The people of the town revel in the might of the Italian state when they all row out into the Mediterranean in the middle of the night to see the state's huge liner, the Rex, sail by. The boys all have fantasies that drive to elevate their small existence in this small town.There's so much love in this movie for the characters and setting, and yet Fellini's satirical streak attaches itself to everything at the same time. It's obvious that Fellini has wonderful feelings towards the people he left behind, but he seems firmly committed to the idea that they should remain there for himself. The fact that it's in the past gives the film a melancholic and nostalgic effect that transcends the screen to the audience who can share in it even though the audience has never lived in a small Italian seaside town.Amarcord is like a warm blanket. Full of specific and wonderfully drawn characters, all circling around each other with a central theme to tie it all together, the movie paints a specific portrait of a specific time and place that is incredibly inviting. It's probably Fellini's easiest to like film.",

So, you probably will assume I am an idiot--that may be the case--the jury is still out on that one! However, I am not alone on IMDb, as a few others also have stated that they felt may of his films were overrated as well.So why did I like this film? Well, instead of the disconnnectedness and choppiness of 8 1/2 and the utterly depressing nature of La Strada (which I still liked) and Nights of Cabiria, this film was more enjoyable. I don't require films to be fun to be worthwhile, but I think all too often, depressing and unappealing films are elevated to greatness by critics simply because of these aspects. In other words, if the film makes you feel suicidal, critics ASSUME it MUST be good! So why did I enjoy this movie? Well, I liked looking into the old Italy of Fellini's childhood and observing all the interesting and quirky characters--I am a sucker for these elements. In fact, that is why I am a particular fan of the films of Marcel Pagnol--it's as if we are peeking into the private lives of ordinary but likable folks.",

The message which comes through is loving, and about the gaiety of life, embracing its madcap characters and moments - moments which will someday live in our memories, hazy though they grow, as little diamonds of light. I loved the scenes satirizing the Fascists and the Catholic Church, and they're all the more powerful in this context, where they are reduced in significance, and just another zany thing Italians dealt with (or deal with) in life. The film doesn't strike any major philosophical chords, briefly coming close as men peer up into the heavens, but the lines uttered as a poem by a construction worker are powerful (\"My grandfather made bricks / My father made bricks / I make bricks, too / but where's my house?\"). I may be in the minority here, but the film didn't strike me as particularly beautiful, though it was a pleasure to see Magali No\u00ebl (Rififi, La Dolce Vita, and many others). It held my interest, but lacked a big punch, even in its sentimentality, though I was always pulling for it, and loved the many references to Hollywood actors from the 1930's. Unfortunately, there is not enough depth here to consider it a great film, and Fellini too often indulged in caricatures and juvenile humor. Net, a mixed bag.",

            "content": "When \"Amarcord\" had it's American premier at the Plaza Theatre on East 58th Street in New York, I was working as the manager of The Paris Theatre, also on 58th Street, just 2 blocks west, behind Bergdorf's and facing the front of the Plaza Hotel.Both theatres were part of the Cinema-5 circuit of first-run theatres in Manhattan. I often took advantage of the pass privileges that theatres extend to one another and always attended every other theatre in the city to sample their fare.As I often worked as 'relief' manager of The Plaza, I was well known to the the crew there and had easy access to that theatre at all times. When I first sat through \"Amarcord\" during it's opening, I realized that I had just seen \"THE Finest Film Ever Made\". When I told this to others, I was often scoffed at. I was told that the 'Finest Film' hadn't been made yet. That was until the scoffers saw the film for themselves. Every friend I brought to The Plaza to see \"Amarcord\" was as enchanted with the film as I was.During it's opening run at the Plaza Theatre in 1974, I must have seen the film at least 50 times. I next saw \"Amarcord\" at an art house in another city in 1980. Yes, it was still the best film. In the 6 years since it's USA premier I can't say I saw any film better than \"Amarcord.\" Then, when it was at long last released on videotape in the 1990's, I purchased the tape. When I watched the tape I wept. Yes, it was STILL the finest film ever made. I DO think the world of \"Nights of Cabiria\", \"La Strada\", \"La Dolce Vita\" and \"8 1/2\". But \"Amarcord\" is more than just Fellini's greatest work. It is greater than ANY other film, made by any other person or group of persons. I know now, 27 years after I first saw this film, that I will certainly say, 27 years in the future: This is THE film that no film-maker can top...In my humble opinion, of course....",

            "content": "Federico Fellini's \"Amarcord\" is perhaps the flamboyant directors most entertaining and autobiographical film. His personal recollections on growing up in 1930's pre-war Italy under control of Fascism and the Church, are recorded with lively, colorful images. Fellini stylishly evokes his unique vision of provincial Rimini(Where he was born)through an adolescent viewpoint. The youthful irreverence, casual vulgarity. and tawdry exuberance of the characters flow unrestrained throughout the narrative. Fellini vividly recreates a carnival-like atmosphere filled with incident and observation. He excelled at constructing private worlds; distinct and spirited in their sense of community and place. In \"Amarcord\" childhood perceptions and improbable encounters are summoned via symbols, dreams, and illusions. Similar to Pirandello, the nature of truth becomes suspect. Fellini does little to dispel this notion. He once stated that 'nothing stifles the imagination more than a good memory'. Fabrication with Fellini often times blends  imperceptibly with reality. \"Amarcord\"(The title translates as \"I Remember\") is structured in a series of loosely connected tales. Detailed vignettes of public school shenanigans; curious instruction; and the hyper-critical approach of the church. Cinematographer Guiseppe Rotuno favors shooting with a short lense to exaggerate the perspective. He frequently films the sizable features of the actors in extreme close-up contributing to the film's overstated visuals. Fellini was notorious for his preference of using actors with strange and unusual faces. He favored grotesqueness over craft for the most part. (The majority of the cast were selected from amateur groups all over Northern Italy. \"Amarcord\" is filled with memorable and eccentric characters including a blind accordianist; a foul-mouthed midget nun; a buxom tobacco store owner with a penchant for young men; a lascivious and gaseous grandfather; Volpina the town nymph; Theo the sexually-repressed, mad uncle; and an ever present dim-witted street vendor. Erratic personalities who consistently insist on indulging their illusions. The film uses an on-screen narrator who comments directly into the camera about Rimini's storied past. The pedantic commentator's articulate and austere tone is comically undercut by some off-screen antics.(Ill-timed, loud raspberries; well-tossed snowballs; general heckling, etc.) In the course of the film, an array of odd processions confront the spectator from every conceivable angle. Several of Fellini's films share this infinite movement of characters. Much of the scenario is taken up by the presentation of these large groups of comic figures as they interact around town. \"Amarcord\", Fellini's last commercial success, is an elaborate nostalgia piece populated with exotic individuals. Endearing misfits who seem to fit perfectly in the director's unconventional universe. One may not know where Fellini is heading half the time, but that's part of his lasting appeal. And in \"Amarcord, make no mistake, Fellini is ALL over the place. KB",

With no real story line, we are offered a series of events....a collection drawn from his own experiences and I would suspect from his vivid imagination.While all the characters are interesting in their earthy approach to life and its problems, some of the episodes related are scarcely worth mentioning while others are quite outstanding in their appeal.  I like particularly the Greek lesson in which a little girl is taught correct pronunciation, the excitement of a celebratory bonfire with little boys playfully exploding crackers among unsuspecting villagers, a priest rather too interested in details during the confessional, Uncle Teo's eccentric behaviour and the rifle fire bringing down the bells from the belfry.There are magic moments too.  The builder afloat with friends on a calm sea looks up at the night sky filled with stars.   Turning philosopher he muses at the miracle.  \"What keeps all that stuff up there?\" he asks. and thoughtfully adds \"There are no foundations!\"Another beautiful moment is the announcement of Spring after the long cold icy Winter when Nature sets free all the fluffy seeds drifting about in the wind.In retrospect there is something in this film for everybody.  I am surprised how many of the little episodes bring to mind incidents in my own life which I have long forgotten.",

Although it looks at lives of numerous people in the small town, the focus is on a family that presumably is based on Fellini's own family. Apparently Fellini grew up in a family of Italian stereotypes. The mother fusses. The father screams. It's like a sitcom except that there are hardly any laughs. This is not high art. The humor is on the level of \"Porky's\" and \"American Pie,\" with lots of emphasis on flatulence, bodily fluids, and the female anatomy. The cinematography is colorful, but there is no plot here to sustain interest; it's a series of disconnected episodes that soon become tiresome.",

It entertains some Italian clich\u00e9s (in a way that only an Italian could get away with), makes some serious points about the awfulness of fascism, and plays with the contrast between the eternal notion of \"la dolce vita\" with the reality of life in a poor, rural town in the years between the wars. It's fun but light; a lot of the humour is really very broad. I enjoyed it, but as my introduction to such a renowned cinematiste as Fellini, it didn't quite explain his illustrious reputation.",

After all, this was a man who still knew how to see situations for us. But the situations are inconsequential -- there is no life force here. No one will have their life changed by this as they might with more than one of his earlier projects. This isn't art, it's just emotional decoration. It is coffeetable Fellini.The compromises in this film bothered the cowriter, Tonino Guerra until he collaborated with another great filmmaker 8 years later. The same subject: constructed memory. But this time, in Tarkovsky's `Nostalgia,' you end up with something both beautiful and lifealtering. Can't say that of `Amarcord.'Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

But for his sake, I watched Amarcord, and in the past years have found myself returning to it time and again.  I haven't seen any other movies by Mr. Fellini, so I can judge this film only against itself.  By such standards, it is a masterpiece.  Never have I seen Italy portrayed as lovingly, nor the spectrum of childhood emotions - happiness, love, frustration - represented as frankly.  The images are spellbinding - sunlight and fog and great dark seas.  Yesterdays are perfect, it would seem, and love exists in what we can remember.  So my friend got it right with this one.  Amarcord is a kind of magic only the very best in cinema inspire within us.  It's the magic that makes us remember.",

Well, in theory at least, as it isn't that funny. The \"humour\" is largely of the farcical, juvenile kind and is generally more silly than funny. It's the sort of stuff you'd expect from a B-grade, made for teenage boys, Hollywood comedy and not the great Fellini.There are some good moments, but they are few and far between. I particularly liked the story where the fascists arrested the harmless towns person. Was a great indictment on the irrationality, paranoia and stupidity of totalitarian government. I was hoping that would set the tone for the rest of the movie but sadly that was the highpoint and only highlight. This scene was almost immediately followed by a scene that largely consisted of an idiot sitting in a tree, and I lost interest.",

Here, towards the end of his career amidst some films that seemed to pretentious or overanxious to amuse us, he presents a story about people. Not just one person, but a whole group of people living in a small coastal town in Italy 1930s.It may not be his most dazzling or mesmerizing film, but Amarcord is Fellini's most personal journey. It is told through multiple narrators, all who add a little more the picture, but mostly it is told through the incredible images Fellini creates. His use of color is astonishing, balancing bright colors of passion against the dull lackluster colors of white and black. He also gives us multiple fantasy sequences, building on those of Guido in 8 1/2. Here, they are more abstract but more meaningful. There is a young boy probably supposed to represent him, but it is clear Fellini admired and loved all these quirky people. There is Gradisca the village beauty, Teo the crazy uncle, Aurelio the loud and stern father, and Miranda the loyal and loving mother. Fellini films all of them with such grace and affection, you can't help but be swept up into this world. And, as with most Fellini, you really don't want to leave either.",

            "content": "This film is about a little Italian town biting Joy among the horrors of fascism, seen through all ages and professions and attitudes. Everybody is completely different, but one thing is clear about everybody who lives here. They enjoy life to the fullest and grab it wherever they can get it. The burning of a witch in a bonfire is representative of the change of seasons, and what is very clear is that beauty is found in everything whether it be a beautiful woman or a delicious meal. But definitely beauty of the family is very important in this, and no matter how much they fight, they find beauty in everybody.I've seen a handful of Fellini films, and this is by far the easiest one to watch, definitely a starting point for film students who haven't gotten into foreign films. What I love about this film is that everybody has enthusiastically, and even when they fight, they know that the moments that the fight is over, they'll be enjoying life together all over again. \"Everyone in town laughs at us. Even the roosters!\" the matriarch of one family exclaims after one of those fights, but something tells me that every other family is fighting and loving and behaving foolishly the same way.As always with Fellini, even in comedy, there's something tragic behind it, and it comes when you least expect it. The happiest and most full of life people all have some sense of sadness, from the nymphomaniac showing up at a construction site looking for some quick fun to the fighting patriarchs and matriarchs of the familys shown. With \"Stormy Weather\" heard in the background, that's a prophetic emotion to be feeling. The setting that is utilized is gorgeous, a picture postcard of what movie fans think of when they think of Italy and the wonderful places they've never been to.It's obvious that Woody Allen was greatly influenced by this film, not to mention probably others really any films, what this really shows a sense of Allen' style from later films, not saying that he ripped it off but simply adding his own touch along with the sentiment that this film has a lot of. It is a masterpiece to be terrorists, and one of the very best films of the 1970\"s. So much joy to be found even in a time when there was not a lot to be joyful about.",

            "content": "Although on one level this is indeed a warm reminiscence of youth, it would be a mistake to think that's all it is. In fact there is sharp satire at the heart of the film, indicated by the punning title - \"Amarcord\" is the local dialect for \"I remember\" (used in preference to the Italian \"Mi ricordo\") while \"Amaro\" is Italian for \"bitter\".There is considerable brutality among the laughs - a man is maltreated by the Fascists, a small boy tries to kill his infant brother with a rock in an aside the casual viewer might miss. Rimini stands in for the whole of Italy as Fellini tries to get to grips with what factors in the national psyche (Catholicism, the education system, past imperial glory, sexual frustration) led Italy to invent and wholeheartedly embrace fascism.These are some of Fellini's own comments on the film:-\"The province of Amarcord is one in which we are all recognizable, the director first of all, in the ignorance which confounded us. A great ignorance and a great confusion. Not that I wish to minimize the economic and social causes of fascism. I only wish to say that today what is still most interesting is the psychological, emotional manner of being a fascist. What is this manner? It is a sort of blockage, an arrested development during the phase of adolescence\u0085 That is, this remaining children for eternity, this leaving responsibilities for others, this living with the comforting sensation that there is someone who thinks for you (and at one time it's mother, then it's father, then it's the mayor, another time Il Duce, another time the Madonna, another time the Bishop, in short other people): and in the meanwhile you have this limited, time-wasting freedom which permits you only to cultivate absurd dreams \u0096 the dream of the American cinema, or the Oriental dream concerning women; in conclusion, the same old, monstrous, out-of-date myths that even today seem to me to form the most important conditioning of the average Italian.\"One can only speculate on what Fellini would have made of Berlusconi.Apparently the film as we see it was originally planned as part of a larger-scale project in which a man in the present day retreats into a nostalgic reminiscence of his adolescence. For whatever reason that framing device was abandoned and what we have is just the reminiscence.Fellini described \"Amarcord\" as \"a minor planet... not a masterpiece\" but for all that it enjoyed considerable success and remains wonderful to behold. On the downside it could be considered the seed of the later plague of execrable 'adolescence' movies such as \"Porky's\" and \"Road Trip\".Still, you can't blame Fellini for that.",

This came at a point in Fellini's career where he had made a number of unsuccessful films (like Julliet of the Spirits which is just painful to watch!) and most critics felt he had peaked. Probably his most accessible film, Amarcord can be appreciated - like Citizen Kane - just for its watchability, for the great direction or for the sub-surface themes (although the fact that the Fascist Party is never criticized is a controversy that surrounds the film). But the point is that the film is not there to judge but to remember the little moments and little joys.It could be quite explicit at times and the colors are truly orgasmic. The pranks the village kids play are quite realistic and crude. In some way, they bring back memories of my childhood. There is no plot, only seasons and memories.At once sentimental and unrealistic, Amarcord has a dream-like quality and you will in some ways remember your childhood, classroom pranks and different experiences when you watch this.",

            "content": "Having watched and loved La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2 and La Strada previous to Amarcord, I was understandably expecting good things for this film. And I got that exactly. This is said to be Fellini's most personal film, and this comes through loud and clear, as his direction is superb. So is the movie.When Amarcord is funny it is quite hilarious, and when it is poignant it is heart breaking. I can understand why someone mayn't like it, some aspects are rather coarse- not a bad thing for me- but if you see it again you may find it grows on you.The visuals as I thought it would be are beautiful. I loved the skillful cinematography, and the sets, locations and costumes are lavish and colourful. There are also some very memorable scenes, the peacock in the middle of the snow is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful images I have seen recently.I also love the score. I have always considered Nina Rota a wonderful composer; The Godfather, La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2 all to name a few have a knack of being not only beautiful and haunting but also that they stick in the mind long afterwards. Amarcord's score is no exception, if anything it adds to the film's quirks and poignancy.The script is also fine. What I loved most about it was its deft mix of humour and sentiment and also childhood memory and adult insight. The story is never less than compelling, even with the expansive running time. It has interesting themes(ie. mocking Mussolini's regime, Roman Catholicism and the prejudices and peculiarities of the bourgeoisie) and for me it had few dull moments.The characters I think grow on you. They may seem like stereotypes at first perhaps, but once you see the film more, they are as human as they are grotesque. The acting is excellent, Magali Noel is the standout lightening up the screen with her allure and acting talent.Overall, Amarcord is a wonderful film, while it wasn't my first Fellini movie, I'd say this is a good enough introduction to the work of a master director. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "There is an old misunderstanding about the art and the importance of the artistic subject; this misunderstanding claims that the subject doesn't matter, that it is indifferent, that only the craftsmanship matters. There is some truth and common sense in this statement: the truth that you don't need to choose Julius Caesar as an artistic subject, that great artistic achievements can have as subject the everyday life of a small provincial town. In this sense, and in this sense only, and if we take 'subject' in its very broad and somehow vague meaning, the statement is true and it has a certain valid polemical importance, as against the superstition of the 'great subjects', establishing that humble and everyday subjects may serve as the basis for the artistic creativity . But it is not true that, if we take 'subject' in its specific and concrete meaning, anything can serve as a subject for any work of any artist (this nihilistic thesis has been implied by various sophists in the last decades). In this sense, AMARCORD has an obvious superiority over other Fellini movies\u0097the superiority of its subject. The world is that of Vitelloni --as it marks Fellini's return to the provincial world of his teenager life. After 20 years, Fellini returns to that world. Now he believes in it more than he did when he was a young artist. Amarcord (1973) is Fellini's great synthesis\u0097a synthesis on multiple levels, an ensemble of synthesis, the masterpiece\u0097there are many things that he wants to communicate here\u0097this film is like a fruit, the fruit of a lifetime experience and thought and dreaming\u0097the opportunity itself. Ginger e Fred (1986) is another masterpiece, and a film perhaps as good as Amarcord (1973), yet its principle is entirely different\u0097it is not about a social world (well, it is, but not primarily)-- Ginger e Fred (1986) is about the inner life. Amarcord (1973) seizes and depicts an unique connection of thrills and joy between a soul and a congruent world. Fellini's characters\u0097we all know that\u0097feel exiled and torn in the world, and lonely and disappointed and sick in the world and in their environment\u0097Fellini wrote in some of his movies the ecology of tearing.But then again, Amarcord (1973) is no \"Malena\". There are sinuosity and arabesques and weirdness and a decadent treatment of the sexuality. No Malena here, but Gradisca and the insane prostitute and the math teacher and the housewives' asses. This world is loved by Fellini, but its' not Malena's world. It is weird and \u0085;and it is Fellini's vacation, his day off. In a certain sense, it is also one of his few realistic films\u0097films that set themselves up to explore outward, with a realistic intention too ( that is, they are not primarily satiric, pamphlets, etc.). He certainly intends here to evoke a certain historical world, and to give her characteristics, etc.. A movie like no other in his career. It is a film of atmosphere where the atmosphere belongs to an outward world. The weird touches belong of course to the grown-up Fellini, yet the atmosphere has that objective quality that our childhood memories retrospectively seem to have.Fellini was a great artist of the color. Giulietta Degli Spiriti (1965), Amarcord (1973) , Intervista (1987) are works of a keen 'colorist gusto. Amarcord is perhaps Fellini's most funny and lighthearted and warm movie.Scenes of a strange beauty and spectacular,witty comic abound.The second part gets a metaphysical scope,in the scenes that explore the reality's sheer ambiguity.Amarcord displays a certain Italian aesthetics of the visual,that Fellini seldom used throughout his career;it emphasizes the vivacity and the picturesqueness.It offers the living of some visions.You might be tempted to choose those Fellini shows that are rounded off aesthetic objects.But aren't they all?Firstly,you pick a few movies ,then again some more,then others too,then all.I turn again to Averty's word:Fellini is one who never made a bad movie.Simultaneously,Fellini's art has always been very permeable to life itself.Amarcord is (also) Fellini's most sensual show;as a cartographer of the sheer ambiguity of the real,he displays ardor and a distanced rethinking of the world,that takes the shape of this movie.Amarcord is amusing,anecdotal , and seasoned.",

Federico Fellini is one of the greatest of all filmmakers. And to think there was a time, only a couple of years ago, when I despised his films.

I have never felt these same emotions while watching a film as Fellini made me feel during this one! It is an experiment in unabashed nostalgia. Nostalgia happens to be the strongest emotion known to man. There are dozens of characters in this film with whom you'll utterly fall in love. I never wanted this film to end!

He spoke with him for a minute but he was too busy to take time with a 24 year old kid. He did pat my friend on the cheek and laughed. Great moment that was worth every cent.

It's not a surprise that Titta is again, Fellini's alter ego and through his eyes, which are Fellini's, there is the often funny and occasionally nostalgic, dreamy look at a time gone by.AMARCORD is also and foremost a plot less story about the town its set in. Events that may seem little more than unremarkable get major story lines. The opening sequence, for example, is quite beautiful, surreal: the dandelions letting go of their seeds, signaling the arrival of spring as one of several narrators tells us the magic of seeing them floating in the wind. A traditional bonfire follows, introducing the main characters. Among them is Gradisca, whom the town affectionately dubs \"S'il vous plait\" due to her dalliance with a general, the owner of the tobacco store who has a magnificent carnal physique, the Biondi family, and the kids who are always playing pranks and pining on Gradisca (or Jean Harlow). But in essence, this introduction is a way of saying how intimate, how close, these people -- the lawyer, the movie owner, the teachers at school -- are to one another in typical small-town fashion. Put them and their excesses and quirks in a Fellini film and you get a warm randiness filtered through a lens of a dream.Federico Fellini has been considered one of the Greats and in my opinion, is. His films are so unique in nature, even when they venture into excesses stemming from his own psyche, and must be seen. I can't say which one I prefer better because they're so different in taste and feel and remain in memory (pun intended) long after credits have rolled. I saw this film in 1980 when I was ten years old and I can only say that in doing so again this last month, I was surprised how fresh its everyday incidents popped back into my head as if I had seen this not a day ago. That, to me, is the making of a timeless film independent of critical acclaim, critical condemnation, or awards. Seeing the hysterical scene when Titta wrestles the grandiose tobacco store owner in a scene that American cinema would censor (Titta's age can only be around 15ish), I was in stitches, and the memory came back to me: right there and then I was ten, watching Titta suffocate under her heaving, huge breast; watching Uncle Teo yell out, \"I want a woman!\" perched on top of a tree; watching Titta also narrowly miss Gradisca as they walk on opposite sides of a snow drift, or the snow fight, or the appearance of the peacock brazenly strutting its feathers. And Gradisca's wedding is the most poignant moment in AMARCORD because like the townsfolk innocent, happy singing, there is the undertone of a part of town being taken away from them. Woody Allen definitely knows where to take his cues for his movies: RADIO DAYS is AMARCORD in almost everything but setting and plot. And that also makes this film stand out even more: already a flawless classic, able to inspire another acclaimed film maker, and to linger on ages later in the memories of any sensitive viewer. AMARCORD does just that, and remains in my mind and soul forever.",

The film became momentarily interesting with the depiction of the fascists, and there is the delightfully politically incorrect scene of the emir and his harem, but then we get 20 minutes of the guy who won't come down from a tree.

Even then these examples only get to the outskirts of Fellini's half-memory, half fiction Rimini as displayed here. I suppose it is quite possible to dream several seemingly unconnected dreams in one night though Freud would insist that however disparate they ARE connected and this is the feeling I take from Amarcord except that the dreams in question are the products of a lifetime's rather than a single night's sleep. It is laced with ravishing images, notably those involving snow, whilst others are almost drab and mundane, Real Life, in fact. In effect Fellini has created a world from his imagination just as Tolkien did with the vital difference that Tolkien was creating grotesques deliberately whilst Fellini was merely embellishing the SLIGHTLY grotesque inhabitants of his home town. This is a film that not only requires but DEMANDS multiple viewings and richly rewards each one.",

            "review_title": "Fireworks",
            "content": "I write this for mainly two reasons: 1. As I clicked through a few pages of reviews, most of them were raving madly about Fellini, not many gave below 10, and then again, not much lower. 2. When I stopped to read a few of them, they contained obvious misinterpretations of the movie (which was funny) and none of them came up with a significant argument as to why the movie was good but just not for my taste.With the disclaimer done, here's my feelings about the piece: Fireworks. Loud, full of cracks, constantly surprising and distracting you with big flashes and quick satisfaction.This movie represents the life in this seaside little city, but does so via caricatures. Very loud, very energetic, very... \"Italian\" caricatures, you could say. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing, except that it probably needs to be funny most of the time. Which it isn't. It consists mainly of slapstick humor, slight sexual references, kids being cheeky, the works. Sure, it is entertaining at times, but 2 hours of it?I did not feel much connection to the characters, some, indeed, I did not really recognize in the middle of the constant mess of the screen (admittedly, the woman who dies left me a bit confused). As there is no plot, you don't really see anyone grow, just really pass the time, but I may be a sucker for plots, so enough about that.There are several special events that go on to show how the people at the time lived them. I interpreted them mostly as a mockery of the masses, especially for the fascist parade. Entertaining, in fact, but they're so fast and superficial that.. one's left with a feeling of \"..that's what you wanted to show?\"One thing I did enjoy from the constant mess was how some scenes were composed of irrelevant people who were bluntly being so. Comes to mind especially the construction scene, where, out of 20 workers, none was doing absolutely anything that could be valued in an actual construction site.So, to wrap-up, outside of a few good jokes, interesting moments (e.g.: poetry) and nice recreations, this film is simply too much for too little. I would consider watching it again, were it shortened to 30 minutes.",

            "content": "Amarcord (1973) *** (out of 4) Oscar-winner for Best Foreign Film, this Fellini comedy is considered by many to be a masterpiece but I'm afraid I wasn't that impressed by it. The film is basically the director looking back at his teen years in Italy where he learns various subjects ranging from sex to his crazy uncle to even more sex. Martin called this the PORKY'S of art house movies and I must admit that I'd agree with him because there are several scene here where I couldn't help but think that perhaps Bob Clark borrowed some. The way the two films look back on perversion are quite similar. The one thing I didn't care too much about this film is how there's not a clear cut story being told. Perhaps this is just Fellini doing his thing but it seems all the scenes really weren't in place to tell a story but instead just small, short subjects. It really seemed like a conversation that someone would have where they just skip around telling different stories of someone's past. What I did like best was the first hour and the rather raunchy comedy bits including a funny scene in a classroom where urine is the set up and pay off. Another funny sequence was a scene around the dinner table where the father goes crazy and ends up chasing his son out of the house. The middle of the film started to drag as it gets a tad bit more serious before picking up more steam with a hilarious bit involving a crazy uncle and an outrageous scene where he forgets to \"open shop\" and ends up peeing on himself. One of the highlights of the film has to be the bizarre and rather awkward scene where a priest starts asking a young boy about masturbation. The performances are all fine with Armando Brancia, Pupella Maggio, Bruno Zanin and Josiane Tanzilli, as a crazy prostitute, really sticking out. In the end this is pretty much just a slice of life comedy that goes overboard on the sexual nature but that's not a bad thing. I laughed a lot in the film but not enough to fill up the complete running time, which is why I was left bored in a few spots. I'm still new when it comes to Fellini and while I haven't really \"gotten\" what he's about, I'm still interested in checking out more of his work.",

It's stylistically elaborate, but instinctively accurate to human nature. Nino Rota's sweeping score is almost constant, the characters are vibrant and humorous.

            "content": "Translated as 'I Remember', the great Italian director Federico Fellini's Amarcord is a series a comedic vignettes that look back at his childhood in a 1930's coastal town. Apart from the intertwining inhabitants, there is nothing thematically or even tonally linking the stories together, much like memory itself. The film takes places over the course of a year, with nothing signifying the passage of time apart from the subtle changes in seasons. Apart from the film's brief focus on the rise of fascism, this is Fellini at his most satirically light, with his usual mocking of the bourgeoisie making way for some amusingly childish humour and some beautifully photographed scenes.True to Fellini's style, Amarcord is occasionally outrageous and always flamboyant. We see the majority of the film through the eyes of the closest thing there is to a protagonist, the young, rosy-cheeked Titta (Bruno Zanin), and therefore everything in the film feels exaggerated. The sexual aspects especially are often juvenile, but true to the experiences of a young, hormonal man, so when Titta shows off his strength by lifting the large, buxom tobacconist (Maria Antonietta Beluzzi) he so often fantasises about, he is rewarded by having a grope of her ridiculously large breasts in a scene that could have been called Carry on Fellini. There is also the local nymphomaniac Volpina (Josiane Tanzilli), who seems to hover around touching herself and growling hungrily at any man who glances in her direction. These are true Fellini grotesques.The comedy aside (and special mention must go to the hilarious segment in which Titta's crazy Uncle Teo (Ciccio Ingrassia) comes to stay and escapes into a tree), there are as many touching and profound moments that display Fellini's outstanding talent. The scene in which Titta must watch his mother's final moments on a hospital bed is brutal in its simplicity, with Titta's naivety failing to grasp the seriousness of the situation while his father Aurelio (Armando Brancia) lingers in tragic silence. There's also moments of beauty, namely the arrival of a peacock in the winter snow displaying it's covert feathers, or the sight of a giant ocean liner, seemingly meaningless moments that stuck with Fellini for decades. For me, this is not Fellini's finest moment - that would lie with 8 1/2 (1963), arguably one of the finest films ever made - but this is still one of the most accurate depictions of memory and beautiful ode's to nostalgia I've seen.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Amarcord is where I realized that Fellini is a great director because he can seamlessly do exactly what the word \"director\" implies, which is direct. You can tell where his work lies on screen, directly, because of the organization it must take to film a movie in which every scene involves a large ensemble of people and infinitely busy goings-on. Hardly any more than one shot in the entire film has only one person in it. If Fellini is too dry to make the audience feel truly attached to the story, Amarcord is where I see that that is perhaps his niche. Amarcord is a film that is dramatic and funny but so detached that the film has no individual protagonist.I liked Amarcord a lot, because it's a story that could only ever truly be impacting as a movie. There is no main character, as I say. But again, technically there is. The main character is actually the Italian province the film is set in during the Fascist period. The people whose lives we follow over the course of a year are the building blocks used to create an arch for the character that is the town. The film, despite having hardly any true emotional provocation, still stays with me and makes an imprint, and many directors cannot make a film that has an impact without emotion. Hence, I realize now that Federico Fellini is a wonderful director. Nino Rota's music is also very Italian in its theatrical melodrama, hoewver it is still not stimulating at all to the feelings.Just an aside: Magali Noel is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life, especially during the snowball fight. Uuhh, baby. The cast is very realistic, even during scenes of hilarious humor, but Noel stands out. I'd like to show her something that stands out.",

Would that the story and characters had the same impact. Unfortunately, director Federico Fellini and his co scenarist Tonino Guerra decide on a scattershot approach that resembles nothing so much as a receptacle full of anecdotes, memories and snapshots, some disturbing, some heartbreaking, some silly, some poignant, dumped willy nilly by messers Fellini and Guerra onto the cinematic floor so to speak and left for the viewer to assemble, organize and make sense of. And, of course, the result is that while some aspects of the film are powerfully rendered, like the Fascisti forcing Fellini's dad to take castor oil and a comic/tragic visit with Fellini's mentally impaired uncle, other scenes that are meant to evoke pathos, such as Fellini's mother's death and the sad marriage of Gradisca which ends the movie, fail to have the requisite impact and leave at least this viewer rather unmoved.Bottom line: Glad I saw it but I sure wish Fellini had hired a better scribe and stuck to directing.

The movie is set in the 1930s and portrays the everyday adventures of the citizens of Rimini, an Italian city by the Adriatic sea. But it merely scratches the surface of several themes -- love, coming of age, fascism --without exploring them in depth. Moreover, the protagonists are hardly more complex than popular notions about \"typical\" Italians and, given that the narrative bounces back and forth between at least a dozen people, there is no way for the viewer to identify with any of them. I found myself watching this movie waiting for a plot that never happened. The various subplots -- if they can be called that -- did not add up to an ensemble but rather led to a bunch of unfinished story lines that left me puzzled and frustrated. True, the scenic shots of Rimini and Italy's breath-taking countryside are captivating, but they can't compensate for the virtual absence of a plot and a circus of superficial and often outright annoying protagonists.

When Fellini is working in peak condition, as he is in Amarcord, he somehow brings out the best in us. We become more humane, less stuffy, more appreciative of the profound importance of attitudes that in other circumstances would seem merely eccentric if not lunatic.\" Canby is spot on.

            "content": "\"Amarcord\" (I like the explanation what this word stands for) is an Italian (Italian language too, with just a very brief inclusion of Greek) movie from 1973, so these slightly over 2 hours have their 50th anniversary soon. The director and one of several writers here is of course Federico Fellini and even if he lives on for a long time after this film and made many other movies, this can definitely be considered one of his later career efforts. The most obvious aspect is already that this is in color unlike those films that are maybe considered more defining for the filmmaker. This should not mean that this one here has gone forgotten. Not at all. It is probably the most known work from Fellini that does not involve Mastroianni (even if there seems to be a relative part of the crew) or Fellini's wife Masina. It is much more about the ensemble cast here and not one defining character, even if there is a young one who could be considered in the middle of the movie. The actor there (Bruno Zanin) is also still alive today. He is no Mastroianni obviously, but he doesn't have to be. It also makes sense that Fellini did not cast Marcello this time because the latter used to act in films that were about wealthier, maybe even elitist, groups from society (also because his aura) and here we have basically simple townsfolk that this film is all about. Still these show us that they can also really live the life and it's a pretty spectacular film at times with some characters who stay in the mind, even if they have only very little screen time. The best example is of course the busty tobacco saleswoman. You see her on the poster here. There is talk about her early on as she is part of one young man's wet fantasy and near the end, there is even a scene when she is about to seduce the protagonist and this scene is pretty explicit in fact. Definitely more than you'd expect from a 1970s movie. Until then, it is really just talk. We see a naked man from behind on one occasion, but that is harmless. Nothing sexual. However, the talk I just mentioned is really juicy on some occasions. Just take immediately at the beginning the blonde woman and what another character says about her morning coffee. The one who always seems to be horny throughout the film. Or the confession scene with the priest. Or the talk about the teacher. (These teacher moments were hilarious anyway early on, such interesting characters, even more interesting than the students. I would have loved teachers like these.) Or the scene with the boys in the car. There are further examples. In general, this is not a politically correct film at all. Just take the several farting references. The chubby boy who is accused of farting, the noises one character makes at school when he can't (or can he?) pronounce a certain word or of course what Grandpa does when he leaves the room. You may say here that the kids are pretty rotten (or are they just normal?), but if we take a look at how the grown-ups here act, it is not a surprise they turned out like this.I will just brainstorm a few more things. Speaking of the tobacco woman, it is interesting what people back then (especially Italians) perceived as beauty ideals. And of course speaking of tobacco, today you will definitely not see teachers smoking in class or people smoking inside a theater. But back then, it was not an issue. Oh well, they did not know about the negative effects yet. As for the theater scene, the woman smoking there was apparently one everybody was crazy about and she gets married in the end, but I cannot really see the appeal too much I must admit. I did not know the actress either. Admittedly, I did not know any of the actors really. So I mentioned a few recurring themes already. Another one would be politics. This is not half as dominant in this film as you may think it is though. There is of course the scene with the father being forced to do something against his will because he said something unpleasant about Mussolini and with the exception of a scene that depicts a larger-than-life Mussolini this is basically all there is in terms of politics. And even this latter moment I just mentioned is more about comedy as we see how one young character who has a crush on a girl imagines that the Mussolini picture would act as a marriage registrar and the two got actually married. In his fantasy, that is. His interest in the girl is also something that stays there until the end of the movie when it seems he lost said interestg a bit in a speeding car sequence. Italians love speeding cars. Of course, this one would be included. There are also not too many dramatic moments. The biggest is probably near the end when one character gets sick and dies and we see everybody at her funeral. There, for once, they did not include any comedy and that felt right. Still I must say it was not too emotional for me, maybe because we don't find out too much about said female character before that. There are just so many characters in here that most did not get too much elaboration. Except when she says one day she will kill her husband (when the two are arguing) by putting poison in his food. And the man playfully says he is going to kill himself and acts as if he peeled of the skin from his head.I watched this movie on the occasion of a Fellini retrospective because the man had his 100th birthday not too long ago. One of several films I saw. I wwould say it is among the better by him, but not the best. Then again, I am probably not as big of a fan as many others. Sometimes the film felt very Fellini (if you ignore the color), like for example this celebration sequence at the end (he always has these in his films) or that there is a certain vitality to the characters in his movies and you could fell thatg here too. Anyway, as for the final sequence at the wedding, there is also a certain melancholy there because we just hear briefly (one sentence) that Titta (the centrall character) went away a long time ago or something like that, but we do not find out in detail where he went or if he maybe died even. So it is a somewhat open ending and as he is not physically present anymore, his interest in Gradisca had also vanished down to 0% by then obviously. So with Titta being absent, the film ends and it makes sense because, like I said earlier, Titta was a bit like the protagonist here. Overall, I think this was a good film. I am a bit surprised though that it won best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars that year and that the Academy loved it that much. I think a nomination would have been the maximum, but of course the name Fellini definitely helped the matter. It is kinda ironic how many times he won this category for Italy, but how he never managed to win an individual Oscar and this also applies to this film especially because Fellini managed to get in here too for writing and directing. Especially the directing nomination surprises me a bit. These two nominations happened the year after the Foreign Language Feature Oscar and that is really something pretty unthinkable today I must say. This film is calles \"a series of comedic and nostalgic viggnettes\" and I agree with that, not only because it emphasizes that there is far far more comedy than drama in here, but also because it is a bit of an unusual film. There is no steady flow, no plot almost, but just one scene after the next at frequently different locations and characters vanishing for an hour (despite not actually vanishing story-wise) is nothing unusual here. It almost felt a bit of a sketch comedy. The scene with the guy up there in the tree throwing things at everybody else was just the perfect example. I thought he was funny, but at the same time he displayed perfectly what this film had to offer in terms of longing for love, even if it is just a mentally disabled man or horny school kids. As for the guy up in the tree, it was also hilarious how they got this tiny nun to climb up there and she was the one that managed to get him down there. But ask yourself: With everything you watched about all the characters in here, is this bearded fellow really more crazy than everybody else. Even if they know to pull down their pants before peeing? Okay, that one maybe. Overall, this was a really creative and entertaining film and I don't regret watching it one bit. I was actually baffled how full the theater was. Did not expect that, but it seems Fellini is still a crowd magnet. Before I finish my review I want to mention two more aspects that made me long a bit here, not love-related, but still. The first would be these puffballs very early on when we find out they indicate the arrival of spring (if it isn't the bigg female butts in tigght pants, another sexual reference here). That was a thing of beauty honestly, even if my nose certainly would not have stopped running there like crazy. The second would be when it snows and everybody runs out of the theater to see it live. Man I miss snow so much. Seems that winter 2019/2020 will go completely snowless here in Berlin and it makes me sad and I felt a bit melancholic watching these scenes (even if I am not a huge fan of snowball fights). Oh well, to sum it all up, let me say that Fellini showed with this really creative and different movie that he still had it the way he did decades earlier. It did not blow me away on any occasion, but it is certainly a fine watch. And one of the most different films I have seen in quite a while. I am genuinely surprised that so many awards bodies really wwarmed up to it because I would have thought maybe it was too progressive for them. Go see it.",

As it's the norm not to have a political thought in your head in your adolesence, the movie proceeds from this uncritical, rollicking viewpoint, through an entire year of loves, lusts, deaths and a marriage. Titta is just enjoying himself, and the casting of redheaded Bruno Zanin is the films master stroke. He prefectly embodies carefree boyhood.Perhaps best of all in the movie are some visuals that advance the story and highlight the picaresque and the absurd. A peacock that lands in the townsquare in the a snowstorm; The pursuit of a young boy's lust through snowdrifts so tall that the camera sees more than the characters. A waltz in the fall, An encounter with a bull in the fog. And maybe best of all, a late-night boat excursion to see the pride of the Italian fleet, with scalar absurdity. Heart breakingly sweet without being cheap.Despite the harm to the movie by a lot of low humor it remains indelible. Perhaps one of my favorite films.This is one time I would actually recommend the dubbed version over the sub-titled one.Woody Allen attempted a shabby remake of this movie with Radio Days. Cinema Paradiso rips it off shamelessly and trowels on the schmaltz. Roger Ebert has a decent review of this. On the other hand, the classroom eleocution lesson here is lifted from the 400 Blows.",

Not to say they aren't a joy for the most part, films like La Strada aside. Amarcord comes closest to love, but settles for really like. It's a difficult film at first, but once it's possible to latch onto recurring characters it gets much better. Each scene escalates into juvenile absurdity in a very entertaining way, but all are not equal as some vignettes feel like throwaways that don't add enough. The highlights are hilarious scenes like the man up in the tree yelling that he wants a woman. The sexual desires of the characters can be relatable, but it doesn't touch anything deep. It's all eventually just great entertainment. Regardless of its deliberately overdramatic topics, the rich cinematography pops in every moment. Maybe I'll find the Fellini film I love, but maybe they need a rewatch. 8 1/2 sounds built for me.8/10",

The spring cottonwood wisps that offer a gently rocking temporal cradle to a story which traipses on the edge between straight narrative and emotional space.  Gradisca's wedding.

I promised I'd come back after seeing it again. Here I am.I watched the DVD. One comment, front/center: The dub (Criterion?) was FANTASTIC! I normally will only read subtitles. But the English dub was a very professional, nuanced, artistic job--very well translated to American English idiom and sound.Did I still like the movie? Yes. I was a little shocked this time 'round at the \"rawness\" of some of the sexuality. But I was genuinely touched by the images: The peacock, the cottonwood wisps, the music, Gradisca, the midget nun coaxing Teo from the treetop, the boy's coming-to-terms with his Father. Time like a river. The evocative sets, shots, music, etc. This movie answers the question; is there really the (in)famous body/soul split, posited by certain philosophers and apostles? The answer: No. We see people's spiritual selves, in the flesh. Not to imply Amarcord (and/or Fellini in general) is an oasis of this kind of revelation in a cinematic desert. But Fellini excels in Amarcord at his own particular species of cinematic spirituality. This may well be *the* movie to watch if you want to see this aspect of Fellini in full swing.I'm just thinking of one weak point in the movie; the peanut vendor is certainly \"over the top.\" Of course, others think everything Fellini did since 8 1/2 is over the top, but still....Take time to see this movie. Many have complained that Fellini should have stuck to just telling great stories. This movie finds a fine balance between his narrative capabilities, and his desire to transcend \"story space\" to give us the story of life; a fine mythic rendering of growing up in small-town coastal Italy young and horny, old and bitter, blind and crazed, ripe and pulchritudinous, stocky and fiercely nationalistic, etc., etc., etc.",

In fact this film describes very well the desires and irreverence of the youth (and probably here Fellini is depicting himself, when he was a young teenager) but it also portrays some social problems, the raise of Fascism in Italy and the difficulties of dysfunctional families. All of this with intense sarcasm and hilarious moments! The flatulence scenes for instance, can be disgusting to some, but I found them funny! I think there isn't a real main character in this film, because there're a few important to the plot. Of course the entire plot circles around TITTA (Bruno Zanin), but characters like MIRANDA or AURELIO, his parents, or even GRADISCA, his muse, are very important as well.Here Fellini does a film which is pure, intense, sarcastic, at parts grotesque, but essentially humorous and real!

It's a film detailing a specific place in Italy at a specific time, and though the eccentricities of the characters that Fellini lays out (not to mention the bizarre performances these players put in), it captures this time and place without fail. And unlike a couple of Fellini's other films it really isn't as confusing as I first though; his works at times are like those poems read one year and then taken again years later work on another level. Some of the images in Amarcord in particularly are quite strange, and beautiful often at the same time (and the director's affinity for putting at least one large, cartoonish-type woman is on display here as well). That it's been called semi-autobiographical isn't without its merit, but more in that Fellini is tapping into his emotions and sights and sounds from that time, however abstracted it might seem.

This film is most similar to \"La Strada\" in regard to the randomness of the situations presented. There really is no coherent narrative to the story and scenes proceed along rather arbitrarily. If the idea is that Fellini is conjuring up nostalgic memories from his past I'd be okay with that, but I miss the structure of a story with a sound beginning, middle and ending. In this picture, the director appears to be satirizing his youth perhaps, turning daily life into something of a circus with adolescent desires and male fantasies abounding. A particular thought occurred to me regarding the wandering narrator who kept popping up from time to time. I thought he might have been the adult Titta (Bruno Zanin), all grown up and reflecting back on his youth, but that was not the case. In retrospect, that might have been a way for Fellini to more effectively tell his story.

When a peacock lands in the snow with its beautiful, vibrant blue and green feathers, it exemplifies beauty, simply existing, within harsh conditions.

Fellini gives his audience mischievous adolescents, oblivious teachers, a \"crazy\" uncle, a humorous grandfather, an idealistic and extremely feminine beauty, a generous but sickly mother and her easily-angered husband dissatisfied workers, a story-telling lawyer, a prince, and a lying snack vendor. And none of these characters is ever treated inhumanely, or as being of any less value than any others. The uncle has an episode in which he climbs a tree and throws rocks at people who try to get him down, all the while yelling, \"I want a woman!\" Hours pass and the doctor who eventually comes to get him down remarks, \"He has normal days, and he has not normal days\u0085Just like us.\" This shows the compassion that allows such a peaceful beauty to exist. Through the interactions of these characters, Fellini allows his audiences to encounter a town, the families, a community, and the simple\u0097sometimes tragic and sometimes beautiful\u0097life that exists within it. This film is powerful because it is saying that one does not have to defeat oppression to be worthy of being a model, seen and honored.

We follow a bunch of horny adolescents as they go about their pranks and hijinks, consumed with the same thoughts that consume all horny adolescents wherever they may live, and then in the next scene see them practicing drills as part of a Fascist youth militia. Fellini doesn't use a heavy hand in orchestrating any of this, and though his point is made this movie isn't about making a point.

Amarcord is one of Fellini's masterpieces of his young days growing up in a coastal Italian town in the 1930's (under the watchful eye of 'Il Duce' & the rest of that sub element). The fact that the Father figure in this film was an avowed Communist didn't help matters any. Despite these odds, the film covers various topics of growing up as family ties,community,sexual awakening,love,as well as a myriad of other themes. The film seems to sway between earthy comedy (first sexual encounter,raunchy humour,bawdy jokes,etc),pathos (encounters with Fascist Party members,death),etc. It will appeal to some,and will turn off others, due to it's episodic narrative structure.

The main focal point of the film isn't really defined, Fellini takes us through a series of episodes that have an enigmatic link. The tone is of the film is perfectly consistent from the subtlety of the rumptuous dance of the woman in the hair saloon at the beginning to the shocking briskness of the frisky scene with the overweight tobacco saleswoman.It could seem, due to the loose narrative, that this is a lazily made film. Yet one must not look at the narrative but instead look at the visual prowess of this picture, the tone of the film which is in fact very dark. The imagery screams temptation and lust; the luscious red woman, the peacock near the end and many other intricately planned sequences. Yet we never actually see graphic sex which in fact the film transcends and hints towards. The adolescents are constantly poised, constantly watching yet like the boys, the audience are waiting for the one scene where the boys release their carnal passion and desire. Yet, this scene doesn't come and in the way this mirrors all adolescent sexual fantasies.Amarcord is visual candy, a delight on the eye that doesn't hold back on meaning but in fact makes it difficult to find; it's thought-provoking to say the least, a parody of the ridiculousness of adolescent desire.Very Impressive 8.5/10",

The most beautiful woman in town. He tries to get close to her in a dimly lit cinema. No wonder he went on to become a film director. If all of these characters, like the tobacconist who tried to smother him with her enormous boobs, were really around him while he was growing up, we can thank the circumstances for producing such a personality. Fellini's story is warm and humorous. There's a lot of self-humor in there, not only in the form of fart jokes. He mocks Italian mentality, fascism and family life, but at the same time, this is no anti-fascist propaganda, nor is his story set to disparage 'patriarchy' or male lust. He loves Italians and Italian food. Amarcord is a celebration of life, with very interesting female characters, unapologetic about their sexuality and sex life. And the same goes for men - the group masturbation scene is unforgettable!",

However, as the film dragged on, I found my self sadly disenchanted.First off, the costumes, sets, camera-work and acting are all superb, so I can't complain about those elements. The use color and lighting in the film is excellent as well, as is the score and soundtrack. Therefore, technically speaking, it is a very good film. However, the biggest problems I had were with the script and perhaps the story itself. I never cared about these characters. I didn't care who they were, what they did, or what the consequences were. I felt very disconnected throughout and unengaged. This is not to say it didn't have its moments. There are several scenes that made me laugh or smile, but they were too few, in my opinion. Maybe I simply don't \"get\" or like Italian humor? Another \"turn off\" for me was the toilet humor, mainly the gags concerning flatulence and masturbation. I find this crude more than funny. No, I wasn't offended, but I've never found bodily functions funny, so these moments of the film did nothing for me.So, while it was a technically great film, and it clearly had a lot of heart and soul put into it (being a labor of love for Fellini), \"Amarcord\" ultimately left me with much to be desired.",

The film overflows with images both vulgar and dreamlike, colorful small characters, moments both hilarious and sad, all seamlessly interwoven forming the background of a year in a small town in 1930's Italy. From the opening scene the characters move in and out so fast that it takes a couple of viewings to realize who everyone is. Much of the movie is from the point of view of a young teenage boy based on Fellini's childhood. What Fellini captures are images and scenes in the way that a person remembers the past. On the surface it can sometimes seem jumbled together but it builds step by step a picture of memories of a community.Throughout Amarcord there is humor melded with harsh images from life. From a lonely rich girl, to a mentally ill man peeing on himself and even someone being tortured by the fascists, every cruel moment coupled with wit and a laugh as sharp as an elbow in the side. There is love and fantasies of sex which is usually what's on the mind of the young Fellini character and his friends. But mixed in with all of it are moments of beauty, like a peacock in the snow. Some of the simplicity of this time whether good or as the result of fascist oppression would soon change in World War 2. But the specifics aren't the point. Everyone has childhood memories that form us, that were just fantasy, that we love and hate. No film captures this experience better than Amarcord.",

            "content": "Undoubtedly Fellini's most accessible work (to modern audiences, that is), \"Amarcord\" ranks right there with \"Giulietta degli Spiriti\" as the director's best in my view - a funny, sad, dreamlike and altogether beautiful film that may well be autobiographical. Once seen, you will never forget it, for it's ultimately different and superior film-making style. That being said, it's far from being an easy watch. It has a highly uncommon narrative style which is usually misunderstood as being 'inexistent'. Fellini's unusual approach at storytelling is obviously more different than what you might see in pseudo-intellectual Hollywood features such as \"The Dark Knight\". Here, as in almost every other film by the director, the story is about peoples' lives and their own personal conflicts, as seen through the eyes of a teenage boy in a Italian village during the World War II. Not to mention, imagery is as important, if not, even more important than dialog in other to understand the film. Indeed, each scene is filled with a one-of-it's-kind aesthetic and poetic beauty, marvelously brought to life by Nino Rota's spellbinding score. The characters are all played to perfection by the whole cast, and have a strong lifelike quality despite their seemingly surreal and otherworldly appeal, even more so to anyone remotely relate to Italy. Overall, a wonderfully captivating and timeless classic of European cinema. As I've said before, it will not appeal to everyone, even by some Fellini fans, as it is considerably less subtle than \"La Strada\". It can be criticized as being over-the-top, eccentric and somewhat even vulgar, but then again, so is life. 10/10",

            "content": "A creation can be specifically located in time and space but carrying timeless and universal significances, that's the mark of the greatest artists. Fellini \u2013again- accomplishes this compromise in \"Amarcord\" with an incomparable virtuosity.All Fellini's films, encapsulate a part of Italy's heritage and/or population but \"Amarcord\" is probably the most explicitly autobiographical. Reassembling through a succession of little vignettes his youth memories in a small town named Borga, Fellini paints the flamboyant portrait of colorful and eccentric characters, so different yet so united that the town feels like a character. From Burcin, the compulsive liar street-vendor to Volpina, the blonde nymphomaniac, from an irascible blind accordionist to a tobacconist with giant breasts or the charming lawyer who pops up every once in a while to speak about the town's history, they all stick in our memories, even more because we all knew one of them in our youth.The most emblematic figure remains Gradisca, the local beauty played by Magali Noel, she was Fanny the nightclub dancer in \"La Dolce Vita\". The 'Lady in Red' is one of these immortal representations of Fellini's filmography along with Cabiria, Guido or Gelsomina, always parading in town swinging a beautiful derri\u00e8re that invites for the most luscious fantasies. She's a living fantasy herself, coveted by men, envied by women; she's one of these privileged persons so beautiful that she can allow herself to be tempting. She also symbolizes the eternal interference of lust, sexual fantasy and boy's memories. \"Amarcord\" is a man's film but of a man exploring his inner adolescent, through Titta's character. Indeed, in boys' memories, sex takes a significant place. In a hilarious scene, that I could relate to as a guy who grew up in a conservative Mediterranean society, the religious instructor, a nerdy looking guy with huge glasses warns Titta about masturbation, an act that makes \"Saint Louis cry\". Titta delivers an interior monologue taking us a witness: how can he avoid touching himself with all the temptations surrounding him? Gradisca, Volpina, the fat- bottomed peasant women in their bicycles, the fat tobacconist? Titta crystallizes in one monologue all the frustrations of a generation lost between forbiddings and temptations. To a certain extent, Titta also embodies Italy's condition.\"Amarcord\" is a rich film providing many layers of appreciation, but beyond the cheerful tone of the film, there's the commentary on the way Italy was conditioned by the grotesque Mussolini, and Church's omnipresence. In another memorable scene of the film, the fat boy pictures the huge statue of Mussolini's head marrying him to the beautiful brunette, Aldina. Submitted to authorities, little people were maintained in a sort of childhood condition that might explain their everyday insouciance. It's sad to see Gradisca hailing the Duce, unaware of the chaos he'll bring Italy to, and even sadder to see Aurelio, Titta's father, a brave communist working-man being harassed by the fascist police.Titta's family is another remarkable example of Fellini's capability to create characters that rapidly grow in our hearts, delirious and poignant in the same time, like so many clowns of life's circus act. After an argument with his wife Miranda, both threaten to 'kill themselves'. Anyone, who'd find that Fellini goes over the top, must consider the Family background in \"Amarcord\", when adults were no better than children. How can you also resist to the dim-witted uncle who climbs a tree and shouts, \"I want a woman!\" or when all the townspeople embark in small boats just to admire the SS Rex, the regime's greatest technological achievement. With Chaplin, Fellini is probably the only film artist who makes pathos so endearing.\"Amacord\", echoes the self-referential aspect of \"8\u00bd\" and has the realism of his earlier work. As a great mix of nostalgic fantasy and realistic social commentary, \"Amarcord\" is one of his best works, precisely because it's the most accessible in both sides of his talent. \"Amarcord\" immediately mesmerized me. I could immediately relate to Titta, to the boys, we all had fantasies on women that fulfilled our noisiest nights, I can't count how many house maids made my nights, or how many teachers inspired me the most lustful thoughts. And still, it's a Fellini's film with its share of music, the nostalgia inducing tone of Nino Rota, parades and processions.And like many coming-of-age stories, the film follows a clear cycle, one year, starting with the arrival of puffballs floating in the air, announcing the spring. Whether it's by snow or fog, it's a time when people are still easily distracted. A snow fight is brutally interrupted by a piercing peacock's sound, only to see feathers floating in the air, a simple, magical and fascinating moment. I guess at the time the film was made, no one would care, radio, TV would prevent people from playing games, having parties, spending times together. Now, it's even worse, how can you even allow fantasizing at the pinnacle of the porn industry or when any girl can post her pictures in Facebook. Sex has been so trivialized that even the scene where Titta literally suffocates in the tobacconist's breast is more innocent than any clip from today's television.Indeed, \"Amarcord\" is the eulogy of a lost innocence, it ends with these Felliniesque parties where Gradisca leaves the town, after having found the love of her life, but somewhat, as the beaches gets empty, I was sad to see these people I shared this two-hour slice of lives leaving the screen. \"Amarcord\" inspired one of my favorite Woody Allen's films, \"Radio Days\". I, of course, wish I had seen it first. But nonetheless, I'm going to give it the same compliment, \"it made me feel nostalgic for an era I didn't live.\" And that's because it was indirectly reflecting my own memories and an innocence that I'd mourn and celebrate forever, with this mix of happiness of poignancy in the universal music of life that only Fellini can orchestrate.",

Basically this is an autobiographical look at life in a small Italian coastal town during the 1930's, it is based on the town Rimini where Fellini grew up. There is no story as such, it just looks at young people and others who surround them as they live a year in the town, with amusing antics, both from a regular and grotesque cast of characters, all with peculiarities. While watching you could see this as mocking the people of the seaside town that the film is based on and in, a mock of the Roman Catholic religion, or just an excuse to see cinematography put to good use with colourful sets and likable people. I will confess, I didn't see much going on during the film that excited me, only regular everyday activities such as washing clothes and hanging them up to dry, stuff like that. Starring Pupella Maggio as Miranda Biondi, Magali No\u00ebl as Gradisca, Bruno Zanin as Titta Biondi, Armando Brancia as Aurelio Biondi, Ciccio Ingrassia as Uncle Teo, Nando Orfei as Patacca, Luigi Rossi as Lawyer, Gianfilippo Carcano as Don Baravelli, Josiane Tanzilli as Foxy Volpina, Maria Antonietta Beluzzi as Tobacconist, Giuseppe Ianigro as Titta's Grandfather and Ferruccio Brembilla as Fascist Leader. The best thing I can say about this film, having not really got it all, is that the characters are all good, the scenery of the town is really well made, and there are some amusing moments to make you giggle, I'm not sure I could recommend it unless I watched it closer again one day, but I know it is a worthwhile comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. Good!",

            "review_title": "Amarcord grows on you",
            "content": "\"Amarcord\", which means \"I remember,\" is a severely nostalgic film from Federico Fellini. It is also a movie composed entirely of vignettes that do not seem to be forming into any sort of cohesive whole until late in the film. An apparent lack of narrative force can make the film a difficult one to dip into, but I found that it improves greatly on repeat viewings as we get to know its large cast of characters and its sad, sinister undertones become more apparent. \"Amarcord\" follows a year in the life of the people of the Italian village of Rimini. It is the 1930s. Fascism has taken hold and Il Duce is in power.In watching the film I was immediately struck by its similarity to two nostalgic American movies. It is like \"A Christmas Story\" in its structure and its cast of broad, sometimes grotesque, comic characters many of whom are family. Watch any of the dinner scene from \"Amarcord\" and then view similar moments in \"Christmas\" and you will see that director Jean Shepherd was clearly influenced by Fellini. \"Amarcord\" also calls to mind \"Radio Days\", the vignette-filled Woody Allen film about growing up in 1940s Brooklyn. The two are so alike that it is clear Allen was unabashedly emulating \"Amarcord\" with his nostalgic look at family and lost youth.Those two films, however, used an offscreen narrator to tie one disparate moment to the next while \"Amarcord\" does not. Fellini's transitions are more jarring and the sequence of events in the film does not necessarily follow any immediately apparent pattern. This will likely be disconcerting to the first time viewer more attuned to the tidy storytelling of most film and television. More than tell a story, Fellini wants to reminisce. He jumps from one vivid memory to the next without the urgency of arriving at a fixed endpoint.About a third of the way into the film it becomes clear who its main characters will be. All are plagued by great longing. Titta Biondi, a teenage boy on the cusp of manhood, obsessed with the female bodies of Rimini. His father Aurelio the town's lone communist, political stalwart, and a frequently ineffectual patriarch. And Gradisca an aging beauty and the obsession of all the boys and men of Rimini. She expresses a continual aching desire for transcendent romance and seeks it out in films, ceremony, and the pomp and trappings of Fascism. This desire for transcendence cannot be satiated and it continually proves allusive even to the end of the film.The humor of \"Amarcord\" is cruel, usually the pain or humiliation. This recalls the humor of another classic \"Don Quixote\" which mines much of its humor from the torture of the addled Alfonso. Nabokov found the book, in a famous series of lectures given at Harvard, to be crude and cruel and wonders what he would make of Fellini's film. In the film, we see townspeople having fun at the expense of the crazed Volpina and the town's blind musician. Much of the cruelty of \"Amarcord,\" however, can be seen as a result of fascism as group think takes over and brings man's worse tendencies to the fore.We see much of the film through the eyes of the teenage Titta who is fascinated by the female posterior and to a lesser extent cleavage. The men of Rimini never grow out of this objectifying behavior, however, and long after the female form even as they overlook the women themselves. The oversexed Volpina is teased and handled by the men of the town. Gradisca is hounded by catcalls wherever she goes and the town's boys direct their sexual longing toward a statue of a mythic naked figure. The film's priest seems to only care if his young male confessors are engaged in onanism. Sex is the constant obsession of the men of Rimini, but it is forever adolescent and an aggressive, one-sided affair.The film's most memorable scenes follow a day of pageantry for visiting dignitaries. All of Rimini gathers together to praise Il Duce and to put on a show of being good Fascists. They move as a group and work themselves into a fury of loyalty. They act in unison and behave as a hive mind. Even the priesthood and school teachers--who more indoctrinate than educate--collude with the Fascists. The lone dissenter is humiliated after an attempt to show solidarity with a different political cause.\"Amarcord\" from moment to moment feels disjointed and even aloof. As the film closes, though, its elliptical structure reveals itself and seemingly unconnected moments come together. We begin to see Fellini's blueprint and the entire approach seems less scatter-shot. The film also has a large cast and when viewing the movie a second time each character becomes more distinctive. With \"Amarcord\" repeat viewing is a necessity.",

            "content": "A jolly man in his golden years recounts colorful episodes of the past which took place in his seaside Italian town filled with farmers, families, students, and 30 visiting concubines. Director and co-writer Federico Fellini based the incidents on memories of his own hometown of Rimini in the 1930s, and the occasionally raucous journey is both a beguiling and amusing one, beautifully filmed by the estimable Giuseppe Rotunno. Fellini's fixation on big bottoms (and on breasts that look like big bottoms) isn't sequestered away for fear of making \"Amarcord\" look less prestigious. Hardly...the movie is full of low-ball, bathroom humor and sex-jokes, and is at its best when following a group of randy hooligan youths around town, weakest when it mixes political satire with fantasy (while the concubine episode seems to belong to a different picture altogether). An early dinner-table sequence--which, one presumes, features a typical Italian family--is staged for maximum impact (lots of gesturing, shouting and eye-rolling), yet the characters around that table, particularly the natty and unruffled uncle, become quite dear to us. The opening celebration of the coming of Spring is a bit flat, but the classroom montage which follows is hilarious and full of recognizable hijinks; another highlight is the visit with the insane uncle, who refuses to come down out of a tree. Fellini doesn't goose the story with grotesqueness, nor does he make big introductions; he allows the pages to turn and the audience to become absorbed by the vignettes in a lively, funny way. This Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Film is one of the filmmaker's finest achievements. *** from ****",

No one else has gone through what each of us has, or, even if it had been possible, no one else would have interpreted those experiences in the same way. So we're all compelled once in a while to think about our own \"portrait of the artist as a young man\" -- or as a brewery worker or a president's wife or a nice Jewish boy in Newark.It's not always easy, alas, because unless we construct a portrait that is nicely done, nobody's interested in us. The story must have some elements that are idiosyncratic but, equally important, has to have enough of the universal to engage the outsider.This is Fellini's attempt at the job and he pulls it off with what he might have called sprezzatura. He's done a good job of hiding the effort behind this apparently casual, leisurely, comic, and sometimes very sad movie of a boy growing up in the 1930s in a small Italian town. Well -- small in a way, but with scads of historical resonance.It helps that Fellini had Nino Rota to write his musical score. Rota could write wedding music that trips right along or, as here, take a simple minor scale and turn it into a memorable melody for a funeral. Rota might have played the accordionist in this movie -- a grouchy cripple who is wildly enthusiastic in his playing and kicks at those who annoy him, a clown of accomplishment.The visual images are striking, as they so often are in Fellini's work. Some of the images are obviously fake -- the huge heaps of snow, the gigantic passenger liner aglow with portholes and running lights -- but I don't think the director cared. Or possibly he enjoyed the stylization. Illusionists don't depend on realism.But everything about the movie is appealing. Even if we don't recognize the faces of the performers we recognize their types. Gridesca, the town beauty after whom all the boys lust. Mamma, whose funeral leaves a dismal empty patch in the social fabric of a kid's life. A crazy uncle who won't get down out of a tree. The furry warmth of summer and a dinner with a large, loud family on a back yard table. The damp chill of winter with big snowflakes drifting down, that not only fails to depress the kids but positively exhilarates them. All these scenes are illustrated but none are played for easy emotions. They're not cheapened in any way by sleazy manipulation. Fellini and his tricks sort of earn their applause the way any good circus performance does, through the exercise of skill.",

In a magical enchantment that borders the dread, we see these strange beings that, at first glance, cause excitement and promises, convert in natural threats, explosive deposits of estrogen.Some say that under a mass repression of the Catholic Church and of fascism at the time, all men regressed to a pubertal stage, which may explain the ambiguity of Titta (the boy who may be Fellini) who, in contact with the giant breasts of the owner of the tobacconist, more resembles a choking baby than a happy lover.What happened in that little town of the 1930s is that men expressed themselves through phallic symbols (the communist anthem in the church tower, the mural of flowers composing the face of the Duce, the peacock in the snow) challenging nature, whereas women WERE (are always) nature itself.Gradisca, the great object of desire of the ragazzi, was only given (literally) to the powerful. The prostitute Volpina, the only unrestrained person in the village, was frightened and disgusted, and walked alone on the beach.The movie ends the way it started. During the marriage of Gradisca with a fascist officer, le manini return announcing the beginning of new spring. Titta (Fellini?) has been gone for some time, they say.

            "content": "Federico Fellini's 1973 Amarcord is a film that has often been linked with Ingmar Bergman's Fanny & Alexander as films by old men looking back on their youth. While this is true, in the main, the fact is that Amarcord has a loose narrative structure, in which the lives of many characters are detailed in comic vignettes, whereas Fanny & Alexander is a straight drama. The film that Amarcord shares a deeper affinity with is one which was obviously influenced by it; Woody Allen's grossly underrated and terrific Radio Days. Which of those two films is better is debatable, although Allen's film is tighter, shorter, and a bit deeper in characterization. Allen's opening classroom scenes in Annie Hall also owe a debt to this film's school-based scenes. Amarcord is not a masterpiece, on par with earlier Fellini classics like Nights Of Cabiria, La Dolce Vita, nor 8\u00bd, but it is a very good and enjoyable romp, which opened the 1974 Cannes Film Festival and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film that same year.Reportedly, the proper Italian for 'I remember' is 'mi ricordo', but Fellini used his own native Romagnolo dialect's version of the term a m'arc\u00f2rd, to limn his lost boyhood in the coastal town of Rimini- which is the central character of the film. Regardless, the film he constructed is a very good one, which follows a year in the life of a town and its citizenry- from one spring to the next, although it heralded the weaker and even more loosely constructed films that ended his career. This is the last film that most cineastes even to bother arguing the greatness of. Yet, many of the labels applied to it simply are not correct- it is not surreal, for it is grounded in reality, even as flights of fancy take place; it is not a satire, even though there are satirical elements. The very impulse to always definitively characterize something as this or that, without allowing comfortable straddling of boundaries says more of the flaws of the critic than they do of the film. Also, despite the picaresque nature of the film it does not move too quickly. Most of the famed scenes plat out in seven to ten minute stretches where small details filter into the subconscious without even knowing it\u0085.The musical soundtrack, by Nino Rota, is stellar, and the best thing in the film, although the cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno is not far behind, especially in the sunset scene where Uncle Teo is coaxed down from the apple tree and back to the asylum. Yet, Amarcord succeeds because its totality is greater than any of its great to mediocre parts. It may not be a great film, but it is a great display of artistic excellence to marshal such disparate elements into a film that succeeds far more often than it doesn't. Federico Fellini, in this film, shows that he is a great artist, even when his art is not great.",

This is Fellini at his best as he works not isolate the audience, but rather, develops a personal story that is riddled with the usual mythological deconstruction. By widening his audience, Amarcord works to have the audience reflect on their own childhood.

There are scenes where characters talk directly to the camera, giving history lessons about the town and some of the people in it, and then offscreen, another character will make a fart noise. It's strange and bizarre, and I don't know how it works so well, but it does. There are other scenes that feature masturbation as a joke, and characters constantly ogle the more voluptuous women in the town. But though there are scenes with that kind of humor, there are also long scenes with people just playing music and dancing. We see a yearly festival take place, and we watch as people get excited to watch a boat pass by their town. This film is really a slice of life; we experience everything the people of that time dealt with, from the rise of fascism to dealing with mental health, to the hopes and dreams of random characters. I absolutely recommend this movie, but I don't know if I'd start here for Fellini. While \" La Dolce Vita\" is a masterpiece; \"Amarcord\" is simply a great film.",

There's a certain quality -for bad and for good- to the people depicted in Amarcord, a restlessness for life, love, and their celebration and consumption that you can find in the people of Rimini and Romagna, even past its heyday.

            "content": "Amarcord, Italian for \"I Remember,\" is a colorful and artistic film from famed Italian director Federico Fellini. It tells the story of a small Italian coastal town under a fascist regime before World War II. The film paints a grand imaginative portrait of this town as recalled by its spry director who possesses a keen knack for creative and spirited storytelling. We grow to love the characters in the film and we watch their larger-than-life stories unfold before our eyes in a beautiful and enticing way. This film makes its own rules and paints itself up as an incredibly spirited tale of joy, love, and even bittersweet remorse for a town that only could have existed the way it did in the time period it did.It isn't difficult to see the personal level of this film that Fellini includes. It is apparent how much of the story was taken from his own childhood and then injected with a wistful and almost make-believe quality of storytelling. The town in the film is based on Rimini, the town where Fellini grew up, so it is a given that this is a personal film, but you don't even have to know that to see the personal connection coursing through this film's veins. Fellini has created a nostalgic story for himself that others can also enjoy to great extents. Amarcord isn't self indulgent and it doesn't lose track of its heart and soul which makes it such a pleasurable experience.Fellini takes some liberties with the narrative style of this film as it is told in a very free-form way. It is almost a collection of short stories thrown together in a playful and creative way. The town and its strong heritage, affecting each enjoyable character, is the thread which ties the scattered pieces of the narrative together and keeps it from being uncohesive or confusing. Amarcord is the study of a town, as well as the study of people and family. It weaves all of its stories and characters in and out of each other, never losing its loving and colorful mood. The film boasts a lot of fun style throughout with plenty of humor thrown in. The film is very funny at times, but it displays a smarter and more sophisticated humor without being pompous or self important. The film's humor is an excellent display of sarcasm, irony, and cleverness all rolled into a bundle of entertainment.For everything Amarcord does, it does right and it does well. It is simplistic in its motives and care free in its narrative. It isn't anything complex or serious. It only seeks to entertain, while also provide a glorious, imaginative, and often times nostalgic look at the simpler times of life and what joys they bring us. While Amarcord isn't a film I would watch over and over again, there is absolutely no denying that it is an excellent film well worth the watch.",

            "review_title": "Fellini past memory",
            "content": "In Italian, a m'arcord means I remember and this is what Federico Fellini does in this film which recounts his childhood and the life of his childhood best friend, Luigi Titta Benzi, who is the inspiration for Titta, the main character. Fellini took efforts to say that this was not an autobiographical film, but thoughts of his past.What's amazing to me is this Oscar-winning film - Best Foreign Language Film and nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay - was brought to the U. S. by Roger Corman.Titta (Bruno Zanin) and his friends would rather be involved with pranks and attempt to lose their virginity than studying under fascism. This film has a scene where four of them masturbate in a car while discussing women like Bardot that may shock U. S. audiences, not because there's any nudity, but the frankness and idea of boys exploring their sexuality in the same confined space is something that Americans would deny ever doing.Many of Titta's fantasies revolve around Gradisca (Magali No\u00ebl), the most beautiful woman in town who is due to be married to a fascist officer, as well as an encounter with a well-endowed tobacconist (Maria Antonietta Beluzzi) who nearly overwhelms him with her bosom.This is an episodic film, filled with moments like Titta's institutionalized uncle climbing a tree and screaming, \"I want a woman!\" as well as his father's past as an anarchist, a winter family tragedy, the town coming together for a festival and an ocean liner passing by and everyone meeting it by boat. It's charming and perhaps the most accessible of Fellini's films, even if the Italian sexuality of it all may be too much for American puritanical eyes.How important of a movie is this? It was the first film released in the letterboxed format when it came out on a RCA SelectaVision CED videodisc.",

We have all been there, actively or passively, maybe only watching, but there. People are the same everywhere! And it is just wonderful to see these portraits of people made with such honest love, without bad intentions or double morals, without prejudices. Maybe a little bit too much nostalgia, but hey, this is a movie of reconciliation with life, after the disillusion of La dolce vita and the sour sweet 8 e mezzo.

The seemingly accidental colliding of scenes, which come and go as memories do, is what makes Fellini's Amarcord (I remember) such a perfect depiction of one's memories of youth. It feels like a collection of moments so bright and vibrant, that it is totally believable that it would be those that the central figure, Titta, would remember. Fellini remembers his own childhood, of course, through Titta in Amarcord, and the help of a lot of fantasy and fiction, which Fellini loves to deploy in order to reach penetrating truth. Rich colours, cinematography, and a beautiful Nino Rota score also help create the dreamlike feel of memory. Fellini had such a sense for movement - both of the camera, and for the arrangement of figures in the frame (also known as mise-en-scene), and though it is nearly impossible to pick a favourite Fellini work, this sense works here just as marvellously and hypnotically as it does in 8 1/2.

Don't get me wrong: it is perfectly realistic, yet for the most part its funny (not in the american way, of course) and even when things become more serious, it retains its lightness, as if Fellini is suggesting: \"Life is funny. Too funny to take it too serious, too short for someone to be politically correct. And for that one, its true and original art.AMARCORD = my memories (info provided by some Italian reviewer, thnx!)",

            "content": "Amarcord is about pulling together meticulous memory and loose fantasies. Fellini shows us the people and the places of his (or somebody else's) youth, in a small Italian village in the 1930s.  Each person and each place is shown in a manner that contains an unknown dosage of memory and fantasy. This exercise goes from Tita's inner family to his school, streets, village, church and \"big\" politics.  The family includes the cantankerous father, the stressed mother, the pampered uncle, the colorful grandfather, the sly brother, the maid, the unruly but wholesome Tita - all  shown in a single, rowdy sequence gathered around a cramped dinner table in a small kitchen. The school is depicted in a devastating sequence of vignettes about ugly and intimidating teachers and a series silly student pranks.  The village people are portrayed in the opening sequence of the burning of the winter witch. There we see the deranged town whore, the good old over-aged boys (reminiscent of I Bidoni), the mayor, the town beauty queen (Gradisca), the fierce motorcycle rider.  The dream-like passage of the giant steamboat is an opportunity to see most of the same people, in different attire and behavior.  The civic parade is still another opportunity to see everybody again, under another light, saluting the fascist official and ceremonies. Tita's friends are a colorful bunch of weird-looking teenagers, who dance in the fog in front of the closed hotel to the imagined tune of still-to-come American band-style music.  A peacock in the middle of a snowstorm seems to hit the upper limit of fantasy (or memory), so Fellini swiftly takes the film to an end with the sequence of Gradisca's marriage to a carabinieri, an end so \"soft\" that looks like the dissolution of a dream, as characters and landscape gently fade out.  Choose to see what you prefer each time you see this film: memory or fantasy, or the thousand shades in between.  Try to do this with any other film, and you will find that it does not work.  That is why it is a masterpiece.",

If my neighbor says Hitler or Mussolini is a great guy than I must think so too. Everything is just events unfolding and adding up to results. While this at first can be devastating for a child to face, the adults necessary for a world to function all generally realize that life simply just goes on like a play or film that starts and ends.The rollercoaster we call life is all here in the film Amarcord.

Although I saw it only once, decades later I can still remember scenes and share my delight in them with friends who have also seen the movie. Rather like the later \"Ginger and Fred\", we see here Felinni's compassionate eye for humankind and the humour in their everyday foibles. No need to list my favorite vignettes here, everyone will have their own, and they are all great, even if one or two stand out for sheer extravagance!I am looking forward to watching this again sometime soon. \"Dolce Vita\" now looks dated and self-indulgent; \"8 1/2\" is as incomprehensible as ever (though I still enjoy it); but if I ever build up a Fellini library, Amarcord will be one of the first on my list.",

            "content": "Of the world's great directors Fellini is probably the most uneven.  His early work is all of a piece.  Films such as \"La Strada\" and \"Le Notti di Cabiria\" have a clear sense of narrative flow, their stories told with considerable charm and sensitivity.  His unique style is already present. Who but Fellini could have conceived the scene where a mad boy is discovered hidden away in a farmhouse while outside a wedding is in progress (\"La Strada\") or assembled  the array of grotesques for the religious ceremony in \"Cabiria\".  With \"La Dolce Vita\" the director reached his watershed.  This gigantic pivotal work contains scenes that are among his finest, the hysteria generated by a fake religious vision for instance, while at the same time the self indulgence that all but ruined his work from then on was beginning to appear.  One wild party follows another (by Pasolini standards they are almost too tame today to be described as \"orgies\"), constricting dramatic advancement through the director's ever increasing obsession with the strangest faces he can find.  It is something of a miracle that he made a film as wondrous as \"Amarcord\" after the boring excesses of \"Roma\" and \"Satyricon\".  I can only conclude that at a time when he had all but lost his grip on cinematic syntax he found a subject he really cared about. \"Amarcord\" is a visual poem set in Rimini, the town in which he grew up. The warmth and expressiveness of his early work is wonderfully combined with the visual flights of fancy that either made or marred his films from \"La Dolce Vita\" onwards.  The formal framework of the four seasons over the course of one year gives it a satisfying sense of unity that for Fellini is unusual.  It ends as it begins with the onset of a new Spring cycle with the coming of the \"fairy fluff\".  Although the narrative line is mainly anecdotal, Fellini achieves a marvellous sense of formal balance by placing an extended sequence (almost a film within a film) at the midway point.  The family summer outing with the mad uncle let out from his asylum for a few hours represents Fellini's genius for comic observation at its finest. Among the shorter sequences the family Sunday lunch which, like the outing, ends in disaster is a highlight.  And who can forget the early school scenes with their grotesque gallery of teachers so outlandishly depicted.  It has to be admitted that not all of \"Amarcord\" is on this high level of invention.  I find the sequences in the Grand Hotel rather silly and those depicting the nocturnal gathering to see a liner passing by and a boy's walk in a thick fog almost need to be fast forwarded.  But who can quibble with a film that offers so many delights that it is probably one of the select few I would have on my desert island.  I love the work for its irreverence. There is one gorgeous moment lasting a split second where a little boy being driven in a vehicle following a hearse to a funeral suddenly pulls a grotesque face.  Only Fellini could have pulled this off.",

Fellini's fantastical take on fascism, sexuality and, enveloping it all - Catholicism, the true repressive force in many ways. Giuseppe Rotunno's exquisite cinematography captures it all rapturously and Nino Rota's music transcends.AMARCORD won the Oscar for Foreign Language Film and Fellini was nominated for Best Director* and Screenplay (with Tonino Guerra).",

Amarcord won both an Oscar and a place in lists of great movies (Roger Ebert's, for example). Amarcord dazzles us with scenery, with ideas, and with Fellini's usual suite of well-defined situations and characters. Fellini also fondly reveres the movies of other great directors. One homage among many others is to the grand snow fort and pillow fights in *Napoleon*, by Abel Gance. Clearly Amarcord captivated many perspicacious viewers and reviewers. But I am not sure why, because the movie lacks a perceivable plot. Oh, there is a plot of sorts, which I shan't give away, but the movie mostly stands on its Turner landscapes, its Velazquez *family* portraits and its Rota score. Marvelous in its way, of course, but this Amarcord is, after all, a movie, and, for me at any rate, a movie should have a plot.

It is absurd, incoherent, devoid of any plot and amusing at times.It consists of myriad vignettes, but they don't connect towards the end of the film to make a statement. However, they all hold their place regardless of how insignificant they may seem. Fellini doesn't linger with a scene and they are all very transient, similar to most of our experiences. Regardless of how long some of them may seem at the time, they all eventually prove to be ephemeral.Isn't it funny how all of our individual experiences are so personal and yet so universal? Fellini seems to be well aware of this paradox and deploys it in his film. Amarcord will make you rummage through your memories, and at any time in the film, you might say, 'I know what this feels like.'\nOur lives are an amalgamation of the smallest of experiences and don't necessarily need to have any grandiose spectacles. Similarly, Amarcord is about a baffled group of boys, their lewd jokes, classrooms, a coveted teacher, an eccentric uncle, a father whose only visible emotion is anger, the church through the lens of a teenager, childhood crushes, a voluptuous woman desired by the entire town. It also encompasses more poignant aspects such as politics, radicalism, dissent, and its repercussions.Fellini succeeds in encapsulating a lifetime within two hours. Towards the end we get to experience loss, subsequently followed by the beginning of a new life. Isn't that what life is: a perpetual process of endings and new beginnings.
