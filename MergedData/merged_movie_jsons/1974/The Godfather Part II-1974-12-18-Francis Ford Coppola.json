            "content": "Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by \"The Godfather, Part II\" in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters...",

            "review_title": "The Greatest Sequel During the Cinema's History",
            "content": "\"The Godfather, Part II\" is excellent just like its predecessor. While the first is arguably the greatest film ever made, the second installment is easily the best sequel produced hands down. The film is split between the stories of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, Oscar-nominated) and a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in his star-making, first Oscar-winning performance). In the 1950s, Michael is trying to expand his crime empire to locales such as Las Vegas, Hollywood, and even turbulent Cuba. However, there are numerous problems as older brother Fredo (John Cazale) may have double-crossed the family. Also two prominent crime bosses pose a considerable threat as well (Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, both Oscar-nominated). Younger sister Connie (Oscar nominee Talia Shire) is still reeling from her husband's murder and her father's death at the conclusion of the original film. Michael is also distancing himself from his wife (Diane Keaton) and some of his most trusted friends (Robert Duvall). While all this is occurring we get glimpses into the early life of Michael's father (De Niro). We learn that his parents and older brother have been killed in early-1900s Sicily and that he has immigrated to New York. Vito pays his dues and learns the tricks of the trade, buying his time, before deciding to create his own small empire which would of course grow and become what we saw in the original. It would seem that the film would be confusing by jumping back and forth between Michael and his father, but that is not so. Coppola gives you just enough information to keep the audience intrigued through each segment. The film is very well-made and runs very smoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes. Many think that this installment is the best of the series. Even though I still think that the original is the best, I cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this is the definitive sequel. 5 stars out of 5.",

This movie is both \"prequel\" and \"sequel\" of the first godfather movie. I have never watched anything like this in my entire life.

It's a masterpiece that can never be written off even after centuries.

            "review_title": "The Greatest Film Ever Made",
            "content": "The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.\nBehind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (\"Keep your friends close .....\", \"I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies\"), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent.",

            "review_title": "Terrific continuation of the \"Godfather\" series; to call it a \"sequel\" almost seems insulting...",
            "content": "This sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I hesitate to call it a sequel, as \"sequel\" is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like \"The Matrix Reloaded\" is a sequel - \"The Godfather Part II\" is something more. It's just too good to be called a sequel.The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did.Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in \"The Godfather Part II,\" Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. \"The Godfather\" was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. \"The Godfather Part II\" may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all this good. To call it a \"sequel\" almost seems insulting.",

            "content": "Nino Rota's musical score plays an even greater role in this equal but different successor than it did in the predecessor. Yearning, lamenting, stimulating bygone ages, see how infectiously Nino Rota's music affects our sentiments for the savage events on screen. It is the pulse of the films. One cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota music. Against all our realistic deduction, it guides us to how to feel about the films, and condition us to understand the characters within their own world. Throughout the Corleone family's many criminal actions, we understand that one doesn't have to be a monster in order to live with having done them.In what is both a dual expansion of its predecessor and a masterpiece of juxtaposition in itself, we see Michael Corleone forfeit his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. As his father quietly knew in his latter days would be so, Michael has lost sight of those values that made Don Corleone better than he had to be and has become a new godfather every bit as evil as he has to be. The score, with its tonal harmony, its honeyed and emotional aesthetics, is sad, and music can often evoke emotion more surely and subtly than story. Consider several operas with ridiculous stories and lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us to tears.The devolution of Michael Corleone is adjacent with flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito, played with paternal, home-loving subtlety by Robert De Niro. These scenes, in Sicily and old New York at the turn of the century, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. No false romanticism conceals the necessity of murder to do business. We don't look at Vito as a victim of his environment, but a product of the depiction of the resorts to which the Italian culture had turned, initially to both protect their homeland and protect their livelihood as immigrants who came to America to be paid less than the blacks.The film opens in 1901 Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral procession for young Vito's father, who had been killed by the local Mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio, over an insult. During the procession, Vito's older brother is also murdered because he swore to avenge his father. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg for the life of young Vito. When he refuses, she sacrifices herself to allow Vito to escape. They scour the town for him, warning the sleeping townsfolk against harboring the boy. With the aid of a few of the townspeople, Vito finds his way by ship to Ellis Island, where an immigration agent, mishearing Vito's hometown of Corleone as his name, registers him as Vito Corleone. From this very opening, and the events that gradually follow, we see that Vito's damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense of family, and his experience of revenge as a necessity was passed on to Vito's sons.The life of young Vito helps to explain the forming of the adult Don Corleone. As his unplanned successor Michael, his youngest child, transforms, we hark back to why, when his true desire is to make the Corleone family completely legitimate, he feels that he must play the game by its old rules. His wife says, \"You once told me: 'In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.' That was seven years ago.\" What we have are two all-too-real narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. There is even a parallel between two elderly dons: Revenge must be had.I admire the way Coppola and Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving Miami boss Hyman Roth, his older brother Fredo, and the death of Sonny in the previous film. Who is against him? Why? Michael drifts several explanations past several key players, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess. He has to envision the moves without seeing them. Coppola shows Michael breaking under the burden. We recall that he was a war hero, a successful college student, forging an honest life. Ultimately Michael has no one by whom to swear but his aging mother. Michael's desolation in that scene of dialogue informs the film's closing shot.So this six-time Oscar-winning three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic is ultimately a dreary experience, a mourning for what could've been. It is a contrast with the earlier film, in which Don Corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers. Young Vito was a murderer, too, as we more fully understand in the Sicily and New York scenes of Part II. But he was wise and diplomatic. Murder was personal. As Hyman Roth says, \"It had nothing to do with business.\" The crucial difference between the father and son is that Vito is cognizant of and comprehending the needs, feelings, problems, and views of others, and Michael grows in the very opposite direction. Whereas the first movie was a taut ensemble piece, this second part is a more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters, neither of whom share scenes with each other. Everyone else is periphery.It must be seen as a piece with the consummate mastership of The Godfather. When the characters in a film truly take on a simulated environmental existence for us, it becomes a film that everyone who cherishes movies to any extent should see at least once.",

            "content": "To me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more of a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb rating and you'll see I'm not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleone's life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one.",

            "content": "Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) \"in the role\" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the \"inside\" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended \"flashback\" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call \"J.K. Rowling Syndrome\". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the d\u00e9nouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.",

            "content": "A lot of people seem to consider THE GODFATHER PART II to be the best film ever made, a film that's even better than it's already excellent predecessor. Unfortunately, I have to disagree. While this movie is very good, and as well made as the original, I think the original has the edge.The reason for that is the script, which was just better, and more involved, the first time around. Here, there are dual narratives, one of which follows the traditional sequel route of showing that happened to the Corleone family after the events of the first movie, while the second is a prequel revealing how Vito Corleone became the mafia boss he ended up as.While I love Robert De Niro and I enjoyed the flashback scenes, I felt this whole sequence was slightly unnecessary. From the material given, the viewer can already guess how the De Niro character rose through the ranks and the events we witness feel a little bit superfluous. Sure, the pair of assassination scenes are excellent, but the rest just feels obvious and expected.Meanwhile, the Pacino narrative also has its problems, although cast and director aren't at fault; Coppola reunites many of his principals here and to excellent effect. However, there isn't nearly as much incident in the narrative and the whole story feels a little dragged out, a little over-emphasised. In the first film, the Pacino character had three or four major plot points to deal with, whereas this time the events are limited; for example, the entire film focuses on the situation with Roth, whereas in THE GODFATHER that would have just taken up half an hour or so. Therefore the ending, when it comes, is admittedly powerful, but not as effective in comparison to the genuinely amazing things we saw in the first film. It's been done before, and apart from a little more depth and character focus, we can't take much more away from this sequel. So it's very good, but not quite up there to the level of the first.",

            "content": "I do have to agree that calling Godfather Part II a sequel is rather insulting. It is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was that says a lot. The Godfather Part II is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. People may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. Of course, but I think that was deliberate. Both this and the first Godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling.For one thing, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. The music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. Then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. The film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where Vito flees Sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.The acting is superb once again. Vito is brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro in one of his better performances. I was also taken with Robert Duvall as loyal Tom, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. But the picture belongs to Al Pacino. He was great carrying the first Godfather movie, but he is even better here. He is simply phenomenal, and to be honest I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Not that I thought it was bad, but it just didn't live up to the hype of being a better sequel or one of the greatest sequels ever. I really don't think so, but then that's because I absolutely loved the performance of Marlon Brando and that's something I loved that film for. I also liked Al Pacino in the first movie, but here with him being fully in control I didn't quite like him. His acting is good, like the way he acts with his eyes and being a man of few words and all, but I still prefer Brando as a lead and want him to carry the film.The cinematography is excellent and by 70's standards it's just incredible and I can see why it must have been loved so much and as a sequel especially. As far as the story goes, this one was nothing groundbreaking or jaw dropping. It was highly predictable, annoying and boring at times.The best part for me were the flashback scenes of Robert De Niro, where he played the young Vito Corleone. The to and fro between the current times and the flashbacks were a tad annoying but I did enjoy the parts with De Niro in them. I usually don't mind long films. I love the Godfather 1972 immensely, but I'll have to admit I found this quite long and tedious to finish and felt a few scenes could have been cut short and it could have been made even better.Overall it's still a pretty solid movie, but you may feel it has not aged too well and is kinda overrated.

            "content": "Sequel to the original Godfather is slower moving than the original but maybe better. The first was fresh material and Brando's presence was a huge plus. But this one digs into the blood and guts of the two main characters, provoking more thought, as well as introducing us to one of the most prolific actors today.Michael's descent into darkness is terrible to behold. Tragedy surrounds him as he struggles to maintain his empire but alienates himself in the process. Hey, it's not easy holding a crime empire together. I think this film sets out to make Michael a tragic figure but how do you feel sympathy for a guy who murders family members? It's a cold world obviously, and takes a strong man to stay on top. Very interesting final scene, grim and stark, as Michael sits contemplating on a chair watching the dead leaves blow around him.Pacino's performance is magnificent. Some great scenes, especially when Michael realizes Fredo betrayed him. That simple movement of covering his forehead in shock and despair conveys so much. Michael becomes a three dimensional character in this film as opposed to the first. Pacino just nails the part.The secondary story is the rise of Michael's father, Vito Corleone and we watch the birth of a star. DeNiro even surpasses Pacino in his part, if that is possible. The calculating Vito as he calmly stalks Don Fanucci from the rooftops is classic film. DeNiro plays the role of Death himself: knife thin, pale yet slick and immaculate in appearance. How many other hit men in the movies borrowed DeNiro's look? What the Godfather does, unlike so many other films of it's generation is convey thought in simple movements. Watch DeNiro as he pales visibly, staring at an old Italian remedy of his sick baby. We know right then that Vito Corleone will do whatever it takes to protect and save his family. Watch him as Don Fanucci boards his car and leans on him. By DeNiro's expression, we know Fanucci is already a dead man. That's unsurpassed acting.The sets are beautiful to behold and this is probably the best cinematography I have seen in any movie. Early 1900's New York, in the Italian neighborhood is unreal. Watch the pedestrians and background movement while the focus of the scene is occurring. That's sheer magic. Once again, watch Hyman Roth in Cuba lie on the couch, shirtless and a gentle wind moving the drapes. We can practically feel the heat and hear and smell the city of Havana. It made me think how much care and calculation was put into this movie.Some weak points: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth was not on par with the other actors. Gazzo as Pentangeli just grated on my nerves, especially in the first hour. I was hoping he would get whacked so he would not appear in the rest of the film. The rest of the cast is great as usual, especially Duvall and Kirby. Not much to complain about.The second Godfather, tries to do what the first does, a study of Vito vs. Michael. They both have different motivations for ruling their empire. Whereas Vito tries to do whatever it takes to rise from poverty and provide for his family out of love, Michael rules out of ruthlessness and a need to succeed to maintain his empire. You can see where the results have taken both.One of the greatest films of all time.",

This is the only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it's acting talent, for it's cinematography, and for it's fantastic story. The acting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but the story wasn't exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the flashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it wouldn't have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was otherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as the first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath, and Michael Corleone's further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the first. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as young, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents, by mimicking Brando's performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not as good as the first; it's saved by the flashback sequences that show us how and why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the first. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first, and the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the first. The new actors also give great performances, though the following stand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. The characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is portrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the first, has it's share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that were memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly because of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando's part fairly well, but overall, the film isn't as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it does reach about the same quality overall. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved, and of course anyone who enjoyed the first, as they should enjoy this one too, but possibly to a lesser extent. 10/10",

Regarded by many as the best sequel ever, the Godfather Part II is equally brilliant as its precursor and good enough to stand on its own. The movie juxtaposes, the early life of Vito Corleone (from his orphaned childhood to his rise in power in New York), with the life of his son, Michael (after Vito's death to Michael becoming the most powerful Mafia head). Al Pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating Michael's journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. Just like in part I, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an Oscar, but the Academy once again robbed him of the glory.Robert De Niro in his Oscar winning portrayal of Vito Corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in English. The synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. Robert Duvall reprises his role of Tom Hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of Brando's portrayal in Godfather part I. The entire cast is brilliant with special mention of John Cazole as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V.Gazzo as Frankie Pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. Cuppola's brilliant and innovative direction gives Puzo's masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by Nino Rota's poignant score and Gordon Willis' vivid cinematography. In a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana.

Two films for the price of one!Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, only half of this 'double-bill' is really worth the time and effort. The flashbacks are great, with Robert De Niro superb as the young adult Vito, rising from shop assistant to mob boss; these parts reminded me of the excellent Once Upon A Time In America, which also charted the early lives of young gangsters (and which also starred De Niro). In contrast, the scenes featuring Michael's continuing underworld activities in the '50s are far too convoluted and slow for their own good, making keeping up with the Corleones more of a chore than a pleasure.8/10 for the flashbacks; 4/10 for the rest.

There's almost no way you could believe that the piece powers past the three-hour mark, which it does thanks mainly to its unneeded and honestly less interesting flashback plots seemingly disconnected from the main story. There's not a moment in the foremost narrative I'd suggest cutting even for a second, and even those flashback bits are breathlessly entertaining (in a much more instantly gratifying way than the slow-burning main narrative.) Every second of the picture adds up to an experience that seems sweepingly massive yet strangely intimate, an effortlessly engaging examination of the fall of an empire and the nostalgic sadness at the heart of a man whose soul is slowly turning to stone. 8/10.",

            "content": "In the movies, sequels have always been difficult. The franchise pictures of the twenties and thirties were always careful to repeat cast and basic formula without reopening story lines that had already run their course. While the following decades saw the rise of the TV series, the screen sequel became almost unknown. Today the fad of numbered sequels, ubiquitous in the eighties, has now become synonymous with unspeakable badness. That tradition was started, quite innocently, by this 1974 follow-up to The Godfather.Being a drama, The Godfather Part II's biggest asset is probably in retaining the sublime cast that made the original so powerful. Al Pacino picks up exactly where he left off a few years previously, retreating further into passive steeliness, suppressing all emotions except the occasional burst of anger. John Cazale has a somewhat expanded role, getting to show off a more impressive acting range and making Fredo seem sympathetic in his weakness. Welcome returns are also made by Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire. However the greatest turn is that of newcomer Robert De Niro. De Niro gives a credible presentation of an up-and-coming mobster and proud family man, whilst cleverly working in mannerisms of Marlon Brando's middle-aged Don in The Godfather. It's still only a small demonstration of De Niro's talents however.Perhaps an even more important factor is the return of producer-director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola demonstrates again his ability to focus drama, going to lengths to show us only what is important. Take, as one example out of many, the scene where Pacino and Lee Strasberg first meet. Roth's wife greets Pacino, and bustles in and out of the scene once or twice to utter a few lines, but watch the way Coppola keeps her fluttering about in the foreground, often with her back to us, framed from the shoulder down so we never see her face. Coppola allows her to appear for reasons of logic, but as she's not a character we need to remember, he doesn't allow us to connect with her visually. This is really intelligent filmmaking.But The Godfather Part II is more than ever about stunning imagery. With a bigger budget, vaster sets and hordes of extras, Coppola shows an impressive ability to create thriving tableaux of crowds and street scenes, repeatedly using horizontal scans to move us through an environment, showing off a hundred tiny instances of real life that really make us believe in the recreation of a bygone era. This is especially true in the young Vito flashbacks, which thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and the production design team lead by Dean Tavoularis, have a wonderful sepia-toned look to them. It's intriguing how Coppola also tends to keep his camera further back from the action in the those scenes, giving us the impression of something we are looking in on rather than something we are in the midst of.And yet this concentration on the visual has perhaps been taken a little too far. There are too many rather blatant bits of symbolism, such as the business of the dividing up of the Cuba-cake, which reminds me of some kind of twee history textbook illustration. This inconsequential prop gets several amount of close-ups, and even several references in the dialogue, everything but a flashing subtitle saying \"They're carving up Cuba \u2013 geddit?\" But instead of looking clever it just seems silly to have Hyman Roth going on about his stupid cake. And what's more, there are too many references to the best ideas in The Godfather \u2013 the dark Lake Tahoe office where Michael does his dealings: the murderous little montage at the end \u2013 all of which serve little purpose other than sly winks to those who are familiar with the earlier picture. None of these motifs is executed as effectively as they were first time round, and so really they look almost like poor copycats by some lesser filmmakers. The Godfather Part II is in many ways a decent work, but compared to its illustrious predecessor it is lukewarm; a flawed attempt to rekindle some of the old magic. In fact, it is just what we have come to associate with the movie sequel.",

            "content": "I commend Coppola for taking on Pt 2 and filling in a bit of Viteo Corleone's history, and continuing Michael's saga, with parallels between the two.\nIt was a good sequel, but I didn't find it as engaging as the first one, which I've seen countless number of times. I just watched Pt 2 recently after not having seen it for a number of years.\nI'm not sure why it doesn't have the same feeling as the first. I think the lack of direction (i.e. a clear plot line) didn't help. There was an attempt on Michael's life, and there was talk here and there of doing some extra business, but a lot of it just seemed vague. Much of the movie was spent on the strained relationship between Michael and his family.\nAnother missed opportunity was explaining Don Vito Corleone's rise to power. You see him assassinate the neighbourhood Don at one point, but then we fast forward years later when he's grown a mustache and is doing favors for people, and vice versa. But we don't get any information on whether he's affiliated with the crime boss that was the boss of the guy he killed, or if he had formed a completely different family. I guess that would have been a 4.5hr movie.\nOverall, a good, but not great sequel. Not as quotable either, like the first movie. Did it deserve the Best Oscar Nom and Win. I guess so. There were a lot of great movies that year. But I think the juggernaut of the Godfather saga was too much to pass up giving it the win.",

            "content": "2 word advice: Watch it. Just watch it. Watch the restored 4K version if you can, the picture quality is breathtakingly gorgeous. This isnt a review by the way, it's just a long tribute to the brilliance of this work.For once a sequel is as powerful as the original. The Godfather part 2 is the proof. It is more elobarate, with a more detailed, complicated story, compared to the original. It has more character devellopment than part 1. Yet it definitely has a more saddening, melancholic mood as well. The original Godfather is like watching Spring, watching The Godfather part 2 however is like entering a never ending Winter. Part 2 is as powerful, as mesmirising and as brilliant as the original, but so saddening to watch. Sad, but beautiful.Director Francis Ford Coppola pulled of something no other director has ever achieved. He created 2 masterpieces of American cinema back to back, within 2 years. Coppola was a mad man in the seventies. Bordering on lunacy and also bordering on bankruptcy. Although one would think the enormous succes of the original Godfather made him a millionaire, he risked all his money for the sequel. That risk of investing all of his own money gave him a lot of creative control though, with consequentially terrific results.Just to mention one example in which director Coppola took risks no other director would dare take, I want to tell you about the Robert de Niro scenes shot in New York. The studio wanted to shoot these streetscenes on a cheaper indoor filmset, but director Coppola insisted he wanted to shoot on the streets of New York.This was not just a regular shoot, no way. Coppola cordoned off two entire city blocks for weeks on end. He redesigned the entire 2 blocks to make them look exactly like pre-war conditions. New Yorkers being New Yorkers were complaining about the inability to enter their own houses for weeks on end. The costs that cordoning off entire city blocks costed were skyrocketing. And for what purpose? Coppola wanted an authentic looking scene of merely a couple a minutes in which Robert de Niro would walk the streets of his neighbourhood.These scenes do look stunning, and because I know how many millions these few scenes have costed, I cant help but admire Coppola even more then I already did, for wanting to go to the limit in order to achieve ultimate credibility. And THAT is what the Godfather oozes in massive amounts: CREDIBILITY. Never before or after have life and love and the bonds of family been portrayed with such cinematic craftmanship and soul.Originally released in 1974. It was brilliant, mesmirising and taking my breath away back then. It still does, to this very day...",

            "content": "Although most movie sequels never equal the original this is certainly not the case of The Godfather: Part II. Many would argue it surpasses the original. With both films declared the Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy in their separate years, I'd hate to argue the difference.In this case we should thank the executives at Paramount for retaining both director Francis Ford Coppola and the original The Godfather author Mario Puzo to put their talents to this film. I'd hate to think what would have happened in other hands. Certainly these two men knew their characters and knew how to expand on them. And the best thing about The Godfather: Part II is that one can pick up the story, at least the modern portion of this one without reference to the original. In fact viewing this film will give you a burning passion to see the first.Unlike The Godfather and The Godfather: Part III, this film runs on two parallel tracks. The modern story is a continuation of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone now residing on the shores of Lake Tahoe and now directing the family affairs from Nevada where the Corleone family is heavily into gambling as we well know organized crime was back in those days of the Fifties and Sixties. He's going into partnership with Lee Strassberg playing Hyman Roth, a thinly veiled portrait of Meyer Lansky. But there are a lot of things making Pacino hesitant about this move into Cuba under the Battista dictatorship.The prequel parallel story is how young Vito Corleone came to this country as an orphan and worked his way up to establish himself as a crime boss. Here Coppola does a brilliant job in capturing the flavor of pre-World War I New York in the Italian ghetto. Robert DeNiro is young Vito Corleone and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Remarkable when you consider that two of his rivals were Lee Strassberg from this film and Michael V. Gazzo playing Frankie Pantangeli from this film as well, the Mafia kingpin turned Senate witness modeled on Joe Valachi. DeNiro and Marlon Brando have the unique distinction as players of winning an Oscar for playing the same role.The woman do better in this film as in the original. Talia Shire got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actress category as Connie Corleone Rizzi. You remember her husband betrays the family and is killed in the original. She now is a drunken dependent on Pacino. Diane Keaton's character of Kay Adams Corleone is expanded here as well. She's a cultural outsider and the Sicilian vendetta code that she's expected to approve without comment becomes too much to bare. Her scene with Pacino when she tells him she's leaving him is one of the best for both in their respective careers.Overlooked unfortunately at award time was John Cazale as Fredo Corleone. He's the middle son who's passed over for succession after eldest son James Caan is killed in The Godfather. Fredo's big moment in The Godfather is being unable to fire his weapon in defense of his father being shot and how he breaks down.Fredo's got feelings as John Cazale dramatically points out. He does something really stupid in this film and it costs him dear. Cazale has some of the best moments in this film.If the first Godfather film doesn't do it, The Godfather: Part II will have you permanently hooked on the inner workings and dynamics of the Corleone family both in the criminal and personal sense.",

            "content": "Michael Corleone continues his rise within organised crime in 1950's America, by expanding his family's empire across hotels and casinos.  When an attempt on his life fails Michael proceeds with his dealings in Cuba with Hyman Roth, a deal that will not be as straightforward as it appears. Meanwhile we are told the story of a young Vito's move to American and his rise from the ghetto up into the world of organised crime.I don't know what I can actually add to the sheer weight of praise that has been heaped onto this film - it is as accomplished a film as everyone says and is rightly one of the few examples of a sequel improving and building on a film.  The plot follows two separate strands, the continuing rise of Michael that is as much detrimental to his family as it is beneficial to his pocket; the other thread being Vito's arrival in America as a child and his rise up within the Italian ghettos.  The two stories are not as intertwined as I had remembered - they are very separate and the film can go for quite a while before it switches over.  In a way this works better as it allows both stories to go ahead without fragmenting either too much.This film, as with many gangster films, has been accused of glamorising the life of crime and those involved in it, however, if anything Godfather II does this even less than the original did.  The film shows the moral collapse of Michael in the same way as the first showed his power.  In fairness it does contrast the rise of the two dons - showing how Vito manages to keep his family together.  Despite this I would still argue that Michael's path is far from glamorous.The two narratives are both excellent but for different reasons.  Vito's rise is very interesting and provides solid back story to the first film and we can clearly see the change in Vito from a quiet young man to the influential powerbroker that he became - we also sadly see the rise in his demons and his viciousness.  Meanwhile Michael's tread sees more powerful deals and double crosses as he continues to gain more power.  This was overly complicated for me the first time I saw it but, with reviewing it I have gotten more from it each time - more understanding and more enjoyment. The twin stories are both engaging and the three hour plus running time passes effortlessly - this is a saga and it never feels like the running time was anything more than what was necessary.The cast are fantastic.  Naturally the kudos go to the two leads, and they deserve it.  Pacino has a less showy role than in the first film as he has already done his falling - here we only see further proof of the corrupting nature of his power.  De Niro steals the film this time with a measured performance that parallels Michael's change in the first film - it is a performance that lacks a certain amount of personality but shows us the traits that the film is interested in.  As before the support cast are great, Duvall is reliable as ever, while the most improved role goes to Cazale, who's Fredo becomes more important to the story and almost becomes a biblical character.  Quality comes in waves with Shire, Strasberg, Spradlin, Kirby and many others with solid performances.  Keaton is good but she is not given as much time as I would have liked, even if her scenes are important and powerful.Overall this is a great film that is based on a classy pair of stories that bring the subtexts with them and a collection of characters that are well developed by a script and some great actors.  It may be a little too lavish and plush for my own personal tastes, but it is a rich story.  To a certain degree the production values and sheer class of this film could be accused of glamorisation, but generally those who say this have managed to totally miss the fact that this is a cautionary tale that shows the corruption of power.",

            "content": "Mike is the head of his family, but he is broken, angry man and no one can escape his wrath, not even his poor older brother. This film is a film that laments for loss and is full of bitter emotions\u0085\u0085.but this is also arguably one of the greatest sequels of all time to one of the greatest films of all time. This is one of favorite all-time films, and I wouldn't hesitate to call it better than the first movie. This movie excels at everything, especially when it comes to storytelling. and the devolution of Michael Corleone's humanity and morality. The film invokes emotion from us for many reasons from the sad but powerful score by Nino Rota, to the powerhouse acting from everyone in the cast especially from Al Pacino, a story that introduces the past effectively, a very shocking ending, tight editing, powerhouse directing by Francis Ford Coppola, and the list goes on and on. Sequels were not a commodity back in the day, and this sequel to the huge 1972 film The Godfather is one of the first of its kind. The success of this film is why today's movie business relies upon sequels to make money. Regardless, this is one of the greatest films of all time.This film continues the saga of the Corleone family as we continue from the events of the first film. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is trying to expand the family's business into places like Hollywood and Cuba. His character takes a dive as he clashes with his brother Fredo (John Cazale), his lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), and his sister Connie (Talia Shire). He is suspicious of his business associates activities such as folks like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) and Frankie Pentangeli (Michael Gazzo). But this film incorporates another story into this story: the past. We meet Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) when he was growing up in Sicily and emigrates to New York City where be becomes connected with the mob life.I loved how the story is told thanks to the masterful storytelling by screenwriter Mario Puzo and director Coppola. They successfully tell two stories over the course of the movie without any trouble. Each story complements each other very well. The continuing saga of the present day family remains a high point. Of course the central character is Michael Corleone. The first film he was a man reluctant to take over the family business, but now he is turning into a control monster who trusts no one, not even his inner circle. It's a sad thing to watch as his morality crumbles and the final scene-one of cinema's most famous scenes, makes the case to show why Michael Corleone turns into a monster.I enjoyed the flashback sequences featuring young Vito. De Niro absolutely nails his role as Vito and he inherits the older Vito's mannerisms very well. It was fun to see how Vito turned into the man we knew him from the first film. The scenes in Sicily, where he is connected with a local mob boss is very powerful because Vito's mother was shot down. But that event helped turn Vito into the kind of man he was and to my happiness, Vito exacted the perfect kind of revenge. These scenes in Sicily and New York are beautifully shot and they really understood what New York was supposed to be in 1910.This is a film full of performances, all of them wonderful. Pacino excels as Michael Corleone once again. I really wish he won an Oscar for this role because he deserved it. His performance was effectively scary. Robert De Niro was absolutely amazing as the younger Vito and his role showed the kind of versatility this man has. Diane Keaton was effective as Kay. This film has Kay standing up to his man as she eventually leaves his side. Duvall is always great as Tom Hagen. John Cazale has a bigger part in the second film, as he tries to do what's best but simply does not have the brains and ultimately pays the price. His performance was a powerful one. Then we have the likes of the little known actors who gave an impression like Lee Strasberg who played the business partner Hyman Roth who wants Michael killed and Michael Gazzo who plays Frankie, a relative and associate of Michael's.The Godfather Part II is one of the greatest films of all time. The Godfather is an amazing film, but this one may just be a tad better. That is a rarity because 1.) Just look at the quality of the first film and 2.) sequels are rarely better than the original film. Speaking of sequels, this is the only sequel to this day that has won Best Picture at the Academy Award. Indeed, it's a very amazing feat. Although to be taken with a grain of salt, but on the website IMDb, this movie is ranked #2 of all-time. That goes to show the commercial value of the movie. I loved this movie for many reasons. From Al Pacino's wonderful performance to the chill-inducing score by Nino Rota. There was also a flashback sequence that hearkens back to the first movie as it brings back James Caan although Marlon Brando declined because he felt under-appreciated. Anyhow, Coppola does an amazing job with the first two movies in the series. That end shot\u0085\u0085just wow.My Grade: A+",

            "content": "OK. Let's get real. The Godfather is beyond excellent in every single way. I'm not giving comments on The Godfather, because it would be almost blasphemy. Nevertheless, I expected much more on part II. Personally, I didn't like it. Here's the deal: the story was way too slow paced. Nothing really happened. Only the hit on Michael's house, and the build up for young Vito's story was what makes you interested. The rest is just anti-climatic and dull. The dialogs weren't as quotable or stand alone as in the first. I thought as a sad imitation of the real thing.Al Pacino's performance was absolutely superb. The problem wasn't that. The whole character was what failed. In the first, we get the glimpse of a warm man, but gets cold when is needed. A man who thinks before he talks. In this one, we see a man who is cold and heartless every single time you see him. He no longer has the eminence that Vito Corleone once had. The previous Don was eminent and even though he could scare the hell out of you with his stare, you respected and looked up to him. Now, his son is just pure evil. And that doesn't make sense. In the book, it's clear that Michael is the living image of his father. So, what happened? Him killing Fredo was completely useless. Even if he did betray him, there was no need to have him whacked. A Don just doesn't kill anyone from his own family (not \"the Family\", the real one). I know, Michael did kill Carlo, but let's remember he was not really family, just an in-law, and he did deserve what was coming. Another thing I personally hated was what happened to Connie. As you will see in the third, she radically changes from the naive Don's daughter to... Sorry, wrong movie. Anyway, all the other aspects, (filmmaking, score, performances, photography)were indeed flawless. It's interesting. You can perfectly notice Coppola's anatomy for each \"Godfather\". You start with a prologue, then a religious ceremony and/or a party afterward, the plot then starts and a pivotal point is a hit on the Don. The rest is a slow, yet properly thought vengeance that ends with a gigantic and operatic blood bath. However, for part II, it wasn't's that operatic or with the same effect than part I. It was anti-climatic, and pretty disappointing.Another flaw I found was that the story doesn't really stick to the book. One key aspect in the film didn't even appear in Mario Puzo's novel: Vito Corleone never returned to Sicily. The name of the Don who had his family killed doesn't even matter. Still, the scene prominently explains Don Tomassino's condition from the first.Now, don't get me wrong. I'm a die hard fan of \"The Godfather\". I consider it to be the best movie ever (and the best novel ever, too). But part II just doesn't do it for me.",

            "content": "\"The Godfather: Part II\" hit theatres a couple of years after the first film and made history by becoming the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it is routinely listed alongside the original as one of the best American films of all time.The story picks up a few years after the end of the first film. Michael is firmly established as the head of the family and has moved to Nevada where he is edging the family towards legitimacy. However, when he is beset by betrayals he systematically sets about dealing with the betrayers mercilessly. There is also a second story thread (told in flashback) that traces the early years of Vito Corleone and his introduction to mob life.The film clocks in at a hefty 200 minutes. Unlike the first film, though, I couldn't really get caught up in either of the parallel stories so the film seemed to drag quite a bit. I didn't find the Vito storyline particularly compelling and the Michael storyline is little more than a convoluted extension of part one. These stories were meant to be compared but I don't feel that the director or the editor really constructed the film optimally for this purpose. Nevertheless, the film still has a classic scene or two, though it's nowhere near as consistent as the first film.Most of the actors whose characters survived the first film reprised their roles here. Returnees Al Pacino & Talia Shire each landed Oscar nominations and so did newcomers Michael V. Gazzo & Lee Strasberg. However, the only actor to take home an Oscar statuette was Robert De Niro for his portrayal of the young Vito Corleone. Personally, I think that Pacino gave the best performance of the film.Francis Ford Coppola won an Oscar for his direction but I feel that the first film was a better effort. From a visual standpoint the film is attractive, though, and the Nino Rota score was justly rewarded with an Oscar.Ultimately, I don't feel that \"The Godfather: Part II\" lives up to its pedigree. I've watched it a few times, so I'd say that I've given it a fair shake. That being said, I realize that I'm in the vast minority here so it must be a personal thing. As far as I'm concerned, \"Chinatown\" deserves the Best Picture Oscar that went to this film.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II (1974) **** (out of 4) Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece shows the early life of Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) who tries to rise in power and seek revenge after his parents are murdered. In the current times, Michael (Al Pacino) survives an assassination attempt and goes to find out who was behind it as well as destroy anyone who might be trying to do the family any harm. There's always going to be a debate on whether this film or the first is the best but for my money I have to hand it to this sequel. While both movies are great, I think this one works so well for numerous reasons but the biggest being that not only is a great sequel by continuing the events of the first film but it's also a great prequel by showing the life of Vito.I've always had a few minor problems with the original movie but I think it would be fair to say that this one here is flawless in every way. Coppola does such a masterful job at making sure everything was on par with the original but you can tell he knew people were going to be questioning him attempting to do a sequel so he wanted to make sure that he delivered even more. As with the first film, this one here has that very slow pace that wouldn't be allowed in any movie today but thankfully the 70s were a much different time. Coppola perfectly uses this slower pacing to really get inside the heads of these people and he really delivers so much character development that you're amazed that so much is able to be done in its epic 200-minute running time. Even more amazing is how quickly the film flies by, which is saying a lot of consider the length and pace.Of course, no one could ever say a negative thing about the performances and they're all masterful. I had really forgotten how wonderful Pacino was here but he's so chilling, cold and deadly quiet that you really do begin to fear him. I'm certainly not going to spoil anything but if you've seen the movie then you know what happens at the end and how Pacino plays this was just a masterful touch. DeNiro, picking up his first Oscar, does a wonderful job too. Doing the Italian language and mastering is obviously impressive but so are the small touches that he brings that connects the character to the later one played by Marlon Brando in the previous film. John Cazale is often overlooked but he has some terrific moments here as does Talia Shire, Robert Duvall and especially Diane Keaton.THE GODFATHER PART II contains all the greatness of the first film and it's a real miracle that Coppola was able to match it and deliver even more. The film works on so many levels but being able to pretty much see two movies rolled into one is something of a lost art. Even rarer is how perfectly both parts are as the drama, tension, violence and pain are all on full display and there's no question that this film deserves its reputation as one of the greatest ever made.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II is said by many to be the best sequel ever. I personally think that is arguable, since it arguably surpasses its proceeder and checking out the Lord of the Rings sequels and the Empire Strikes Back. Say this is the best sequel ever and I will not disagree. Say this is better than the first and I will agree. Honestly, I keep changing my mind about which instalment is better every time I watch them. This last time I watched them, the first one seemed better to me. The time before, this one was the superior picture. I don't care which is better, as long as I have 200 minutes of no interruptions while watching this.With the success of The Godfather in 1972, it was only natural for there to be a sequel. The Godfather Part II acts as both a sequel and a prequel, with the sequel being written by Coppola and Puzo and the prequel being taken from the novel. When Pacino broke out in the first movie, he topped it one year later with Serpico. His performance in this tops Serpico and everything else he's ever done. Unfortunately, he lost his sure Oscar win to Art Carney. Yes, Carney was worthy, but put him in the same category as Al Pacino for perhaps the best role ever and he becomes very unworthy. The people at the Academy probably thought Pacino would just get better and they could give him an award later. That would not come until 1993 when he won for a role in Scent of a Woman that was inferior to all that he did in the 70s. At least the Academy got the Best Picture win right. That was a given. Pacino's rival/friend/co- star, Robert De Niro took home the win for Best Supporting Actor, beating out their acting teacher, Lee Strasberg. De Niro became the first Oscar winner to not say a word of English. I don't know what it was about his portrayal, but there was some sort of magic contained with utter brilliance. Strasberg and Michael Gazzo where also fantastic, but both did not possess an unknown magic that few can bring to the table.The prequel follows a child Vito Corleone who's family is poor. He witnesses his family begin murdered by Corleone's most powerful mob boss. He heads to America and grows up on the streets there too. Years later, an adult Vito (De Niro) rises to the top of New York's underworld and is determined to avenge his family's death. Revenge stories like this have been done to death, but almost none have been executed this good. The sequel takes place a few years after the first with Michael (Pacino) as the Don. After he successfully dodges an assassination attempt, ordered by Hyman Roth (Strasberg), Michael's fears about loyalty, betrayal and murder lead him to a severe paranoid state making him a deadly madman.If there was one flaw this had, it would be that the antagonist in the sequel isn't much of a threat; we know Michael can destroy him and all he has. One reason the first one worked so well was because the family was losing and audience did not know how the family would regain power. That masterstroke isn't quite achieved in this. So maybe the first one is better.Both stories are less complex than the original, but both together make one hefty team. Al Pacino outdoes Marlon Brando and himself in one of the top five greatest roles of the screen. He leads an all-star cast in what is arguably better acting than the first. With most of this being arguably better than the first, Coppola's direction surpasses the first. The cinematography, sets and camera tricks beat out all the first had, which were great.4/4",

This is quite ironic because upon my 1st viewing, I thought it was the weakest of the trilogy.It may seem insane to rate this above the first, but Richard Roeper calls this his favorite movie.(See IMDB's trivia page for him.)Now WHY do I like this above the other? Hmmm..I have a hard time explaining that. I think one thing is the quotes. \"My offer to you is this...nothing.\" \"My Dad said you would always catch a fish if you said a Hail Mary.\"(that's a paraphrase.)\nIf I had to criticize something, it would be its length. Roger Ebert said \"no good movie is too long and no bad movie is too short.\" I disagree with the first half.TGP2 is very good but it's also very long. At 202 minutes, the movie actually seem longer and I had to repeatedly stop the DVD to get through it. Luckily there is an intermission you can skip.Either way, I do think this is the best Coppola film and therefore-if you see the 1st movie before this, you will definitely thoroughly enjoy it!",

Then after some days it started to grow on me. I couldn't help but watch The Godfather again. But i chose to watch The Godfather part 2 instead and boy I loved it.\nPerfect acting by everyone specially by the trio Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and John Cazale. These people gave the performance of their life. This is De Niro best performance after Raging bull and taxi driver and Al pacino's best after Scarface.\nThe way this movie plays with your emotion is indescribable. The best part is when Michael hugs Fredo during their mother's funeral and they seem to have forgotten what had happened but the look Michael gives to Al Neri we know that Michael is going to kill Fredo. This part shows us the true haunting nature of Michael. And the part when Anthony is called by Connie and Fredo says to him that he will catch a fish for Anthony and Al Neri smiles at the back making it feel normal but we knowing what is behind the smile is haunting.\nEverything about this movie is perfect! For me this, The Godfather and Raging Bull are the best movies ever made",

            "content": "You can write the volumes about the Godfather Part II phenomena. There is nothing that has not been said about it greatness, magnificence, perfection that radiate in every aspect, every moment, every inch of every frame, every performance, quote, glance, in the sound of the music, in both parts of the story, past and present that take the viewer to the journey in search of American Dream that turn to the epic vision of gaining ultimate power coming with ultimate loneliness. The story of one family of Italian Immigrants begins in Sicily in 1901, goes to New York City's \"Little Italy\" and spans over the most part of the 20th century. The viewers and the critics often argue which film is better, the original Godfather (1972) or Part 2. (1974). Both films are perfect in every way, and the vision and movie-making talent of a young director named Francis Ford Coppola are simply awesome. His idea of making an American epic, the story of one family raise to power, the price it takes and the eventual fall instead of a low budget fast moving gangster movie as the MGM studio had planned proved to be the stroke of genius. It is not easy to choose the best of two but I prefer Part II because I found the way Coppola tells two parts of the story by intertwining them and cutting effortlessly, seamlessly between the different time periods and geographic locations - incomparable. Yes, it's been done before and after him but never was I touched so deeply and amazed by the artistry and brilliancy of moving between past and future. I am surprised that the film was not rewarded for the editing because the team of editors contributed enormously in what is the magic of The Godfather, Part II. The film is unique by being at the same time a prequel and a sequel to the original Godfather because it tells the stories of young Vito Corleone first steps to the top of the criminal world and of Michael, his youngest son who became Godfather after his father passing. Part 2 has the most important scene in the whole trilogy, the scene when Vito kills Don Fanucci - the choice that would eventually lead to his raise as the crime family patriarch. I can go on forever. It is known how many great performances Al Pacino gave back in the 70s, his prime time (four Oscar nominations in the row, 1973-1976) but Michael Corleone in Part 2 is something that has to be studied and admired for as long as the young aspiring actors dream of not being stars but the ACTORS. I am not a fan of Pacino's latest films and roles. He screams a lot, he overplays but all screams can't say more than one glance from the scene during the New Year Celebration in Habana. He said so much by his eyes only that had literally darkened with disbelief, grief, anger, and despair when he realized that he had been betrayed by his own brother Fredo - who broke his heart and left the viewers heartbroken. John Casale had only given five performances during his tragically short career but every one of them was remarkable and every movie he worked in belongs to the best America has produced. ...Robert de Niro speaking only Italian as young Vito gives one of his finest performances speaking. He plays a beautiful, dignified, decent man, hard working, loving father and husband who would stop at nothing to make his family happy the best way he knows how... And above all - the melancholic, melodious, mournful score by Nino Rota, the Requiem for a dream, the best Rota's tunes outside Federico Fellini films, As great as it is, Godfather Part II would never be the same without musical themes written by Nino Rota specifically for the film, especially the main theme or the Kay theme - the sound of love lost and longing... And in the end - perhaps the best flash back scene ever filmed, Christmas and Vito Corleone's birthday celebration - the family is close together, the grown up children sit around the table, talk about future, some choices have been made, but there is no alienation, betrayal, losses, regrets, death....yet.",

Even so, I would rank this among the superior films to follow up on another and still be as strong and appealing and dramatically satisfying as the former. The structure of the film is also very important as it jumps back and forth between two stories of Corleone's without any disconnected feelings for the audience. Both could work as perfect single films on their own; together it's like a double album of the dark side of crime and the perilous nature of rising up in America as an immigrant. It's spectacular in many ways, masterpiece in fact, and has become as important as the first one (it is the only sequel to win an Oscar for best picture in those terms) and the acting all around is well-knit (even the pioneer himself Lee Strasberg is on hand as Roth), the score is possibly better in some ways to the first film, and most of the scene work is fantastic. One thing that attracted me to this film is also what I believe is one of the all-time great breakthrough performances in any film, as Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone has all of that confidence as an actor without channeling too much Brando. If there would be one reason to see the film and recommend it it would be because of him, as he gives one of his tour de force career turns in that streak of one after another in the 70s. Pacino is practically as good with enough lines that are realistically grounded but also highly quotable at times (the \"in my home\" bit is priceless). John Cazale, by the way, is also an element to make the film work as one of two performances that he'll be remembered for twenty years down the line (the other being Dog Day Afternoon). In short, it's just a very well done picture.",

Also, more on his father's growing up in Sicily and coming to America. With Vito being played not by Marlon Brando, but Robert DeNiro.) If you liked the first film, you will like this film. If you didn't, you won't. It's really that simple, since you have all the same great people coming together for this film with just as solid a script and acting as you did the first time. You lose Marlon Brando, but you get Robert DeNiro. I consider that a fair trade.This film has two things going for it: it has the early years of Don Corleone, which really fills in the missing mythos around the family. Without this, the film would appear to show the Corelones were always powerful, which is far from the truth. It does not explain how Don Corelone grew to talk in such a mumbled voice, though.Also, I really enjoyed the entire Cuba sequence, because it put the film in a historical time frame (and I like Cuba). I was never fully sure when the first film was taking place, but this one made sure I knew the years when Don Coreleone was growing up and that the present day was not 1974, but rather in roughly 1958-1959. That changed my perspective on things completely.If you have invested three hours in the first film, invest three more in this one. Why only get half the story of Vito Corleone?

I wonder if one could look at organized criminals like one might look at a mideast country, because they have their own principalities, their own history, almost their own religion. They have parceled out their land and protect against invaders. They fear and react to threats from the outside, from \"non-family\" members.The product they sell is terror. Of course, all participants live on the edge. Their human failings are dismissed and magnified as weakness and disloyalty. Brothers kill brothers.

I was almost convinced he was somehow related to Marlon Brando, he had the voice, the looks, the mannerisms, everything. Couple this with another story not included in the book of betrayal within the family while Michael tries to make a move in pre-Castro Cuba and you have a sequel that is every bit as good as the original. Michael has been stripped of all his humanity in this story, and he comes across as being a cold and heartless human being, one who would even have his own brother killed to preserve his nefarious empire.

Masterfully tracing the history of the Corleone Family from Vito's arrival at Ellis Island in 1901 to the Lake Tahoe empire of 1958, the story is a decades spanning saga that makes you wonder how almost three and a half hours can blow by so quickly. The picture's numerous flashback scenes work well to establish the beginnings of Don Corleone's rise to power, and Robert de Niro's portrayal of the young Vito effectively allow us to forget about asking why Marlon Brando didn't show up even once. Pacino is no longer the fresh faced kid home from the military who takes up the family business, but the brooding, brutal leader of a crime syndicate with a chessboard strategy of staying two and three steps ahead of his enemies at all times.If you haven't seen the movie in a long time, you might be surprised like I was while watching today. It's easy to recall the highlights like Frank Pentangeli's courtroom scene and subsequent suicide, and the way Fredo met his timely demise. What I had long forgotten was the way the picture opens with the Sicilian back story, and the way the New York neighborhood flashback thread literally runs throughout the entire picture. It's funny how I recall those scenes as a single sequence leading up to the murder of Don Fanucci, but it just goes to show you how faulty memory can be.You know, it's hard to believe that the first two Godfather movies are nearing the forty year mark since their original release. They've become American classics that have well withstood the test of time, and will continue maintain their appeal.

            "content": "After the huge success of The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo go on with narrating the history of the Corleone family. It picks up right where we left it: Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has replaced his deceased father as head of the family, becoming one of the most powerful criminals in America. Soon enough, however, he will realize absolute power also means absolute solitude. Apart from his henchmen and his lawyer (Robert Duvall) he can't trust anyone (\"Keeps your friends close, but your enemies closer\"), including his own brother Fredo (John Cazale). Hell, even his wife (Diane Keaton) doesn't feel safe next to him anymore.As we witness Michael's dealings with power, corruption and murder, we're also given the chance to see what gave birth to the Corleone dynasty in the first place. We learn, through flashbacks, that a boy named Vito Andolini had to escape from his native Sicily when his father was brutally assassinated. Once at Ellis Island, his home-town was mistaken for his surname. From that day on, he would be known as Vito Corleone. Yes, it's the same Vito Corleone who made \"offers you can't refuse\" in the first movie, and this time we're shown how he slowly became a feared gangster in his younger years. It's a riveting look at yesterday's society, which doesn't differ that much from ours: power is still as easy to obtain as it is to lose forever, and no matter how sophisticated man's methods can get, violence is still the \"best\" way to achieve something under specific circumstances.Just like Part I, this impeccable, superior sequel is masterfully staged by the filmmakers, their passion for the material breaking out of every single frame. The screenplay is flawless, Coppola and Puzo seamlessly moving back and forth in time to show us the origin and fate of the most beloved cinematic family that's ever shown up on a screen.The family theme emerges off-screen as well, as the director's father, Carmine Coppola, helps Nino Rota with the superb, tragic score.But let's not forget the extraordinary actors who made each member of the Corleones memorable: Pacino steals the show with his best performance alongside Scarface's Tony Montana, while Duvall, Cazale and Talia Shire (not to mention James Caan in a priceless flashback cameo) display the same charisma they had in the previous installment. Yet there's one guy who tops all of them, the only one I haven't mentioned so far: Robert De Niro, who won his first Oscar for playing the young Vito Corleone. It's one of those rare times people don't complain about the fact that a thespian was replaced in a sequel (okay, so Marlon Brando wouldn't have looked young enough for the part, but otherwise he would have been perfect): De Niro's star-making turn has the power of not making you miss the older Don for the entire movie. It's a top notch performance based on gestures and looks rather than words (but then again, he only speaks Sicilian throughout the film), which would become De Niro's trademark and which he proved to master perfectly long before Travis Bickle, Jake La Motta and Jimmy Conway made their appearance.Before The Godfather: Part II was released, all sequels were considered B-movies. I can see why opinions changed after this film: watch it back-to-back with its predecessor and you'll feel rewarded for giving that awesome twosome part of your time.",

            "content": "At the time of its release, many claimed this to be a finer film than the original. However, the passage of time has been less kind to this than that iconic movie. Much of the problem stems from the decision to make this both the sequel and prequel to the first film at the same time. So we have the back story of Vito Corleone and the ongoing adventures of his son Michael inter-cut throughout. This adds to the films inordinate length, which would have been long enough if Michael's story alone was told, but here is stretched to almost 4 hours. Details in both stories fail to convince, the Vito back story most of all. It is scarcely believable that a well meaning outsider could so easily take over the underworld in the manner portrayed. As played by De Niro, he is a Robin Hood 'feared by the bad, loved by the good' but why he is so universally feared not plausible. He could have easily been taken out. The real Vito Corleone would have had to have been much nastier and been prepared to deal with his opponents brutally. His character is whitewashed for Hollywood consumption. And there is some cack handed attempts at humour during, for instance, the slum landlord scene. There is, of course much fine acting from all, especially in Michael's story arc. This differs from Vito's since while Vito's is very simple, Michael's is very very complex. Too complex perhap. Various well known events from the 50s merely are stuck together to form the backdrop. The Mafia involvement with pre-revolutionary Cuba; congressional hearings; plus a few subtle hints at the Kennedy assassination. The narrative is exceptionally loose and meandering. The writing is surprisingly unsubtle, with clinking plot points being underlined again and again. The female characters are under-used but make the most of their meagre parts. Talia Shire's impassioned plea to her brother sticks in the mind, but elsewhere she barely speaks a word. Diane Keen has a better role and sinks her teeth into it with gusto.The film belongs to Al Pacino who dominates this in the way that Hamlet does in Shakespeare's play. Its an accomplished performance as would be expected. There is certainly enough here to make it worth watching, but it could have been much better.",

            "content": "\u00a8Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\u00a8 Coppola's (or should I say Puzo's) The Godfather Part II is considered by many as the best sequel of all time, and some even consider it to be better than the original. In my opinion it is not as good as the first part, but there is no denying this is a great film nonetheless. Coppola did a great job with the direction once again, and has created a timeless film that movie fans go back to time after time. There are several things he did well with this film. First of all he took a completely different approach towards romanticizing the Corleone's. In the first film we were attracted to Vito for his strong family beliefs and loyalty to his friends, in this film we see how Michael completely begins to lose control of his family and friends. Michael, who I admired in the first film, has become so blind in his lust for power that he losses the strong values his father had taught him. He has grown cold, distant, and even goes as far as to hitting his wife (something Vito would never have dreamed of doing). The parallel story of young Vito and how he became a Don also works really well as it is told in flashbacks during Michael's present reign as Don. This story serves as a reminder of how distant Michael has become from what his father wanted of him. Part II is more of a nostalgic movie as we see the decline in the once strong and united Corleone family, and Nino Rota's score is a perfect example of that. The final scenes of the film only confirm this sentiment. The performance from the cast is as equally as brilliant as it was from the first, and Gordon Willis's cinematography is also equally impressive with its dark scenes that help set the mood of the film.The Godfather Part II continues where the first one left off with Michael (Al Pacino) as head of the Corleone family and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) as his personal adviser and lawyer. They are living in Nevada now and running the gambling business in that state during the late 50's. While we follow the present storyline, Coppola introduces a series of flashbacks beginning all the way back in 1901 following the early life of Vito (Oreste Baldini) in Sicily. Vito's father, brother, and mother (in that specific order) have been killed by Don Ciccio (Giuseppe Sillato), but Vito is able to escape to New York. The film later jumps forward to 1917 where Vito (Robert De Niro) is making a living working as a clerk for a small store in New York. The movie jumps back and forth between both stories. On the one hand you have Michael trying to expand his empire traveling to Miami and Cuba, meeting with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), a successful Jewish businessman, who Michael isn't sure he can trust. On the meantime he has problems back home with his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), problems with Nevada Senator Pat Geary (G. D. Spradlin), and problems in New York with Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), Clemenza's replacement and friend of the family. After an attack on his life Michael isn't sure who is after him (or maybe he is and we don't know it). On the other hand, the other story continues to follow young Vito as he meets Clemenza (Bruno Kirby) and Tessio (John Aprea) and begins his imminent rise to becoming the Don.Marlon Brando was a huge part of the success of the first film, but Coppola, along with Puzo, did a great job introducing new characters to the story that contributed to the success of the sequel. Michael V. Gazzo as Frankie and Lee Strasberg as Roth were great in this film and gave it a fresh new look. Another contributing factor was the addition of the flashbacks because Robert de Niro was the right man to play young Vito. His Oscar winning performance was outstanding and he just stood out in every scene he was in. Al Pacino continued with his transformation in the first film, and now he portrayed a much darker and colder Michael. He didn't have to say anything and we already knew what he was feeling. There are several memorable scenes in which he speaks louder with his facial expressions than he does with his words. The opening scene in Nevada where the family is reunited celebrating Michael's son's First Communion is reminiscent of Connie's wedding scene in the first Godfather, and the same thing can be said of several other scenes as the final one. The sequel serves as a nostalgic memory of what the Corleone's once were (or at least what Coppola wanted us to think of them in the first romantic movie), it is much darker, but it still works and compliments the first part really well. The Godfather Part II is not better than the original, but it is still a masterpiece.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "The sequel to \"The Godfather,\" at times, was just as impressive, and sometimes even more impressive than the original. Overall, though the film struggles with it's flashbacks to an early New York as we watch a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), rise to power. \"The Godfather II,\" wants to be both a prequel and sequel at the same time. When we're in the present time watching Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) fight off Senators that are trying to squeeze him, or when we're watching his house get shot up on an assassination attempt that involved someone very close to the family we always find our self in amazement. When we jump back in time, you get a feeling of intrusion. The script is to blame because its too bloated, and wants to accomplish so much in it's near three hour run time. When we're in the early 1920s we see things that are entertaining and gratifying, but ultimately not even close to being on par with the present day status of the Corleone family. Its good to know and see how the godfather started out, but there's too much to say and not enough time to say it. The bloated section of the film becomes underwritten. We don't really learn anything about Vito Corleone that we didn't already know. We don't really see how he gains his power. He kills \"The Black Hand,\" and one day, through rumors, he becomes the Don of the city. Just like that. Just like that? Really? Then we come back and he's all of a sudden in the Olive Oil business. We don't know how he got there or anything, he's just there. De Niro gives it his best, but he's just not working with anything to give any kind of performance that's remotely on the same level as Brando did in the previous film. I found it painful to watch De Niro try to imitate Brando. When we see the city, it does have a good look to it, and its convincing as the set and costumes designs, along with the art direction, are very good. We never see big wide shots of the city block. We see a lot of people and grocery stores go by the quickly moving camera. Coppola does an excellent job of not pulling back too far (Probably didn't have the budget to make a huge set of the city), but we get a claustrophobic sensation. The kind of claustrophobic sensation where a guy right next door, in the next building, is close enough to stick his head out the window, call for you, and hand you a sack full of guns. Coppola encapsulates the city, and the time very well. There are some great moments in the flashbacks, but I could have lived without it entirely, and probably would have watched a much better film (Possibly better than the original). When Michael finds that his own brother, Fredo (John Cazel), knew about the assassination attempt on his life, and that he was involved and that he never told Michael about his connection with Hymen Roth and Johnny Ola, it infuriates Michael to the point of no return. He feels as though he loses his family. When he confronts Fredo, he doesn't say much; he's sick of him; Fredo's too stupid to have around, and he can't even look at him. Coppola' direction here is magnificent. Even though its dark and you can't see the reactions of both of the men, they're both in the picture with the light shinning through the windows creating silhouettes of the men that were, and we see their body language, and the body language tells us everything we need to know.Cazel gives a great performance throughout the entire film, and we wish we got to see more from his character. He's so good in this one scene that it stands as one of the best scenes in film history, and a huge part of that is due to him. The words that come out of his mouth are on par with Marlon Brando' speech in, \"On the Waterfront.\" All this frustration, years of it, just boil over to point of pity. He's pleading with his brother. We watch him spill his guts on the table, and admit that he's well aware of being stupid and feeding into that stereotype as he watches his younger brother give him orders we feel his pain and frustration for not living up to the coldness and callousness of his family. He feels like an outsider, a coward, and a loser. All the while, Michael sits in front of the window looking at the boathouse. He doesn't care what Fredo has to say, which makes it all that more painful to watch for the both of them. Michael wants information from him, and that's it. One feels like an outsider, and one is an outsider. Neither of them fit in this lifestyle, but it ruins both of their lives. Fredo wants respect and power. Michael has the power, but no respect, and finds out that he loses everything that he ever cared about: his family. Its one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history.",

            "content": "Marlon Brando plays no part in this sequel to 'The Godfather', but Al Pacino is still on hand, playing his son, and Robert de Nero joins the cast playing the Godfather's younger self. The two films together can thus be seen as representing the passing of a torch from the best actor of one generation to two of the best of the next. And it's amazing to see how fully the two youngsters come to inhabit their roles, and how fresh their portrayals are. The chronology of the story means they share no screen time; but when they eventually did come together on celluloid, over twenty years later in Michael Mann's 'Heat', they appeared as clapped-out, over-acting, stereotypes of themselves - whereas here they simply play their parts, to perfection. Pacino especially is good (while de Nero attempts to impersonate Brando); while among the supporting cast John Cazale (who also co-starred with Pacino in 'Dog Day Afternoon') is also exceptional . The film shares other virtues with its predecessor: a stately pace, but masterful directing ensuring that the film never bores; and a great, haunting score. However, I don't quite find this film the equal of its predecessor: it lacks a bit of focus in comparison. The two stories (of the Godfather's early years, and his son's later ones), do not fit seamlessly and the second, major story is too political, lacking the visceral impact of the story told in 'The Godfather Part One'; while the other story is simpler, but almost not political enough. A third story, maybe more interesting (how the Corleones got rich, presumably under prohibition) is not covered at all. In summary, for all the plaudits given to this film, I don't feel it adds that much to its predecessor; but it's still a film of the highest quality, and another reminder (if needed) of quite how good an actor the young Pacino was.",

When it comes to Part 2 i do not think that its story and storytelling is as tight as in Part 1, because there are some subplots involving Michael's life which i do not really find that interesting or involving. But when it comes to Vito's part, its a movie to behold.Overall, \"The Godfather Part II\" is a great movie - no surprises here. I do prefer first one over part 2 way more - sometimes less is better.

When the camera follows DeNiro as he moves from rooftop to rooftop, falling into the abyss filled with crime and corrpution, it will affect him and his family forever. DeNiro is slick and smooth as the young Vito Corleone. The rise of Michael Corleone's power is superbly captured by Coppola and delivered with cold hearted villainy by Al Pacino, in his finest performance. Strasberg is also solid in his performance of Hyman Roth. It's nice to see him put that \"method\" to work. The only one who feels out of it here is Duvall who seems to be simply going through motions. It may have been that Tom's character is also given limited depth within the script. It is a superb sequel, argued by many to be superior to the original.",

So take this review with a grain of salt: I'm an outsider, definitely.I kinda liked the first Godfather, while not considering it as great cinema I found it engaging, well put together, with strong moments, all in all a good movie. Not so here. To me this was excruciatingly boring.I actually liked the overture scenes very much. Then we leave Italy for the USA, and after 40 minutes I was still waiting for something to vaguely interest me. These endless contrived stories about the Italian Mafia (mob) have become such a clich\u00e9 in movies that it's impossible for me to attend all this convoluted, ultra-codified stuff without getting successively amused, then annoyed, then plain bored. So when the cinematic and staging aspects are great, like in SCARFACE or ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, I just take that stuff for what it is, a genre film bound by rules, and enjoy it from the great acting, direction and purely cinematic elements (in De Palma's case -Scarface- the fabulous camera eye, in Leone's case -Once upon a time- the mindblowing psychological staging and the terrific cinematography).Here the staging is mostly sloppy, long parts of the movie feels like it's been produced too fast, with poor cinematography and loose acting, some others are just as good as in the first movie but they're too scarce.Pretty average, exploitative, complacent stuff for me. Sorry, I've seen so many movies that I need much more than that to be impressed. As far as classics goes, I'd rather watch \"12 angry men\" or \"Le Proc\u00e8s\" for the 30rd time than another of these clich\u00e9-ridden mob movies.",

            "content": "Of all the wonderful things that can be said about Francis Ford Coppola's American masterpiece The Godfather (1972), above all else the film is a masterclass in storytelling. It's essentially a classic, romantic story of family, loyalty and the passage of time, undercut with a dark, violent portrayal of what it takes to achieve the American dream. It told a detailed, complex, and often confusing story featuring a large ensemble of characters, but this only matched the complexity of what Coppola was trying to achieve. The director, adapting Mario Puzo's novel, famously had a torrid time at the hands of the producers, namely Robert Evans. Yet when the resulting three-hour epic became a box-office and award-season smash, Coppola would be given free reign if he was to helm a follow- up.The resulting three hour twenty minute sequel was the director grabbing his chance to have complete control and pouring all of his artistry into it. This wasn't to be another classical Hollywood tale, but one of corruption, greed and pure evil. I first saw The Godfather Part II around 20 years ago at the age of 12 when I was first allowed to start watching movies for grown-ups. Watching it now, having seen it a handful of times in between, it's a completely different movie to the one I remember. I remembered it as an ambitious gangster movie with quite shocking violence, chocked full of great performances by actors who are now giants in their field. What I see now is a sequel truly like no other. A movie that is somehow optimistic and pessimistic in equal measures; one that sees its lead lose his soul while his father gains his; and quite possibly one of the saddest movies ever made.At first, Part II mirrors the narrative of its predecessor, beginning with a grand wedding as the Don (now Al Pacino's Michael Corleone) makes his underlings sweat as they wait to greet the head of the 'family'. While the previous wedding was a joyous, boisterous occasion, this one is noticeably different. Of the family that remains - John Cazale's weak-willed Fredo; Talia Shire's gold- digging Connie - only the mother seems to be the same. The band doesn't even know any Italian songs. While Michael may have attempted to continue his father's legacy when he took over, the changing, capitalist world has driven him inward, isolating himself from everybody around him and drifting away from the Sicilian values of his father. He was once a proud war veteran with a bright future, but now he is solemn and aggressive, and becomes even more so when a hit on his home almost kills him and his wife Kay (Diane Keaton).His close brush with death only fuels his paranoia, and he must navigate perilous waters as he moves into business in Cuba with one his father's business associates Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who also happens to be backing a couple of brothers moving into Corleone capo Frankie Pentangeli's (Michael V. Gazzo) territory. Michael suspects a betrayer within his own ranks, suspecting everyone including his own family. It almost seems like a deliberately confusing plot to take in alongside Michael's descent into pure evil, and it may all be too overwhelming had Coppola not chosen to juxtapose this story with one of optimism and nostalgia; that of the young Vito Corleone's escape from a mafia boss in Sicily and his eventual arrival in America. There is infinitely more colour and hope in these moments, and while these scenes may gloss over Vito's own violent journey, it seems like Coppola is making a point about where he feels his country was heading. Of course, these flashbacks are made even more welcome by the astonishing performance from a young Robert De Niro.The Godfather Part II currently sits in between The Godfather and The Dark Knight as #3 on IMDb's Top 250 list, and while I have little faith in the accuracy of a list that relies so heavily on popularity, it must be one of the most difficult and uncompromising movies in there. I'm actually pleasantly surprised that so many people love it, given the lack of flashy moments of violence the genre is so popular for. It's an experiment that could have gone so horribly wrong, and one that certainly wouldn't have been made outside of the innovative 1970s. Yet Coppola gets everything spectacularly right, from the inspirational casting of the Oscar- nominated Gazzo and Strasberg, to the chilling penultimate scene which sees James Caan's Sonny briefly return. In that final moment we realise that Michael has always been alone, destined to carve his own path, while forever gazing into the past to ponder what could have been.",

(Personal Note)I don't really think a 3rd Godfather film was necessary,you didn't need to see Michael physically die,he was dead mentally by the end of II.A Very Very High 10/10",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II (1974) is one of the best sequel's out there! Following the story right from the first film! I love this film as much a is love the first one. Drawing on strong performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken.Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The Godfather, parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.The Godfather Part II presents two parallel story lines. One involves Mafia chief Michael Corleone in 1958/1959 after the events of the first movie; the other is a series of flashbacks following his father, Vito Corleone from 1917 to 1925, from his youth in Sicily (1901) to the founding of the Corleone family in New York. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone did do a strong lead and a wonderful perfect job he acted in this film superb and strong. Robert De Niro as young Vito Corleone did a brilliant performance I have ever saw. He played an Italian immigrate superb and brilliant, there isn't any connection that he is American at all, his ascent is gone. It is like he was born an Italian by birth.I love this film Because you get both sides of the story, because you're able to see where De Niro's coming from, just seeing those guys in the movie. Again, I think there's something that, when a sequel can hit it right, to keep pushing, instead of, \"Let's capitalize on what we did the first time.\" And for me, maybe one the first movies where I felt like, \"Ooh, we're getting a backstory.\" That, to me, was really thrilling. And just to see those guys, that young and hungry. That's it, that is the right thing there. Coppola is at the top of his form in both films.Simply as a story, the Michael scenes in \"The Godfather: Part II\" engage our emotions. I admire the way Coppola and his co-writer Mario Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he handles delicate decisions involving Hyman Roth (Strasberg), the boss of Miami; Fredo (Cazale), his older brother, and the shooting of Sonny (James Caan). Who has done what? Why? Michael floats various narratives past various principals, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess; he has to envision the moves without seeing them.But finally it is all about Michael. Even the attack on the night of his son's first communion party is on his bedroom, not our bedroom. His wife, Kay (Keaton), leaves him, and his focus does not waver: He will keep his son. Tom Hagen (Duvall), the most trusted confidant of father and son, considered a brother, is finally even suspected. In Michael's life, paranoia is a useful defense mechanism.Coppola shows Michael breaking down under the pressure. We remember that he was once a proud war hero, a successful college student, building a legitimate lifestyle. But on their wedding day, Kay first began to fully realize what an all-controlling cocoon the Corleone clan was. There would always be things she could not be told about, could not be trusted with. Finally Michael has no one to tell or trust except his elderly mother (Morgana King). Michael's desperation in that intense conversation explains everything about the film's final shot.The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba The Godfather Part II is a 1974 American epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo, starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Partially based on Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather, the film is both sequel and prequel to The Godfather, presenting parallel crime dramas.The most memorable best epic Francis Ford Coppola's classic masterpiece sequel ever, the film stunned everything for brilliance to superb acting.

As a matter of fact \"The Godfather: Part II\" even ranks above the sublime \"The Godfather\", which got made 2 years earlier, starring mostly the same cast.The movie connects nicely with the first movie and decides to start off were the first movie had finished. Michael is the new Don now and he continues his father work by leading a crime syndicate based in New York. Besides the usual struggles with other the other families and other characters who are looking for opportunities to gain more power and control, Michael also needs to handle his personal life with his wife and his other family members, who aren't all on the same line.But \"The Godfather: Part II\" is not just a movie that continues what the first movie had started. It also adds a story-line of the young Vito Corleone, played in the first movie by Marlon Brando. In this movie he is being portrayed by Robert De Niro, who wasn't really a big star yet at the time. It's amazing how these two different story-lines, set at completely different time periods and also in essence have really nothing to do with each other, blend in so perfectly. The historical settings of the New York of the early 20th century are also truly impressive.It's a movie that got practically made by the same cast and crew as the first successful movie. Of course there also are some new addition to the cast this time, in which the earlier mentioned Robert De Niro and Lee Strasberg impress the most. Both also received an Oscar nomination in the category for best supporting actor, along with Michael V. Gazzo but it was Robert De Niro who would eventually take the statue back home. What also makes this movie an even better one than its predecessor is the fact that this movie is filled with some classic moments of cinema. It contains some of the best known sequences and phrases. It also contains some great constructed and build-up sequences, for which the credit really needs to go to Francis Ford Coppola. Also the characters are more developed and expanded in this movie. A true accomplishment for a movie with so many characters in it but then again the movie has also more than 3 hours to tell its story.A sequel that even surpasses its brilliant predecessor.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Eventually I came to the conclusion that \"the godfather part two\" is amazing for its story: both story arcs of Michael Corleone and Vito Corleone are fantastic, challenging and beautiful. Robert DeNiro is an amazing actor, one of his best roles, Al Pacino = revolutionary. The character of Hyman Roth is smart and well written. The score composed by Nino Rota is perfectly balanced with the tone of the movie, the cinematography of Gordon Willis nailes it again. A lot of great shots and camera movements. The most emotional part of the film is the scene Michael is at the \"top\", the most powerful Don of all but alone without family and friends. The flashback of the family at the table waiting for Vito to return and then Michael is left all alone shows what he has become and how far he went to \"protect\" the family until there is no more family left to be with him. The shot of him sitting alone closess the movie and ends his arc for now.",

            "content": "Wow. This thing is almost three and a half hours long and yet it is not boring for a second. Not one moment. From the very first scenes up until the tragic and forlorn ending, this film seizes hold of the viewer's consciousness and does not ever loosen its grip, even when the credits roll. I walked away from the movie with what felt like a deep resonance inside me. It is at once heart-wrenchingly sad and stunningly beautiful.Thematically, it actually shares much in common with later films such as American Beauty and Fight Club. The Godfather Part 2 is the story of a man who seems to have it all - but the only things he ends up not having are the only things that truly matter to him. Michael's character arc continues on from the first film, creating a great, epic tragedy and what I think is one of the saddest and yet most majestic endings in film.I haven't even talked about the more technical aspects yet. This is because I don't have to - everything is perfect. Not just great, but perfect, as in there seems to be no way that they could be improved on. Acting, direction, cinematography, script and story. Everything.The one thing, though, that clinches it for me is that the plot doesn't really matter. This is a movie about themes and ideas. The plot is quite thick, so don't worry if you don't get it - you don't have to. As long as you understand what the film is really about... you will walk away knowing that you have witnessed something almost life-changing.",

            "content": "Six weeks ago was The Godfather in a theatre setting. This time it was the sequel, which generated an equal amount of movie bliss. Experiencing these two classic movies on the big screen almost 40 years after release reinforces what great films they are \u0085 and how few truly great films get made. We are reminded that a powerful well-written story, world class cast, visionary director, brilliant photographer and stunning composer are all necessary components for movie greatness.This sequel explores three time periods: the journey of 9 year old Vito to the U.S., his rise to power in Little Italy, and Corleone life after Vito's death. Some find the cuts to varying timelines to be distracting. Personally, I find it fascinating and a very effective way to tell the entire story. Watching an almost mute 9 year old Vito land on Ellis Island and transform into a twenty-something community \"leader\" is one of the more powerful and unlikely events ever seen on screen. Mix that with Al Pacino holding little back as a power-mongering Michael is downright frightening. If you doubt this, look at it from the perspective of Diane Keaton's May, or John Cazale's Fredo.The film received 11 Oscar nominations and won 6, including Best Picture. Robert DeNiro won for his tremendous turn as young Vito. This is early DeNiro \u0085 the Mean Streets, Taxi Driver era. DeNiro and Marlon Brando remain the only two actors to have won Oscars for playing the same character. Two other acting nominations went to Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V Gazzo as Pentangeli. Mr. Strasberg was the famed acting teacher whose prized pupils included none other than Al Pacino (who talked him into taking this role). Strasberg was also bequeathed 75% of the Marilyn Monroe estate and there was much scandal after his death when his widow auctioned off most of it.A couple of other interesting points were that most of this script was original for the film, though the background story of Vito was drawn from Mario Puzo's novel. Director Francis Ford Coppola considered casting Joe Pesci as the young Clemenza, but ultimately decided on Bruno Kirby. Dominic Chianese plays Hyman Roth's right hand man Johnny Ola. Chianese has been recently seen in both The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire. B-Movie mogul Roger Corman plays one of the Senators on the committee interrogating Michael and Pentangeli. Harry Dean Stanton plays one of the FBI bodyguards, and former heartthrob Troy Donahue plays Connie's (Talia Shire) goofy boyfriend Merle. One of my favorite characters in the film is Don Fanucci, robustly played by Gastone Moschin. His strutting and preening always creeps me out and makes me laugh.Besides being the first sequel to win a Best Picture Oscar, The Godfather II is simply one of the finest films ever made. At 200 minutes, it requires both a time and mental commitment, but along with The Godfather, Coppola and Puzo have provided us exemplary story telling through expert filmmaking.",

I am thankful to have just viewed the Coppola 2007 restoration of this film.At well over 3 hours, it is longer than the original. What is does is deftly fill in 2 stories that we saw small parts of in the first film. We find out how the Don, Vito Cordleone got his name, what his real name is, and the history that made him who he was in the first film.The second story fills in more about his kids, particularly Michael, and how he took over in the late 1950's and his battles with one of his dads enemies. The back drop moves from Nevada to Sicily, and then to Havana. Michael faces down a series of folks including a Congressional Hearing about his life.While this has no Brando, it has an excellent cast from the first film with some additional folks added. James Caan makes a brief cameo at the end of the movie. Talia Shire & Diane Keaton head up to female cast though these films seems to have a cast of 100's because there are so many parties & events.The film keeps with the same strength as the first film, strong storytelling which brings you in and peeks your interest enough to keep you going.

The all important a$pect$ of continuing a story from one hit movie i$, wa$ and always$ will be that of Box Office and Profit$; also known as the 'Bottom Line\". This is all understandable, for after all, making movies is a business.HENCE, we generally treated to a parade of inferior stories, watered down story lines and lame ideas that get to the screen only because of perceived relationship to a real, true hit. The roster of examples are loaded with the likes of: SON OF KONG, FRENCH CONNECTION II, McHALE'S NAVY JOINS THE AIR FORCE, RTEURN TO PEYTON PLACE, BACK TO THE FUTURE II, III, IV etc., CITY SLICKERS II, ANALYZE THAT, BELLES ON THEIR TOES, HOUSE OF Dracula and all of those Friday THE 13th & HALLOWEEN spin-offs.ON AN occasional a rarity occurs. A sequel picture comes along which is not only on par with the original, but in some cases actually tops the original. Titles such as BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, FOR THE LOVE OF BENJI and SUPERMAN II come to mind as prime examples. There are others out there; but for the sake of brevity, we'll hold down the roll call.ARGUABLY the greatest example of a sequel that surpasses its progenitor is Francis Ford Coppola's production of MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER: PART II; which just happens to be today's subject for dissection and analysis.PERHAPS the success of the original GODFATHER paved the way for such an unexpected surprise and hit. Critically and at the Box Office, GODFATHER II is considered to be an even greater achievement of film making. The reason probably lies in a maturity and coming of age by Director Coppola .IN LATER interviews, as well in his commentary that is included on the latest DVD set, Mr. Coppola speaks of the interference and attempted control of his artistic view of the picture was an almost daily bone of contention; especially during the early days of production. There was a great deal of meddling from the 'Suits' from the board room of Paramount Pictures; even extending to rumors that the big company wanted to replace the Director.LUCKILY for F.F.C. and the rest of us, he managed to survive long enough to get the picture over the hump and into the final editing room. The resulting product came out of the film editors' shop as quite a sensational film; being one that would go down as, arguably, the best gangster film of all time. Surely it could not be eclipsed! THIS UNPRECEDENTED and unexpected success earned Francis Ford Coppola his spurs as a full fledged Hollywood Director. His name would from that point on be mentioned in the same breath as Capra, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles, Huston, Spielberg and Scorsase.FOLLOWING such prestigious accolades, the Director now enjoyed full artistic control over his projects. Mr. Coppola was able to pull out all stops and do the picture he wanted in his own way. From this point on, the office gang at Paramount Corporate Headquarters could go and pound sand. The corporate monkey of the 'bottom line' was off his back, for good.SUCH freedom allowed for the drafting of a fine, complex story not only to serve as a sequel, but at the same time it was functioning as a prequel; which is a term that wouldn't come into usage for some years yet. The mounting of having both the story of Michael Corleone's ascension to the heights of the Underworld, as well as the wonderful and lengthy flashbacks into the early life of Don Vito Corleone, was truly a work of genius. By using this dramatic device, the screen play, a collaboration done by both Mr. Puzo and Mr. Coppola gave us a chance to compare the life and times of two generations of the Family and our Nation as well.WE do know that the working title of the project was announced as THE GODSON and some considerable amount of surgery had to be performed on the screen play; for the character of Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) was a late addition to the starting line-up; as the story had Peter Clemenca (Richard Castellano) in the role of the discontented Cappo of the Corleone Family.BUT Mr. Castellano proved to be unavailable; due to his insistence that his own writer would be the one to pen any and all of the character's dialogue. Refusing to give in to such demands, Coppola and Puzo wrote the Clemenca character out of the story; due to an unusual case of natural death; replacing him with this Pentangelli guy, who had been previously unmentioned.* WITHIN a short time of its release, GODFATHER II was hailed as a critical acclaim magnet; as well as being touted for its keeping high standards established in the first GODFATHER effort.AND just for good measure, Coppola and the boys at Paramount had them a real good pitcher and hot item at the all important Box Office. (Just funnin' around with them improper used words & grammar, right Schultz?) OVERALL and with all factors considered, in order to be fair, we'd have to rate this film with a 10+ rasting. So, we will.NOTE: * As further evidence, note all of the similarities in the two characters; what with his position, his henchman Willie Cicci (Joe Spinnell) and his keen interest & references to History.POODLE SCHNITZ!!",

This phrase has been used so often in reference to \"The Godfather: Part II\" \u0096 the exception that makes the rule. What is even more laudable is the fact that the original is generally considered as a landmark in the history of film.This is one film that proves cinema to be a form of art, and not merely one of entertainment. A skilful direction from Francis Ford Coppola, outstanding performances from the likes of Pacino, De Niro, Gazzo, Strasberg, Cazale, Duvall, Keaton, Shire, memorable cinematography from Willis, a soundtrack by Rota, Coppola and Curet Alonso, and an ingenious script by Coppola and Puzo (partly adapted from his novel), make \"The Godfather: Part II\" stand out as a story of courage, love, treachery, and devotion, crafted in the life of the Corleone saga.The plot follows the consolidation of power of Michael Corleone, and his desire to gain the legality of his business, and the consolidation of power of a young Vito Corleone, and his desire to build a better life for his family. The old story of the father handing his wealth to his sons, gains a new twist by allowing a positive outcome to the original story. The wealth remains in the family, but there are losses to be incurred. An ontological thesis of Pareto optimality into the organisation of social structures is subtly brought into the view, without harming the general development of the story.\"The Godfather: Part II\" remains also as a text book for any actor. Al Pacino shows that temperance can be dramatic, making us empathise with his character even when made to realise the most brutal of actions.  Robert De Niro is purely outstanding, in one of the best supporting performances the screen has witnessed. His charm, charisma, and vocal skills, help him achieve a complete transition to Puzo's Vito Corleone. The viewer is unarmed in the choice given between murder and love, between life and necessity. Talia Shire stands out as the lost woman in a world dominated by men.Even if \"The Godfather\" is the point of reference when it comes to great cinema, \"The Godfather: Part II\" remains a powerful example which proves that there is always more to say in a story, and the additions can be more than surprising.",

There is more violence here than in the first Godfather and several scenes, like the original, feature real life events. I personally like the first one better probably because of Brando but I will watch both without reservation. Pacino shines here as brightly as in the first one and DeNiro gives it some much needed weight to replace or more accurately continue Brando's character. It is also much sadder than the first in my opinion and shows the misery and depravity of young Vito's life and why he was what he was. It is a true masterpiece.",

            "content": "As a huge fan of the original Godfather, I have never understood all the hoopla about this film. A great continuation of the story? The only sequel to be better than the original? No way, on both counts - not by a long shot.First of all, The Godfather is a movie that truly needs no sequel. When that door closes on Kay at the end, that's it - an entire cycle has played out: power has been passed on, the new guard has superseded the old, evil has corrupted goodness and the sins of the father have come back to feast upon the sons. It is a perfect story, complete in itself and suggestive of all that is to come. Anything you could add would only be elaboration, nothing genuinely new.  As such, there's nothing - not one single thing - which happens in The Godfather Part II that is not either already implied in the first movie or at least could be predicted by knowing the first movie. Therefore, the story just doesn't feel fresh; it feels more like a \"standard\" sequel - that is, one done just for the money, to capitalize on the series while it was hot. (The true greatest sequel of all time, of course, is The Empire Strikes Back - superceding the original in so many ways and on so many levels it's unbelievable.)Now, I'll concede there's an awful lot of artistry on display in this movie - the acting is all great, the cinematography and production design, etc. It certainly doesn't have the *look* of a quickie re-hash. And you can tell that considerable time and effort has gone into the story and in the structuring of the movie. Which makes its failure all the more troubling to watch. First of all, the cross-cutting between the two time periods (Vito Corleone in the early part of the century and Michael in the late '50s) just DOES NOT WORK.  I'll challenge anybody on this point; if you think it's a good idea, you're just WRONG! I can half see what Coppola had in mind here, but it's just annoying. First off, the two sequences are not equally weighted - we see far more of the \"modern day\" Michael segment - and so the Vito scenes come to feel more like an intrusion, a break up of the momentum of the real movie, rather than as a legitimate sequence in its own right. And frankly, it's not a legitimate sequence anyway - it's far too bathed in quaintness and romanticism, it never truly takes Vito to task for the life he has chosen; in fact, it doesn't even give us a good sense of why he has chosen that life. Except for the brief murder scenes, it mostly portrays Vito as a hero - a Robin Hood of the people - and does not give a clear picture of the ruthlessness and cold-bloodedness he would have needed to build up his empire. (For a good portrait of this side of the young Vito, read the chapter in the original Godfather book by Mario Puzo which focuses upon his rise to power. Compare this sequence to the movie's in order to see just how much Coppola has omitted and how much he has romanticized what he's kept.)  Coppola wants to save all his rage and condemnation for Michael, you see - almost as if the Corleone crime family was kind of a Mom and Pop store started by the old man in the good old days, and was great and wonderful until the young whippersnapper came in with all of his newfangled ways and started screwing everything up. If Michael's soul is shown as corroded by the end of the movie, why is Vito not assessed in the same harsh way? After all, if not for him, his son would never have been put in this position in the first place. Curiously, Michael's attempts to \"go legitimate\" are portrayed as the real horror here, which is certainly an interesting idea, but I think this is a theme much better developed in The Godfather Part III, where the agent of legitimacy becomes the Church (the Vatican), making for a much richer and headier mix. Here, Michael's mainly trying to buy into resorts and casinos in Cuba. How interesting is that?Finally, this picture moves sooooo slowly and takes so much time to tell its story (er, stories) that it becomes sleep-inducing. Not enough of import happens here for the story to take as long as it does. In short, The Godfather Part II is a film with an inflated sense of its own importance; the wonder is that it has suckered so many millions of people into buying into it. The Godfather is a movie which truly needs no sequel, but if you feel compelled to see one, rent Part III and skip over this tired and pretentious mess.",

Coppola expertly tells the parallel stories of a father and his son with the use of flashbacks and flashforwards. He simultaneously shows how the father builds an empire and how his son subsequently unwittingly destroys it. The scenes involving the son Michael Corleone are very serious in nature,whereas the scenes involving the father,a young Vito Corleone, are presented in a more jovial manner.Before a flashback or flashforward, Coppola uses an effective technique of having children or the mention of children in the scene in order to emphasize the generational link through children. The flasback scenes are also photographed using different methods of lighting to contrast the different moods.Metaphorically, the story of the Corleones parallels the rise and subsequent corruption of America. The ultimate symbol of America in the form of the Statue of Liberty appears throughout the film. The assassination of Hyman Roth the Jewish Mafia chieftain, is eerily similar to the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald the alleged assassin of President John Kennedy. Coppola effectively uses symbols such as the orange to represent evil. Several scenes show characters that do evil holding an orange (the fruit being a biblical symbol of evil).In an early scene Johnny Ola an emissary for Hyman Roth brings an orange to Michael Corleone from Miami. In a flashback scene, Don Fannucci (the black hand), is seen handling an orange before his demise. Michael Corleone is eating an orange as he plots the murder of his enemies. Coppola also uses catholic religious rituals as backdrops in major murder sequences. As Vito Corleone murders Don Fannucci there is a religious procession on the street. As Michael's brother Fredo is being murdered he is reciting the Hail Mary prayer. In the end Michael loses his soul and family to maintain his power. A great film by a talented director.",

The Corleone family tree is divided here into parallel histories, with young Vito (Robert De Niro) arriving in the New World to begin a family, and a family empire, which a generation later his bitter and lonely son Michael (Al Pacino) would consolidate, destroying in the process everything he holds dear. The sudden displays of gangland violence are no longer placed in ironic juxtaposition to the unlikely richness of Corleone family values, being used instead to measure the corruption of il padrone's immigrant idealism: murder to young Vito is strictly a matter of honor, but to Michael it's only an extension of his absolute power. The crosscutting between two stories sacrifices a consistent narrative flow in favor of complexity and depth, but it's a fair trade, and seen together with Part One (Part Two should not be seen without the introduction provided by the earlier film) is a rich experience not soon forgotten.",

            "content": "With many claiming it to be better than its predecessor. Racking up a runtime of 200 minutes, this behemoth is the longest theatrical film I've seen. For those of you who read my review on Part 1 would know that my only gripe was with pacing issues, particularly in its third act which dipped completely to a point where I became uninterested. With no Marlon Brando and a far superior runtime, does Part 2 better its predecessor? Drum roll please...The Godfather Part 2...is...the better chapter in this saga. Yes, everything that made the first so well acclaimed still exists here but with a much more detailed end result. The pacing was perfect. There was always something happening whether it be the Corleone family members just interacting with each other over family and business, or when the Don himself Michael conceptualises a thorough and genius plan to get him out of trouble. Then, in addition, Coppola brings in Robert De Niro to portray a young Vito Corleone depicting his rise to power in the mafia culture. This is interwoven brilliantly with the current story involving Michael, the two plots bounce off each other and further the rich developed characters that Coppola originally put on screen. The plenty of backstabbing as traitors lust for power and control makes for some tense and gripping moments in a bloated film. Many more exotic locations to spice up the cinematography, from sunny Havana to vintage Corleone. I appreciated the inclusion of the Italian language, Coppola could've forced the scenes to be spoken in English and yet he didn't in order to keep the authenticity of these characters. Everything I mentioned in Part 1 still remains. Coppola's direction is flawless, acting is masterful (particularly Pacino and De Niro), complex family narrative that left me compelled in every scene...I mean I could go on but there is no need to. The vast majority of reviews state everything that I'm describing here, which is why this is regarded as one of cinema's greatest films of all time.",

In the first GODFATHER, we saw Michael give up his dream of an honest life to save his family and lead it back to greatness.  Here, we see he sacrifices everything for his family, and in the end loses even that.At the same time, we see how Michael's father Vito became the great Don. Starting out by doing his family and his fellow immigrants a great favor by eliminating the brutish, terroristic Don Fannucci, Vito ends up merely replacing one tyrant with another in ANIMAL-FARM-like style.As we see Michael and Vito maneuver for power against their enemies (including Hyman Roth, excellently played by Lee Strasberg), we begin to wonder how much worse the mafiosi are than the government officials who surround them.  Their dishonesty and their violence would hardly be out of place in many \"legitimate\" governments throughout history, and in some cases even today.  As Michael tells a corrupt Senator played by G.D. Spradlin, \"we're both part of the same hypocrisy.\"(Spoilers below).The ending of THE GODFATHER: PART II is one of the most poignant in history, as Michael's memory flashes back to a party before he joined the military. The scene contains four men besides himself: Santino, Fredo, Tessio, and Carlo.  All are dead now - three of them by Michael's own order.  As Tessio mentions that thousands of young men are enlisting to fight the Japanese after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Santino comments, \"They're saps, because they risk their lives for strangers.\"  Now Michael, having risked his life for his family for years, finds they are strangers to him who fear and loathe him.  The third part notwithstanding, the tragedy is complete.Rating: **** out of ****.",

How much pressure Coppola must have felt when embarking on this after the huge success and instant classic that \"The Godfather\" (1972) had become. In spite, he must have kept calm in perfecting the work of Part II.The film centres partly on Michael's descent into the downward spiral of the crime world, as well as the history of his late father, Vito Andolini, beautifully portrayed in the original by the screen legend above them all, Marlon Brando.In part II, Vito's life is presented from when he was a young boy in Sicily, and how the tragic events of his childhood shapes him as a person. We also follow him as a growing adult, portrayed by Robert De Niro, who gives a stunning performance, for which he deservedly won the Academy Award for best supporting actor. In this period piece part of the film, we see some intriguing character development which contributes to sophisticated storytelling, while simultaneously paying homage to Part I.The character studies of Part II really is what drives the saga's perfection further. Along with a budget twice as large as in Part I, this highly ambitious effort was possible for Coppola to execute to perfection with beautiful shifting set designs and huge staging of the milieus. Naturally, it draws on the same perfect storytelling, direction, cinematography, score and all else that Part I is revered for. But it adds further, with even more intrigue and suspense than what we where exposed to in Part I.A perfect film, and a deeply convincing character study of a man, who has it all but love, and who falls apart from his desires to power and money. Almost on par with Part I, and although some even think this surpasses its perfection, the original remains my favourite film.",

The Godfather films (I presume we may ignore the third) are now a quarter of a century old, and if you haven't seen them, chances are that two snippets of information will leap into your mind when you think of them: they are about the Mafia, and the sequel is as good as the original.  This latter line has been repeated so many times, always with the same air of surprise, that it has entered popular mythology.  It is my sad duty to report that it's not true.\"The Godfather\" was a story about the corruption of a soul.  It was a good such story, since the person who suffered such corruption did so from the noblest of motives, or at any rate from motives it would have been hard to question.  But, of course, once the process of corruption is complete, the story's over.  \"The Godfather Part II\" is afflicted with the same blight that afflicts most of the other sequels we dislike.  It's just more of the same doodling at the end of the script, prompted by a desire to know what happens next after the point has been reached where we don't need to know - and, worse, it childishly gives in to the impulse to tell the same story AGAIN rather than think of a new one.

            "content": "Given complete control over the directorial proceedings by Paramount, and a much larger budget to boot, you would be forgiven to think Francis Ford Coppola had it good when, two years after the release of The Godfather, the studio convinced him to direct The Godfather: Part II. Despite this free reign, Coppola still faced challenges \u0096 most important being the daunting task of matching the first picture, creatively and financially. There are many critics who regard the second part of the Corleone saga as not only equal, but superior than the first, and while I don't think Part II is as \"classic\" as it's original, I can concede without hesitation that this is the more ambitious and grand in scope, and certainly more powerful as an exercise in tragedy.The Godfather: Part II continues the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), established in the end of part one as the new Don of the Corleone crime family, who has moved all their interests out to Nevada. Michael looks to expand his empire and invest in businesses in Havana and Miami, where Hyman Roth (one of his father's aging ex-partners) resides. When betrayal comes from where he least expects, Michael must make decisions and sacrifices, however difficult, to save his family, and in doing so will perpetually change who he is as a person. Throughout Michael's ordeal, Coppola flashes back to the turn of the century, where a young Vito Corleone (then Vito Andolini) must flee Sicily when he becomes hunted by the local Mafioso at the age of only nine. As an immigrant, we are shown the rise of Vito (Robert De Niro from young adulthood onwards) as a man of respect, loyalty, enormous generosity and ever growing authority on the streets of New York.Coppola must be given due for the transitions between the two parallel story lines, which are absolutely seamless. They come at natural breaks so as to not take away from the pacing of either narrative, and the episodic approach to covering thirty-odd years in the young Vito storyline is perfect for keeping the audience on the edge of their seats for the developments in the Michael story. With the interconnectedness of the narrative, Coppola encourages a contrast of the way Michael and Vito take control of their respective families \u0096 what decisions they make, what they value \u0096 and this helps to further punctuate and underline the film's harrowing final scenes.In keeping with the tone of the first picture, Part II sees the return of Gordon Willis' dark, under lit photography, and Nino Rota's memorable, distinctive score (largely utilising the same cues as the first, with the addition of a few new themes including the magnificent \"The Immigrant\"). The acting across the board is quality \u0096 just as it was in the original. John Cazale has a larger role here as Fredo, whose outburst at being stepped over as the family Don is as forceful and potent as any in his regrettably short career. Newcomers to the picture give excellent supporting turns, Michael Gazzo as caporegime Frank Pentangeli and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone, preserving Brando's famous gesture and manner, but it's Al Pacino's picture through and through \u0096 his Michael is so intense, but yet is an empty shadow of his former self. By the end of the picture, Pacino's beady black eyes are cold: completely stripped of life, and reflect upon the tragedy of the loss of the family he committed all his power to trying to protect. It's a haunting, powerful, parting frame that lasts.",

            "content": "The Godfather: Part II is not a sequel in the traditional Hollywood sense, rather a companion piece to one of the greatest films ever made in The Godfather. Here, the story is epic and sprawling, as it covers Michael's reign as the new head of the Corleone family by moving the business to Nevada and at the same time flashes back to show the story of how a young Vito Corleone came to power and started the story now being continued.Francis Ford Coppola returns to his old ground with writing partner Mario Puzo to expand on Michael and establish Vito and doing so by going back and forth. This leads to some incredible shots of the young Vito and the young Michael in the same frame, a haunting image and symbol of how far this family has come. It also shows how far Coppola has come in terms of directing these films. Once again, his direction is immaculate in every sense, perfectly balancing the time between Michael and Vito, always picking the right time to go from story to story.All this aside, I haven't even mentioned the other strong points, which are basically all of them. The flawless acting continues here with Al Pacino cementing his legacy in this very subdued yet emotionally upsetting performance as Michael, the youngest who seemed ostracized from his family at the beginning and now has all the power and success and none of the love or affection his father had. Indeed, one of the main themes of the film is to show how different Michael handles things from his father and whether or not he is a better leader. Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and the tragic John Cazale all contribute so much in their roles, and Robert De Niro made his name known with a flawless performance as the young, ambitious and loyal Vito.Once again, Gordon Willis photographs and once again the darkness shrouds the characters, symbolizing the heavy-handed situations surrounding them. This adds so much to the tone and atmosphere of the story that it completely takes us up in the story and makes the 200 minute running time fly by smoothly. The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II have long been recognized as required viewing for any film lover and I cannot argue. They are so well-made and engrossing that it is impossible to not feel for these characters and the choices they make.The final two scenes are quite something to behold. The first is a flashback to see the kids waiting for Vito to surprise him on his birthday. Here, we see how Michael truly was treated and how Sonny, Tom, and Connie related to one another and how it colored the rest of their existence. The final scene is Michael, alone and contemplating everything that has happened. It is a scene for the audience to contemplate and wonder at the travesty that has abounded. And these two films are truly something to behold and admire for their sheer quality and intensity.",

            "content": "The Godfather, Part II is one of the most revered sequels of all time, if not the most. While I prefer the original for a few reasons, this sequel is not without more than its fair share of merits. However, it also has one or two flaws that, if I am going to be fair, I have to mention. Since they will take up the least amount of space in my comments, I'll get them out of the way first. The first flaw, in my opinion, is a jumping sense of focus. As the story goes from one part of America to Cuba to Sicily to another part of America, one can get a little giddy with the to and fro. The other problem is that when the screenplay doesn't follow Mario Puzo's original writings, it doesn't quite work. The big conspiracy with a Jewish smuggler and unnamed Italian rivals in the New York or Nevada underworlds doesn't quite seem to gel. Both stories, the historical story of Vito Corleone and the present-day story of Michael's decline, really needed three hours of their own. It is interesting to note that of all the deleted footage that went into the Godfather Legacy miniseries, the majority came from this film.The acting from all concerned is top-notch, especially from Al Pacino, who sells himself beautifully as the dangerous head of a mafia family in spite of needing to be on platforms to appear at the same height as many of his castmates. Robert Duvall gives a workman-like performance, but he has little to do here other than act out the part of the ever-loyal brother. I think the fact that he was almost irrelevant to the storyline here has a lot to do with Duvall's refusal to join the cast of the third film. The real surprise here is John Cazale, who fleshes out Fredo Corleone far beyond anything in either the first film or the novel. It is unsurprising that all of the films Cazale has been in have been nominated for Best Picture. He portrays the rejected brother who just wants what he feels is his fair share with an uncanny grace. But these are just the highlights. The entire cast give top-notch performances, even the extras who appear for less than ten seconds.The best thing about a Godfather film is how it builds a simple story of a family who, whether they wanted it or not, happen to be in the business of organised crime. The bloodshed of this film, much as was the case in the original, is secondary to the simple premise that these are ordinary people in an extraordinary position. Francis Ford Coppola has previously stated that he saw The Godfather as a (relatively) modern King Lear, and that style is kept up in the sequel. Michael is in essence the new King of the realm, but he learns the hard way that the more he tries to tighten his grip upon what is his, or what is loyal to him, the more it slips away. This is the film in which we learn why this is not what Vito Corleone wanted for his youngest son. Sadly, fate has a way of getting in the path of our best intentions, and nowhere is this more evident than in Diane Keaton's dialogue. Some of her speech to Al Pacino really sounds like it was either written at the last moment, or by someone who didn't have a whole lot of experience in writing films.Like the other Godfather films, the most satisfying moments are when the opponents of the Corleone family get their hash settled in a big way. The montage shown in Part II is not as graphic as that of the original, but it brings the whole thing to a satisfying climax. Lee Strasberg's speech to the press after his character being deported from Israel is priceless, as is the manner in which it ends. Unfortunately, the etiquette that dictates I cannot reveal what happens at the end of the film means I cannot tell you anything about the most satisfying death in the film. Being one of the most debated and criticised scenes among Godfather fans, I am fairly certain that anyone with an interest in the film is going to hear about it elsewhere anyway. In spite of the fact that it, and the necessary lead-up, takes up most of the second half of Michael's plot segment, it will leave many a viewer stunned. But that is one of the things that detracts slightly from this cinematic tour de force. With the screen time so sharply divided between two stories, sometimes the linking between plot points seems to fall by the wayside.I gave The Godfather, Part II a nine out of ten. In contrast to the original, I noticed the passage of time on a few occasions in its two hundred minutes. Still, if you're out to see a good drama, and you've already enjoyed the first Godfather, then this is worth a couple of viewings. If every director adaptating the writings of others into a film format took as much care as Francis Ford Coppola had here, then the world would be a better place.",

Either the person will believe the current hype and say \"The Lord Of The Rings\", they'll recount to their youth and say \"Star Wars\" or they'll answer \"The Godfather\" trilogy. Containing some truly breathtaking acting and a jaw dropping good plot, the original \"Godfather\" film was a masterpiece. Even more surprising though is just how many people seem to prefer the sequel from two years later. Once more starring Al Pacino, \"Godfather Part II\" is an awesome film which could technically also be classified as a masterpiece. Still, despite the technical genius of the film, this second episode in the story of the Corleone family is slightly inferior to it's predecessor.In continuation from the first film, Michael Corleone (Pacino) is head of the family and living in Las Vegas. Apparently enjoying life, Michael is a much darker character than he was during the previous film. With plans to expand into foreign territories, Michael once more finds himself faced with difficult decisions and former friends turned enemies.The true genius of \"The Godfather Part II\" is the combination of sequel and prequel. Rotating between the early life of Vito Corleone (played in the original by Marlon Brando, but now played by Robert De Niro) and the current affairs of his son Michael, the film manages to tell two superb stories side by side.Pacino, as with the previous film, is once again stunning as the now cold and malicious Michael. Transformed from the outsider at the beginning of Part I, Michael has become a completely different person, and Pacino shows this with skill.In \"The Godfather: Part II\" however, the true star of the picture is Robert De Niro. Taking hold of the role of a younger Marlon Brando, De Niro spends his time on screen replicating Brando's mannerisms with apparent ease. He takes a firm hold on the life of the young Godfather, and he impresses throughout.Despite it's technical genius though, this second part in the story does feel slightly inferior to the original. To a degree this is possibly due to the Michael scenes being original rather than Mario Puzo's book, but the parts of the film dealing with Michael, never really seem to take off compared with the original. In the first film, we are shown a loving family who fight for each other and who come out on tops despite heavy casualties and strong opposition. In this second film, the view on the family feels much more dark and disturbing. Gone seem to be the family values, and instead Michael's direction seems much more obscure and unfocused.It's entirely possible that this reviewer simply didn't understand this film. There's no denying that upon first viewing the original, the impression wasn't good and it took a second viewing before becoming a fan. In comparison to the Brando and Pacino led first chapter however, this second chapter doesn't really hold water. This doesn't stop it being a masterpiece, and it is. It is easily one of the finest films ever made, BUT compared with it's predecessor, it doesn't quite work.",

The character was very recognisable as a younger version of the Godfather from the first film but De Niro still managed to put his own stamp on the role. Incidentally, Pacino is one of only two actors to be nominated for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for playing the same character, the other being Barry Fitzgerald who was nominated for both awards for playing Father Fitzgibbon in \"Going My Way\". The writing and direction are once again of an extremely high quality.I've watched nine films which ran 3+ hours long so far this year and this is one of the best structured of those. There is a not a minute that drags. The two story lines are excellent and I loved the depiction of Michael's moral decay. My favourite scene in the film is the extremely powerful one where Kay tells Michael that she is leaving him and she aborted their child when she discovered that it was a boy as she did not want to perpetuate the next generation of Corleones. I think that Diane Keaton deserved a Best Actress nomination for the film. I was surprised that Talia Shire got a Best Supporting Actress one as, while she is excellent as Connie, she has such little screen time. Besides De Niro, the two strongest newcomers were Lee Strasberg - the legendary acting teacher who taught Pacino, De Niro, James Dean and Marilyn Monroe, among many others - and Michael V. Gazzo. Both of them were nominated for Best Supporting Actor but lost to De Niro. I thought that Robert Duvall deserved one too as his performance was even better than in the first film but I suppose that they needed to let other films get a look in!",

From the seedy casinos of Nevada, to the revolution in Cuba, \"The Godfather: Part II\" chronicles the reign of Michael Corleone, acted to perfection by Al Pacino, over a massive criminal empire. Corleone's dealings with the manipulative and ruthless, but ailing, Hyman Roth, depicted by the masterful Lee Strasberg, are some of the best scenes captured on cinema. Roth is a weary, weathered old man, but he more than holds his own against the young, ambitious Michael Corleone. And how does one describe the character of Michael Corleone? Is he an evil killer that cares only about power, and will do anything to achieve it? Or is he a reluctant son, trying desperately to get out from under the enormous shadow of his father, but assailed on all fronts by enemies old and new? Perhaps both. The story of Michael Corleone in this film is a tragic one, without doubt. But his is not the only tale told in this masterpiece of cinema. The story of Vito Corleone, portrayed entirely in Sicilian by Robert De Niro, is interwoven with that of his son, and it is arguably as potent. A young Sicilian lad, orphaned by a violent Mafioso, Vito is smuggled off the island and to America. There, Vito is met with oppositions and struggles, and he overcomes them all to become the original Godfather. It is truly a journey, and shows the adversity that crafted a giant of a man.\"The Godfather: Part II\" beats the odds, and somehow, in my opinion, manages to be a greater film than its predecessor. It is a massive, complex, dark, tragic, ambitious film, and it succeeds in everything it does. 10/10",

Out of these, The Godfather Part 2 remains my favourite.It continues the Corleone family tale, of greed and corruption and yet Part 2 adds another vein to the bloodstream of this biblical tale; the story of Vito Corleone and his arrival in New York. The cinematographer, Gordon Willis creates a sepia-washed dream of a New York. Every shot is sumptuous ad full of depth - the production value was a help too, with some of the most authentic streets scenes ever committed to film.Though, as wonderful as the film looks, the acting is stellar to. De Niro completely transforms himself from the urban maniacs like Johnny from Mean Streets and Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, to form Vito Corleone, the younger Marlon Brando. De Niro doesn't over cook the character, instead he simmers; his eyes tell two tales, one of being content, the other of contempt, for the killing of his family.De Niro is backed up by great co-stars, such as Bruno Kirby who played the young Clemenza. The story itself in this section of the film is slow burning, much like the rest of the film, yet is here to serve a contrast to the story of Michael Corleone in Nevada.This is the part in the trilogy where Michael transforms from the \"college boy\" and \"war hero\" of part 1, into the heartless, muted confusion that he embodies here. Pacino plays the part with ease and never goes wild and shout, much like his later work (Glengarry Glen Ross, Godfather Part 3...). Keaton is superb as the WASP wife, Kay, who tries to break free of the corruption she has married into. Cazale, who plays Fredo is wonderful too, a helpless, jealous character, who forms one of the best brother characters in film history. The co-stars are also great, with Strasberg as Hyman Roth.Just as Michael's family is dissolving, Vito's is just beginning. The two fragments of the Corleone history run side by side to depict the downfall of Michael's character. Constantly trying to please his dead father, Michael talks of family, but doesn't understand how to sustain it.A classic.",

It's absolutely incredible.    Once again masterfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it lives up to both its reputation and its predecessor.  One of the best parts of this movie is how you see two people changing in parallel:Michael Corleone (Pacino) who becomes a criminal after having sworn to his wife that the family would be legitimate.His father Vito (De Niro in his Oscar- winning supporting actor performance) who goes from good to evil.  The movie follows the steps of its predecessor with many classic scenes (the ending especially).  Pacino, De Niro, Starsberg, Duvall, Keaton, and Shire give tremendous performances.  See it.",

Vito Corleone, an immigrant who lands on the shores of New York to escape the mafia in Cicily. Only to become the most powerful man later in life as the favour granting Don Corleone. Marlon Brando was brilliant as the Don as well as Robert Deniro who plays his younger self. The scope and gritty scale of the dirt ridden Ghetto was absolutely eye catching. You can actually smell the surroundings as you watch the film unfold. What was enjoyable also was seeing Al Pacino play the Don's young son, who later in life takes the reigns of his father's business and becomes even more powerful through the connections of the Las Vegas Game Circuit. Violence and revenge is what this movie is all about, to settle scores between families and factions which sometimes become chaotic. Through this is Micheal, a calm mild mannered child of Don Corleone who can take revenge to other levels. Another enjoyable character was Micheal's family lawyer played by Robert Duvall, without his connections, none of what the Corleone family gained would have been possible. This was a grand scale movie in all forms, the music, the gunfights, the revenge, and Coup De Gras type solutions which is only recognizable to those who appreciate this kind of genre. Beautiful story.",

            "content": "This post is probably gonna tick you off. But I don't want to flame on your tastes. I'm not gonna trash what anyone thinks is the best movie. This is just a very long-winded argument about why The Godfathers stand as milestones in cinema. Spoilers throughout.I've read a number of posts who think the characters are hollow. There are long scenes when the characters seems to be doing nothing, or just *thinking*. That's one of the great parts of the film. There are deep threads of loyalty and family and duty throughout the trilogy, and the original Godfather (and ptII) is one of the few films that does these moments justice. The cast assembled does what few ever have: you can \"see\" them thinking. Brando, Pacino, DeNiro, Strasberg (of course), Duvall - all masters of what is probably the most difficult talent to achieve on film. Pacino is especially great at this in GpartII when you watch him agonize over what to do with (if you've seen it) *you-know-who*. There is a subdued intensity to each character, living a life where death is always around the corner of one bad mistake. They're thoughtful, intelligent, and conflicted. The gift of these movies is they don't telegraph these undercurrents or make it painfully obvious. If you let yourself, the characters draw you in to these processes.Much of our current standards for cinema are based on flair and fast-action-packed-editing. Not to sound cheesy, but the Godfathers unfold like a rare flower, slow and with purpose. Keep in mind, there are no accidents in movies. That is to say, what you see in the frame is completely planned (as much as can be in cinema). Watch the scene where Brando is advising Pacino on the particulars of the business. There is real heartbreak between them, two men doing the family's business. Vito Corleone never wanted it to be Michael, and neither did Michael want it for himself, but both esteem the family more than themselves, and so they discuss this ugly business. If this movie were made today, the scene would only be a few snappy lines, some quick wit dialogue, and cut to the big explosion. This is a gem of a scene because you watch the actors put these emotions away to do what's brutal and necessary, and in a sense, say goodbye.Watch Brando in the car after the meeting with the Five Families. He comes to a chilling realization about who is behind the war, but how? Watch this scene and then re-watch the meeting with the Five Families for the moment this realization hits him. It happens and is gone in a second, but in that second you see him decide what to do. He tucks away his anger and waits. He waits until Michael takes over, and passes this knowledge on to him without ever telling him what to do. This is where the art of direction makes this possible. Without a word ever being spoken about what's coming, Michael takes over the family business and sets the table to take control over all the families. Of course, when the hits are actually being done, and splicing them into the scene where Michael's niece is being christened, is the best form of ironic cinematic poetry. What makes the GpartI and GpartII connection is you see the same process in DeNiro/Young Vito. After he's shaken down for the last time by Don Fanucci, he decides what and how to do it in a second - and DeNiro shows that, without a word ever being spoken. Of course, there are the iconic moments of the movie. The horsehead in the bed, (in the restaurant with Solozzo and McCluskey) Pacino coming to a boil as the train gets louder in the background, the opening scene with the undertaker (a great homily to Italian-Americans), Brando moving around the room and brushing his cheek, Fredo on the lake reciting the Hail Mary, Pacino kissing Fredo in Cuba, Sonny on the causeway, etc... These are just a few of examples of what make these movies great. I've read where people can't identify to the characters. How many of us really can identify with the people we see on film? The Godfathers paint a portrait of a life unknown to just about everybody. The real gangsters liked it so much, they emulated the fictional parts (like the hand-kissing). The films are poetry, but there's nothing poetic about the events in it. The characters are sublime, but there's nothing sublime about their character. The movies don't give anything away (who saw the Fredo thing coming?), but are transparent at the same time. I know this is high minded and stuffy, but hopefully, even if you're not a fan, you can understand why the films are so highly regarded.But, for the haters, I'll give you GpartIII - what in the h*ll was he thinking letting Sofia Coppola act? Part III is by far a weak addition to the trilogy...unless you're a die hard fan...not worth seeing. Now rub your eyes if you read the whole thing....",

De Niro & Pacino are two of the greatest movie actors of all time but I have to say that, to my mind, De Niro is just fantastic in his role. Great too is Robert Duvall as family lawyer & counsellor Tom Hagen. John Cazale who plays Michael's brother Fredo is also excellent. He had the misfortune to die of cancer at only 42 years of age but the good luck to appear in only five 1970's movies all of which are regarded as classics.

            "content": "Francis Ford Coppola came perilously close in this film to accomplishing something rarely, if ever, done: he nearly made the second movie revolving around a particular set of characters and themes better than the first.In the truest sense of the word, Godfather II is NOT a sequel, nor was it intended to be. What Part II does is fill in details about Don Vito Corleone's arrival in America and rise to underworld power. That story was told by Mario Puzo in the novel, but involved too lengthy a story to include in the 1972 film. Coppola and Puzo did the next best thing: they told the prequel, the rise to power of Don Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and then appended to the prequel the story of the Corleone family subsequent to Michael's gangland triumph at the close of the first film. \"Appended\" should not be taken to have a pejorative connotation. There is certainly nothing slapdash about the tale of the Corleone family's fortunes following the obliteration of the rival gang leaders at the end of the first film.Al Pacino is stunningly believable as the still-reluctant Don Michael Corleone. He wants to move the family business toward legitimacy, but in the end events compel him to \"be strong for everyone\" by taking down all of the family's enemies, even when one of them is his older brother Fredo (John Cazale, again brilliant).Unlike the first film, Coppola does not pull off the same level of audience empathy for the Corleone family in the second film. Clearly the life of the crime boss is costing Michael everything while he gains all the power in the world. The first film is more equivocal on that point and also remarkably draws the viewer into a world where the Corleones can be viewed with some empathy. In Part II, Michael is far more cold-blooded and consequently a less sympathetic character. He seems less drawn into the vortex of organized crime by unexpected events, as was the case in the first film, and more the ruthless manipulator.This is really two great films in one. Vito Corleone's rise to power is portrayed with subtle intensity by DeNiro, always observant and always absorbing important information from his observations. Those scenes really capture remarkably the story of Don Vito's early years woven by Puzo in the novel. Wrapped around that prequel is a marvelous continuation of the original story with remarkable twists and turns and deft uses of historical circumstances (Congressional racketeering hearings and the Castro revolution in Cuba). This is another magnificent film, and fitting second step in the Godfather story.Don't end the story with the first Godfather movie. See them both. As for Godfather 3, well, if you really want to go ahead, but be prepared for a let down.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II (1974)Is this well made? Dramatic? Epic? Beautiful? Impressive?Of course.Is this better than the original Godfather? In some ways, yes. It lacks the originality of the whole world novelist Mario Puzo (and co-screenwriter Coppola) created, but it fills in background in Italy and adds wonderful new elements about immigration and the revolution in Cuba. It lacks Marlon Brando, who is a force of his own, but the presence of Robert DeNiro in the many long flashbacks is moving (and he has more presence than Pacino, frankly, who is intentionally stoic, but to the point of expressionless). Is it a great movie? Why not? What is a great movie supposed to do that this one doesn't? Well, for one thing, I don't think it surprises at all. It doesn't reveal anything too deeply, despite all its deeply felt and emotionally turbulent scenes, and despite the apparent inner probing of the main character (who is last seen thinking very hard, staring into space). It doesn't suggest how to feel about any of this violence, this cold duplicity. And maybe it shouldn't do any of these things. It is an oddly \"confirming\" experience. It shows what we have come to think we already know, more or less, about the mafia world with its combination of loyalty and bloody revenge, its attachment to business and its selfishness, its emphasis on family even as it kills those in its own family.What Coppola does do, as director, is suck you in. You get wrapped up in the world of these men (mostly men, of course, though with a great small role by Talia Shire and a famously troubled larger role by Diane Keaton, who makes a better Annie Hall by far). You are easily and gladly transported from New York to Las Vegas to Miami to Italy back and forth, across time and space, in warm colors and sweeping scenes, inside and out. The pieces of this rather complex story are put together with \"artful\" deliberation--it's a work of art, surely, despite its relatively straight forward intentions.It is also filmed, that is lit and photographed, with sensitivity, without becoming virtuosic for its own sake, by Gordon Willis. Part of the immersion happens because of how everything is depicted, and it's easier said than done to make it all cohere and remain beautiful.So yes, it's surely a terrific movie. It might not be one of your favorite movies, and it really isn't one of mine. I've resisted watching it a second time for two decades, and finally have, and found my mind wandering sometimes. This might partly be a testament to the imprint the Godfather movies have made on American culture and on the movies, because part of my distraction was that it's all so familiar. But it's familiar partly because it's so influential and convincing.But it's also partly true that there isn't a huge range of events here. I mean, a lot happens, but it falls mostly into a small diversity of power plays, deceptions, waiting games, and ruthless murders. It's all fascinating and terrifying on some level, but it all wraps around itself over and over again. You will find yourself understanding and even identifying with some of the characters, but you might not find yourself sympathizing with any of them, not the major ones, who are all (all) out for themselves in the end, or a pathetic followers yes men. In short, if you like this world and are fascinated by the male power aura, every second is filled with drama. But if like me this isn't really sufficient for over three hours of absorption, your mind might wander a bit, too. Cosi sia.",

Here are just key examples.G1 opens on an exterior wedding party; inside Vito's office, people ask for his help and present their respects. / G2 (after the prologue in Sicily) opens on an exterior communion party; inside Michael's office, the latter is insulted by the Senator.-G1: the horse is decapitated and his head put into the producer's bed to scare him. / G2: a prostitute is massacred, her bleeding body lying in bed, to frame the Senator. Despite being less graphic, this scene is more shocking than the previous one.-G1: the Corleones receives two fishes indicating Luca Brasi \"sleeps with the fishes\". / G2: Fredo's body will be thrown into the lake amongst the fishes he used to take.-G1: at Vito's funeral attendance is high; everyone including other Mafia families is united and acts in a friendly way (although this hides a plot to assassinate Michael). / G2: at Carmella's funeral attendance is lower; Michael first refuses to see Fredo, then agrees, however the truce will be short.-G1 ends with parallel editing alternating between Michael's godson's baptism and the murders of five Mafia heads. This is only partly shocking since they are criminals and intended to kill Michael anyhow. / G2 ends on parallel editing alternating between three pathetic murders while Fredo says the prayer \"Hail Mary\": a terminally ill old man (Roth), an old man by proxy (Pentangeli's suicide), Michael's own brother (Fredo).-At the very end of G1, Michael is in the house surrounded by his family and his men; the scene is bright. / In the last shot of G2, Michael is alone outside only surrounded by dead leaves; the scene is dark.-G1: the final shot shows Michael's hitman closing the door on Kay. / G2: Michael himself closes the door on Kay, preventing her from kissing her children goodbye.-Overall, G1 chronology is linear. / G2 presents a fragmented timeline with many flashbacks and sequences of variable lengths (see below).-G1 includes dark scenes (Vito's office, the restaurant at night, etc.) but actually more bright ones, notably the entire part in Sicily. Some bright scenes even depict a bleak story: Paulie's murder, Sonny's shooting, Vito's death, Vito's funeral, Carlo's murder. / G2 opens on a very dark scene, albeit short (Michael in his office) and has many more dark ones, to the point we sometimes do not see the actors' eyes.-In G1, the weather is frequently sunny and warm. / G2 shows snowy exteriors and ends in autumn with dead leaves covering the immense garden.-Regarding soundtrack, the famed and beautiful \"Love Theme\" played at length in G1 is only briefly played once in G2 (appropriately when Vito returns to Sicily).REMARKABLE STRUCTUREBelow is the organisation of the movie with the rounded lengths. It alternates 7 \"present\" sequences and 6 flashbacks:\nA - 1958: Michael in his office (1')B - 1901: Vito in Sicily then Ellis Island (10')C - 1958: Michael in Tahoe (32')D - 1917: Vito in New York (16')E - 1958-59: Michael in USA then Cuba (51')F - 1917: Vito in New York (16')G - 1959: Senate hearings (7')H - 1920: Vito in New York (7')I - 1959: Senate hearings (23')J - 1925: Vito in Sicily (7')K - 1959: Carmella's funeral, final murders (21')L - 1941: Vito's surprise party (4')M - 1959: Michael alone in his garden (1')Then closing credits (5') for a total of 3h22.Flashbacks represent a cumulated length of just one hour but cover a long period of time (1901 to 1941). By contrast, present sequences last for two hours and a quarter yet only span a year and a half (mid-1958 to end-1959): we feel there is a progression in Vito's story while Michael's is stagnating, and in some ways regressing. Indeed, the last scene loops with the first one: both are short, dark and silent showing a close-up of Michael's face on the right; yet while in the first Michael was respected and protected by his house, in the last he is alone and exposed to the outside world.Also, all flashbacks involving the young Vito (B, D, F, H, J) have a comparable length: from 7 to 16 minutes. Some are even equal: 7 minutes (H, J), 16 minutes (D, F). This creates a sense of stability as we follow Vito's evolution. By contrast, present sequences have very different lengths: from less than one minute (A, M) to 51 (E). This generates uncertainty and instability on line with Michael's dangerous and immoral evolution. Of course we don't watch a movie looking at a timer but we intuitively feel its rhythm.Last, the same way Part II is a degraded version of \"The Godfather\" as we saw, contemporary parts are a degraded version of flashbacks. This is notably illustrated by transitions between sequences, highlighting contrasts between present and past. (The only exception is the transition between parts B and C which highlights continuity: insert indicating \"Vito Corleone (...)\" -> insert indicating \"His grandson Anthony Vito Corleone (...)\".)C: father and son (Michael and Anthony) are together, yet in a difficult situation since their house was assaulted -> D: father and son (Vito and Sonny) as well as Carmella are together in a happy mood.-D: Vito and his family are again together -> E: Michael has to go away from his family.-E: Michael learns Kay had a miscarriage, hence they lost a child -> F: baby Fredo has pneumonia but will survive.-F: Vito is with his family, Michael in his arms; it is a happy scene -> G: Michael is alone in the snow then has to face the Senate hearings where the word \"family\" is used pejoratively to designate the Mafia.-G: Michael talks to his mother, he is scared about losing his family -> H: Vito's power is growing, he is building a family both as a father and as a Mafia head.-H: Vito sets up Genco company which will make him powerful -> I: Michael could lose everything at the Senate hearings.-I: Kay tells Michael she aborted; they will separate -> J: Vito surrounded by his family goes back to his roots in Sicily.-J: Vito kills Don Ciccio avenging his family and leaves Sicily; for him it is an appropriate end of an era -> K: Michael's mother is dead; it is a sad end of an era.-K: there are three murders, of which Fredo's -> L: the family is gathered around the table, including Fredo.-L: the gathered family happily sings for Vito; then there is a shot of baby Michael in Vito's arms waving goodbye from the noisy train (same as end of J) -> M: Michael is alone and silent in his garden.PIVOTAL ENDINGThe penultimate scene depicting Vito's birthday (L) is especially compelling. At the end of K, Michael is alone in his house after Fredo's assassination; he remembers with nostalgia that party were the family was gathered: it is the only flashback based on Michael's memory since the other ones illustrate Vito's life. It started joyfully, however gradually became grim. For starters, Michael had an argument with Sonny and Tom about joining the army. Ironically, Fredo was the only one supporting him, precisely that brother he just killed. And out of the nine persons present, we realise six are now dead, either naturally (Vito, Carmella) or murdered (Sonny), including by Michael himself (Tessio, Carlo, Fredo). The table then progressively became empty: a metaphor of the plot where characters are eliminated one after the other. At the end Michael remained alone while the family sung \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" off-screen, a perfect counterpoint to his past and present situations.The flashback hence only makes complete sense at the end: it does not come to Michael's mind because he is trying to revive a family feeling as we think at the beginning, but because he associates his present solitude with what he then experienced. This scene is pivotal not only to the movie but to the entire Trilogy: we better understand Michael. First, he remembers it during a key moment of his life: he is as powerful as ever, having diversified his empire, dodged the Senate hearings and eliminated his enemies, yet also as lonely as ever, divorced, with a reduced family and children who cannot be completely happy. Second, it was a key moment in itself: Michael for the first and last time diverged from his family, just before going to war. When he returns four years later, he progressively embraces their business. So Michael is now wondering: Was I right to try another way, only to come back later on? Or should have I permanently diverged at the risk of losing my family?Throughout the Trilogy Michael is obsessed with being part of a family, yet by taking over the business to avoid being lonely as he was at the party, he eventually failed: he endangered relatives; he couldn't save Apollonia and Sonny; he murdered his brother-in-law and his sister became an enemy; Kay aborted and divorced because of his crimes; he murdered Fredo; he killed some of his friends and allies. What could he have done differently? Where did he go astray? Could he have chosen the same path and avoided this tragic vacuum? The Trilogy is about the Mafia, America and Capitalism as Coppola said, but also about a man's destiny and decisions.The last short flashback showing Michael as a baby waving goodbye represents an adieu to his happy past before he made the wrong choices. In the following ultimate shot, Michael at the height of his reign and isolation cannot do anything else than meditate on the missed opportunities. The autumn surrounding him is his own autumn: Part III will be his winter.",

This surpasses a Great Film with an even greater Film. It is certainly broader in Scope and even more lavish in its Production. The Flashback New York Scenes are a standout.The warm, rich Cinematography remain and the sharp Characters with a wider palette to add even more richness to proceedings. It is more edgy and is less likely to linger with Portrait like introductions to already known participants. There are more interesting themes here like the expansion to Las Vegas, and the formation of the Family's Patriarch and sensibilities, and the Senate Hearings.This one moves quite a bit faster than the original because it has much more to say. It says it and then some. Michael's descent into internal Madness is not a pretty sight and the Inheritor to all that is Corleone becomes a very unlikable Tyrant and shows virtually no signs of Humanity as the Modernity of events that take place have no place for that sort of thing.",

Gazzo, Richard Bright, Bruno Kirby, G.D. Spradlin, Troy Donahue, Harry Dean Stanton. One of the greatest sequels in the rarest form (whereby it being even better than its predecessor in many ways) of sequels: continuing the epic storytelling of the Corleone crime family with Michael (brilliant Pacino, Oscar nominee Best Actor) beginning his dynasty with the family business taking over Las Vegas with only his middle brother and family screw up Fredo (Cazale) ineptly trying to prevent him his destiny. What makes this sequel a stand out is the parallel storyline showing young Vito Corleone (uncannily portrayed by Best Supporting Actor De Niro) and his immigrant migration to New York City's Lower East Side ghetto, establishing himself as a man of his word. Some truly great ensemble acting particularly the character actor Gazzo as a stoolie with a conscience and of course master of the Method Strasberg (both a nominee for Best Supporting Actor) as nemesis Hyman Roth. Superb screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo (Best Adapted Screenplay) as well as direction also by Coppola (Best Director). Winner of Best Picture and the only sequel to win this award as well. Academy Awards also went to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola (Francis' papa) for Best Original Dramatic Score; Art Direction (Dean Tavoularis and Angelo Graham); and Shire getting a nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

            "review_title": "Great Movie. Another Winner from Francis Ford Copolla",
            "content": "Warning! Spoilers Ahead!\"The Godfather, Part II\" is another gem of a movie, worthy of a place alongside its revered predecessor. This movie's strengths lie in Copolla's retention of the best actors from the first film mixed in with terrific new actors for the second. John Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Robert de Niro and Michael Gazzo are given their moment to shine here, and play credible and unforgettable characters. Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall reprise their roles from the first movie, and put in an equal amount of effort to the first film, which means that the second is also very good. Copolla had a lot more creative freedom with this picture, but it doesn't differ much from the first in terms of style and camera angles. Still, the director does an admirable job crafting an interesting and wonderful film.Pacino's Michael Corleone is, in the first, a quiet and understated character most of the time, only this time, whenever the character is riled by a tragic event, Pacino lets out his infamous \"scream\" to emphasize that his character is like a dangerous time bomb with an unpredictable temper: one minute he's calm, the next he's in a rage. Unfortunately, Pacino is most remembered for his loud, bombastic performances rather than his understated quiet ones. Keaton appears to have less screen time, but, like her husband Michael, undergoes a credible transformation from the naive, submissive character we remember from Part I into an assertive, strong woman who will not give in to her husband. She asserts control over her own body by aborting her baby rather than letting Michael have another heir to his criminal empire. Again, Keaton's performance is usually cited as the weakest of the \"Godfather\" saga, but this seems unfair, and she does well whenever she has screen time. Robert Duvall is back with another excellent turn as Corelone family adviser Tom Hagen.The new faces do very well here, and again, Copolla was blessed with an excellent cast. Gazzo is simply delectable as mobster Frank Pentangeli, one of cinema's most memorable characters. One minute he's a lovable old man, sometimes seeming as dopey and sweet as your great-uncle, asking the band to play an Italian \"tarantella\"; the next he's viciously asking for the blood of the Rosato Borthers. He, ultimately, cows to Michael's control during a Senate hearing, just as he is about to rat him out.Gazzo, a prolific playwright, showed he had the chops as an actor as well. Another memorable performance is the Italian actor who played the gangster Don Fanucci, a dandy tyrant who shakes down Italian immigrants for protection money. He, like the guy who played \"The Turk\" Solozzo in Part I, is a convincing actor who can make a slimy villain come to life. He seems to relish his role as the white coated mobster who confidently rules the neighborhood with an iron fist. Less potent is Lee Strasberg's Hyman Roth, who, after Don Fanucci, is the film's main antagonist. Roth's true evil is only revealed in other characters' dialogue and indirect screen action rather than anything we see Roth do on the screen. I wasn't fully convinced that Roth was a cunning double-crosser, as we don't actually see him engage in the double-cross. Strasberg gives an understated performance as the kingpin of the pre-Castro Havana casinos (an obvious representation of real-life gangster Meyer Lansky). Still, Strasberg does have some memorable moments, such as the famous \"This is the Business We've Chosen\" speech he gives to Michael.Fresh performances from John Cazale and Robert de Niro round out this movie. We don't see much of Fredo in Part I, but he's essential to Part II. Cazale gives a memorable performance as the meek, weak, sweet, but ultimately treacherous middle brother of the Corleone family. His flaws include his lack of intelligence and possible naivet\u00e9, which ultimately result in his being a pawn in Roth's scheme to kill Michael. Fredo wants the keys to the kingdom, but will settle for some power, and Roth apparently offered him something special for his services. All Fredo says is that \"there was something in it for me!\", but what this was is rather vague; still, Fredo's ties with Roth are enough for Michael to commit the darkest murder he will commit in the saga: fratricide. We almost feel sorry for Fredo as he sweetly tells his nephew how to catch a fish by reciting a \"Hail Mary,\" right before Michael has one his goons shoot him from behind on a fishing trip. Fredo may be the rather weak and dopey member of the Corleone clan, but Cazale also manages to humanize Fredo and make a memorable performance as the ultimately tragic odd man out in the \"family business.\" Part II carries with it a sadder tragedy than Part I, as Michael \"loses his family,\" in terms of his wife's abortion and departure, and Fredo's treachery and his eventual murder. It is in Part II that we see the full scope of the perils of a life of crime in terms of keeping a family together. Even Don Vito, while running a criminal empire, was able to somehow keep his family glued together. We see the sad irony when Michael's mother tells him \"you will never lose your family.\" This is an excellent movie, much like the first one. Copolla does well here. (Copolla's further career is debatable. Radio host Phil Hendrie once gave a hilarious criticism of Copolla's career: \"what do you mean 'Charlie don't surf?!'\") He directs beautifully here, and the actors cooperate by giving excellent performances. This is a highly recommended movie.",

            "review_title": "A Shakespearian tragedy for a Macchiavellian triumph ...",
            "content": "By tracing a parallel story between Vito's ascension to power and the consolidation of this very power by his son Michael, \"The Godfather Part II\" has an epic scope that remarkably contrasts with the 'intimate feeling' of the first opus. Yes, there's a cruel lack of warmth, of genuine love, of this very 'Family spirit' that cemented the iconic greatness of \"Part I\" but that's because the very purpose of the film is to show another kind of intimacy, the one between Politics, Business and Crime, as to highlight a sort of inner perversity in the American Dream. This is also why the film is regarded as an epic.In \"Part II\", it's not a Five-Families-war that structures the plot anymore, so there's no need for this 'team spirit' anymore, we're far from the good old days with Sonny, Hagen, Tessio and Clemenza, when the Corleones were fighting for their survival. The bigger your territory gets, the more invisible is your enemy ... so invisible he can even be one of your own. Indeed, even the first film ended with a betrayal from Tessio, Vito's trustful capo-regime, a shock that foreshadowed the idea expressed by Michael in \"Part II\", the fact that \"loyalty relies on business\". What a world where you can't call your friends \"friends\" because they are only your \"associates\" but you still call your enemies \"enemies\"! What a world when your enemies have to be kept closer than your \"friends\"! And what a world when even your brother can betray you!\"Part II\" is a much darker film in its content because it plunges us in a world where there's no room for genuine and non-calculating people \u2013after all, isn't one of the many things that make the first film more enjoyable the presence of such characters as Sonny- Even Michael has these words about Fredo, \"he's a good heart but he's weak and stupid, and this is life and death\". Life and death indeed, the family expanded its power, becoming one of the wealthiest in Nevada, but it's not New York City anymore, it's time to deal with a new category of enemies, more dangerous because they are more respectable. The film opens with a conversation between Michael Corleone and Senator Geary, but this time the politician is not the criminal's friend, he not only despises him but explicitly affirms his intention to \"squeeze him\".Michael's reply sets the tone of the film \"Senator, my offer is this: nothing\", he wouldn't feign legitimacy with a man who just asserted his moral corruption. If politicians and criminals play in the same arena: business, then they'll play according to the rule of the strongest. Crime has ceased to be an underworld, on the contrary, it embraced the world, getting \"bigger than US Steel\" as Hyman Roth would say, in the name of making a profit that would go as far for legitimacy as pretending to serve a country's economy, Las Vegas, pre-Revolution Cuba, even be able to elect a new President. If Coppola was accused of romanticizing the mob in the first opus, no one can hold the same accusation against \"Part II\", and the directing plays a significant role to that.Indeed, it's impossible to end the second film with the same level of fascination created by the magical moment where Neri shuts the door on Kay's face, and maybe that's why we still enjoy the first film, because it has this sort of 'happy end' feel, because we are still within the Corleone's inner circle and \"the good team won\" and could savor the victory behind the closed door. Michael became another man, even more ruthless than his father, but he was the Don in this 'underworld' context, so he can only inspire our empathy, if not our respect.But in Part II, crime, business and politics are all part of the same hypocrisy, and while Michael could count on the loyalty of Neri, Rocco, Hagen and even Fredo at the end of the first part, in Part II, he becomes aware that greed and thirst for power can triumph over the most loyal individual.... and if he didn't knew that before, the assassination attempt he miraculously escaped from, sent a clear message about it. So, while \"Part I\" established the necessity of a strong loyalty to overcome a clearly identifiable enemy, \"Part I\"I highlights the illusory aspect of loyalty when it comes to an invisible enemy that can be on your own side, even your own brother, consequently leading to Michael's descent into paranoia.The first film was a consolidation of power, built on Family, friendship and loyalty, incarnated by the warmth and quiet strength of Vito Corleone, we find him again with the traits of Robert De Niro, in his Oscar-winning role. He represents the heritage of Michael Corleone, the proper use of power, of intelligence, of heart but the tragedy of \"Part II\" is to highlight the obsolescence of a figure like Vito Corleone in a world that got more blinded by greed and power, a world where Machiavellian intelligence was a more valuable asset than pure intuition and where even love and brotherhood could be reduced to sheer abstractions. Times have changed and Michael realized that the time of his father is over, and that he can indeed \"lose his family\". The tragic irony is that he lost it by trying to preserve it.The second film deconstructed all the values that its glorious predecessor stood for to draw a dark, gripping and harrowing portrait of Crime, incarnated by the cold and ruthless eyes of Michael Corleone, Al Pacino in what I believe to be one of the all-time greatest performances. It's thought-provoking, it's even more realistic, but maybe we blame it for not being 'more enjoyable' than the first film, more romantic I mean. For me, it's perfect the way it is.",

            "content": "It seems impossible to think that the first Godfather could be topped, but its direct sequel may be even better. It effectively takes all the elements from the first and makes them bigger and more complex, as well as revolutionising the idea of flashbacks. The plot is possibly the greatest of all time, the characters are more diversely fascinating and everything feels even more epic than before.The plot is split in two, one following the Corleone family in modern day and the other early life of Vito. The first follows Michael who is now Don as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas. He faces much dissatisfaction in his own family, from Capo Frank Pentangeli and his own sister. He later survives an assassination attempt, and as he tries to learn who made the attempt he also faces a committee investigation that tears his family apart. This story is one of the best in film history, everything about it is incredibly set-up. The second charts the young life of Vito Corleone as he raises his family in New York and aims to build his own legacy. This sees him challenge the local Don and gain friends to help him achieve his goal. This part gives us a true insight into how all of what we're seeing started and is a fantastic mirror image to the modern events. The huge cast is once again truly outstanding. Al Pacino gives an incredible performance as we see Michael transform into a cold monster who has no feelings for his family. The way Pacino shows the struggle as he edges closer to the abyss is astonishing. The other star is John Cazale as Fredo, he is outstanding as the timid Fredo, the chemistry between himself and Pacino sets their scenes alight. Robert Duvall is solid as a rock once again as the reserved Tom, while Diane Keaton is great showing Kay as confused and frightened of her situation. Michael V. Gazzo is superb as Frank showing him as a genuinely troubled person. Richard Bright deserves praise as, despite few lines, he commands the screen as the loyal but brutal Al Neri. Joe Spinell is great as the doubtful Cicci as is Lee Strasberg as the devious Hyman Roth. Robert De Niro made his name here, he plays Vito with assured comfort and is just as good as Brando, which is praise itself. The film looks stunning. It is lit similar to the first and carries the same gloomily authentic feel being very atmospheric. The scenes of early New York and of Sicily are both excellent having a very natural look to them. The music from Nino Rota is once again marvellous. The script is full of classic lines, \"Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer\" and \"I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies\" to name but two. It's great how the film focuses more on Michael and it's reflected by the look at Vito. Michael grows increasingly paranoid and unstable as he places the family business above all else. We see the differences in how the family is set. Vito's was built on loyalty and love, whereas Michael's family is built on fear and violence. It is a fascinating contrast which the film itself is built on, the whole scope is formed from this showing the pleasant start of the family and then it's tragic fall. There are so many classic scenes, Michael finding out the traitor, Kay's pregnancy reveal, all of the conversations with Fredo, the scenes at the hearing and the famous 'fishing trip' to name a few. The final shot of Michael sitting alone is one of the most memorable of all time.The Godfather Part II is a breath taking achievement in film and has possibly the greatest story ever put on screen.",

Maybe the drive of Michael Corleone to build his empire makes him too cold? But it was a pleasure to see Al playing with his mentor (Lee Strasberg) and watch their complicity.The great moment of this movie was the story of the Don played by De Niro. He speaks little but when he said something, you'd better listen. The life of immigrants in little Italia around 1900 was very well depicted.

            "content": "I secretly read Mario Puzo's The Godfather in 1974 when I was 12 after my mother prohibited me from seeing the movie. She was trying to shield me from the rough language and lurid violence. There sure was a lot of both but more so there were great characters. Vivid, real, flesh and blood souls that acted on well drawn impulses and ambitions. Consequences were openly inevitable but somehow jarring, devastating and poignant. Historical elements were stunningly precise yet grandly broad and vast. I was entirely, absolutely overwhelmed by the visceral sensations and sprawling imagery. So this is what \"literature\" is all about. This is what \"reading\", I now understood, could be. I had been something of a sci-fi junkie previously, but from then on I was a converted disciple of the Great American Fable. The story was truly great and I never could have imagined a better one until I finally saw the movies.Astoundingly, Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptations surpass the novel in a few key details. The casting of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is the single greatest improvement on the original story. Where in the novel, Michael is something of a strapping, virile, obviously competent man of action, Coppola introduces a crucial element of doubt by way of Pacino's diminutive stature. Though we are told Michael is a returning war hero, we are skeptical of his leadership abilities, especially in the company of such physically imposing figures as his father and oldest brother Sonny. Pacino's bodily disadvantage works to emphasize the complexities of his reluctance to join in the Family Enterprise, and makes his cerebral and emotional challenges that much more epic.The other notable improvement on the book, of course is Marlon Brando, who created one of the most indelible characters for the big screen. There wasn't then, nor is there now, any other person in the industry who could so monumentally fulfill the herculean task with which that character is charged. Don Vito Corleone's function in the story is metaphorical, transcendent, mythological. He is the living embodiment of the ageless value of Heritage. Heritage which only endures through the tenuous bonds of family unity, but transported to a young, naive, unsympathetic land, is now being severely tested. But since Godfather II begins after the Don is dead it is faced with the considerable challenge of how to maintain this crucial historical perspective. So, Gf 2 immediately whisks us back into time with a vignette of Vito's tragic childhood in turn-of-the-century Sicily. Later begins a series of flashbacks to his early manhood in New York City played by a sublimely low key Robert DeNiro. Oddly, he is not engaged in acts of wanton destruction, sociological delinquency or self indulgent pride. Rather, we are casually informed of Vito's entry into the underworld by way of seemingly reasonable acts. He is drawn as a man not just doing what is necessary to survive in the rough, often brutal New World, but driven by his familial responsibilities and a sense of duty to his community. The period from which we are \"flashing\" is the late 1950s and early 1960s. By butting the \"old\" up against the \"new\" we are offered a sparkling view of the clash of cultures, of just how much had changed in those few decades. This dichotomy introduces a two fold historical perspective. By way of the contrasts between early and mid century life we are being informed of our present day (1972 and after) cultural afflictions. It's a subtle, almost invisible point, but one that is, I believe, extremely profound, the central theme of the story, and even more relevant today. Consider how, just one single decade after the time when the story ends to when the films were made, American life had so radically changed. Now consider how much things have changed since then.While most fans of the film are impressed with the robust characters, compelling dialog and and terrific action produced with expert cinematic skill, I was even more fascinated by the film's more abstract qualities. Coppola, much more so than Puzo, is playing Socrates here, posing a dialectic query - How is it that primal cultural tenets might survive in a climate of overwhelming opposition? Francis is troubled, alarmed by the assault on vital culture that all humanity is experiencing today, and obviously very cynical that cherished and valuable, essential traditions can persist. This cynicism was a pervasive theme at the close of the sixties and it infused nearly all the great art of the time. Remember, the year of the book's publication, 1969, also saw the release of \"Easy Rider.\" Not insignificantly, that too was a story of social outsiders, antiheroes colliding with an increasingly corrupt, immoral majority. This cynicism is the intellectual, psychological and emotional driving force of the The Godfather I & II, and it's the thing that kept me coming back to them, again and again. So, what for many is simply a superb, if not the greatest, Gangster Movie, is for me one of the finest critical views of the American Way. It is, in fact, irrelevant that the Corleones are mobsters, because ultimately what destroyed them is what is destroying all Americans. The disintegration of the essential commitment to family and community - our succumbing to all the temptations that undermine our strengths - is our downfall. It's no coincidence that the tragedy ultimately concludes in Las Vegas, the spiritual center of America's true religion, the Capitol City of Temptation. Our cultural decline has progressed to where it is now terminally incurable. Great art in the service of a dying society. We have all become Fredo.",

But seeing the good side thhe conflict of the movie is very interesting and dramatic, as in the first one the performeance of Al pacino and the other actors is great, and the evolucion and the evolution of Michael Corleone is incredible, and i like very much that the movie tells you the orgins of Don Corleone.This movie, more than anything, tells us about Michael's path in the life of crime, everything he is doing and the bad decisions he has made. Finally the ending of the movie is great,because reminds you of what Michael used to have with a scene of him eating with his family and then he changes the scene to a lonely Michael who really has nothing left.",

First off, I have to mention the excellent musical score. It gives the film a sort of dark, moody atmosphere, and I think it was a very good idea to use the same score as in part I. Secondly, the idea of inter wining the story of Michael Corleone and of his early father Vito was brilliant and makes this sequel stand out from the first part. This idea of showing two stories in one film could have been quite risky and confusing but Coppola did a fantastic job at it. Both stories are very clear to follow and show the contrast between Vito and his son's way of handling the family business.Of course, I cannot comment on this movie without mentioning Al Pacino's awesome performance. He definitely should have won the best actor's Oscar for that role. He has unbelievable screen presence and plays incredibly well the ruthless, suspicious Michael Corleone. The most poignant scene of the film, in my opinion, is definitely the one where Michael finds out at the party that his brother Fredo betrayed him.",

Without Marlon Brando, Al Pacino fills the big shoes as the Don in this movie, along with Robert Duvall, and flashbacks to a young Vito played none other than by Robert De Niro. This movie shows the rise of Vito and how he became so powerful, and gives you background on his upbringing and family. It also shows you how much different times are and how Michael handles current situations. I read somewhere that they asked Marlon Brando to come back for the second even though he passed in the first he probably would have done some flashbacks and It upsets me that he didn't do that, but then again who knows how it would have turned out, If that happened maybe they wouldn't have cast De Niro and would never have had the career hes had. So i guess everything happens for a reason. The Godfather Pt II is a great film and falls so close to the original.",

            "content": "This film essentially begins in Sicily with a young \"Vito Andolini\" (Oresti Baldini) having just lost his father and witnessing his mother also being murdered by a local Mafia chieftain. Knowing that he is now a target as well the 9 year old boy escapes on a ship to New York and not long afterward arrives in Ellis Island where he is given the last name of \"Corleone\". The film then fast forwards 57 years with \"Michael Corleone\" (Al Pacino) presiding over a party for his young son's First Communion party in Nevada. As is customary he meets with those who need to see him with one particularly powerful person named \"Senator Pat Geary\" (G. D. Spradlin) using the opportunity to attempt to extort some money from him. Little does he know just how vicious Michael actually is and the senator soon changes his tune not long after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film constantly shifts its attention from the now grown \"Vito Corleone\" (played by Robert DeNiro) to his adult son Michael after he inherited the title of Godfather from his father. To that effect, although I didn't particularly care for the repeated flashbacks, the stories of both individuals are so riveting that it didn't really matter that much to me. Likewise, while sequels often fail in comparison to the original film, many people feel that this particular picture is as good as its predecessor and the fact that it won an Oscar for \"Best Picture\" and received numerous other Academy Award nominations certainly strengthens that argument. On that note, while I agree that this is an excellent film, I have rated it just slightly below the original movie.",

            "content": "Often this film is listed as the sequel to The Godfather,which it is to an extent, but yet it also serves as a prequel. Francis Ford Coppola blended the two storylines together as well as one could with two that are so different. However, was the Vito origin story really essential ? As the film follows Michael's descent into evil it cuts back to how Vito became The Don which feels like more of a distraction than anything. With a total runtime of two hundred and two minutes the Vito storyline at forty six minutes doesn't even make up a third of the film. In those forty six very little happens and for the most part the camera just meanders around him living his poor,Italian immigrant life.\nThen on the other side there's Michael. The film starts off a little while after the end of the original and Michael has moved the family to Lake Tahoe and is now a wicked,emotionless gangster. And that's pretty much how the rest of the story is.\nUnlike the original which has a far more structured story this one really is just scenes that observe Michael's life over a period. In the beginning an attack is made on his life which he works to solve and avenge. First he tries to kill the man responsible which fails but in the process he learns that Fredo was involved. It also causes one of his friends to turn on him which leads to another small series of events. And don't forget, throughout we have the young Vito scenes which feel like unnecessary deleted scenes in an extended edition.Although the overall constitution of this film is inferior to the previous, Coppola still injects some of the style of The Godfather in it. For instance, the scene in which Michael presumably forgives Fredo and walks out to embrace him the camera focuses on Michael looking past his brother and at one of his guards who understands his order. Al Pacino also deserves credit as well.\nIf there's one thing that's as consistently good as the first its Pacino. He brings the same quiet,cold brooding he did before that's so full of nuance. It's hard to imagine that this subtle,hushed actor became such a ham.\nMarlon Brando as Vito Corleone is possibly the greatest performance in film history and they were some pretty big shoes for DeNiro to fill. And while that part of the film may not be good he still gives a strong performance-at least as good as someone who's name doesn't start with Marlon and end with Brando can.As I close out this review I might as well mention the ending scene,which I found the best in the film. Michael sits down on a bench and flashes back to him waiting for his father on his birthday along with Sonny,Fredo,Connie,Tom Hagen and Carl.It also happened to be Pearl Harbor and Michael announces he's enlisted in the Marine Corps to the anger of Sonny and Tom Hagen's shock;Fredo of course congratulates him before he's silenced by Sonny. They hear Vito arrive and go to greet him leaving Michael thinking alone at the table and then the park bench. It's the best note in an uneven composition.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II is an epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay he co-wrote with Mario Puzo. The first film is a masterpiece but the increased budget is only positive in the sequel as everything is improved immensely and I'm talking about the production design and bigger scope, the superb writing and direction is still there. Why is this film like it's predecessor regarded as a classic and of course among of the best films in history? You can write a whole essay regarding that but there's a lot of things that makes it into the masterpiece it is, there's simply just so much attention to detail and the writing is some of the best I have ever seen. It's 3 hours and 22 minutes long, every scene matters, even the flashbacks as it ties everything up nicely at the end. If not for the excellent and award worthy editing, the two parallel narratives wouldn't really work but it works in such a brilliant way. It flows so well and you see how much the two writers (especially Mario Puzo) how they care about the story and its characters. Though they are hugely inspired by real people, you can just see how real these characters are as they are flawed and written as human as possible. Mario Puzo created a fascinating and truly mesmerizing story in his books, his and Francis Ford Coppola's work for the film trilogy is on the same level if not better. There's also some comedic scenes like the previous film, if not for the actors and their execution, it wouldn't be funny. Nino Rota returns to make the musical score and honestly, it's phenomenal like always, superb work that just hits you with its emotion. The Costume Design are top notch and so is the art direction, sets and locations. The cinematography is excellent and mesmerizing, visually this is an incredible film, much thanks to\nGordon Willis. This film shows Francis Ford Coppola at his best, he created a masterpiece. It's considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. In 1997, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 32nd-greatest film in American film history. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and became the first sequel to win for Best Picture. Its six Oscar wins also included Best Director for Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for Robert De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He got robbed of the Oscar, his performance is brilliant in every way and tops even Robert De Niro's phenomenal performance, it might also be Pacino's best performance of his entire career. Robert De Niro won an Oscar for his performance and I'm behind that 100%, he lived in Sicily for three months and spent four months learning to speak the Sicilian language in order to play Vito Corleone, that's how he prepared for the role.It is the second installment in The Godfather trilogy. Partially based on Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather, the film is both a sequel and a prequel to The Godfather, presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of Michael Corleone, the new Don of the Corleone family, protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life and as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba; the prequel covers the journey of his father, Vito Corleone, from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in New York City. The Godfather Part II has many characters returning from the first film, they changed actors for the flashback/prequel story of the narrative, Robert De Niro takes over the role of Vito Corleone and I want to say that he does the character justice but it's almost impossible to stop thinking of the magnificent and perfect performance that Marlon Brando did as the older Vito. Some important characters are Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams-Corleone, Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone, John Cazale as Fredo Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, Michael V. Gazzo as Frank Pentangeli, G. D. Spradlin as Senator Pat Geary, Richard Bright as Al Neri, Gastone Moschin as Fanucci and Tom Rosqui as Rocco Lampone. There's of course much more actors and fully fleshed out characters. Hyman Roth is a Jewish mobster, investor and a business partner of Vito Corleone, and later his son Michael Corleone. He is based on New York mobster Meyer Lansky. Frank Pentangeli is a caporegime in the Corleone family, running the family's operations in New York City while Michael Corleone, his brother and underboss, Fredo and the other two capos, Rocco Lampone and Al Neri are based in Nevada.The character arc for Michael Corleone in the first two parts of The Godfather Trilogy is brilliant and just a milestone in terms of storytelling, but it comes full circle here and sees the true nature of Michael. I just think he's a brilliant character and even though he's such an ice cold person and evil person, I still sympathize with him because of who he once was and who he still is underneath it all. The Godfather Part III is a satisfying end to his arc and it wouldn't be as excellent if it wouldn't be for this movie.Rewatching this film made me appreciate it even more and I can finally say that this is among the best films I've ever seen. Like Goodfellas, this trilogy is worth coming back to again and again, I just hope it doesn't take me years to rewatch it again. In terms of camera, lighting, cinematography, composition, production design, costume, storytelling, writing and acting. It's flawless and a master class in filmmaking. With all that said, I just have to admit this, I think the story was better in the first film and that's mostly because of how the entire film was based on the book, whilst Part II is partially based on that book (it's only Vito's backstory that's based on the novel, rest is original). On my first viewing, my thoughts were the opposite, I thought the story was better here but the first has a better story but I think this film has improved on everything.The Godfather Part II is a masterpiece that I'll continue to study and to enjoy, almost 50 years and it's holding up better than some of the latest in the past two decades, I think letting Francis Ford Coppola get complete freedom with the follow-up to The Godfather was the right choice for the studio and for the trilogy. It wouldn't have been as good if that weren't the case, but we got an masterpiece and a classic out of it.",

Boasting all the ingredients that made its predecessor one of world cinema's greatest triumphs, The Godfather Part II remains one of the most critically & artistically successful films in cinema history and amongst all sequels, is certainly the most honoured.The Godfather Part II tells the story of two generations of the Corleone family, thus serving as both a sequel & a prequel to the original, transitioning within the same film. The prequel portion is illustrated in a series of flashbacks and depicts the life of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in the previous film & by Robert De Niro in this one) and shows his rise from a poor immigrant in 1910s New York to the highly powerful & respected boss of the Corleone crime family. The sequel portion deals with the aftermath of the events of the first film and continues the journey of Michael Corleone as the new Don and shows him tightening his grip on his family business and expanding it into Vegas & Cuba. The two parallel dramas within the same film also serve as antonyms to each other, considering that one part follows Vito Corleone's rise to power through love, fear & respect while the other part represents the fall of Michael Corleone from the ruthless boss of a vast empire to a lonely & empty shell of a human being.Continuing the saga from where it signed off in the previous part, Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo, this time, bring the origin & evolution of the Corleone crime family on-screen through flashbacks but also carry forward its current legacy in the sequel segment of the story. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is much improved than it was in The Godfather and presents him in complete control of all filmmaking aspects. The screenplay is expertly written by Coppola & Mario Puzo, adapting the prequel part from the novel while envisioning the sequel part from scratch and, just like the previous film, contains some of the most memorable quotes in movie history. Cinematography inherits the same Technicolor print from the original and adds different contrasts to distinguish the two parallel timelines occurring within the film. Editing is equally impressive for it balances the two stories beautifully and keeps the pace in check throughout its 200 minutes of runtime. Art Direction & Set Decoration shows major enhancements over its predecessor. And finally, the music by Nino Rota is even better, building upon the iconic score of The Godfather and exploring newer territories in this one.One of this saga's biggest strength has been its remarkable cast & splendid performances. The Godfather Part II features Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton & Talia Shire in their reprising roles while also adding Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo & others to its strong ensemble. Al Pacino has given many spectacular performances in his film career but his work in this film remains his best. The cold & ruthless Michael Corleone, played exceptionally well by Al Pacino, returns to screen as more evolved & unforgiving and this performance of Pacino easily ranks among the finest that cinema has to offer. Robert De Niro comes next with an equally magical performance as young Vito Corleone and brilliantly modified his voice & expressions to match the attributes that Marlon Brando brought to this character in the previous film. John Cazale gets more screen time and delivers a heartbreaking performance as Fredo Corleone. Lee Strasberg & Michael V. Gazzo also chip in with strong inputs as Hyman Roth & Frank Pentangeli, respectively. And other impressive contributions come from Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams-Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, & Gastone Moschin as Don Fanucci.On an overall scale, everything about this sequel just works. It is more star-studded than the first film and all the filmmaking methods introduced in The Godfather appear seamlessly evolved in this second part. Fans will always be divided over which is a superior film but there is no denying that both movies are paramount examples of flawless filmmaking. As for the two stories that are masterfully intertwined within this film, I personally prefer the flashback segment more than Michael's tale for it was much better filmed, more captivating & also added quite an amount of artistic touch to the whole narrative, comparatively. From start to finish, this masterpiece improves upon the original in such impressive ways that not only it succeeds as a successful follow-up to its predecessor but also shares the same class of greatness with it and both films, since their inception, have been highly instrumental in influencing its genre as well as cinema aesthetics. Displaying greatness in all aspects of filmmaking, The Godfather Part II is an ingenious work of expert artistry in both front & behind the camera and serves wonderfully as an epic conclusion to the violent history of the Corleone crime family. Certainly the greatest & most respected sequel of all time and one of the greatest treasures of world cinema, The Godfather Part II comes one hundred percent recommended.",

            "content": "Quite possibly the greatest sequel ever made. The continuing saga of the Corleone crime family tells the story of a young Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) growing up in Sicily and in 1910s New York; and follows Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in the 1950s as he attempts to expand the family business.A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits. Too many movies are designed merely to amuse or entertain for 90 minutes or so. But there are other movies that cling to you, stay in your subconscious and you don't forget them. \"Jaws\" for example, who does not hear the \"Jaws\" theme and worry a little about what's below them when they are swimming just a little too far out in the ocean!! Godfather 2 is another of those movies. Even before the short opening credits have finished, the movie already starts to take effect. This is not just a gangster movie, it's a movie that poses deep moral problems for all of the main characters. It doesn't attempt to answer questions. The rights and wrongs that these people do to each other. What would I have done, had I been in Michael Corleone's shoes? Of the cast, Al Pacino deserved the Oscar for his work in this, the middle of his three Oscar Nominations for Best Actor in a row 73-75. \"Serpico\" and \"Dog Day Afternoon\" the other two. Even if Dustin Hoffman (Lenny) or Jack Nicholson (Chinatown) won that night, you could still argue that Pacino deserved it for his tour de force performance. But Art Carney winning (Harry & Tonto) makes the decision not to give it to Pacino all the more baffling. He is simply the core of a movie, which runs at over 3 hours long.Robert Duvall effectively underplays as his mild mannered adviser Tom Hagan. An Oscar nominated Talia Shire shows she deserved a better career than being type cast a Adrian Balboa in the \"Rocky\" franchise. Her scene towards the end with Pacino should have seen her take the award home, but she was inexplicably beaten by Ingrid Bergman (For Murder On The Orient Express) Bruno Kirby looks more than at home in his scenes with De Niro and it's a wonder how he never got more work in this genre. Next gangster movie he made was again with Pacino and this time with Johnny Depp 1997's \"Donnie Branco\" which is a shame, he'd have made a great Al Capone. Lee Strasberg deserves special mention too for his role as Hyman Roth as does Joe Spinelli. A young actress called Kathleen Beller makes an impression in her small role, and it's a shame she never had more of an acting career.And that is without even mentioning The Superb Robert De Niro who did win the Oscar Beating his costars Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo as well as after Astaire and a young Jeff Bridges (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot) to the award. This was a young De Niro when Mean Streets was the only movie he'd made of more, and you could already see his future as one of our greats.",

Pathetic.The only scenes that actually ring true here are from the original Puzo book (the earlier life of Vito Corleone).The contrast between the dreary Coppola script of Godfather Two and its dreary characters is brought home strongly by the final (flashback) scene where Sonny Corleone and the others are around the table.

            "content": "The original Godfather was more about Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) than it was about Michael (Al Pacino), his son. Michael was the other main character certainly, but it was Vito's movie all around. In this sequel the roles are switched and while it's still about Vito, specifically about his youth, it's much more about Michael and his struggle with power, responsibility, pride and greed.The movie dances between two timelines, following both young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), and Michael as the new head of the Corleone family. The roles are also switched in that in the original film we followed the fall of an aging crime boss and the rise of a cunning mind in Vito and Michael, respectively. This time it's Vito that's rising to become the most feared and respected man in New York, whereas Michael is the one to suffer and watch as his life is torn down all around him.Superb storytelling from Francis Ford Coppola, and the main reason why this is such a beloved movie. In lesser hands all these separate strings, characters and plot points would have become a convoluted mess, but in Coppola's hands they weave a tapestry of corruption, personal glory and ruthless ambition. And while it is a requirement to have seen the original film, it in no way takes away from the saga. In truth these films should be regarded as one long experience.The secondary reason why these films work so well are of course the actors. Al Pacino once again gives us the performance of a century. He has moved from young man plagued by naivety, responsibility and obligation to a man burdened by expectations beyond any reason, inner struggles of family and endless ambition to prove himself worthy of his father's legacy. Robert De Niro as young Vito proves himself Pacino's equal. In him we get a character that's eerily similar to young Michael in intelligence, charisma and willingness to do what's necessary, but unlike his eventual son, this man isn't burdened by the expectations of larger society. He isn't an unreasonable man, but neither does he expect anything to be given to him if he isn't willing to take it by himself. Fantastic roles, both of them.The only flaw I can name in this film in comparison to the original is the multitude of plot point and story lines. I mentioned that in Coppola's hands they are not the disaster they would otherwise be, but that doesn't mean that the original movie isn't a purer, more streamlined experience. Though only in comparison. This film is still a masterpiece by any standards.",

If I could, I would go back and change my rating of \"The Godfather\" to an 11 and make this a 10. With the exception of the Lord of the Rings films (and even that series didn't win two best pictures), no sequel can say that it strengthens the original film and that's why \"Part II\" is so good.At an epic 200 minutes long yet rarely boring, \"Part II\" tells not only the story of Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) as he takes over the family, but simultaneously tells the background of Don Vito Corleone (DeNiro) who was played by Brando in the original. To the modern viewer, DeNiro feels like a gimmick, but this was his first prestigious role and he is quite convincing as a younger version of Brando's performance. Leading man Pacino is incredibly commanding yet again as Michael as this time we see the weight of being Don grow heavier and heavier on his shoulders. As usual, it's too difficult to explain the \"business\" plot of the film, which has plenty of double-crossings and twists that the pervasive feeling of paranoia that is so ingrained in the original continues quite masterfully in this film.The acting talent is across the board so good that you have to give casting team and Coppola some of that credit. This film had three best supporting actor nominees at the Oscar's for goodness sake. If the Golden Globes that year had the best ensemble category, this film would have won it hands down. My personal favorite is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I would trust him with my life too.Everything about this film is so well done (especially the set design for New York, Italy, Cuba, etc) that it's hard to notice sometimes because you're so drawn in to the plot and following it. Coppola makes you think something tragic can happen at any second and when it does, it always delivers. The ending sequence is something that directors have stolen left and right when trying to make their ending just as powerful. While \"The Godfather\" has more memorable scenes and dialogue, this film is a masterpiece in its own right despite not having as much glitz as the original.Of course, in terms of themes, \"The Godfather: Part II\" continues to address the original's themes in new and meaningful ways. The themes of what family truly is and means get expanded upon and become so complex as seen through Michael's relationship with his wife and brother Fredo. The back-in-time plot arch with Vito sheds additional light on the \"Michael\" part of the film as well. All of it just makes \"Part II\" a rock-solid classic.",

It is a bold mix of a sequel and a prequel, showing Michael Corleane's decline in character as he leads the Corleane crime family in the late 1950s/early 1960s, and showing Vito from a poor orphan Silian boy in 1901 and rises up the ranks of the Mafia from 1917 onwards.Michael Corleane had been running the family for around five years and moved them to Nevanda. Things seem to be going well, he has political influence and is gaining money from legitimate means. But they are turning times ahead, having to deal with a conflict with a Jewish Gangster, Hyman Roth, a traitor within his ranks, the FBI and a Senate committee investigation. He is suffering family problems (both crime and personal) and is around during the Cuban revolution. Vito starts the film as a 9-year-old boy and all the male members of his family have been murdered by Don Cirrio, a powerful local Mafia chief in Silicy. He see his mother beg for mercy before getting killed by Cirrio's men and flees to New York. In 1917 the Italian neighbourhood he lives was run by local gangster, Don Fanucci. He gets tired of his iron fist rule and ends up murdering the man and taking his position. With that he becomes respected in the Italian community and a leading gangster and then looks for revenge for his family.This a complex, well plotted film, with many aspects of Mafia life being looked at from a board time-period. It is well written, brilliantly directed, Francis Ford Coppala at his best, and some great acting. It also has some good quotes which I think are some of the best in the series, like the 'I know it was you' bit and 'You are not a friend and your are not a brother'.The Godfather Part II is a great example of a gangster film and I believe that it approach of a sequel/prequel influenced other films like Infernal Affairs Part II and III. This was a very worthy Oscar winning film and I think that this film is just as good as the first. I don't know how it compares to Part III because I haven't watched it, but I haven't heard good think about it.",

            "content": "To call 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)' a sequel doesn't quite do it justice. It is more of a companion piece to the original film, serving as both a prequel and a sequel, both expanding and enriching the characters and story presented in 'The Godfather (1972).' This week I was fortunate enough to attend a cinema screening of the second film {each instalment of the trilogy played over three consecutive weeks}, and needless to say it was well worth the late night. When we last left Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), he'd just been \"baptised\" into the world of organised crime. Now, years on, he must accept that his position of corrupt power can only lead to the disintegration of his family, and the loss of everybody he's ever cared about. Michael's plateau of despair, following the impressive rise we witnessed in 'The Godfather,' is here juxtaposed with the historical ascent of his father Vito Corleone (now played by Robert De Niro) from a humble but traumatic childhood in Corleone, Sicily. The comparison delicately suggests the downside of the so-called \"American Dream\" in which Vito believes so passionately.As with 'The Godfather,' Coppola's film could only have succeeded with interesting and authentic acting performances, and the cast doesn't disappoint. Al Pacino has rarely been better, playing Michael Corleone with a violent intensity that suggests the lasting influence of brother Sonny (James Cann), who was assassinated in the previous film. Pacino's scene with Diane Keaton, in which we learn that she received an abortion for her unborn son, is one of the most traumatic moments of spousal interaction I've ever seen, with Pacino exhibiting a barely-suppressed rage through his severe, almost fearful, eyes, and a quiver in the jaw. An under-appreciated John Cazale brings depth and pathos to weaker brother Fredo, and Robert Duvall is excellent as Tom Hagen. New to the 'Godfather' cast are Lee Strasberg (President of the Actors Studio) and Michael V. Gazzo, as business associates who may be plotting against the Corleone family. De Niro won an Oscar for his portrayal of a younger Don Vito, understatedly evoking the essence of the character without parodying Marlon Brando.'The Godfather: Part II' is certainly an impressive achievement, but it doesn't quite manage to equal its predecessor. Whereas the original film achieved the bulk of its emotional power through the transformation of its central character, 'Part II' leaves Michael hopelessly stranded in his despair, portraying neither his rise nor his downfall. Having effectively sold his soul for the family in the previous film, Michael must now come to terms with his desolation, alone in his misery, and having long forsaken any opportunity for salvation. He concludes the film still at the height of organised crime in America, and yet receives no reassurance from his position of power. Michael is alone, a dejected and self-loathing soul, without comfort from the family he helped destroy. It's a haunting ending that will remain with you for hours afterwards, but nevertheless doesn't seem like a conclusive ending to the entire Corleone saga. Fortunately, Coppola returned sixteen years later to direct 'The Godfather: Part III (1990),' which charts, I believe, Michael Corleone's inevitable downfall. Hopefully I won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "Moving through the deep shadows and heavy glooms of his vast estate, Michael Corleone presides over the destruction of his own spirit in \"The Godfather, Part II.\" The character we recall from \"The Godfather\" as the best and brightest of Don Vito's sons, the one who went to college and enlisted in the Marines, grows into a cold and ruthless man, obsessed with power. The film's closing scenes give us first a memory of a long-ago family dinner, and then Michael at mid-life, cruel, closed, and lonely. He's clearly intended as a tragic figure. The Corleone saga, as painted by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo in two films totaling nearly seven hours, has been a sort of success story in reverse. In a crazy way, \"The Godfather\" and its sequel belong in the same category with those other epics of immigrant achievement in America, \"The Emigrants\" and \"The New Land.\" The Corleone family worked hard, was ambitious, remembered friends, never forgave disloyalty, and started from humble beginnings to become the most powerful Mafia organization in the country. Coppola seems to hold a certain ambivalence toward his material. Don Vito Corleone as portrayed by Marlon Brando in \"The Godfather\" was a man of honor and dignity, and it was difficult not to sympathize with him, playing with his grandchild in the garden, at peace after a long lifetime of murder, extortion, and the rackets. What exactly were we supposed to think about him? How did Coppola feel toward the Godfather? The flashbacks give Coppola the greatest difficulty in maintaining his pace and narrative force. The story of Michael, told chronologically and without the other material, would have had really substantial impact, but Coppola prevents our complete involvement by breaking the tension. The flashbacks to New York in the early 1900s have a different, a nostalgic tone, and the audience has to keep shifting gears.",

We got to know the family, the business, the violence.In 1974, Francis Ford Coppola does a sequel. And it's just as brilliant as the original.I'm writing this in 2003 which will definately go down in film history as \"The Year of the Sequels\" and not one of those will come near this rare occurance of an epic of a saga. The real term here is \"saga\".I got the feeling watching that \"The Godfather part two\" was NOT done for \"sequel's\" sake. It was done to complete a story, to answer questions and to get into your mind as to why things turned out for these folks the they way they did. Some things in the Godfather part two you never saw coming. That is the mark of good filmmaking...keeping you on your toes. A few things you KNEW were coming, you may have been upset to see why, but you watch to see HOW it will unfold.The Godfather part 2 gives you history about Vito and at the same time shows you how his youngest son Michael is taking hold. You're interested in both..watching the past and present unfold and realizing HOW their futures entwine. A rare film making experience.And even rarer than that, The Godfather part one is chosen best film of 1972, the Godfather part two is chosen best film of 1974. Both, deservingly so.I got to see The Godfather part 2 as a salute to Francis Ford Coppola on the Los Angeles based \"Z\" channel immediately following The Godfather part one. The only other film I sat this long through mesmerized and thrilled with at that time was \"Fanny and Alexander\"... and when you're young, its HARD to sit still.The Godfather Part 2 is a rare film indeed, another to include in the top 25 of all time.",

            "content": "Both a prequel and a sequel to \"The Godfather\", this film tells parallel stories in different time periods. The early one takes place in the early 1900s when Vito Corleone escapes a traumatic childhood in Sicily and becomes part of the crime scene in New York City . The later story in the 1950s has Vito's son Michael taking over the family's business of organized crime.As both crime drama and family drama, this film earns high marks in both categories. The later story includes a patriarch who is so ruthless and power-hungry that it would normally be tempting to despise him and those around him. Yet, the skillful directing by Francis Ford Coppola successfully tricks the audience into showing great interest to the clan almost to the point of sympathy.The later story is sometimes difficult to follow. It's extremely busy with many details and characters that are sometimes difficult to follow and remember. Luckily, the earlier story is straightforward. Each story is enhanced with differing styles of photography by the very talented Gordon Willis. The music of Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola is also beautiful.Despite the mentioned flaw, this film has so much talent involved that it ends up as a memorable experience even after multiple viewings. The supporting cast members John Cazale, Michael Gazzo, Lee Strasberg, and Talia Shire all have at least one scene that gives them a chance to shine. As Vito, Robert DeNiro shows greatness in the role that brought him to fame. But the highlight of the cast is Al Pacino as Michael who personifies the worst side of humanity in subtle ways especially in two scenes. In one, where he has a serious confrontation with his wife, his still face can't fully betray his anger as his jaw shakes. In another scene, he is viewed from a distance behind a glass screen door. Even at a distance, his silent pose conveys soullessness and evil.Coppola's directing is at its best in crowd scenes, particularly a street festival in the earlier story where a murder is being planned; and a New Year's Eve party in Havana in the later story. Overall, \"The Godfather Part II\" has aged very well.RATING: 9 out of 10Outstanding Achievements:Directing by Francis Ford CoppolaActing by Al Pacino",

And on its own, this one is just no match for part one. It's good; we have flawless production values and cinematography. Jumping between past and present works and mix of locations (wintry family residence and tropical Cuba) helps. But the major drawbacks are: 1. Its length. 2. Its stretched-out storytelling and protraction of many scenes, which made my attention and interest drop considerably. It is simply too draggy and meandering. I just FEEL so much more watching part one, because it cuts more to the chase - tighter, darker and deeper. This one seems made to sprawl - but stalls a bit too often.However, some of the characters develop nicely (more depth from both Keaton, Cazale and Shire) , and the family heritage is cemented every time we move to Vito Corleone's younger days. Make no mistake, it's fine, solid and an indispensable part of the whole saga, but sorry folks - it's no masterpiece to me. 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",

            "content": "As the name would suggest, Godfather Part 2 is the sequel to Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather film. This film is an extreme rarity because it divides feelings; some people have suggested that this sequel is actually better than the first film (which doesn't really happen often for sequels), while other die-hard fans would argue that a sequel could never out-rate an original.Godfather 2 could actually be split into 2 separate films, both showing separate events, in different times, with only a family name and blood being the connecting factor. One film is a rewind to a time already gone - a young Vito Corleone (the Godfather in the first film - played here by Robert De Niro). The other film; living in the present but with stark teachings of the past coming into fruition.It's been 7 years since the events of the first film, and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) attempts to expand and develop the family business as the head of the Corleone Mafia family - looking to get a toehold in Las Vegas and Cuba. Woven into this we also get to see a young Vito Coleone in flashbacks as he comes from Sicily to America and makes a new life for himself. The film uses these two stories to show similarities and contrast between father and son, separated by 30-40 odd years. This film is a masterpiece in storytelling, expanding on a world we've been introduced to via the first film, and moving forward with sublime character development and a complete story. Throw in a 'who-done-it' for Michael to solve (trying to find the mole in 'the family'), as well as the stresses he has to deal with from domestic family life and there is an awful lot going on.It could probably be argued that rather than being a sequel, this is a follow on. Coppola expands on the groundwork laid out in the first film - it's not a whole new adventure, more the next chapter in a story that we, the audience, have been tantalized with in the first film. Like the first film, it's not just a film about crime and mafia; it's as much a film about a man's struggle to live in the world that life has dealt him. It is brilliantly climaxed as we see Michael, alone in his own compound at the end of the film, like he's strapped in his own head dealing with the thoughts and plots going on - playing a mental game of chess with himself in order to stay one step ahead of his real life enemies.Pacino and De Niro are both fantastic in their respective roles, and the supporting cast is brilliant. There is plenty going on, and in some instances it's what you don't see which is as important as what is explained to you.I love this film, I have no issue with awarding this 10 out of 10 the same as I gave the first Godfather film.",

Indeed, there is little that rivals these two films in opulence or production scale.Coppola doesn't shy away from trying new things. Michael Corleone's story-arc is more realistic, more ambitious than anything in the first film. The scale of crime is upgraded. And I had never expected to see that scene between Michael & Kay, where she tells him of her departure, \"because of this 2000-year-old Sicilian thing.\" Vito Corleone's backstory follows the earlier, more conventional combination of style and myth. Actually, Coppola makes Vito's arc too obvious, as though he's following a checklist. But again its very tastefully done, so you enjoy it.I guess what this film lacks is a simpler plot and the phenomenal pacing of the first film. Also missing is the magisterial presence of a certain Marlon Brando. It is easier to appreciate this film when you place it together with the first, as one single epic of the rise of one Mafia generation, followed by the decline of another.",

            "content": "The Godfather II is not nearly as good as Godfather I, even tho some intelligence and good acting went in.  After the Godfather I, and Michael's evolution is complete, who needs a sequel about unsavory characters so much? The Godfather I, led by Vito and Sonny, had elements that provided for great entertainment and made you less bothered by the evil and sleaze (temporarily).  Michael pales as an imposing figure next to Vito, and altho Al Pacino is a good actor, I just get tired of watching Michael too much--I was even getting a little tired of him at the end of Godfather I.  In other words, I think the disadvantage sequels have of becoming-tiresome subject matter are more present, not less, here.  The end of Godfather II, with Michael staring out morosely into the water from a chair, symbolizes the decadence of the story and the corrupt characters, especially Michael himself.  I think more toward a pathetic character than a tragic one, despite some of the events he had to endure.   And what is the point of Kay's back and forth moral concerns if she is staying with him?   And wasn't that \"abortion\" blowup scene (natch, male child) so moving?  Not to me.The main story here is somewhat convoluted and disorganized, so when the flashbacks are inserted the confusion gets worse.  We have sordid characters (Hyman Roth etc.) who do not particularly entertain me on a movie screen, and the depressing figures of Fredo (geez, isn't he such a compelling character) and Connie.  This is a precursor to a lot of post mid-70s movies in which the plot is overcomplicated and not crisp and the characters sleazy and unappealing--in movies like this, I would like the characters to be less dwelled on and the action to rule.On the other hand, there is reason to be somewhat interested in the development of Vito and the flashbacks of the family.  Robert DeNiro does a good job as Vito, and the screenplay is thoughtful, but ultimately the main story dominates.  Yes, it is true, modern movies are less uplifting than ones preceding the mid-60s, but in spite of the many elements that some people complain about--violence, corruption, sex, pomposity, ridiculously overdone and confusing special effects--there are often some redeeming or uplifting features.  Certainly none here, and this film is depressing and sometimes boring, in spite of some good individual scenes and substance here and there to the story and characters.  To each his own--I can see why some people like this movie more than I do, but I really do not think it belongs on a pedestal either.",

            "review_title": "The Best Sequel, Prequel, and Movie Ever Made",
            "content": "Normally, movie sequels aren't very good. They are usually just rushed cash-grabs to make money off of a successful property, but occasionally they can be just as good, if not better, than the original film, as rare as this is. (\"The Empire Strikes Back,\" \"Terminator 2,\" \"Aliens,\" \"The Dark Knight,\" and \"Spider-Man 2\" are examples of these.) Prequels are not so different, and are even harder to pull off. So, normally, the 1974 follow-up to Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece \"The Godfather\" would have a lot to do in order to top the original. But, despite this, \"The Godfather Part II,\" is, in my opinion, not only better than the original, but also the best movie of all time. (I take back what I said in my review of the original about it being the best ever made, I hadn't seen this one yet.)\"The Godfather Part II\" is actually two films in one. Expertly presenting two story lines, one sequel and one prequel to the original, half of the film follows late-1950s Michael Corleone, now as the head of the Corleone crime family, expanding his power and picking off his enemies, becoming less and less like the man at the beginning of the previous film. The other half follows his father, Vito, in 1920s New York as he creates the empire that later gets passed down to Michael. Both stand out on their own, but the two story lines, brilliantly put together, create a masterpiece that is yet to be matched.Like the first movie, the best element of this movie is the acting. Al Pacino returns as Michael, in what is undoubtedly his best performance of the two films. (I can't say the best of his career, because these two are the only movies of his I have seen. Sorry, \"Scarface\" fans.) He is perfect as a man who, through gaining power, loses his humanity. If you have read my review for \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" you'll remember I named some performances that would be on a list of the Top 10 Best Movie Performances. I have no doubts that Pacino in this film would be right on there.Before watching this, I had doubts as to how the movie would make do without screen legend Marlon Brando, as his character is twenty-five years younger, and so played by Robert De Niro. (I haven't yet seen \"Taxi Driver\" or \"Raging Bull.\") But after watching it, I feel that he is just as good, and he really deserved his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor. He is so good that I can't decide who did a better job, him or Brando. Good thing he wasn't cast in the first film, otherwise the world wouldn't have this terrific performance.Although Pacino and De Niro are the highlights in this movie's cast, the others are excellent as well. Robert Duvall as Michael's stepbrother, Tom Hagen, really sells his conflicted loyalty/fear of his changing stepbrother. Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, a man who Michael is trying to kill, is excellent. Diane Keaton as Kay, Michael's wife, really shows how she is frightened at what he has now become. And, of course, there is John Cazale as Michael's brother Fredo, the weakling who tries to be stronger than everyone says,but things don't go according to plan. (I won't go into specifics.)Just like the first film, another great aspect is the script. Doing one story line would be hard enough, but the fact that the movie does both so well, so flawlessly, is just amazing. It reintroduces the characters we already know, and take them to further places and develop them more, and also introduces more. It features parallels to the first movie, with similar scenes that show how things have changed. This installment also feels more epic than the first one, as things get bigger and darker.The film is also marvelous in its technical aspects as well. The score by Nino Rota, once again, is beautifully haunting, and even better than in the previous film. The cinematography by Gordon Willis continues to shine. (Even though, ironically, he himself has regretted some scenes that he felt were too dark.) The production design is fantastic, and it helps with the epic scope I mentioned previously. The violence is more realistic, and somewhat more graphic, which gives it a better impact. The editing is also good, as the two story lines are connected beautifully. If I have one problem with the movie, it is that it is slower than the previous film, as it's longer by twenty-five minutes, and 3.3 hours makes for a pretty long movie. But, taking into account how brilliant the rest of the movie is, that can be forgiven.This film is so amazing, it astonishes on every level. I may have been disappointed that the first film only won three Oscars, but fortunately this one managed to get six, including a second Best Picture, which were all well deserved. (I have no idea how Pacino didn't get Best Actor, but, according to \"Some Like It Hot,\" \"Nobody's perfect.\") Clearly topping the original, \"The Godfather Part II\" is the Best Film of All Time, so of course, I have to give it a 10/10 rating.",

Although i would not consider De Niro's performance to be the greatest of his career as i think he achieved even more in his portrayals of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver and Jake La Motta in Raging Bull; for me this is Pacino at his best. The camera work in the flashback sequences chronicling the early life of Vito is stunning and would make you think you are looking at a picture from the twenties. There is obviously a lot of debate as to which is the better film, this or its predecessor, but i consider this to be superior as it holds the viewers attention more. An absolute Classic. 10/10",

            "content": "It's hard to give an objective review when you are dealing with favourite movies. Having just watched this for the first time in years I was delighted to see it was as magnificent as I remembered it. Francis Ford Coppola would have been sensible to be wary of doing a sequel when he'd just made a film as acclaimed as The Godfather. How do you follow that? Amazingly he managed to broaden the themes of the original, producing a study of power and corruption that may be unequalled in Hollywood history. And whereas some critics found the first film questionable in its moral compass (is Michael supposed to be a hero?) the sequel leaves us in no doubt that he has passed on into something else and as his wife Kay shrewdly notices, there is no coming back. Judge the film on its own merits and ignore the continuation of the saga in Part III. This is the final Michael as we should always remember him.The scope of Part II is extraordinary (as if the first film wasn't bold enough!) with the story of father Vito in 1920s New York cross- cut with son Michael's rivalry with ageing mobster Hymen Roth, a respected, though never trusted, business partner of his father. These later sequences may not make sense on first viewing but there are some remarkable set pieces from revolutionary Cuba to a Senate committee in Washington. This is a no holds barred portrait of American society corrupt and hypocritical from top to bottom. How often has Hollywood been so daringThe film invites a contrast between father and son, with young family man Vito embracing criminality out of necessity and using his status to become a 'Godfather' in the Italian American community. Meanwhile in his middle age Michael has become a Don hooked on vengeance with all business now personal. The inevitable conclusion of which is a violent crescendo with him not just wiping out his enemies (again) but committing the far worse sin of betraying his own family. Few films can have gathered such a fine cast. Al Pacino's Michael is the symbol of idealism turned sour in extremis. More than anything this is what elevates The Godfather over so many other gangster films. He's not just some Goodfella or ordinary guy, he once aspired to be a great man but somewhere something went wrong. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen is the great constant across the two films, always at the side, never changing, but in his reaction to the transformation of Michael we get confirmation of his moral decline. Diane Keaton as Kay has a meatier role this time and as the voice of 'respectable' America shows the futility of Michael's actions. If he can't keep his family together, what's it all for? John Cazale's Fredo is a tragedy of his own. Secretly resentful of his younger brother, their mutual betrayal becomes one of the emotional cores of the saga. Replacing the character of Clemenza proved relatively easy as even if the story loses something, Michael V. Gazzo was memorable whilst the legendary Lee Strasborg is a suitably cast as rival/partner and pretend Uncle to Michael Hymen Roth, delivering one of the movies' great speeches.So often artists seem burdened by great achievements, but not here. One can only assume that the young Coppola was so exulted by the critical and commercial phenomenon of The Godfather, he felt capable of anything and judging by this, he near enough was. One only wonders why he's largely struggled to reach similar heights ever since.",

Observe where Michael Corleone begins and where he ends: he begins as the idealistic war hero, refusing to get involved in the family business, but he is quickly engulfed by circumstance and slowly transforms into a cold and ruthless underworld boss. The recurring theme of solitude is persistent throughout the film. Michael trusts nobody, and his instinct is ultimately proved correct when he learns Fredo has betrayed him. In the end, he is completely alone. He has destroyed his marriage, he has alienated his consiglierie, and he has murdered his brother. From this perspective, the story of the Godfather is a classic tragedy. The final shot solidifies this notion, showing Michael sitting alone, reflecting on his life. By trying to protect his family, Michael has destroyed it.",

This work would make even Mario Puzo himself proud.Found the duality between father and son poetic. Great way to show how Don Vito and Michael forged their own paths with different motivations. Every character had their own motivations that were understandable and believable. Not to mention the conniving Hyman Roth being an excellent villain. The ending was especially chilling as both protagonists were worlds apart when they achieved the same goal... solidifying their power.Justice was also done to make the film feel like the eras portrayed. It felt as if I was seeing real scenes of 1920 Italian New York slums and the rise of Las Vegas in the 1950s. Beautiful.The only problem I had with The Godfather: Part II was how Robert De Niro looked nothing like Don Vito. Should I hold that against him? Definitely not considering his stellar performance.5/5. A must-watch for lovers of the Godfather or good films in general.",

Vito's story involves his early start in the business after he is forced into the US from Italy as a child. The two stories are told in a parallel fashion.

Not only to be recognized as one the best sequel ever, but to even top the original is a master Accomplishment even for back then. The Godfather part II continues the story of the Corleone Family. Michael Corleone( Al Pacino) tries to expanded his family empire only to come to gripes with the hardship of what it really means to be the Godfather. While the other half of the film as he reflects. We see the life and coming of age of his father Vito(Robert De Niro) as a criminal. The first movie became a sensation for its gripping story telling and very Romantic yet realistic tone. It's sequel captures all that in every way as Michael evolution and complexity of his character descend deeper. Al Pacino captured the essence of this man you has descend deep in this dehumanizing manner here. It's completely shows that this is not at all the same Michael you knew from the first film. He a completely different person and who reach that point where he will make those unforgiven decisions. You see how he he sort of reach that point with his business and his family. The scene of his father serve as a way a self reflection in a way. How would my father deal with this? He doesn't have that same tier status as his old man did. He's not as respected and feared the same way. As for Vito scenes they were a excellent touches to not only Michael's character, but also Vito. Where's the first film While marlon Brando killed his role and made Don Corleone Iconic. The first film you didn't really know anything about him, but he still had the honorable crime lord feeling to him. Here you actually do get some pieces of what the kind of man he was in his youth and they also a relevant with Michael journey. Not much to say about De Niro he was perfect casting having the voice and mannerism down of Brando it felt believable that this it the same man in his youth. The Tone is still dramatic and investing with death, scandal and betrayal. Nino Rota returned again for the soundtrack and it's just as somber and classy as the first and accompany the scene lighting and tone nicely.",

            "content": "Everyone has probably heard that \"The Godfather: Part II\" is as good as the original, and it's true. Perhaps it's better, that's debatable. Picking up where the first film left off, we see the Corleones' control over Las Vegas. Also, Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), one of his father's former cohorts. Meanwhile, in flashbacks, we see young Vito Andolini immigrate from the town of Corleone, Sicily, to New York City in the early 20th century. As he ages (the adult Vito is played by Robert DeNiro), Vito becomes increasingly involved in Mafia business.The climax (at least in my opinion, it was the climax) happens in Cuba on New Year's Eve in 1958. You may recall that the Mafia helped prop up Fulgencio Batista and his reign of terror. Anyway, while Michael and Fredo (John Cazale) are at a party at the Presidential Palace, Michael angrily yells at Fredo \"I know it was you, Fredo! You broke my heart!\" At that moment, just as it turns into 1959, the revolutionary forces enter Havana, proclaiming the revolution's victory. The combination of these two events shows that things won't be the same anymore, whether in the Corleone family or in Cuba. To be certain, Kay (Diane Keaton) has some unexpected news for Michael when he returns home.The point is, this movie disproves the notion that all sequels suck. This sequel is a masterpiece, with splendid performances by Pacino, Keaton, DeNiro, Cazale, Strasberg, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire. But of course, most of all, this movie's superbness owes to director Francis Ford Coppola. He knows exactly how to make a movie, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 10/10.",

            "content": "A good sequel should do two things: continue the story of the original, but also be a story in its own right. Most sequels try this and fail - sometimes it's made because of the financial success of the first film, and the studio wants to cash in; sometimes it's because the first film said everything that needed to be said and the original idea's been thinly exploited. Often, it's a mixture of both. The Godfather: Part II is a rare example of a sequel having the same power as the first, expanding the world we already know, adding context to things we've already seen, but also telling us a story (well, two actually) that can, proudly and confidently, stand on its own. In fact, it's almost unfair to label this film a sequel given the slightly negative connotations of the word, because it scarcely gets done this well. It's another work of art from Francis Ford Coppola.The debate rages on amongst film fans - which Godfather film is the best? Well, it's not the third, although there are moments of brilliance in it, and it could well be the second (filmically, it might just clinch it), but for my money it's the first. That's not to detract from the achievement of this film, it's just personal preference, and I've rated it a ten so it's clear how highly I admire it. There's really not a lot in it.The cinematography in Part II is stunning, some of the very best I've seen in a film, and possibly the Academy's greatest failure (in its entire history) is the lack of nomination here for Gordon Willis. Fredo, underused in the first, is also given more to do in the second film - he becomes an integral part of the story and we also get to understand what makes him tick. The scene, my favourite in the film, where he finally lets rip at Michael, following his discovery that Fredo's the family traitor, is staggeringly good - years of resentment comes pouring out of him after being passed over for his younger brother. Another Academy Award failure - where was John Cazale's nomination? Diane Keaton, too, as Kay, for me a character so integral to the whole saga, when she tells Michael the miscarriage she suffered wasn't that at all, it was an abortion. The fear and sadness in her eyes, knowing he'd hate her for it (spoiler: he does), but the absolute conviction in her decision, makes it another hugely underrated performance in the film, and in her career. De Niro as the young Vito, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, Pacino again as Michael - all great work. The music too, again, is haunting and operatic, adding so much. There really is so much to love about this film.But, for me, the thing that puts the second just slightly below the first is the journey of Michael as a character. The first film took him from being the vulnerable war hero who had shunned the family business, by all accounts a good man, all the way to Mafia kingpin who ordered the deaths of those who tried to destroy his family. In Part II, he does the unthinkable (poor Fredo), but he starts off as a man warped by his own importance and hell bent on protecting his family, and he ends the film that way too - even though, as it turns out, the thing his family might need protection from is Michael himself (poor Fredo!). It's a small thing, and the character does subtly change in the second film, but the journey of Michael in the first is what made it so fascinating and captivating to watch. It's also, the second film, just a tad too long and the story's slightly harder to follow.It's a work of art, though. No doubt. And it delivers a gut punch in the final few minutes that's become one of the greatest and most shocking endings in film history. Poor, poor Fredo...",

He does an incredible job of conveying a man turning into a ruthless monster, and the comparison to a Roman Emperor made in the film is both very symbolic and intimidating, much like his performance.Overall, the rest of the actors do an incredible job as well and the script is simply amazing.I wouldn't say you could or should watch this without the original, since it's both a fantastic film and this one really builds on the plot already established, but the second film is by far superior.The Godfather saga ended here for many years, and, quite frankly, should have ended here; it was the perfect conclusion, and less said about the third film, the better.

This film is a true masterpiece. Here's why.The story is as good as the original, this time the film has two separate story lines: Vito Corleone as a Young man and Michael Corleone's storyline. Vito Corleone's story follows his life as he evacuates from New York and to Italy by his parents in 1910 and goes through his normal day life, and Michael Corleone's story follows him being accused for being a criminal by the Law after being framed by his Brother during a celebration when another criminal did the illegal Activity that happen in the celebration and Michael goes through Family life and has a divorce With his wife and all that stuff and must prove that he isn't guilty of the actions caused by a another person.The film's direction is one of the biggest strengths of this film, it's switch between Vito and Michael is done in a good pace and well choreographed camera transitions makes this film direction nearly a masterpiece. The performances especially once again Al Pacino is so good, it deserved an Oscar for best performance, for a reason, Pacino's character is so emotional, you really care for him in the scenes With his wife. Oustanding i must say.The film, despite being a serious drama, has some funny moments, like where one of the characters gives Vito Money and continuously regrets it, now that was funny, but the film really is quite serious apart from that one scene, that's why the change of pace makes this quite comforting of a Movie.The characters are better and the film is longer, The Godfather Part 2 is one of the best films i've ever seen, Performances, humor, drama, direction, Music and characters are great, there is nothing terrible With this Movie.

In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.",

We have already witnessed Michael's incredible transformation from \"civilian\" war hero into hard-as-steel overboss in the original, and this makes his character less interesting to me.

This film tells two stories of the Corleones, it tells the current events of the new Godfather, Michael Corleone, and the story of young Vito Corleone. BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino is brilliant at being a villain, the worst thing he did as the character was to kill his own brother. But it's Oscar and BAFTA winning Robert DeNiro as young Vito that's my favourite of the whole film, because he is very good at impersonating Brando, and being just as mean as him. He is just as good at being the Godfather as the late, great Marlon Brando was. Also starring Diane Keaton as Kay Corleone, John Cazale as Fredo Corleone, Oscar nominated Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Oscar nominated Michael V. Gazzo as Frankie Pentangeli. A lot more interesting and complex than the first, a masterpiece sequel, I only wish it was left here and there was no third film.

            "content": "I have an earlier review of this movie posted somewhere on this site in which I pretty much deconstruct it and its status as a \"classic sequel\" and even \"a great movie.\" A handful of great scenes populate it, to be sure, and a spate of fine performances (particularly a toweringly great one from Pacino), but nothing that coheres into greatness - particularly as it's at the service of a turgid and convoluted plot.All of which I more or less stand by - at least as it befits my own taste and predilections. But I recently had some insight into why this sequel may be so well-respected: in its very dourness and lack of fire, it paints the unremittingly grim portrait of Mafia life that many apparently felt was missing from the first Godfather. I recently showed that movie to a group of my friends who had never seen it before (amazing in this day and age, no?) and they all enjoyed it - but, to a man, they felt that it definitely glorified and mythologized the violence it showed and the lifestyle it portrayed. Personally, I have a hard time seeing this - and, pay attention, because I believe here lies the discrepancy between the people who love the sequel and those who don't. On the most simplistic level, if you feel the first film glorifies the Mob - and feel at least slightly cheated because of it - you will most likely have an appreciation for the second film. If you feel, like I do, that the first movie sucks you into associating and sympathizing (hell, even *loving*!) these characters, but that the violence brings everything all back home and reminds you the evil and corruption which undergirds their way of life - then the second movie, though having perhaps some interesting elaborations upon this theme, offers nothing genuinely new. And is, therefore - despite all the evident care and superb craft involved - kind of a waste of time.But, since the violence and worldview depicted in The Godfather is such a polarizing issue, I suppose it was a good idea that Francis Coppola decided to have another go at it, ramming down his point for all those who didn't get it the first time: \"The Mob is BAD, it CORRUPTS YOUR SOUL, and NO GOOD CAN COME OF IT!\" These are good points to be made, and perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss them. I had just thought, previously, that . . . well, they're obvious (or should be, anyway - and anyone to whom they're not obvious is probably beyond all hope) and that the director had already made them once. Clearly, not everyone feels The Godfather makes those points cogently enough (as my friend says about the end of the first movie: \"Sure, Michael is cold, ruthless and lies to his wife - but DAMN, he's just the *man*!\"). For those people, The Godfather Part II exists, and that's fine. I'll never speak ill of the movie again.Except for those flashback scenes - those are still terrible! Either they should form a completely different movie unto themselves, or they should be cut out entirely (watching the second film as part of \"The Godfather Saga\", where these flashbacks have been excised, is infinitely more rewarding to me). I still don't know what function they serve - if anything, they seem a throwback to the preciousness and romanticism of the first film, except far worse, in my opinion. But no one seems to agree with me, so I'll stop beating the tune on that one . . .But as long as I'm here and have got this movie in my sights for a second time (and am inclined to dwell on its strengths rather than its faults), let me just expand upon what I said earlier about the acting: the film is a veritable master's class in great acting, coming in all shapes and varieties. The coiled intensity of Pacino is complemented by an equally quiet yet forceful turn by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen (whose work in both Godfathers is some of the greatest, yet most unsung, in cinema history). Lee Strasberg does wonderful things with the Hyman Roth character, adding new layers and shadings in every scene, and his soliloquy to Michael about Moe Greene is as dead-on perfect as anything can be in this world. Similarly, Michael Gazzo takes a seemingly annoying and one-note character (Pentangeli) and works in so much depth and humanity, that at the end he's one of your favorite people in the entire Godfather story (doubly amazing, since he didn't have any automatic goodwill from the audience by being a carryover from the first film). The quiet scene between he and Duvall near the end is, in some ways, the most shocking, cold-hearted and violent of the whole series - and not one weapon is drawn, the two speaking in pleasantries the entire time, barely above a murmur. This, folks, is great acting - as well as sophisticated writing, all topped off by a director who has total confidence in the audience to get it, without his having to exaggerate or accentuate a thing. This is, simply, peerless moviemaking.Such peerlessness exists, for me, in doses rather than all the way through in The Godfather Part II. But to extrapolate from this that the film is somehow worthless is a mistake - one I must apologize for. Though I still stand by my assessment that, for me anyway, the second Godfather is largely \"unnecessary\", I am more aware and sympathetic to the larger purpose it serves for a good deal of the audience. And, necessary or not, it still has on show some absolutely top-notch cinema acting, writing and directing. Maybe it, unlike the first one, is an offer I *can* refuse, but having once accepted it, I'm there for the duration.",

Pacino fails to deliver to gravitas that Brando had, and we are treated to one mundane scene after another where people are discussing carpets and spouting inane cliched tripe. There's no drama of note, and quite frankly a half hour into this the dialogue was wearing very thin. A lot of the scenes were rehashed from the first movie done ineffectively and unoriginally. The 9 rating is definitely confounding to me because as a fan of the mobster genre this rang not only unbelievable but absurd in many cases. Not going to waste much more time here as clearly the 10 after 10 after 10 star rating will untimately rule the day. I had to double check to see that FFC actually directed this one, because honestly it didn't seem to me that the same person that directed the original Godfather could handle the sequel in such a clumsy way. I thought he would have treated it in a much more dignified and competent manner. The film looks good, sure. How could it not? The soundtrack was off to me, though. The live show scenes, because this is Vegas, were downright lousy and annoying. Not worthy of the praise heaped upon it at all. Watch the original again or Good Fellas. They're at least original. Also, WAY too long. I'm not even sure where the 5 stars are coming from.....",

            "content": "Mario Puzo's epic \"The Godfather\" novel, has gone on to set high standards in both literature and cinema. Considering how the first one had managed to encapsulate so very well it's \"Welcome to the Family\" ideology. It gives the sequel a chance to now stand on its own two feet, without the necessities of an origin story.Well it actually turns out we need those origin chapters more than ever. We are shown the past of how Vito Corleone, became the Don, in contrast of his son Micheal (Al Pacino). Usually watching any flashback sequence in a movie feels so hard for me to get into, it happens so abruptly it feels less like an aid to the story but more of a throw in. Francis Ford Coppola's execution is genius, because watching Vito's upbringing is shown and depicted perfectly with the \"Sepia\" feel, murky streets of little Italy and a Oscar winning performance from a then unknown Robert De Niro. Seeing this perfectly executed with Michael's story in comparison, it just instantly draws us in so well there's not many other films that do it this well.Following the \"current events\" of the movie. Michael is slowly growing distant from the family, and ultimately paranoia is settling in without help from the older, weaker brother Fredo (A truly incredible performance from the late John Cazale). By the time things escalate towards the end of the film, the family is ultimately destroyed. Michael has officially isolated himself from both his own family and the other families, leaving him quiet and reminiscing. It is here we ask: \"Do we see Micheal as a man with a blood lust, or a tragic soul\"? Your choice. \"The Godfather Part II\" is a stunning sequel, feeling more like a 7 hour long epic rather than a trilogy. But if you loved the first movie, I would not be hesitant to watch this one. It is one of Coppola's finest pieces of writing and cinematography .Final Verdict: The American dream is continuously turned on its head, in this more than perfect sequel. 10/10.",

It keeps all of the high quality acting and screenwriting and throws us a curveball by intertwining the continued story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) with the early story of his father, Vito (Robert De Niro). Unfortunately, Marlon Brando does not make an appearance in this film.The great thing about this film is that it gives us a dichotomy of the father's rise and the son's fall. Showing parallel stories but also showing the stark differences between Vito's altruism and sense of justice and Michael's ruthlessness and lust for revenge. It's a marvelous movie that really opens up a lot of room for interpretation on its portrayals of organized crime, family, and the American dream. This is one of the must watch films.",

            "content": "Although this is a great movie, it is logically flawed, and in such a way that once grasped, it is impossible to ignore. Early in the movie, Michael walks into his bedroom, where Kay is sleeping. She wakes up and asks him why the drapes are open. He looks around at the open drapes, apparently sees something outside, and drops to the floor as machine gun bullets riddle the bedroom. The compound is sealed off, and Michael gives orders that the gunmen be taken alive, but they are found shot dead shortly thereafter.Michael tells Tom Hagen that there is a traitor in the family, and so he is turning power over to him while he, Michael, disappears for a while. Though Tom is only an adopted brother (and not Sicilian), and though Fredo is Michael's older brother, yet he does not turn temporary control over to Fredo because \"he is weak and stupid.\" So far, so good.But Fredo turns out to be the traitor in the family. Does that mean he is the one who opened the drapes in the bedroom while Kay was sleeping? And does that also mean that Fredo was the one who executed the two hit men before they could talk? If he did all that, I am ready to believe that he was the one who set up his father Vito for the hit in the first \"Godfather\" movie. But given his character, we cannot believe Fredo did any of these things.But in that case, what was it that Fredo did that was so bad? Fredo says that Johnny Ola enlisted his aid because Michael was being tough in the negotiations about Cuba. So what does that mean, that occasionally Fredo was supposed to say to Michael, \"Don't you think you're being a little tough in the negotiations\"? For that he deserves death?Furthermore, the person who did open the curtains and executed the hit men is the real traitor in the family. There are plenty on the compound who might have done that, and that person, whoever he is, is still a threat to Michael. But Michael seems to be oblivious to this obvious implication.",

Vito's story could stand alone from Michael's, but both compliment the other in ways that cannot be described. Scenes end on cliffhangers. When one starts, we want to be back with the other. The Corleone family is corrupt, and Part II just shows how deep their roots run. This second act is more intense, more involving, incredibly climactic, leaving it's audience wanting more.

These are hollow, morally void movies. So what the godfather was a \"family man\" that justifies his brutality? Just like people's attachment to the Godfather in the first movie because he didn't want to get into drugs and showed \"loyalty\" to his family (so long as he was king). You cannot sugar coat depravity and thuggery. They are what they are, pathetic and empty excuses for criminal behavior. Maybe people's lives are so boring they become mentally disturbed? I don't know, I am simply trying to rationalize this behavior. Idolizing criminals who get weak-minded people to fear them and then pretend themselves to be \"emperors\" among their \"subjects\" is downright pathetic. I suspect people pretend in their own minds to have this control over others, this fake respect and false sense of self-worth.This is how I imagine they envision it,\"Hey look I'm a dumb Sicilian who says stupid phrases with double meanings and then brutally murders others. But it is OK because everything is about the fake \"family\" not the narcissistic personality disorder. Play some crappy music from the old country and drink some bad \"vino\". Make sure to speak in broken English gibberish with an Italian accent. Yes you too can be a loser thug.\"is your life this pathetic? Don't answer that (we know it is).All I wanted to see was Michael Corleone die and he never died. He just kept brooding on and on and on for 3 hours! For some reason Michael can just kill everyone he wants in the last five minutes of every movie yet no one can kill him? Apparently he always wears full body armor and drives around only in a tank? Yet in the movie he frequently goes all over the place in just a regular suit and car. How is this so? Maybe his magic fear aura just repels anyone who would ever think of killing him!The fans of these movies miss the obvious because they are so into Al Pacino brooding around posing for the camera and fantasizing of being the Godfather.What a waste of time.",

He is joined by a stellar supporting cast that includes Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. The main reason you would think this movie could not work out is because Marlon Brando could not be in it, but Robert De Niro manages to shine as a younger version of Vito Corleone, putting in an engrossing performance that is worthy to Brando's in every way, so much so that they are the only two actors to receive an Academy Award for portraying the same characters.

It deserved all the accolades it received for direction, cinematography, art direction and of course those wonderful performances by Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall and the rest of the cast. I think it's fair to say no one expected the sequel to outshine the original, but to many peoples' minds, somehow it did. It is even more intricate and expansive, presenting two stories at great length, one taking place before the first film and the other, continuing the first's narrative. 'The Godfather Part II' has been called both the greatest sequel of all time and the greatest American film, period. It was nominated for 11 Oscars. The 'sequel' part of the film concerns Michael Corleone's attempts to hold his family and its 'business' together after the death of Vito Corleone. Times are changing and he sees an opportunity to invest in Havana's casinos with the help of Hyman Roth, a former associate of his father's, and the pre-Castro, pro-business government in Cuba. The plot of 'Part II' is difficult to follow at times; there are double-crosses, and perceived double-crosses that really aren't, and it's hard to know who is sincere about what. The only thing that is certain is that everyone looks after their own interests and there is no hesitation in using murder as a final negotiating tool. Killings and attempted killings continue, but in this film, they are more methodical and cold-blooded. Toward the end, Tom Hagen even asks Michael Corleone if he feels the need to kill everyone. No, Michael says, just our enemies. But when one of those 'enemies' turns out to be his own brother, Fredo, it is clear that things have changed in the Corleone family, and not for the better. Francis Ford Coppola spoke of the inevitable decline in the Corleone family and it is very apparent, never more so than when Michael gives the order to have Fredo murdered. The 'prequel' segments are, by contrast, very simple and tell the story of how Vito Corleone arrived in America and began to build his empire. Robert DeNiro does not so much replace Marlon Brando as offer an interpretation of Corleone as a young man. There is wonderful period detail in these scenes; the tenement neighborhoods of the recently arrived Italians, living in their own section of New York, bits of broken English beginning to find their way into the mother tongue. It's all filmed in sepia-tinted color, which creates the feeling of a time passed, like looking at old photographs. Unlike the 1950's plot, the turn-of-the-century story is fairly cut-and-dried. Vito Corleone marries, starts a family, and begins a loose partnership with other young immigrants in what will eventually become the Corleone crime family. He kills the neighborhood crime boss, the one who collected protection money from all the local businesses, and effectively replaces him and the old way, becoming a more benevolent, friendlier version of the Black Hand, if no less lethal when the need arises. He even finds time to travel back to Sicily and visit revenge on the aged crime lord there who had murdered members of his family. 'The Godfather Part II' is filled with memorable performances, all of the continuing characters portrayed by the same actors as the first film. It is an epic undertaking and rewards repeated viewings with new detail unnoticed previously, not to mention better understanding of the labyrinth plot intrigues. It is also ultimately depressing, in a way the first movie wasn't. In spite of everything, the audience was pulling for the Corleone family to succeed and win out over its enemies in 'The Godfather;' I don't think that's the case at the end of 'The Godfather Part II.'",

If you retrace the steps of the storyline after you finish watching the film, they are not necessarily illogical but they do sit kind of loose in the plot. These plot points feel more like vehicles for specific dramatic scenes than a natural story. On the other hand, the story does provide some great historical perspective on the history of the mafia and also general commentary on certain social aspects of life.Everything else about this film was pretty good. It is understandable how this film reached its position as one of the top films of the last century.The acting is top notch. In fact, it is what serves as the main course and the desert. You do not go to Godfather movies for action; you go to them for the interaction between all these great actors. These shots are up close and personal, with strong dramatic shadows on characters' faces. The experience is sort of like eating a good steak, no salt or pepper needed.",

            "review_title": "A remarkable epic crime movie, utterly compelling as a sequel though it requires some knowledge of the previous movie to fully enjoy it.",
            "content": "The Godfather: Part II has the rare distinction of being a sequel that is equal to, possibly even greater than, its predecessor. Indeed, it is one of the finest films ever made, a gangster picture that manages to be epic in scope as well as length, showcasing a number of brilliant performances and proving that, for all the fancy special effects in the world, nothing beats a truly compelling story. The only thing to bear in mind is that The Godfather: Part II relies heavily on a knowledge of the previous film \u2013 it is not one of those follow-ups that can be watched out of sequence with any hope of grasping what is going on. 'Sequel' might be the wrong word actually, as the film is divided into two sections, one continuing the story of the Corleone crime family from where it left off at the end of Part I, the other acting as a turn-of- the-century prequel, showing the rise of Vito Corleone from orphaned Sicilian immigrant to powerful Mob boss. In effect, The Godfather: Part II is therefore a continuation of, and prequel to, the existing narrative dealt with in the original.Following the death of his father and older brother, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is the new head of his family's empire, based now in Nevada having moved out of New York several years earlier. Running the 'business' is taking its toll on the once-honest Michael \u2013 his relationship with wife Kay (Diane Keaton) is frosty and distant; his brother Fredo (John Cazale) is becoming more of a burden than ever; he must deal with rumblings of discontent from New York; and his pledge to legitimise the Corleone family is further than ever from becoming a reality. Following an unsuccessful assassination attempt, Michael puts consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) in charge of the family for a while, while he goes away to deal with some business matters and investigate who tried to have him killed. His adventures bring him into contact with Jewish gangster Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who may be Michael's ally or enemy. The story traces Michael's long descent into isolation and paranoia, alienating himself from everyone in his all- consuming quest to come out on top in this epic gangland-battle-of-wits. Interwoven into the story are a number of flashbacks showing the rise of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando's character from Part I, here portrayed by Robert De Niro). After arriving in New York a poor immigrant, Vito eventually finds honest work in a grocery store but is hounded out of his job by local gangster Don Fanucci (Gastone Moschin). Making ends meet through petty burglaries, he gradually rises up the criminal ranks, killing Fanucci and eventually becoming a feared and respected figure in the neighbourhood.Whereas The Godfather was criticised for glamorising violent crime and the Mafia, The Godfather: Part II shows things in a much uglier light. Families are torn apart by jealousy and betrayal; relationships are destroyed by the lack of communication; innocence is tarnished irrevocably. In short, the world seems somehow more rotten and corrupt in The Godfather: Part II. It's an altogether more ruthless film, harder-edged, shockingly authentic even. The performances are exemplary throughout. How Pacino didn't win the Best Actor Oscar of the year is beyond comprehension, creating as he does this incredible character whose grip on his empire comes at a terrible price. De Niro is excellent as the young Vito Corleone; Keaton fabulous as Michael's neglected wife; Duvall convincing as ever as the family lawyer; and Strasberg mesmerising as the slippery Hyman Roth, one of the truly great characters of gangster cinema. If it seems like in this review I have done nothing but shower superlatives upon this film, that's because I have. The Godfather: Part II is, quite simply, one of the greatest movies of all- time.",

It not only tells the ongoing story of Michael Corleone, but it also tells the story of his father's rise to being the Godfather.  Al Pacino superbly reprises his role of Michael, and Robert De Niro is, in one word, perfect as Vito Corleone.  Imagine not only learning your lines, but learning them in Italian, and all the while trying to sound like Marlon Brando.  If you can't imagine any one else besides Brando as Don Vito, just check out De Niro's brilliant, Oscar-winning performance.  This is a must-see for any film fan, and especially any fan of the first \"Godfather.\"  I actually know people who prefer this sequel to the already fantastic original.  I can't say enough about this movie.  My one piece of advice is see \"The Godfather: Part II.\"",

            "content": "This movie is about a struggle for power between two men: the pretentious upstart Michael Corleone, who is trying to establish his legitimacy as Godfather, and Hyman Roth, the most powerful crime figure on the planet, whom Michael both hates and wants to emulate. The movie also shows Michael's depravity and hypocrisy. While committing the most vicious acts in the name of the Family, he is actually systematically targeting for destruction every one closet to him. Michael is nothing but a phony. He reveres his father, Vito, who is his role model, but he can never be another Vito. Vito was respected and loved, while Michael is feared and loathed. Vito attracted people, inspired confidence, was acknowledged a leader, while Michael repels people away. Everyone close to Michael is driven away or killed: Tom, Freddie, Kay, Pentangeli. They are on to Michael and Michael knows it, so he must have them eliminated. The character of Michael Corleone is one of the most chilling characters in cinema history. Michael is cruel and depraved, yet tries to pass himself off as decent and moral. But that is a front which masks his greediness and deceit. Everything he touches he destroys. Michael is so nasty and mean that he even fights Hyman Roth, the one man who has real affection for Michael. But even that is not enough for Michael. For Michael, being a predator, Roth's good will is a sign of weakness to be exploited. The depth of Michael's depravity is bottomless. And in the end, the man for whom family meant everything, has no one. He has either murdered or driven away everyone. He is alone.When this movie was first released oh those so many years ago, I liked it. Recently I watched the movie again. This time, the movie wasn't that good. My main objections to the movie are: the repeated use of flashbacks and the character of Michael. Regarding the flashbacks, they ruined the continuity of the movie. Is this movie about Michael or is it about the first Godfather? Second, the character Michael is so overblown and two-dimensional that not even Al Pacino's excellent performance could totally save it. It seemed that what Michael needed was a therapist to help him work through his misplaced aggression. Michael feels the need to defend his family but defend them against WHAT? Moreover, Michael is married, is the father of two children, is educated and thoroughly middle-class. This profile does not suggest someone who is likely to be directing an organized crime syndicate. Sorry, it just doesn't wash. And when Michael has his older brother murdered, even though his brother is mentally challenged, that defies all logic, even for Michael for whom the family comes first. If this movie is supposed to be a dramatic study of a deeply confused man who harbors paranoid delusions of persecution mixed with a big dose of grandiosity, then this movie is interesting. However, if this movie is trying to suggest that an intelligent, college-educated, married family man, who has the option to go \"legit\", would be interested in pursuing a career in organized crime, then this is stretching literary license a bit far. Why not have Michael run for political office instead? Now that could make for an interesting and credible movie.",

With Brando not present there seems to be more space for others. Especially De Niro impresses here because he had to take Brando's Godfather into account (he mimics his eye, head movement, diction and hand gestures). Both Strasberg and De Niro were nominated but De Niro won from the godfather of method acting.Part 2 is very well structured: Not only is it a great idea to integrate a prequel and a sequel but they enhance each other creating more emotional intensity: death and birth of a child for example. But the greatest achievement in structuring the story comes in the end, when several story lines are intertwining more and more until the short but powerful climax.Again we see that dark and light is used to separate the inner, godfather world from the outer, ordinary world. Only in the beginning there are more lighter scenes in the godfather world to signify Michael's failed efforts to go legitimate. Once again very effective use of doors, mirrors and windows just as in part 1.Where part 1 and the prequel are about the rise the sequel in part 2 is about the fall of the Godfather family (not the empire). Whereas Vito stands for traditional, Italian values, Michael stands for modern, New World-values. The core of the story comes in the end, showing Michael both in the prequel and the sequel as a lonely outsider. That's why his efforts as a family man fail so dramatically, and he's in fact only excellent in 'business'.",

Just my enemies.\" So says Michael Corleone (AL PACINO) in THE GODFATHER: PART II.Pacino plays the part with somber seriousness that becomes a bit one dimensional by the time the film is midway over. Nor is the story as compelling as the first Godfather film. But you have to hand it to director Coppola, he keeps the viewer glued to the screen even when the pauses between dialog is a bit longer than needed. (No wonder the film is so long!!). And with the risk of being politically incorrect, you can almost smell the garlic in every scene, so realistic are the accents and the background flavor of the entire film.So many plot developments are almost throwaways because the screenplay seems to be deliberately ambiguous about certain plot elements. And yet, the film has a certain holding power and all of the performances are more than competent. Especially poignant--and chilling--is the scene where Fredo's fishing expedition takes place with stormy looking clouds setting the eerie scene to perfection as the expected murder takes place.With murderous intentions just around the corner in practically every scene, it's a fascinating film to watch, especially since the murders themselves are so deftly handled by the actors involved. DIANE KEATON is especially convincing in the final confrontation with Pacino.I don't think GODFATHER II compares favorably to the original film with Brando, particularly since it's not always successful in telling two stories--the one involving the young Vito (ROBERT DeNIRO) and the present story--but it still packs a wallop when it gets to the intense moments. The double strand of stories doesn't always mesh well, a weakness of structure that hurts the film. Despite this major flaw, it's a superior piece of film-making.",

I'll be even more brazen by stating that it's superior to the original which is not an easy thing to do, since that was one of the finest motion pictures of the 20th century. Part of what makes PART TWO just as rich and compelling is that it expands on the scope of PART ONE by exploring the roots of Vito Corleone. So in a way, PART TWO is as much a prequel as it is a sequel.As the first Godfather film began breaking box office records all over the world, Paramount was excited about the possibilities of continuing the Corleone saga. Luckily, Mario Puzo's book had plenty of material that wasn't used in PART ONE, and the author was all too happy to collaborate with Francis Ford Coppola again on the screenplay. The cast was all too happy to reprise their roles for the second film; even James Caan returned for a cameo, despite the fact that Sonny met his maker at the toll booth. The origins of Vito Corleone's criminal career meant that the character was going to be resurrected for the sequel, but whether Marlon Brando wasn't interested -or was nixed- has never been made clear. In the end, Coppola cast a promising young actor who would embody acting par excellence even more than Brando: Robert DeNiro.Besides De Niro, there were other new faces to the Godfather sequel -actually, continuation is probably a better word than sequel. Michael V Gazzo, with his raspy voice, joins as Frank Pentangele, who took over the Corleone Brooklyn chapter after Peter Clamenza died of a heart attack. Actor's Studio founder Lee Strasberg was the mentor to Pacino, DeNiro, Brando, Paul Newman, James Dean, and many, many more. Pacino was eager to have his old teacher play the Jewish mobster Hyman Roth, and conspired to bring him and Coppola together...by \"coincidence\" of course.PART TWO opens in 1901 Sicily where a nine year old Vito Andolini's parents and older brother are murdered by a Mafia chieftain. Loyal friends help Vito escape from the town of Corleone to a ship that will take him to America....him and a shipload of Italian immigrants hoping to make their mark in their new home. At Ellis Island, a clerical error records his name as Vito Corleone, where he is soon quarantined due to small pox.Fading out to the present day (1958), Michael Corleone is hosting a big party at his Tahoe estate celebrating the communion of his son Anthony. Much like Vito at Connie's wedding in PART ONE, Michael mixes business with pleasure as he receives guests for a private audience. Among the visitors are corrupt state Senator Pat Geary; Johnny Ola, right-hand man to mobster Hyman Roth; Connie, now divorced from her second husband -he was a lot luckier than the first- and is about to remarry; and Frank Pentangele, who seeks Michael's permission to wipe out a pair of rivals. I should add that there was another visitor whose scene ended on the cutting room floor: the late Sonny's daughter, now grown up and seeking her uncle's blessing for her own nuptials.Michael seems to be completely oblivious that his wife Kay, is becoming disillusioned because she's aware that his promise of his family's legitimacy is never going to happen. This feeling is reinforced when, just like Vito in PART ONE, an assassination attempt occurs on their property as gunmen open fire on their bedroom window. The shooters are eventually found dead, and Michael suspects that there's a traitor within the Family that took part in shooting.Temporarily leaving Tom in charge, Michael travels incognito with a bodyguard on a train to Miami to meet Hyman Roth, a elderly Jewish mobster obviously modelled after Meyer Lansky. Together they travel to Havana to finalize lucrative hotel deals with Cuba's dictator Fulgencio Batista, with Fredo to follow later with $2 million in cash as a \"gift\" for the Cuban strongman. Soon to join them for New Year's celebrations is Nevada Senator Geary, who's a lot less hostile to Michael ever since the Corleone family bailed him out of a messy situation.One of the most pivotal scenes in PART TWO occurs when the American contingent -minus old man Roth and Ola- are at a nightclub. A slip of the tongue from Fredo reveals that he was the traitor that aided in the assassination attempt, the revelation of which hits Michael like a ton of bricks. The evening's festivities will come to an abrupt end when Castro seizes power on January 1, rendering the Mafia's deal with Batista up in smoke.",

            "content": "How do you follow up a film as accomplished as The Godfather? How can you progress a narrative which already seems so complete? Well, the answer, it turned out, was to tell a story which presented both a new beginning and a new ending to The Godfather story by drawing on the events of the first film whilst combining and connecting the events of the second in subtle, poetic ways. The story of the first film was about the passing of the torch, the second juxtaposes the lives of the torch passer and torch receiver as it focuses on both the young Vito Corleone: an immigrant forced into exile who, in order to survive and live a life of dignity, takes the pragmatic and courageous decision to turn to organised crime, and his son, Michael Corleone, a man who, tiring of his and his family's precarious life in New York, has decided to reinvent the rules of mob warfare. Via rivers of blood and ruthless violence he has carved out a new path in a new part of America: a place where the traditions and customs of Little Italy have been left behind forever: a place where he now finds himself a stranger, exiled from the Old World, grimly tolerated by the New. We see Vito's rise as a product of his connection to his Sicilian roots, we see MIchael's fall as a result of his inability to meaningfully exist in either new or old America. He is neither Sicilian nor American, he is something in-between, an outsider, an exception, a lone-wolf who has been charged with leading the pack. His determination, calcuation and intelligence sees that he survives, but his growing sense of dislocation leads to the antipathy and bitterness which means that each step along his path there is less to be gained by his survival. Live, he might, but he shall never prosper.The film succeeds so well because, once again, it is a brilliant character study of both Don Vito and Don Michael, played superlatively by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, which this time dresses itself in the garb of a morality tale. On a superficial level, Vito's rise is represented as heroic and wholesome, while Michael's schemes seem bitter and destructive. If Vito is the hero and Michael is the villain, Michael must have lost his way somewhere. Yes, but it's deeper than that. Michael is necessary to his father's legacy. Had Michael not taken action, his father and his family would have been destroyed many years ago. The true consequences of Don Vito's life do not fall on his own head, he retired and then died before that could happen; it was Michael who had to pay his father's true debts, his father's life and everything his father had built becomes his responsibility once he becomes the agent of its continuation. This isn't cinema's greatest tragedy simply because of Michael's nature but because of the nature of the wider story in which Michael finds himself a key and essentially always reluctant player. Both Vito and Michael do the same thing, they both do what they perceive to be their duty: Vito does his duty and spends his life surrounded by his family before dying as a figure of reverance. Michael does his duty and his reward is isolation and suffering. A family is gained only to be lost, it's the son who must bear witness and continue to realise the sins of the father.",

It certainly wasn't an easy task, but Coppola knew how to do it.. Repeat the formula, but do it doubly better.\nIn this second film we see how Michael takes care of the family's criminal business as well as seeing the beginnings and youth of Vito Corleone. It is quite interesting how these two narratives contrast, both very intuitive, in the first one seeing how Michael destroys his family in his search for power, while Vito builds it. In this way Coppola makes the two apparently separate stories interconnected in a way that is both subtle and masterful.\nBut the real achievement of this second part may be as a slingshot in Michael and his criminal business, which in turn makes his humanity and family relationships compromised, giving the film a non-existent drama in the first part.\nFinally the conclusion I draw from this film is that Francis Ford Coppola has achieved higher status as an artist by being able to not only match his first masterpiece, but to make it even better.",

They were both interesting and I do love them both. But I just feel like the first is better as mostly any first movie in a trilogy or a series goesGreat cast of characters once again including Dominic Chianese who played Uncle Junior in The Sopranos in Godfather Part Two playing a great character called Johnny Ola. The cinematography is stunning once again and so is the soundtrack. I should point out I watched this movie online where it had no subtitles during scenes of Vito's story when talking in Italian which sucked so maybe that's why my first view of this film is as it is but I am getting the Trilogy on DVD very soon so maybe when I look back on this one again my opinion on Part Two will change and will be just as good if not better than the first one.

Diane Keaton's \"I had an abortion!\" monologue is grating on the nerves, in part because of her poor acting and in part because of her character's stupidity. However, in reviewing the second installment of one of the most overrated franchises in film history, I have to mention that scene. The other, much more famous part to the film is Al Pacino's \"kiss of death\". You can take ten seconds and watch that clip, or you can sit down and watch the entire three and a half hours.Robert De Niro shows up in this movie, in an oddly-lit, hazy saturated, flashback to Vito Coleone's youth. I don't know why anyone cared so much about Marlon Brando that they wanted to watch scene after scene about a younger version of him and why he became bad, how he became worse, and all in Italian. Sure, you can watch a very young Robert De Niro speaking in a foreign language and killing people, but you can also rent any number of other Robert De Niro movies and turn on the subtitles.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

No other movie that runs for a whopping 200 minutes, has held my interest like this one has! There is not a single wasted moment in this long running time. And what's more..it has my most favourite actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro starring in it! Words are not enough to describe this great film, and as has rightly been said by many: to call it a sequel is an insult! This is yet another movie that gets better each time you see it.The Godfather Part II tells parallel stories of young Vito Corleone's early life and his son Michael's reign as Don Corleone. The contrast in the two eras has been shown beautifully. The colours used, the sets, the overall feel...everything has been shown to such fine detail, that it becomes impossible to even try and find a flaw in this film! The most important thing to mention here is that the flashback scenes of Vito's life appear at very apt moments! They are not placed haphazardly. Careful attention has been given to their placement, so that they fit beautifully in the present narrative of Michael Corleone.Robert De Niro delivers a mind-blowing performance as the young Vito. He has uncannily managed to look and behave exactly like the young Vito Corleone would (given Brando's depiction of the same character in the first movie). In some scenes it actually feels as if we are watching a young Brando portraying Vito Corleone! Al Pacino is stunning as the cold, ruthless, brooding Michael Corleone! He manages to express so much through his eyes, its almost eerie! John Cazale as Fredo has a lot to do in this movie and he pulls it off wonderfully. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen does complete justice to his role yet again! Other performances worth a very special mention include: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, Michael V. Gazzo as Frank Pentangeli, Gaston Moschin as Don Fanucci and G.D. Spradlin as Senator Geary.Diane Keaton is better in this movie than in the first as Kay; Talia Shire as Connie is adequate.Also, special mention about the choice of actors playing the young Tessio and young Clemenza (John Aprea and Bruno Kirby respectively); they actually bear an uncanny resemblance to the older actors playing these same parts in Part I.The cinematography, needless to say, is amazing! The sepia tone makes the film appear like a beautiful painting.... The score: once again, a class apart! This is one \"sequel\" that truly surpasses the original! I try not to call it a sequel as far as possible, because the word \"sequel\" simply doesn't fit! \"The Godfather Part II\" is an offer that no one should/can ever refuse!! To do so would quite simply be a \"crime\".....",

It is always a difficult task to better a film in its sequel, doubly so when the original film is a masterpiece of cinematic perfection such as the Godfather was. However, Francis Ford Coppola proved that it is possible to improve on perfection.The Godfather Part II is brilliant in the counterpoint created between Vito Corleone's rise to power and Michael Corleone's tragic fall from grace. Each character does what they must in order to strengthen the Corleone family. But, Michael's failures are made even more tragic when juxtaposed against Vito's successes. Whereas Vito was able to strengthen his family's bonds, Michael frays them to tragic ends.Coppola yet again proves his understanding of the relationship between camera and performance. It is not enough to have a lush cinematic experience without engaging performances, and Coppola is able to achieve this masterful balance. The performances by the entire cast are as picture perfect as is possible, and the interaction between even the smallest roles are pristine. Noteworthy is the scene in the Washington Hotel where Kaye (Diane Keaton) opens the eyes of Michael (Al Pacino) to the depths their relationship has achieved. It remains one of the most powerfully performed scenes to ever have been captured on film.Like it's predecessor, The Godfather Part II is one of those rare moments of cinematic perfection, well deserving of its place of reverence in the history of film.",

            "content": "Francis Ford Coppola's classic sprawling epic masterpiece of great artistic vision which is undeniably the finest sequel ever made. It is a brilliant continuation to what surely is the greatest gangster saga of all-time, it tells the tale of two generations of the Corleone family; that of Michael Corleone, played brilliantly by Al Pacino in phenomenal Oscar nominated performance, who has now consolidated the power handed down to him by his father the late Don Vito Corleone, and that of the early life of young Don Vito, played magnificently by Robert DeNiro in a breakout Oscar winning performance of great dignity. This epic shows in flashbacks the on going story of the embattled family after Don Vito's death, and the way Young Vito struggles to make a living for his family in New York's Little Italy in 1917, where he meets and befriends a young neighborhood thief named Peter Clemenza, superbly played by the late Bruno Kirby, and together with a few associates they begin their criminal operations of petty thievery, but Vito is always looking out and helping the people around their neighborhood. Vito is forced to kill the local Black Hand boss, the brutal Don Fanucci, played solidly by the late Gastone Moschin, who wants a piece of the action from Vito and his partners. Don Fanucci is also a snake that oppresses and victimizes his own people in the neighborhood, shaking them down for what little money they may have. With Don Fanucci's murder Vito's communal stature grows as does his power, shift to 1958 where Don Michael Corleone is now based in Lake Tahoe and rules his vast empire with an iron fist. He is increasing distrustful and paranoid, and has become cold, ruthless and unemotional. An attempted assassination makes Michael realizes that Hyman Roth, played terrifically by the late Lee Strasberg in Oscar nominated performance, who is an old ally that once worked for his father is now trying kill him. Michael must also find the traitor in his family, as well as deal with a federal indictment, and his failing marriage to Kay Adams, played wonderfully by Diane Keaton. There are tremendous supporting performances by Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talie Shire, Michael V. Gazzo, G.D. Spradlin, Richard Bright, Marianna Hill and Dominic Chianese. Masterful Oscar winning direction by Coppola, with extraordinary cinematography by the late great Gordon Willis, a complex and vivid Oscar winning screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, a lavish Oscar winning production design by Dean Tavoulars, and a dynamic Oscar winning original score by Nino Rota & Carmine Coppola. This American cinematic classic won 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director: Francis Ford Coppola.",

            "content": "The original \"Godfather\" created the template for every mob movie thereafter. Gangsters previously were either celebrated or loathed, but never well understood. Then \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" released five years earlier, attempted to humanize criminals by showing not only the spectacular bank heists and subsequent car chases, but also the mundane, banal and tragic nature of such a lifestyle. But B&C weren't Mafiosi. \"Godfather\" portrayed the Mafia as a unique and fascinating subset of society. Along with the requisite violence, we see the gangsters with their families, at weddings and christenings, or planning a multiple murder over takeout Chinese. Most of all, it is a portrait of Michael Corleone, the war hero and prodigal son, who returns to the fold and ends up running the show.In \"Godfather II\" Michael is running much more than a crime family. He's a big shot whose son's first communion is celebrated by senators and other luminaries. As Hyman Roth famously tells him, \"Michael, we're bigger than US Steel.\" But his personal life is disintegrating. Michael has promised Kay, his wife, that he's \"going legitimate\" but it's clearly not working, and we wonder about the sincerity of the promise. The family narrowly escapes a hit following the communion ceremony, initiating a series of retributions that we know will not stop. Meanwhile, a series of flashbacks to Sicily show Vito, the paterfamilias, as a young boy who himself survives an assassination attempt (his mother is not so lucky), sails to America and sets himself up as a street hood who through guile and guts takes over the neighborhood rackets. He is respected and feared, but he's not without compassion. When his wife tells him of a friend who's having trouble keeping her apartment, Vito intervenes on her behalf. He didn't have to do it, and there's really nothing in it for him.This is the central contrast in the film. Vito is undoubtedly a criminal who'll kill anyone in his way, but there's a humanity behind his calculations. Michael, who disdains his criminal family at the beginning of \"Godfather I\" and shows a na\u00efve, even playful side, has lost his humanity by the end of that picture, and that hardness only deepens in \"Godfather II\". The only glimpse we see of that earlier man occurs in a scene with his mother, in which he asks how his father kept the family together. It's a rare example of self-doubt in an otherwise scheming, manipulative and deeply cynical personality. When he learns that his weak older brother, Fredo, helped set up the botched Lake Tahoe hit, he permits him to live, but only while their mother lives. By the end of the movie Michael has lost his family (his natural one), and any remnant of human feeling.The structure of \"Godfather II\" is problematic for me. The repeated flashbacks to the young Vito, while engaging, interrupt the flow of the film. That this is a strategic error on Coppolla's part was demonstrated when one of the networks aired a miniseries, \"The Godfather Saga\" a few years after the sequel. It took a strictly chronological approach: beginning with scenes of young Vito in Sicily from \"Godfather II\" and then continuing with \"Godfather I\". (Some scenes were edited or omitted entirely, in conformance with network TV standards, while others not appearing in the films were included.) This merging of narratives conveyed all the power of both movies without the distracting flashback device to form a much more coherent whole. What to say about the cast of \"Godfather II\"? It is uniformly excellent. DeNiro's Vito is pitch-perfect. Keaton's performance as Kay is striking in its nuanced disaffection as she grows to realize that her husband has no inclination to go straight. Dominic Chianese gives a strong performance as Johnny Ola, a quarter-century ahead of Junior Soprano. Michael V. Gazzo, as the harried, doomed Frankie Pentangeli, won a supporting-actor nod, and his might be the best performance of the film. Talia Shire, as sister Connie, shines as the floozy who -- like Michael in the first film -- finally returns to the fold.But it's Pacino and Cazale who really carry this picture. Theirs is a complex, combustible relationship: the strong, ruthless younger brother and the skittish, increasingly resentful older brother share two memorable, but radically different, scenes. In the first, Fredo has just arrived in Havana with Roth's $2 million. They repair to a street cafe for daiquiris as Michael pretends to confide in Fredo -- in fact everything he says is a lie. But Fredo is appreciative of the confidence and regrets that the two never spoke so intimately before. Later, after Fredo stupidly reveals to Michael his association with Roth and Ola, Michael severs their relationship in the harshest terms. Fredo is practically recumbent in his chair, even as he insists that \"I'm smart! Not stupid like everybody says. I want respect!\" But he's not smart: he's a dead man, and everybody knows it but him. Cazale plays the pathos for all it's worth. The film ends with yet another flashback. It's Christmas, and the brothers have planned a welcome-home for the Don (never seen). Michael announces that he's joining the Army, winning congratulations from Fredo, bewilderment from Tom, and scorn from Sonny. This is evidently Michael's reverie, perhaps driven by the guilt of killing Fredo and his brutal treatment of Kay. Flash to present: Michael is seated outside his Tahoe estate, his only companions the fallen leaves whipping around his feet.It's a real tour de force, this movie. It is flawed in its conception but brilliant in its execution. I can see why many people think it's the best sequel ever, even better than the original. I just can't take it that far. It may be the best sequel, but it nonetheless suffers by comparison to its predecessor.",

            "content": "I suppose everyone already knows the story -- Al Pacino as Michael Corleone rises to power in 1958, with multiple flashbacks to Robert DeNiro as his father Vito in the 1920s -- so we can dispense with a summary. Actually, the story itself is less important than the fact that the film naturally divides itself in two -- its execution and its moral message.The execution is splendid in every regard. Coppola's direction is deliberately paced. There is a conspicuous absence of unsubtle and dizzying directorial razzle-dazzle, thank God -- a movie that doesn't give you a headache.The performances are nearly flawless. There isn't a sour note in the entire cast, and especially outstanding is the acting of Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo (author of \"A Hatfull of Rain\"), and Gastone Moschin as Don Fanucci, who tackles the role with an understated grandiosity -- what operatic flourishes! But everyone is good.The photography by Gordon Willis, as in its predecessor, is dominated by a burnished amber except for wintry Lake Tahoe where various shades of blue and a steely gray predominate. The production designer deserves credit. Nino Rota's orchestral score is memorable, a folksy melancholic tune. The script has some neat tag lines. When Strasberg and Pacino meet, they shake hands and exchange warm wishes, then when Pacino admits that he's going to kill a colleague of Strasberg, the latter shrugs, turns to his tuna fish sandwich, and says, \"He's small potatoes.\" It's a chilling moment. The avuncular, sentimental old man is a ruthless murderer. That's the execution. The -- I don't know what to call it. I don't like the term \"moral of the movie.\" Sounds like a high school term paper. And I'm not sure exactly what \"intentionality\" means in phenomenology, so I'll just say \"intention.\" The intention of the film is thoroughly corrupt. Maybe Puzo and Coppola realized it, maybe not.I think the director did, though. That's why he splices so much carnage into the rituals. Almost every scene of violence takes place during some sort of party or religious festival. I think -- I HOPE -- that Coppola was aware of the irony between the rites of intensification and the fact that the principles they embody are ignored almost at will. It's important to have your baby baptized as soon as possible, just as it's important to shoot a miscreant in the chest.In a sense all the rituals, all the religion, are fakes. There is no license permitted, unlike Irish wakes, Polish weddings, or Russian parties. If, like Gazzo, you have too much wine and accidentally spill some on the vast tablecloth at an al fresco party, the glances are severe. No sexy dancing either. In a way, despite the faux gaiety, it's something like living in a prison, especially for women.We're supposed to feel sorry for Michael who, at the end, is seen sitting alone in solemn grandeur, emotionally bankrupt. But Michael is really a rat who deserves everyone's contempt and execution by the state. It doesn't matter that he's young, handsome, well-spoken, powerful and rich. He's broken more laws than anyone can count. He lies, cheats, and murders at will. Those murders include an innocent whore who is horribly butchered simply in order to entrap the Senator from Nevada in Michael's thrall. He betrays his friends. He throws out his wife and prevents her from taking \"his\" children. He murders his own brother for a past mistake for which he's already been punished.The original Don Corleone, Marlon Brando, had a set of allegiances extending outward from the family at its center -- to his ethnic group, his neighborhood, his co-conspirators in the business, and beyond that to some vague construct called \"the nation.\" Al Pacino's Don has whittled it all down. At the center is ego, and beyond that, business. He's become a classical villain, a Richard III who has plucked down that crown, and if he now has buyer's remorse -- well, he should have thought things out earlier. His tragedy is nothing compared to mine, which has been Shakespearean in its grandeur, really. In my adolescence, the love of my life, Juliet, poisoned herself. And when, in all modesty, I tried to become Emperor of Rome, the treacherous bastards assassinated me.",

It feels like Tom Hagen would be afraid of him even if he was given permission to go to Las Vegas.Even the assassinations at the end did not feel like a return to power for Michael as in the first movie, but like a king paranoid of his own brother who was already beaten.I would have liked the scene of Sonny Corleone telling Vito that he saw him kill Fanucci to be included. I think it would have shown how Vito also made mistakes with his family.Overall, this film is a masterpiece.

How could he be so mad at Fredo for being tricked by those two rats, Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola. That wasn't exactly all Fredo's fault. But, you not only do you feel the neglect from Michael to Fredo, but you feel the neglect from Michael to his family and household.  That was one of the really haunting parts of the film.  Michael's neglect is what causes him to fall into the deep depression by the end of the film and into the third installment of the trilogy.

It's no wonder that the 3 Oscars, related to set design were won by this movie.However, my issues with the movie are related to its story. It is 3 hours and 22 seconds long and what happens in those minutes? Nothing. The characters are talking the entire time, saying things that are either meaningless or trying to be smart, both failing to entertain me. My main grip with the movie is that it's supposed to be a crime film and in a crime film you would expect to have a little more action.

But easier said than done, this time the job was tougher, because a sequel or prequel or succeeding film in this case, comes with a certain baggage of expectations, but Coppola had ended the godfather pretty cleverly, now we can't obviously assume that he was planning a sequel because sequels were not a common thing back then....but still Mario puzo and Coppola pack in enough punch to make this 1974 film not only the best follow up ever made but also arguably make one of the most ambitious, innovative and risky film ever undertaken a classic....just like the first one. this film continues right from where the first one ended, right from there, you just don't feel you have ever left the corleones, not for once, it was that effortless....but the masterstroke in this one was the prequel track where we see how don Vito became don Vito in 1930s new york....so the film actually beautifully highlights how Michael and Vito expanded the corleone empire.... Coppola once again manages to make some scenes memorable, which haunt you long after you've left the movie and the cinematography and musical score is also very good. Al pacino plays Michael corleone with outstanding aplomb and maturity. The first movie not only gifted him super stardom overnight but also matured him as an actor. I personally consider this to be the best performance not to get an Oscar. Another time he let's his eyes do the talking and silences speak. Just watch out for a few scenes towards the end...it will surely send a shiver down your spine and give you goosebumps. Robert De niro plays the young don Vito corleone in the parallel track of the movie, almost all his dialouges being in Italian. He had large shoes to fill because a certain Marlon Brando played the same character in the previous one and got an Oscar. But De niro, an icon now but relatively unknown that time, completely nailed the role. Right from the way he speaks to the way he walks and his mannerisms, he is excellent. Not for once you feel he is not Vito's younger self and that is quite a task. The academy jury also thought so, making don Vito the only character in movie history to be awarded Oscar twice. Talia share, Diane Keaton, Robert duvall are all excellent.the only probable issue which people have with this movie is the fact it is three and a half hours long and also some of the scenes could well have been left out.

Even not as an American, I am very moved to see the immigrants at the harbor staring at the Statue of Liberty at the beggining of the twentieth century, and nine-year-old Vito is just one of them.I can imagine there would be many Vitos in that period, hungry, oppressed young men with dim future, and some of them went for criminal paths. Everything in Vito's era is simple, and limited in the small neighborhood. And everyone is young, probably so is America itself.On the other hand, in Michael's time things have become far more complicated. He has to deal with a governor, negotiating on gambling license. The family has now a bunch of associates running businesses around the country, and among them Michael is not sure who he can trust.After an attempted assassination of Michael in his bedroom, he has to find out not only who is the plotter, but also who is the mole inside. His search leads him to Miami and then Havana. Havana gives the film many beautiful and memorable scenes, and they have also interesting historical background, set in the culmination of the Cuban Revolution.Michael is a cold man. I don't like him. But probably he doesn't like himself more than anyone else. I just feel pity for him. I also feel pity for Key, Fredo, Pentangeli, and anyone else in Michael's era. I wonder what is wrong with Corleone family, when remembering how exhlarating things were in Vito's era.When you are watching the film, probably in your head there is the image of Vito Corleone played by Maron Brando from the first film. Even though the two actors don't look like each other, Robert De Niro's Vito, with the hoarce voice and the elegant hand gesture, makes us believe he is the same Vito as played by Brando.Of course Al Pacino is excellent too, playing the loneliest man, who finds himself in the miserable life that he cannot remember when he chose to go through.",

While Marlon Brando's presence is sorely missed, \"Part II\" does everything the original did and does it better. Its story is deeper, richer, and ultimately more thought provoking. While \"Part I\" was a tale of good and evil, \"Part II\" explores the Mafia as the ultimate perversion of the American Dream - something that took the innocence of the immigrant ideal and warped it into a criminal monstrosity.\"Part I\" showed how a good man can become evil. \"Part II\" continues that story and demonstrates how an amoral but complicated man can lose his own soul in doing what he thinks is right. Like \"Part I,\" \"Part II\" is endlessly entertaining but it's also more emotionally involving and satisfying. I love how the filmmakers show the parallel stories of Vito and Michael Corleone, who're both played brilliantly by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. The fact that Al Pacino didn't win the Oscar for \"Part II\" is unbelievable; it's easily the best performance of his career.

But before \"Jack\" there was \"The Godfather.\" While I feel the whole \"Godfather\" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think \"The Conversation\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire \"Godfather\" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. \"The Godfather\" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, \"The Godfather\" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.Grade: Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-",

In the DVD commentary, Coppola himself says that this is at least as good as the first film and that this is where he wanted to end things. The acting here is phenomenal from every character and I think the best performance is perhaps from the actor of Don Fanucci. You just don't see movies like this made anymore. I think the reason I prefer this over the first has a lot to do with the pacing. This movie is a little more fun and the flashback/forward structure always keeps things moving, as well as providing a beautiful contrast between the two generations of dons. By the way, don't let anybody tell you the stories have nothing to do with each other. Its structure is what really makes this a memorable movie, and it actually works without being tacky, unlike Once Upon a Time in America.",

This is purely based on the fact that by Watching part two, i was made more aware of how much craftsmanship was implicated into the film's script. The film begun to highlight on Michael's reluctance to continue in illicit practices in comparison to the first Godfather. the murders committed in the second part could be easily be seen as though Michael was getting carried away with the fact that he could get someone killed when he wanted and also that he acted on personal agendas rather than business. However, The fact was that he was eager to be rid of his enemies so quickly revolved around the idea that he wanted out; no more illegal dealings i.e. dealing with tergiversating, murders, money laundering etc.... The godfather became a story of thriving family men ( Vito and Michael) rather than a typical Mafia picture. i really appreciated the enactment of Vito's life as a young boy transcending into a respectable man of both virtue and vice, executed well by a young Robert De Niro. what had really caught my senses- that really made me believe that the film was original, realistic and was created with diligence was the scene where Freddo supposedly met Johnny Ola for the first time and later had innocently neglected his concealment (of previously meeting Johnny Ola and Hyman Roth which he denied previously to Michael) and the presence of Michael only to implicitly slip out the fact that he had met both Roth and Ola previously, stated in a way that implicated that they all share a mutual friendship. instantly, i felt the inspirational factor of the film. that piece of simple originality in a film just made my day from then on, never in my early 17 years of life have i ever seen something so natural to human nature portrayed in a film, really beautiful. so i have to say, the Godfather is one of the best made films not only for it's uniqueness and reality. but the timelessness of it's creation just makes it even more worth while and will continue to do so for many generations.",

This work would make even Mario Puzo himself proud.Found the duality between father and son poetic. Great way to show how Don Vito and Michael forged their own paths with different motivations. Every character had their own motivations that were understandable and believable. Not to mention the conniving Hyman Roth being an excellent villain. The ending was especially chilling as both protagonists were worlds apart when they achieved the same goal... solidifying their power.Justice was also done to make the film feel like the eras portrayed. It felt as if I was seeing real scenes of 1920 Italian New York slums and the rise of Las Vegas in the 1950s. Beautiful.The only problem I had with The Godfather: Part II was how Robert De Niro looked nothing like Don Vito. Should I hold that against him? Definitely not considering his stellar performance.5/5. A must-watch for lovers of the Godfather or good films in general.",

I also think it's a \"funner\" more entertaining movie. And just to add a bit of context to my above statement; I consider Lawrence of Arabia second. I think those are pretty solid, definitive for me. Just behind I think I'd put Citizen Kane, Ben Hur, LOTR FOTR(still have to watch ROTK) and The Godfather, but I'm not as certain, particularly about the order. I also liked, The Maltese Falcon, Slumdog Millionaire, The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight(haven't seen Rises yet), Braveheart, Casablanca and City Lights(Charlie Chaplin).

            "content": "Godfather Part 2 is so hailed as the greatest film of all time it's time someone burst that overblown bubble and I've got the needle right here. So let's take a closer look at what should be considered a mediocre sequel to the classic film, The Godfather. First of all Marlon Brando is nowhere to be seen here. Instead we get random flashbacks to Robert Deniro as the young Vito. We get some good scenes of old Little Italy though there's a Keystone-cops feel to some of it, especially the comic relief of the slumlord scene.Part 2 has a much bigger budget but a script with weakened plot lines and dialogue, basically trying to followup everything from Part 1 logically becoming formulaic and soap-operaish, and ending up falling flat.The film begins with another celebration of some kind. A brother's betrayal aspires to be that of Hamlet, but without the depth or wit (or brevity). It's now the 1950s and Mike is in Nevada and is trying to buy a corrupt Senator. The Senator is I suppose the film producer element of the first, but with nothing creative like a horse head...just crass dialogue that doesn't ring true. We also get a Mafia hearing in Congress which should have ended up on the cutting room floor. We also get (the great?) Lee Strasberg as some old shirtless and feeble mobster. He may be a great teacher, but someone tell me why this is an Academy Award winning acting performance! Am I just dumb? Al Pacino is great as always, this performance following Serpico, but his dialogue doesn't ring true. When he begins, \"If history has taught us anything..\" I expect some deep wisdom to follow...needless to say it doesn't. Talia Shire's character is also weakened compared to the original's Connie. Here she just \"needs money\" and wants Mike to forgive Fredo because \"he's so sweet\". This mess of a sequel ends with a literal bloodbath, but following the formula of the first, and a final scene with the original cast (sans Brando) the actors of which were paid more than all their good work in the original. I'm not saying it isn't worth seeing, just that it's inferior to the original in many ways. But of course it isn't near as bad as Part 3. My final criticism is that all these mob films intentionally or not glorify criminals. Okay, now you can click \"no\".",

            "review_title": "Darker sequel that focuses more on the Corleon's take on the legal and politics aspects. The best film ever made, probably yes...",
            "content": "This movie can be watched as two different movies that connect masterfully when the actual events are about to reach a climax. \"The Godfather\" plot gets more into the political aspects rather than on mafia wars or vendettas and that brings in consequence more dramatic situations inside the family. Thus the film has a darker, more tense tone.It focuses more on the personal consequences provoked by the family's criminal empire in the US and in Cuba. Michael's character is explored and taken to a new darker level. We understand that his personal life is falling to pieces as his wife provoked an abortion and plans to leave him, while, at the same time, he faces a betrayal from his older brother and the burdens of his sister's life. Michael, unlike Vito, is more cold hearted but marvelous when playing his cards. Vito made sure to establish his criminal empire before others could consider him as an enemy and with his guts, he decides to take down the mafia leader in the zone, Don Fanucci. Later, Vito starts a huge oil business and executes a long time vendetta. That was Vito Corleone, a brilliant negotiator, persuasion leader, calmed down, and smart Italian-American who started from zero and thanks to his family's support, loyal associates, and leadership; soon started his own empire.When both character's reach a similar climatic situation; it's up to Michael to learn through his mother how his father would act in order to keep his family safe or how to deal with a certain problem. After plenty of intermissions that show us Vito's start in mafia; we construct in our mind a parallel story that will give us the \"weapons\" to know how Michael is gonna act.Vito, in his younger years, demonstrated to be very protective of his family and members of his \"other family\". He didn't have to face betrayal or similar situations when he started to build the empire; unlike Michael who is in a very complex situation that not only deals with politics.The trial that the Corleones face is absolutely brilliant on the political side because Michael moves his cards in such a class act manner that witnesses who have the chance to take the business down suddenly regret on their accusations. Michael is now a brilliant politician who has controls the strings of senators, judges, mafia bosses, etc. His the most powerful criminal in the country.This makes Michael a true menacing leader with such power that he is feared, respected by everyone, including his close family.So the movie focuses primarly on Michael and Hyman Roth, making Vito in his young years a supporting character along with Clemenza and Tessio. The supporting characters from the actual events include favorites such as Al Neri (although he was in part 1), Rocco, Fredo once again, Willi Cicci, Frank, Connie, and Mother Corleone. Tom Hagen deserves a special spot for being the equilibrium of the family on the most difficult situations. He's just a splendid sidekick and opposite at the same time for Michael.Special mention for Michael's extremely creepy and lethal capo-bodyguard who provided some of the most suspenseful scenes in cinema history just by making presence. He must be a role model for the Giallo sub-genre.The atmosphere in the movie is absolutely amazing, beautiful. The funeral scene is sad and intense, while the Cuban new year's eve party is glamorous, colorful, and nerve tensing. I enjoyed big time the carnival in Vito's younger years.The movie is excellent, just excellent. It's a mix of classic score executed by orchestras, mixed with creepy piano elements, and classical/popular Italian melodies.The acting is just wonderful. Al Pacino delivers the acting display of his career. Michael Corleone is a brilliant man, with an admirable temper, excellent knowledge of politics and human behavior. Al Pacino demonstrates he can act in EVERY single possible situation. Robert De Niro's performance is highly regarded because of his masterful display of Marlon Brando's behavior translated translated through the Vito Corleone character. The movie focuses on both actor's characters and that's why you just explore them at full. The acting by Robert Duvall is a glory. The rest of the cast is just wonderful and deserve to be congratulated but let's face it; this is all about Pacino and DeNiro.To be honest, myself as a die-hard Horror cinema expert, I can say this sequel is amongst the most tense, suspenseful and stressing but pleasant viewing experiences I've ever experienced.There's plenty of tension, high-quality action sequences (my favorites include Michael's murder attempt which is later spectacular when his gunmen search for the assassin's; Frank's murder attempt when Cicci gets injured; the Cuban citizens rebellion, and the climax when Frank commits suicide, Roth gets killed, Fredo pays for his betrayal, etc.).I loved the final sequence when the flashback takes place and Michael is left alone, drinking tea or wine I can't remember... he just thinks and plans his future in that moment. It's a brilliant scene.Please watch this movie because it's a lesson of life through tense situations that happen in real life, for some.Ford Coppola's delicate, classy direction makes this a great visual experience in all the sense of the word; he creates a whole new world in which we are invited without having to be worried. Now, when a movie is part of your life you can say it's more than a great experience.",

            "content": "Well, it seems that I agree partially with Ebert on this film, except that he rated it higher than I did. The reason that I rated it lower is because there seems to be little to tie the entire film together. The character development and interaction is brilliant, but the plot itself seems to be quite loose and very thin in places. Also the movie seems to follow very closely to the style of the first film, with an almost sudden ending, where everybody that appears to be an antagonist is simply killed, or put out of the picture.What this movie does well though is to offer a comparison between Don Vito Corleone and his son Michael Corleone. Here we see how Vito's family was killed by a powerful mafia Don in Sicily, and then flees to America to build his empire. We then jump to the present (in the film, which is 1959) to see the crowning glory of what his family became. The difference is that Michael Corleone is a cold and heartless man who slowly pushes everybody close to him away, while Vito Corleone, even though he can be a brutal murderer at times, is an honourable man who is there to help the poor and the weak. We see this when he bullies the landlord who bullies a poor widow tenant.I guess the thing that strikes us most in this movie is how Michael and Vito Corleone change. Vito goes from being a poor orphan boy with small pox to a powerful Mafia Don, while Michael goes from being a rich family man to a cold and powerful man with no friends. In the final scenes he falls to the lowest and kills his brother.I have never been all that great about sequels, and I feel that this movie is really no different.",

There's also that \"dividing up the cake\" scene which I've always felt stupid and clunky. And I think it could stand to lose about 20 minutes from its runtime (I've known people who would say the same about Part 1 too, but I'm certainly not in that camp).Negatives aside, this is still a great film thanks to its beautiful visuals, great score, and excellent performances from its huge cast. Pacino is particularly great of course, shining now that he's gone from a supporting character in Part 1 to the flawed, tragic protagonist in Part 2. It's a surprisingly subtle performance, punctuated by scenes where he loses his cool and portrays an intense anger that's terrifying- sometimes just with his eyes, which is some seriously impressive acting.Of course it's a classic, and it's a more than worthy sequel/prequel to the first, but for my money, the original will always be the one I believe to be superior.",

And some times he was even better than brando himself.\nMichael Corleone's life story after being the godfather was brilliant written and well played by Pacino. A man who tried to protect his family and get in the line of work he despised most and somehow he started to enjoy it. This was the fate of Michael in this segment. From being a sad army veteran to a needed devil but in this movie he was a satan who doesn't want to give up power and would do anything to protect his legacy and his Father.\nIn this movie you would also like the match cut between Vito's timeline and Michael's timeline.\nA Cameo from James caan was very soothing and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen was brilliant again.\nFrancis Ford Coppola should be given all awards for making The godfather 1&2.",

            "content": "The rise of a great man is set against the fall of his son in this powerful second installment of the \"Godfather\" franchise. \"The Godfather Part II\" is an eminently worthy successor to the classic first film, not nearly as accessible but entertaining and gripping in its own right.When we reconnect with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), he is firmly established as head of the Corleone crime family, now based in Lake Tahoe, Nevada and as lethal as ever. As Michael asserts control over his dominion, we occasionally go back in time to see his father Vito (Robert De Niro) finding his own path to criminal power.Michael speaks with more authority than honesty, we learn right away. \"Senator, we're both part of the same hypocrisy, but never think it applies to my family,\" he says. The irony and tragedy of \"Godfather Part II\" is how that hypocrisy is in fact never stronger than when it comes to Michael's family, which is all but destroyed by Michael's iron grip in service of evil ends.As sequels go, few are regarded as measuring up to the magnificence of \"Godfather Part II.\" It's everything you expect from the first film, building on the final moments we saw there of Michael accepting his destiny as Mafia don and developing what that all means. Weighing in at over three hours, with lengthy flashbacks, it manages to hold your focus as director-co-writer Francis Ford Coppola plays cards you didn't know were in the deck. The pacing is deliberate, never ponderous.Like the first \"Godfather,\" I found I enjoyed \"Part II\" more with repeat viewings. Occasionally, as in an opening sequence set in Sicily that is revisited late in the movie, the drama gets a bit strained as the revenge theme is overplayed. Otherwise, the same subtlety that makes the first movie so great is in ample evidence here.Pacino is fantastic as the older, harder Michael. We don't quite root for him anymore, the way we did in the first film (another weakness of \"Part II\" as I see it), but his command in the role is startling to witness. In the first movie, we saw him get bloody; this time the wounds are more internal as he plays his scenes with dead-eyed calm. \"I've already made my move,\" he tells his brother Fredo (John Cazale), regarding his latest venture in Cuba with a suspect business partner named Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg).Cazale and Strasberg give the most memorable supporting performances (De Niro is more a co-lead even though he has less screen time than Pacino). Cazale is more of a hot mess than ever, entertainingly so until the stakes get too high. Strasberg is so low-key and charming you almost find yourself trusting him, until a key scene when his mask slips regarding a former associate named Moe Greene.Other performances, many by returnees from the first film, are accomplished if somewhat superfluous, particularly Robert Duvall as Michael's adopted brother Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's wife Kay, and Talia Shire as Michael's sister Connie. All of them have big moments, but are also left in the dust, somewhat by design as the theme of this film is Michael's loss of family ties.The Vito sections could have been deadly, but Coppola here is at his peak as a director, working from a section of the source novel by co-screenwriter Mario Puzo that was left off the first film. Taking his cues from Marlon Brando's original characterization, but lending his own unmistakable spin, De Niro plays Vito as coy, gentle, but highly dangerous.I love how Vito speaks almost entirely in his native Sicilian dialect, except at certain key moments when he uses English, depicted here as the language of power. He handles the problem of a don who wants to \"wet my beak\" in Vito's business with cold calculation. It amounts to a power play not only against the don, but his buddies Clemenza and Tessio, who soon find themselves taking orders from their former underling.The film climaxes, as the first movie did, with a trio of interconnected sequences showing Michael's brutal effectiveness against his enemies. This time, however, there's no sense of triumph. Michael's revenge is too excessive, his \"enemies\" too reduced or ambiguous to merit their ends in our eyes. That of course is the message of \"Godfather Part II.\"Ultimately, \"Godfather Part II\" is a masterful if muted examination of the price of family, how the ties that bind too often strangle. I don't think it packs the same punch as the first film, but hardly any film does. What it does well is bring the themes of the first film into sharper focus, so sharp they leave one feeling the scars.",

With Al Pacino's superb turn as the man who loses his soul, the film hits amazing highs. There are moments in the first half, where we understand the roots of what later became the Corleone empire. Robert De Niro does his best to convey the essence of the young Corleone, but its the reenactment of an era through the loving art direction and touching score that provide the soul of the period.The story line sets up the decay that destroy Michael Corleone. Sadly, following the road to its devastating resolution can prove to be a rather arduous task. There are unforgettable moments, as the more seasoned performers use subtle gestures and deliver lines that point to the overall tragedy surrounding the different characters.\"Godfather II\" ends with a much darker version of \"Godfather I\". All seems lost because this time, the Don lives on, and manages to keep his dynasty going. The question is at what price?",

            "content": "Remember that young idealist Michael Corleone from the opening wedding scene in The Godfather? That Michael Corleone doesn't exist anymore. His descent began in the original film as he took over the family business. In Part II the now ruthlessly evil Michael bottoms out. He has money, he has power. But at what cost? It is hard to comprehend what he has become, so sad to see him cost himself everything he really holds dear. And, in a stroke of genius, as we watch Michael fall director Francis Ford Coppola at the same time flashes back and allows us to see Michael's father rise. The rise of Vito Corleone, the fall of Michael. Either story on its own would be epic. Interwoven together the two stories combine to make The Godfather: Part II one of the most audacious and most brilliant films ever made.After a brief introduction to the Vito storyline Part II thrusts us right back into that familiar Godfather world which we left at the end of the first film. It is now 1958 and Michael has moved family operations to Nevada. We open at the family compound in Lake Tahoe with an elaborate party celebrating Michael's son's First Communion. Yes, the parallels with the first film's wedding scene are obvious. Rather than Vito it is now Michael who everyone waits to see. Even his sister Connie will have to get in line and wait her turn for an audience with Michael. The real business of the day, involving a proposed Corleone takeover of another casino to add to their empire, is conducted between Michael and Nevada Senator Pat Geary. We see that Michael is so powerful, and so sure of himself, that he thinks nothing of being totally dismissive and insulting towards a United States Senator. Safe to say this is not the most cordial of business meetings. Nothing seems to be decided and Geary, a true sleaze in his own right, leaves but you know we'll see him again. Michael moves on to his next meeting with Frank Pentangeli, who is now running the old Corleone New York territory. This meeting is bitter and hostile as can be. It's been a long day for Michael Corleone. And it's about to get much, much worse. An attempt is made on Michael's life. Bullets come flying into his bedroom. He and his family emerge unscathed and you know the film is now going to kick into high gear. This is going to get really, really good. And then the film immediately transports you back to 1917 and the story of Vito Corleone.So is Coppola pulling the rug out from under you by leaving Michael's story just when you can't wait to see what happens next? Not at all. Vito's story will prove to be just as compelling as Michael's. And throughout the film Coppola chooses the absolutely perfect times to jump from one story to the other, at emotional high points, places where the connections between the two stories are the most poignant. It's brave, brilliant film making. The audience is treated to two fabulous stories which fit together absolutely perfectly. As the film plays out we see Vito begin to acquire power and Michael consumed by power. We see the great love Vito has for his family as we watch Michael's family fall apart around him. We know Vito is capable of some evil things but he still has some heart to him. Michael has clearly lost his heart somewhere along the way. Just telling Michael's story would have been enough to make this a great film. Weaving young Vito's story in so seamlessly is what makes the film something truly special.As with the first film Coppola is helped here by universally brilliant performances from his cast. And as with the first film it is Al Pacino who makes the biggest impression. His performance as Michael is as powerful and captivating as anything you've ever seen. Michael is such a complex character and his journey from the beginning of the first film to the end of this one is something that has to be seen to be believed. And over both films Pacino is spot-on perfect every step of the way. In the parallel story it is Robert De Niro who gets the critical role of young Vito and he does ever so well in giving life to the man who would one day be Brando. We of course have the familiar faces from the first film. Robert Duvall as lawyer Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's long-suffering wife Kay. There's Talia Shire and Morgana King. And most memorably of all John Cazale as hapless, hopeless Fredo. Part II also gives us great new characters, making room for new performers to make their mark on The Godfather saga. Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo, G. D. Spradlin, Gastone Moschin, Dominic Chianese...the list could go on and on. Such a huge cast and yet every performer seems to fit their role perfectly. The film tells two great stories and the acting is absolutely wonderful throughout. Some two hour movies seem to drag endlessly. This nearly three and a half hour movie absolutely flies by. A monumental achievement for Coppola, one of the best films of all time.",

As with the original, crime drama plots follow similar story topics.  The differences lie in the acting, editing, characters, and camera.The editing here is less refined, trying to be Kubrick when this is Coppola. It isn't ponderous, but it's a contradictory style--much like 'The Thin Red Line'.The camera is the same as before, not trying to do anything we haven't seen. Even Frankenheimer's 'Manchurian Candidate' contains more visual fluency than this effort.The characters/acting are where the giant U-turn occurs this time.  This has no basis on Puzo's book, but is completely constructed in Coppola's mind and in the actors' presentation.  Are these rational steps being made?  Most aren't.The biggest surprise--DeNiro as Brando.  In a context like this (instead of vice-versa), the range is almost unlimited.  Coppola is one of few directors to use Brando effectively, as 'Apocalypse' would prove, and here DeNiro does his best work.  Everything after this (Scorsese's works, 'Deer Hunter', 'Heat') becomes useless.  In those cases he is bored.  In 'Untouchables' he's energetic.  Here--he's duplicating a master.For that reason alone you should see this.  See 'Apocalypse Now' after this to see Coppola do the real cinematic deal.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",

If you haven't watched the movie, then the following may be a spoiler - but seriously, you must be living under a rock!!?! Anyway, I just wanted to mention how great Pt II was. I cannot compare Pt I and II but really the rewards cashed in Pt II is because of Pt I. But on the face of it Pt II is the best one because its slightly more dynamic and clever. For me, its clinched by a flashback scene towards the end of the movie. In this flashback, Don Vito, Tom, Sonny and Michael are sitting around a table talking about the war but otherwise are merry, and Michael out the blue says he wants to join the army. At this point, the full realisation that Michael was the \"black-sheep\" of the family right from the beginning hits you. Michael has not transformed, he had always been like that. He was always the villain in the story. His promise (in Pt I etc) not to enter into the family business can now be seen in new light. His actions in Pt I and Pt II can now be seen in new light. Only those who contributed to the building/maintenance of the family are the true heroes.Corollary to this, the movie also shows how its easy to sit there and criticise, or to lose everything, and how much tact, skill and resilience (and people/business skills!!) is required to build and maintain something. We could be talking about running a mafia business or your local football team, or your life.If there are any imperfections, then I respectfully submit that it lies with the viewer.",

The Godfather is a wonderful film with a compelling story arch of a good American war hero being pulled into the depths of organized crime due to his loyalty to family. While Part II makes an attempt to elaborate and deepen this theme it does very little to bring anything new to it.  Michael's loss of his family and the fate of his brother Fredo is obvious by the end of the first reel. Such a predictable plot undermines what would otherwise be an interesting sequel to a great film. Only the flashback scenes with Robert DeNiro as a young Vito Corleone has any of the emotion and energy of the original Godfather.  If only the rest of the film was written and directed with such flair. I was so disappointed by The Godfather:  Part II that I haven't even bothered to see Part III and I have little interest in Coppola's other work to this day.",

            "content": "Francis Ford Coppola won three Oscars for his work on the 1974 film The Godfather Part II, the rare sequel that outdoes the original. The original was a masterpiece, and everyone knew it. And I must say that it is pretty difficult to outdo a masterpiece. But Coppola and his screenwriter Mario Puzo really knock it out of the park the second time.The Godfather Part II tells two stories this time: One is of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who now has a family with his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), but really nobody, including his sister Connie (Talia Shire) loves him because he has let the power go to his head. After an assassination attempt, Michael goes on the hunt for the bastard who tried to kill him. The second story is the back story of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), whose family was murdered when he was a boy, and basically he too is seeking vengeance.What I love about The Godfather Part II, besides the fact that it tells two stories, is that it covers the ground that the original film did, but this one digs deeper. The first film mainly focused on family and betrayal. This one focuses on betrayal in the family, which makes for a much juicier and shocking story. The Godfather Part II is a stunner, mainly because you never know where it's going to go, or how it's going to get there.The sequel is more interesting than its predecessor. This one feels a little more like a thriller. Pacino gives one of his best performances here. Here he plays such a complex character. You know that he never wanted any of this, and it is terrible just to see how far he will take it. What started off as a nice man slowly turns into a monster, and that is sort of what keeps the film afloat.The Godfather trilogy is a special one, and this one is the main reason why. This film is a masterpiece, and it is no wonder that it became the first sequel ever to win best picture. It is a difficult decision, because I really do love the first one. But this is a much more interesting and fascinating film than the original. Either way, they are both very amazing movies. I don't know when Francis Ford Coppola will make another movie. But what I do know is that he won't be able to make another one like this again.A+",

However today 15.7.12 I layed my eyes upon the masterpiece of terrible films I mean it truly is shockingly boring. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. Robert De Niro's role: My second favourite actor of all time after Jack Nicholson who does proud in practically ever film I've seen with De Niro in until today. I mean what in Gods holy name did he win an Oscar for this pile of **beep** he wasn't even in half the film. Thoroughly disappointed, no wonder he didn't appear at the Academy Awards because he probably thought what the hell I am I doing winning an Oscar for the worlds most boring films ever. He probably felt embarrassed. How people and watch that film and actually enjoy it is beyond me. I don't think I am exaggerating either to be completely honest I only watched the film to the end to see if Michael Corleone died to boy was he getting on my nerves. I sorry if I have offended anyones opinion but if you want to sit and enjoy a film watch Pulp Fiction which by the way on paper if one worse that The Godfather Part II.",

I am yet to see the 3rd chapter in this series i am not confident that it will live up to this of the first one but i am sure it will be good.

            "content": "My opinions on this movie are a bit mixed. The opening for the film was brilliant as it delves into the early life of Vito Corleone and then flash-forwards to the story of his son Michael Corleone following the events of The Godfather (1972). It was all interesting up until it started faltering during the lengthy middle portion of the film, when Michael travels around to various different places meeting different underworld figures. The pacing and editing was quite bad during the middle portion, so much so that I even found it somewhat boring to watch. It could have been better if Francis Ford Coppola was willing to trim some bits here and there during the middle portion. Nevertheless, the final portion of the film was back on track and largely made up for the weak middle portion. Like the original Godfather, the last 80 minutes of The Godfather Part II were very gripping and moving, with the ending probably being even more powerful than that of the original. The film had the potential to be just as good as, if not better than, the original Godfather if only if it wasn't for the overall inconsistency and the weak middle portion of the film.As for the performances, Al Pacino was again brilliant as Michael Corleone, while Robert De Niro was also very believable as a young Vito Corleone. The other cast members were also impressive, with some of the more minor characters from the first film, like John Cazale (as Fredo Corleone) and Diane Keaton (as Kay), getting more major roles this time around. Although I have criticized this film quite a bit, those criticisms are only relative to its predecessor, as The Godfather Part II is still quite easily among the greatest crime films of all time in its own right.9/10",

            "content": "Citizen Cane, Casablanca, Lawerence Of Arabia and The Godfather are the American classics that usually vie for top film honors on all time great lists. Well, I can't argue those choices, but I can argue for the inclusion of, in my humble opinion, the greatest American film ever made, The Godfather Part II.I truly believe that Coppola topped himself with his second installment of the operatic crime drama. The parallel story structure was expertly crafted, with the rise of Michael story line soaring to Shakespearean heights. The acting, editing, cinematogragphy and writing are so tight that I can't pick a single flaw, a single moment that doesn't work or isn't pitch perfect. One thing I will concede is that for some, the story might unfold a touch slower than The GodFather and of course James Caan and Marlon Brando are only in it for a couple of scenes at the end. The major acting assignments in Godfather II fall solely in the hands of two film icons, Robert Deniro and Al Pacino both are unbelievable, both are at their best, especially Deniro who gives the audience no doubt that he will grow up to become the \"Don\" himself.Other notable performances are John Cazale and Lee Strasberg, actually every casting decision is note perfect, we believe everyones performance so much that they will forever be linked to those creations. I think the thing I love the most is the arc that Michael goes through, where he ends up at the end of Godfather II is so tragic and honest that the last shot of Pacino sitting, that look of pain, of loneliness of inexplicable loss, is engraved on my soul. Its a story of fathers and sons, we witness the connection of fates of choices and of lives over a century, its amazing. I know it is recognized but I think it should be regarded as a better film than the first one, by a slim margin but a margin nonetheless.",

Here, they're both still being somewhat underused but Ms. Keaton has a great scene when she reveals what really happened to her upcoming baby and Ms. Shire has a nearly as such scene when she mentions Fredo near the end. Speaking of whom, John Cazale is fine in reprising the role as the weak Corleone brother. And Al Pacino was probably at his very best in this, his second feat at portraying Michael Corleone especially during scenes with his mentor Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth. Francis Ford Coppola is aces as both the co-writer (with creator Mario Puzo) and director as he handles scenes from both the late '50s concerning Michael and the early 20th century concerning his father Vito, here played in an Oscar-winning turn by Robert De Niro speaking mostly in Italian. So on that note, I highly recommend The Godfather: Part II.",

However, there are new challenges that cross the Corleone family. There are also new characters, some the family is familiar with and some not. There are also new enemies and obstacles the family face. One of the main differences is that the story does not take place only in New York.

Pacino's change from the first film is revolutionary, and Cazale is perfect as the unfortunate Fredo, and the rest of the massive cast are excellent.

Perhaps the most overrated trilogy ever. I really do believe so much of this hype & attention should be given to some other much BETTER films, like \"Iron Will\", which was a true story. Or the \"Great Escape\", another true story! Maybe it's just evident how much of a FETISH Hollywood has for violence, blood, gore, sexual innuendos, and bad language! That's NO \"ART\", you can trust me! I'm not much of a fan of Al Pacino, nor any of the work he has done - he just always seems to come off as scary & abusive (with his scary eyes & unpredictable attitudes.) Couldn't Al Pacino take up a KINDER character role here and there sometime soon???The film was a mess, and so was it's sequels! Everything is shot in the dark, most scenes are often times really boring, and half the time you can't understand what the characters are saying 'cause they're speaking in *freaking* Italian!! And don't forget the horrendous false cult of Catholicism especially being depicted on-screen; Catholics are DUPED. They worship idols, believe in a false Jesus, and are only all just about idolatry, bigotry, and superstition. Though to be fair, I did like seeing Robert De Niro here and there, and I liked some of the talk concerning Israel & the Jewish people - because I have quite a soft spot for Jews, because they have literally got a long sad history of persecution, and deserve to be recognised for their incredible genius minds and intelligence.But in the end, that really doesn't matter in a huge porous abomination nonsensical pile of worthless nothing that is this movie!

I'll be even more brazen by stating that it's superior to the original, not an easy thing to do since that was one of the great films of the 20th century. What makes PART TWO just as rich and compelling is that it expands on the scope of PART ONE by exploring the roots of Vito Corleone. So, in a way, PART TWO is as much a prequel as it is a sequel.As the first Godfather movie began breaking box office records all over the world, Paramount was excited about the possibilities of continuing the Corleone saga. Luckily, Mario Puzo's book had plenty of material that wasn't used in PART ONE, and the author was all too happy to collaborate with Francis Ford Coppola again on the screenplay.The cast was also willing and able to reprise their roles for a second time, even James Caan returned for a cameo despite the fact that Sonny met his maker at the toll booth in PART ONE. The origins of Vito Corleone's criminal career meant that the character was going to be resurrected for the sequel, but whether Marlon Brando wasn't interested -or was nixed- has never been made clear. In the end, Coppola chose a promising young actor who would embody acting par excellence even more so than Brando: Robert DeNiro.Besides DeNiro, there were other new faces to the Godfather sequel -actually, continuation is a better word than sequel. Michael V Gazzo, with his raspy voice, joins as Frank Pentangele, who took over the Corleone Brooklyn chapter after Peter Clamenza died of a heart attack. Actor's Studio founder Lee Strasberg was the mentor to Brando, Pacino, DeNiro, Paul Newman, James Dean, and many, many more. Pacino was eager to have his old teacher play the Jewish mobster Hyman Roth and conspired to bring him and Coppola together....by coincidence, of course! Wink, wink.PART TWO opens in 1901 Sicily, where a nine year old Vito Andolini's parents and older brother are murdered by a local Mafia chieftain. Loyal friends help Vito escape from the town of Corleone to a ship that will take him to America....him and a shipload of Italian immigrants hoping to make their mark in their new home. At Ellis Island, a clerical error records his name as Vito Corleone, where he is quarantined due to small pox.Fading out to the present day (1958), Michael Corleone is hosting a big party at his Tahoe estate celebrating the communion of his son Anthony. Much like his father at Connie's wedding, Michael mixes business with pleasure as he receives guests for a private audience. Among the visitors are corrupt state Senator Pat Geary; Johnny Ola right-hand man to mobster Hyman Roth; Connie, now divorced from her second husband -he was a lot luckier than the first- and is about to remarry; and Frank Pentangele, who seeks Michael's permission to wipe out a pair of rivals. I should add that there was another visitor whose scene ended up on the cutting room floor: the late Sonny's daughter now grown up and seeking her uncle's blessing for her own nuptials.Michael seems to be completely oblivious that his wife Kay is becoming disillusioned because she's aware that his promise of his family's legitimacy is never going to happen. This feeling is reinforced when, just like Vito in PART ONE, an assassination attempt occurs on their property as gunmen open fire on the bedroom window. The shooters are eventually found dead, and Michael suspects that there's a traitor within the Family that took part in the shooting.Leaving Tom temporarily in charge, Michael travels incognito with a bodyguard on a train to Miami to meet Hyman Roth, an elderly Jewish gangster obviously modelled after Meyer Lansky. Together, they travel to Havana to finalize lucrative hotel deals with Cuba's dictator Fulgencio Batista, with Fredo to follow later with a$2 million in cash as a \"gift\" for the Cuban strongman. Soon to join them for New Year's celebrations is Nevada Senator Pat Geary, who's a lot less hostile to Michael ever since the Corleone family bailed him out of a messy situation.One of the most pivotal scenes in PART TWO occurs when the American contingent -minus old man Roth and Ola- are at a nightclub. A slip of the tongue from Fredo reveals that he was the traitor that aided in the assassination attempt, the revelation of which hits Michael like a punch to the solar plexus. The evening's festivities will come to an abrupt end when Castro seizes power on January 1 rendering the Mafia's deal with Batista up in smoke. And Fredo flees for his life after Michael gives him the kiss of death: \"I know it was you, Fredo! You broke my heart\".Coppola sporadically flashes back to 1917 New York City, where Vito Corleone is a hard working immigrant determined to put food on his family's table. He drifts into small time criminal activity quite by accident, through his association with Tessio and Clamenza. They come dangerously close to encroaching onto the territory of vicious Black Hand gangster Don Fanucci. To save their skins, the enterprising trio are forced to pay Fanucci a piece of their action to avoid violent reprisals. Fed up with the constant extortion from Fanucci, Vito plots to kill him and take over his rackets.Once Fanucci is out of the picture, Vito postures himself as a benevolent Don who will only use violence as a last resort, thus earning him the respect of his fellow Sicilian immigrants. With Tessio and Clamenza, Vito forms the legitimate Genco Olive Oil Company, with the goods to be exported by Tomassini, his partner from the old country. Vito is also able to help Tomassini become the Mafia don in his ancestral land....and extract vengeance on the man who murdered the Andolini family. We also learn how Tomassini came to be confined to a wheelchair.If cinematographer Gordon Willis was the person standing behind Coppola to stand out in PART ONE, then production designer Dean Tavoularis is the one who flourishes in PART TWO. Re-creating turn of the century New York down to the last detail is a daunting task, but Tavoularis brilliantly pulls it off, from Ellis Island to the streets of Brooklyn. He also does an outstanding job of turning the Dominican Republic into pre-Castro Cuba, from the urban poverty of Havana to the glittering hotels.The performances in PART TWO are as impeccable as they were in PART ONE. At the film's final fadeout, the soulless Michael sits brooding in his chair after having eliminating all of his enemies. He bears no resemblance at all to the Michael who first appeared in the original at his sister's wedding wearing his military uniform. This is underscored by a flashback sequence featuring all four brothersin happier times just prior to Michael's enlisting in the Marines after Pearl Harbor.John Cazale has more to offer here than he did in the original. The boathouse scene in particular, featuring him and Pacino, perfectly crystalizes the middle child syndrome Fredo had been suffering from all those years, and Cazale gives it his all. But of all the cast, DeNiro especiallyis a standout as the younger Vito Corleone, speaking all of his dialogue in Italian with subtitles....and winning him his first Oscar -for Best Supporting Actor.Unlike its predecessor, THE GODFATHER PART TWO was the unchallenged winner at the Academy Awards, winning six, including for Best Picture, making this the only time a movie and its continuation would accomplish this feat. Coppola won the director's prize that was denied him for the original, plus another screenplay Oscar for him and Puzo. The remaining pair of statuettes were for the music, and for Tavoularis' superb art and production design.The great Billy Wilder once said that THE GODFATHER PART TWO was one of the top five movies ever made. Pauline Kael called it \"an epic vision of the corruption of America\". The two Godfather movies -number three is hardly worth mentioning- are supreme examples of high art, rich in drama and character. If Shakespeare himself watched both of them back to back, even he would have acknowledged that a new champion would have to be crowned.",

So while this is the first movie that includes Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in one movie, the time line constraints did not allow for them to be in the same scene (wouldn't make any sense, you'll understand when and if you have watched the movie). Also De Niro won an Oscar (funny fact, for the same role/character Marlon Brando won one in the first Godfather, must be a first and I don't know if it happened again, doubt it though) while Al Pacino didn't. And while it may seem unfair to Pacino, it was more than well deserved for De Niro, who really merged himself into the character that Brando created. From the way he talked, to gestures to mannerisms. Everything is there!But the movie won a few Oscars and the acting was really good too. The story continues (though gives us a few flashbacks) from the ending of part 1. So while the first one is conclusive and has a satisfying ending itself, the story could be continued. Especially with the original author on board (Mr. Puzzi). There are new themes introduced in this movie. One big one is loneliness. And it's not only about being alone when you have power or being the Godfather. As with the first movie this explores quite a lot of things in Gang related family living.A great movie that was even longer than the first one (and the sequel that came after it). But you probably won't mind the length. Especially if you buy into the drama, that really works. And even without it stating the time jumps/leaps it makes, you'll get the (time) change on your own.

In this movie we see the rise of Vito Corleone to become The Godfather and how Michael Corleone expands his family business but we also see his moral degradation.In the Godfather we see Vito Corleone has no regrets for his deeds because he had maintained his virtues but in this movie Michael regrets his deeds very much because he has morally degraded(which we see at the end).This is a fair depiction of \"changing times\".

Nino Rota's powerful score flies over as absorbingly as it did in the original.Overall,this is even more an accomplished piece of film-making than the original and a must-see if you want to see the ultimate conclusion to that.*****",

So you could say the expectations for this film were high.I saw the original Godfather a few months ago and while I liked it, it didn't feel to me as amazing as people make it out to be. Part II on the other hand grabbed me right from the start and I loved every minute of it.The film tells two stories simultaniosly. One is a direct continuation of the first film, in which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) tries to balance his family life and leading the Corleone family's criminal empire. The other tells the story of a young Vito Corleone (Robert deNiro) who is the godfather from the first film. The two different stories make the three hour run-time fly by. The slices we get of each story are perfectly paced in a way that makes every scene interesting.This film is also a visual masterpiece. The directing and editing are flawless and the production design is also amazing. The costumes and props bring the 50s and 1900s alive in a beautiful way. The score is also perfect for the film.All the performances are great, but Robert deNiro and Al Pacino go above and beyond in this movie. They are the final piece in the puzzle for telling the coming up-story of Vito and the tragic tale of Michael.It's films like this that truly deserve a \"perfect\" score of 10.",

Despite all the famous lines, the scenes don't ring true. Michael hates Fredo inside at the ball but wants to save him minutes later on the street. Only to hate him again when they get home. And they constantly refer to Marlon Brando. They must say \"Papa\" or \"Pop\" 40 times. Constantly reminding the audience that the first movie was better is not a good move. When I was a kid I wanted \"The Towering Inferno\" to win Best Picture because I thought it was a better movie. I still do. \"Chinatown\" should have won that year.

It is more than just the acting, or the directing, or the story. It is everything which makes up that film. So The Godfather II (as did the first The Godfather) presents us all with something of a dilemma. It was made in the early Seventies when, possibly, the public, though not the police and the FBI, were largely unaware of the reality of the Mafia. The yellow press (called the red tops here in the UK) gave them unlimited publicity, and even when we were shown pictures of the bullet-riddled bodies of bosses lying outside barbershops and restaurants, there was a certain thrill about it all. Then came The Sopranos, whose central conceit of a Mafia head of a family suffering from panic attacks was more or less the keynote to a certain disrespect of the whole shooting match, and the public's view is different. We now see the Mafia for what it they are: nasty, brutish, cynical, heartless, sadistic thugs with, it would seem, no redeeming features. Forget all that talk of 'honour' and 'loyalty', these men, and the women who tolerated their brutality and were quite happy to live off its proceeds, were and are scum. So what to make of films such as the Godfather series? They are extremely well-made, well-written, well-directed, well-acted, well-designed and they stand head and shoulders above their peers. But in an odd sort of way, these films are thoroughly devalued by the central lie they tell. Vito Corleone and his son Michael are portrayed as honourable men, wise men, men to be admired. They are almost portrayed, in their convoluted heroism, as honest men. But they are nothing of the kind. They are brutal and murderous and do not deserve to be admired. The men in The Sopranos apparently came far closer to portraying the real mafiosi. Indeed real mafiosi are widely quoted as saying as much. So why did Coppola choose to present them as something close to heroes? And that brings me back to my first question and the very real dilemma faced by someone making a judgement of these very well-made films: as the portrayal of what is basically scum as honourable men is so central to Coppola's films, where does that leave the films? I really have no answer. As a piece of entertainment, of course, the Godfather films are superb. But once you consider the wider context, the butchery, the misery, the killing, the heroin dealing, the pimping, the whoring, you do have to wonder. As film-making this would get 8/9 our of 10. But given the corrupt moral ambiguity at its centre, only a 5.",

Very, very few movies feature characters that bring so much to the screen, and the study of power in The Godfather series will forever be etched in history for its brilliance.Personally I'd probably have to rank Part II above the first movie even, largely due to Hyman Roth and the conflict that brews between him and Michael. As an antagonist, he brings a bit more to the table than Barzini in the first movie. Part II also benefits from legendary performances from both Al Pacino and Robert de Niro as young Vito.The 1970s was the decade for films as art, more than any other decade.

            "review_title": "A very good sequel, but I still prefer the first film",
            "content": "Both The Godfather and The Godfather part II are really good films. Both have excellent performances, and both films move at that same leisurely pace that never becomes boring. But the film I prefer is the first, even though the second is more detailed about what the Corleone family does. I guess I prefer it because it was more original, and Marlon Brando, who doesn't appear in the second even though Francis Ford Coppola tried getting him to reprise his role at the end of the movie, isn't there.With The Godfather part II we have two stories going on. And that is the other weakness of the second film. One involves Michael Corleone (Pacino)as the new Don maintaining his power and pushing to keep his control. The second involves the early life of Vito Corleone and how he became the Godfather of the first film. Robert DeNiro, in an exceptional performance, plays the part of the young Vito Corleone. Both stories are played back and forth, and as big events happen in one the plot shifts to the other, which is a little distracting. I would've preferred that Copolla stuck with one story instead because it would've worked a lot better. Of course I can understand why he did it. He wanted to get two of the biggest stars of their generation together in one film, and both Pacino and DeNiro were up to the challenge even though Brando was still irreplaceable.DeNiro looks really young, and Al Pacino looks much older than in the first, even though both films were only separated by two years. I don't know if it was clever make-up or just Pacino's phenomenal acting that made it so.The ending of The Godfather part II is incredibly strong though as it shifts back to a time when Michael was certain he was never going to be part of the family business, only to shift back to the present as he sits by himself in his home after key events have happened. It was like a realization as Pacino's character completely accepts what he has become. Strong movie definitely, but the first film, in my opinion, is still better. However both films still should be seen. You can't just watch one and not the other. Godfather part II may not be the greatest sequel ever, but it is still one incredible experience.",

            "content": "A look back and look forward at how the Mafia don Vito Corleone gained his original power and the continuing saga of how a son (Michael) chooses to drive forward the criminal empire of his late father.As the great American novel has not been written (an opinion just as popular in America as elsewhere) our cousins over the sea have no option but to over praise the work of better-than-average pulp writers. The vastly overrated Ernest Hemmingway, the junk master that was a Peter Benchley and the schlock with snobbery that is Thomas Harris. Don't get me wrong, all very readable - but great art? Great vision? Something you couldn't live a full and happy life without?As the groundbreaking film maker Spaniard Luis Bunuel once said: \"Today's culture is unfortunately inseparable from economic and military power. A ruling Nation can impose its culture and give a worldwide fame to a second-rate writer like Hemingway. Steinbeck is important due to American guns. Had Dos Passos and Faulkner been born in Paraguay or in Turkey, who'd read them?\" The self-opinions of Mario Puzo (script and book) are probably in line with the above. Until he wrote the Godfather he even worried about keeping food on the table. How can you consider yourself an artist when you are writing rubbish like Earthquake? However, give him credit, he saw Hell's Kitchen for real and it shows.With the Godfather saga many people mistake a heavy subject for heavy writing. However well done it is (production values are sky high and the casting is a dream) this isn't anything more than a thousand TV writers couldn't knock up. While simultaneously looking back and looking forward can be confusing (one of these things that you need to warned about) it leads you to believe that the ex don is a better person than the future don simply because he had so much pushed on to his plate and had to make tough decisions. However he kills to replace the corrupt and becomes equally corrupt himself. Only on a bigger scale.Men of honour is nonsense - they beat/killed, threatened and bribed. They never made any money, they simply took money. If you are interested they took just as readily from criminals (like drug dealers) as they did from honest people. While this shows power being taken at the point of a gun - where are the goons beating the grocery store owner because he wouldn't pay the protection money? Such a scene would shatter this movie like it would a 1,000 foot drop would shatter a Chinese Ming vase.Coppola doesn't like film editors - they want to cut out scenes of people looking in to the middle distance, waiting for people to arrive and generally repeating themselves. The Mafia is male world and the women don't have much of a life - they don't even get to bring in cups of tea. The men are not happy people, but if they paid their electricity bills and had a hobby it would help. The moral is an obvious one - money doesn't buy happiness. But it allows you to be miserable in (Long Island) comfort.Director Coppola and writer Puzo had no choice but to write this as a tragedy. They lay it on too thick though, as they are trying to bring in higher morals to a story that doesn't have it and (as I said above) it doesn't want to kick over enough rocks. This accepted the cast is amazing - Robert DeNiro is on especially fine form - but the message(s) are uneven and dubious. All cons are full time liars and they even lie to themselves - in this little world the words mean little and we have too many of them.",

I rank \"The Godfather: Part II\" as the third greatest sequel I've ever seen, behind \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Toy Story 2.\" Like those two films, this sequel does not attempt to use the same structure and style as the original. Godfather II shows Michael Corelone's (Al Pacino) struggle to hold his father's crime empire together as he begins to abuse his power, and this is combined with flashback scenes showing how Vito Corleone (played excellently by Robert DeNiro in an Oscar-winning role here) came to form his empire. I don't even understand why I like the film so much, as it grows more depressing and disheartening as the film goes on. Nevertheless, it is amazingly brilliant nonetheless. At almost three and a half hours long, the film is not slow-paced at all. It moves along smoothly, yet it takes plenty of time to adequately convey both stories in great detail. The flashbacks are the real highlight of this film, and watching Robert DeNiro as he begins to gain power is engaging and very interesting to watch. It's amazing how much different Michael's character is in this film from the first one. This doesn't top the first film for me, probably because Marlon Brando, who made part I so great, is not in it. Nevertheless, this is easily the best picture of 1974, and the performances are some of the best I've ever seen.***1/2 out of ****",

Unfortunately, the film takes a hard right half an hour in and turns into a convoluted game of Clue that I struggled to understand or care about. Al Pacino, whose transformation was complete at the end of the original masterpiece, does great work and works much of the movie magic where the script allows him to. DeNiro is captivatingly subtle in his role as young Vito Corleone, and the trio of Keaton, Cazale and Duvall, who flew under the radar in the original, do some fantastic work as well. However, the film's plot focuses heavily on a mystery that is too confusing to follow and Francis Ford Coppola falls into the errors of the original by introducing swathes of interchangeable Italian-American men who are impossible to tell apart. As time goes on I am sure that I'll remember the best moments fondly and will be tempted to bump it up, but that will only be because I forgot how agonising it was to sit through 3 hours and 20 minutes.",

It improves on almost everything from the first film while still feeling like its own entity.The story picks up shortly after where the first left off, with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) now in control of his father's crime empire. But as he tries to legitimize the family business and move them out West, new problems - and old enemies - begin to arise, putting him in danger both physically and emotionally. Meanwhile, we also see a series of flashbacks showing us how Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) rose to power in New York City during the early 1900s. These two storylines are expertly interwoven together by director Francis Ford Coppola to create a truly epic saga about family, betrayal, honor...and ultimately redemption.Pacino and De Niro both give career-best performances; Pacino especially shines as he conveys Michael's internal struggle between being ruthless businessman and loving husband/father perfectly. The rest of cast is great too; Diane Keaton returns as Kay Adams-Corleone while Talia Shire reprises her role as Connie Corleone Rizzi (Michael's sister). There are so many memorable scenes throughout this movie that it would be impossible to list them all here; suffice it say that The Godfather Part II is an absolute classic that belongs atop any \"Best Movies Ever\" list.",

These are the movies which go beyond the ratings and awards. The Godfather (1 and 2) is one such movie(s). To give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and I am not making any attempt to do so. These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies.Thus, I present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart.The first scene of the movie, the traditional kissing of the hand of the Don, shows Michael taking over his father's place. Subsequent scenes show you that though he has taken over his father's seat, he is nothing like the old Don. The charismatic supremo is replaced by an angry, impatient man.The movie touches upon the life of immigrants to the new blooming world America wherein begins our former godfather's story. The story of young Vito Corleone runs parallel to the present day Don. The story of the great man is unfolded beautifully and entwined well with the present.In one scene, the relationship with present Don and his kid is intercepted by the young Vito Corleone, a young and handsome R. De Niro, playing with his little son, which enhances the contrast lifestyle of the two leading men.Attention to detail has been given the utmost importance and the scene in which the lead actor watches a play, which though irrelevant to the story is heart touching, is a proof for this.There are times when you just can't take your eyes off the well chiseled face of Robert De Niro and long for him to come back on screen.As the movie unfolds, we see how the Don junior tries hard to keep his personal life & business in place, something which the senior had done with ease. In one scene, the new don's anger at his wife for having aborted their to be boy child vis-\u00e0-vis the distress troubled look on old don's face while seeing his young son treated by a nurse shows the disparity in the way the two men handled their families.While Don Vito was as much a family man as he was a Godfather, his son, Michael fails to keep his family together. Like the icy cold winter snow, the relationship between the husband and wife is harsh and dry. True to his words, the \"Times were changing \".As the movie progresses, we see how the once well built, tightly held family by De Niro is slowly losing its strength and grip under his son.The love for his wife and kids in Niro's eyes in contrast to the anger in Michael's eyes for his wife underlines the entire movie.The story ends similar to the first movie, where all the Don's enemies are killed, whether they are part of family or not.Climax of movie sums up the life of Michael and the drastic changes over the years about his views and relationship he had with his father.",

All well and good.Can't say that about the flashbacks, Deniro is alright and the tone is fine, but it Really does slow things down in a big way-I don't think you'd lose all that much if they just had yanked that chunk right outta the film completely.

However, upon watching this film, I have to say, this film might actually be better than the original Godfather. It's hard to say definitely because they are such different films, and myself, I can't really say which film is better due to said difference, but there are certainly elements here that work better than they did in the original Godfather, and at the very least the two films are comparable in terms of quality (and trust me even that is high praise).",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II has been called the greatest sequel of all time. I'm pretty sure The Empire Strikes Back may have a thing or two to say on the topic, though, both films could probably have shared the same title.Over the last 40 years, I have returned to watch Godfather II many times. There are cases where you get on in age and find new meaning in old art. Sometimes you decide you were wrong about a book, movie or what have you. Some things get better with age, some fond memories turn sour. I never liked Godfather II and nearly 50 years after it's release, I still don't like it. It's true to form really, because the biggest problem with Godfather II is nothing changes from the beginning to the end: Michael is a crook at the start and he's the same crook at the end. The movie has nowhere to go and instead recycles themes better played in the original because there was money to be made from rehashing a better film - one with a story and one with a much, much deeper cast of characters.The 'plot' has some leftovers Puzo and Coppola mined from chapters in the original novel with DeNiro that aren't bad but my god the rest with Havana and Vegas is just drivel covering old territory. Fredo screwing around in Vegas is just the Johnny Fontaine story all over again. And the whole 'kiss of death' still feels silly. I think The Freshman with Broderick shows others got the joke too.The three and a half hour running time is Coppola's ego at play from start to finish. The original Godfather was a tough film on Coppola, but sometimes that's how high art is made. The behind the scenes struggle on a median budget produced something that rose far above the source novel and even the producers aspirations. It cannot be over-sold how important Marlon Brando was to that film and film history at large. Brando was at the height of his art, running point guard with a bunch of hungry kids in the championship game. The sequel feels like a foul-line finish with high school bench-warmers in comparison. And even with De Niro on board, to repeat it, not much happens in Godfather II. Every time I have had this conversation over the decades - people have always said the same thing to me \"but Michael kills his brother!\". Look, I love John Cazale, but if you even saw the end of the first film, you watch as Michael calmly escorts his brother-in-law to be murdered. The man is carted away kicking his last breath through a windshield - and so Fredo's death is no surprise. We've been here already. Less is more and we know by the end Michael Corleone will do literally anything . It's all right there in Kay's face in the final frame of the original - and that's how less is more and indeed filmmaking work best: Show, don't tell. There's sooooo much talking and grandiose Pacino pronouncements in Godfather II by comparison, scenes carry no weight and I never cared who lived or died in the beginning or the end.Godfather II is also a case-in-point for the career-long problems with Francis Ford Coppola not as a 'filmmaker' but more as a poor storyteller. As grand and highfalutin his films may reach in vision, the story is often nowhere to be found. He has occasionally rejected the common dramatic structures, but I've yet to see him do better. In recent years it seems that Coppola came to this same realization and has pulled the George Lucas Special Edition job on both Apocalypse Now and Godfather III. Even if improvements could be made, I'm in the camp of \"What's done cannot be undone.\" let the films be a product of their time and place. Make new stories, don't rehash old loves. Coppola has said that Godfather III was about regret. I would argue that covers a number of the films he has made. For me, Godfather II is the most specific example.Just as Macbeth says, \"Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.\"",

            "content": "Two years after the original Godfather was released, the Godfather Part II came out. This time, it scored Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Art- set direction. It has been labeled by many fans of film and critics alike to be the only film that actually is superior to the original. It also remains in Oscar history the only film sequel to win best Picture as well as the original. I beg to differ with the critics and fans. The sheer beauty of the Godfather is lost in this film. It plays upon images that have already been seen before instead of catching the eye of the viewer with better photography. The musical score is a stand out job, really adding to the effect of the film. Al Pacino is good here as the now corrupted Micheal, but his acting seems a bit less focused then it should be and it doesn't seem as if he's really acting. In support is Robert De Niro, who took home his first Oscar and didn't even speak a word of english in the movie. He shines in this role as his life leads onto from being a peasant to being a crime lord. The flashback sequences are frustratingly too organized, and instead of giving the viewer something to ponder about it rather just shows them the images. Coppola's direction is arguably a lot more confident and realistic, another thing that adds to the effect. The script is rather good as well, focusing on each character as specifically as possible, but it's not quite as good as the original. The Godfather Part II loses itself in time, making it over three hours and feeling a bit stretched with the entire Cube sequence. Unfortunately, Roman Polanski's Chinatown was released the same year and lost a majority of it's Oscars to this movie. In my opinion, Chinatown should've taken Best Picture and Best Art- Set direction. The Godfather Part II packs in a lot more stuff then the first one, it tries hard to really knock the message in tight. It does, but the movie itself feels too overdone. Good sequel, nowhere near the original however. 8.5/10",

The son that came home from the war was given a job to look after the family after his father died. In the end of that movie, his own son became the new godfather. Now comes The Godfather: Part II. But, before I start my review on The Godfather; Part II, let me tell you about my rule of thumb on sequels. For many years, sequels have been trashed, criticized harshly and been disowned. Audiences do go to see sequels, but they don't understand the concept of a great or good sequel. So, I will turn your attention to my review of The Godfather: Part II. The movie tells us two story lines, one showing us how the original godfather, Vito Corleone, came to America in the beginning of the 20th century and one telling us the story of Michael Corleone, taking over his father's empire. Corleone, in a younger age, is played by Robert De Niro, who won a Best Supporting Actor in 1975 at the Academy Awards, and his journey in New York leads him into becoming the godfather of the original film. But even though this is a sequel, this movie is actually a prequel to the original film. Corleone's story is one of the main points of the movie and how he rose to power over the years before 1958. The other main point involves his son, Michael, played by Al Pacino, coming into play as being the godfather after his father dies in the original and in this movie, he takes on his father's job, where his relationship with his wife, played by Diane Keaton, takes a toll and he begins to experience the life of a matriarch, more specific, a hard-working matriarch. Pacino in this movie give a memorable performance in this movie and also in the original. But, there's something different about Michael Corleone. He's more powerful than the original film. If you remember the first movie, you'll realizes that he didn't want to be with the family, or be involved with the family's business because he wanted to live his own life. But, when his father died, however, he accepts the role of being the new godfather. To me, this movie is ranked pretty much up to the original, but this sequel and some sequels are bad and some sequels are good. The Godfather: Part II is a great sequel, more far-reaching than ever and much more in depth with the original. Why is it that great of a sequel? Well, first of all, the movie takes the characters to a new place and have them go on a different scenario in which they can drawback to the original. The business that Michael gets involved with in Cuba in 1958 is well-told. The drawbacks in this movie relies on flashbacks from Don Vito's early career in the early 1920's and 1930's. The movie features some of the other family members of the Corleone's clan, like Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall and Sonny Corleone, one of the Corleone sons, played by James Caan. To me, those flashbacks builds up the supporting parts that made The Godfather great. Not only great, but also revolutionary. If you put all of the pieces together, than you got yourself an epic story of one man, who was poor as a little boy from Italy, grow up and became inventive with his ideas and made himself an empire of his own people and his own family. His actions were direct and his journey was worth watching. It's amazing that audiences will buy a movie like this and see it and go to the movies to see this movie and not understand the supporting backdrop to The Godfather. Coppola directed this movie and amazingly, he won an Oscar for Best Director and the movie itself won Best Picture. The Godfather: Part II was the first sequel to every win an Academy Award. Even though I am not a member of the Academy, my opinion this movie is that it fully deserved the Oscar and does make sense for its story-telling and its magnificent scope of Don Vito's life. The transformation is far more superior than other movie character every to be told or made. The enormous ground-braking history behind the two Godfather movies brings out the American Dream. The two other movies is not about living in the American Dream, where you can pursue happiness and live life. The American Dream in the two Godfather movies is more different than what one's will say. The truth is that the American Dream consists of hard work and dignity. Anyone can pursue the American Dream, but only one will succeed by pursuing their own journey and making the best out of something giant. Giant like the empire Vito build on. It's more than a mob story. The Godfather: Part II is a great movie, with more in depth information amongst the characters and story-telling at its finest. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 4 stars.",

The Godfather Part II is a more ambitious production than the original since it attempts not only to tell a pair of completely disconnected stories, but to do so in parallel. The less time consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into power. The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the conclusion of The Godfather, and shows the means by which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba. Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one. The Godfather 2 is a masterpiece and should be a must watch for any serious cinema lover.",

After realizing that my favorite movie of all times was ranked number 1 in the IMDb list I thought it might be a good idea to watch all of the movies in the best 250 ranking... I'm starting to have second thoughts...Ten years ago when I watched the Godfather for the first time I had no knowledge of English and I was almost a kid. My first impression of the movie was that it was plain boring. I have just watched \"The Godfather\" again ten years later. I am about to be twenty-seven years-old and I am a professor of English as a second language in two universities of my country so I can no longer think that my impression of the movie is biased by my young age or my lack of understanding of English -oh, I also speak Italian by the way.After such a disappointment I didn't set up my hopes too high for its second installment... well, at least I can say I am not disappointed now because this is indeed a bad movie just like I expected. This movie is simply way too overrated. I am not saying this is a bad movie but it does NOT deserve his current position as 3rd greatest movie of all times.I would really like to understand what it is that people see in movies like these. The plot is silly and confusing. Yes, the acting is more than decent but if there is no story to it there is little the actors can do to keep you intrigued.Finally, if you have not watched this movie yet and feel tempted to do so, I recommend you get some decent movies like Kung Fu Panda or Inception and have some fun or go ahead and watch it and waste two hours of your life.Regards, MANIUIS.",

            "review_title": "Part 2 of the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, period! (Here are the reviews of parts 1-2-3 together)",
            "content": "Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word \"perfection\"? Well, \"The Godfather\" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely \"perfect\" in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the \"American Dream\"; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes \"The Godfather\", the strongest brand of cinema till today 10/10",

Every single imaginable element of a film is displayed at its absolute finest.Perhaps my very favorite thing about this movie is the incredible, incredible performance by Al Pacino. Marlon Brando was excellent, but unlike Brando's, Al Pacino's character was far more complicated. He couldn't just say, \"I am going to make him an offer he can't refuse\" in a slick Italian voice and accomplish the role. He so masterfully and ingeniously displayed the coldness of his character. He can say so much without opening his mouth. His stare, his movement, his subtly, everything is just incredible. The supporting cast is very good as well, perhaps the worst performance being that of Talia Shire, who is still alright.The two storyline thing is fine. It worked, and it worked well. We get enough of the early life of Vito Corleone story to know how it eventually gave rise to the plot of the first Godfather.

It is for this reason there is nothing like brotherly love. A brother who has betrayed his brother has to be able to face the brother who has been betrayed. The viewers get to see the games which mafia bosses and politicians play with each other. It is amazing to watch how politicians squeeze gangsters finally in order to make quick money. They are also around when a mafia network decides to extend its operations from USA to Cuba. However, it would be perfectly fine to state that this film is also an extension of the concerns that were raised in The Godfather I. Director Francis Ford Coppola was right in choosing to direct two parallel stories in order to establish the presence of Corleone family in viewers' minds. There is a caveat related to the use of Italian language. The lack of subtitles when Italian is spoken by actors makes the comprehension of the film difficult as not everybody can be expected to know Italian.",

Yes, it took its time but there also wasn't much that happened. I didn't have a reason to care for what happened to the characters, everyone except Michael and Tom. I did love seeing Tom stay loyal to Mike and Michael use his wisdom and critical thinking to make good choices and see who betrayed him, but what did it do for him in the long run? Is he just going to keep killing everyone close to him because this business means so much to him? I wanted to love this movie more...

Then, he movie switched back to the late 1950's in Las Vegas, NV, and later in the same time era in Miami, FL, and then back to the late 1800's again. Of course it is interesting in a sense, with Vito Corleone beginning the future of him and his family in New York, and then strongly carrying across the Mafia in, again, Miami.Al Pacino could have been hated in this movie as Michael Corleone, the now-present godfather. He reached the point where he had no family love. Toward anyone of the members of it. Oh, he was cold! He even reached the point where he hated his own wife his own wife.

            "content": "This is \"The Godfather: Part II\", an American movie mostly in the English language, but there are segments in Italian included too. And even a few other languages. I think nothing really needs to be said about the film's status. Way over a million ratings here on imdb are self-explanatory and so are over a thousand reviews. I will happily add mine now and I hope you will like the read. This was by far not the first time that I watched this film, maybe third or fourth, so it was not new or refreshing to me, but this film is certainly also still a high-quality watch the tenth or twentieth time. It's also been quite a long time since I saw this film before yesterday, so I cannot really elaborate on stuff I perceived differently. One aspect, however, is that I remember liking the De Niro parts a lot more on first or second viewing than I did now. No contest for me now that Pacino is the heart and soul of the film and I think most people agree. I have read many film buffs even say that Pacino is better than Brando in the first. The makeup sure helped the latter with the epic status of his role there. Still a bit sad that Pacino did not get the Oscar here. No offense to Art Carney though. Of course, it is also always about the competition. Look at the supporting players from the first Godfather film coming short against Joel Grey. I doubt De Niro would have won there, but it's all speculation anyway. Probably the best picture win was even more obvious for this sequel. Best Director sure was. I got to watch this film at the big screen the other day which had of course to do with the 50th anniversary of the first Godfather movie. They did not show the third though, just the first and second, maybe also because of the big time gap between the second and third film.Anyway, let's look at the plot now. This is to some extent two films in one because a lot of the film takes place before thre first film even while other parts show us what happened after the death of Vito Corleone. It's also not chronological. I remember that I thought De Niro was lead here, but his scenes are so rare in the film's first half that I agree now that probably Pacino is the only lead here. In the second half, there was a lot more De Niro, which helped him with his awards ambitions too I guess. Of course, we also never see De Niro and Pacino on the screen together because there's decades between their characters. We do see De Niro's character though with young Michael when he was a baby. And with young Fredo as well. It's a pity Cazale did not manage to score a nomination for his work here. His scene when he complains about his brother that he was overlooked was one of the finest from the entire film. Maybe his other scenes were not significant enough. Same can be said about Diane Keaton here, who plays Michael's wife. The scene in which she confronts Michael with the unborn's death being an abortion was among the very best from the film, but other than that her screen time was limited. Must also mention Pacino in this scene. Of course, there is a lot of anger with his character, but you will never see him more angry than in this exact moment. He also never really physically attacks people, but there it had to come out. His speech about how it is just not an option that she will get the children was also very haunting. Just like the moment in which he closes the door later on right into Keaton's face. There are so many memorable and haunting moments in here that I cannot mention them all. You just have to experience them and I definitely think you should watch the other film first to really understand the story.Comedy is something you will not find in here at all and if maybe very briefly (you think) you do, then it has a bit to do with Fredo's character like how he will not let go of the suitcase containing the money. You can also wonder if Fredo knew what was about to happen to him in the spectacular finale. There you see how Michael really gets his will again. One antagonist commits suicide. Another is murdered by a contract killer and his own brother also has to pay for what he did, even if it was a long time ago. This killing stays of course maybe most in the mind with how Michael thinks about Fredo and talked about him before that, how he understand that it was Fredo, the kiss, how he confronts him, how he talks to his mother on one occasion. Another brilliant scene. His mother is not a factor otherwise, even if she is a character who is part of both seperate story lines, once as a young woman, once being close to her death. Her being alive was also a guarantee for Fredo to stay alive. I also liked the way the film ended. The setting is basically between both story lines. The boys are grown-up and they tried their best with makeup to have them look young. Especially interesting to see Michael there telling his plans to his brothers and how he is not 10% of the alpha he is for the rest of this film. Briefly before Brando/Vito enters. Even one of the actors from the first film is brought back for that. One who died there in a pretty spectacular sequence. But this sequel here is not chronological at all and does not have to be to fully succeed. My review is not particularly chronological either. I must say the truly great moments from De Niro's character's story here are missing if there is anything to criticize. It is still interesting to watch how he rises, also to see the (familiar) characters he surrounds himself with. How he takes care of the one bullying the neighborhood to kinda become a more distinguished, more dedicated version of him. Also interesting to see how Vito ends up being called Vito Corleone. Very brief moment early on. Actually, there was some comedy to how he dealt with a greedy landlord and this showed us how important loyalty is to him. I mean the comedy included mostly the scene in which the landlord returned.Back to the other scenes again, I must also mention Michael V. Gazzo. Would have loved to see him win the Oscar here. I definitely preferred his antagonist portrayal over Hyman Roth, although it is probably almost impossible to compare those two because their characters could not have been any more different really. Both really good for different reasons. Also interesting to see Lee Strasberg in here with his famous acting institute of course. One of Gazzo's character's most memorable scenes included his brother, but how he unleashed early on against everything non-Italian, no matter if we are talking \"Pop goes the weasle\", Jews or Black people, was also highly entertaining. Nothing against a good tarantella I suppose. As for Roth, I found his most memorable scene was maybe the one from New Year's Eve, even if his character was basically just sleeping there or being in a coma. This was when a hit actually did go wrong, although I wonder where those saviors suddenly came from. The talk between him and Michael (Strasberg's first scene) was good too though. Another hit that went wrong involved Pentangeli (Gazzo). I am not sure I got this right, but it was not Michael's folks behind that one there. Sure turned out clumsy. One character I have not talked about at all was the Corleone sister played by Talia Shire. She had her own agenda and the guy she chose as husband did not make Michael happy. Not much else to say about her. I am surprised Shire was nominated for an Oscar honestly. But yeah all is possible when somebody who is considered (one of) the greatest lead performance(s) in film history does not win his category. Also I must mention Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen). Hagen is still loyal to the family, but his bond to Michael is just not as strong as his bond to Michael's father. Not even close. There are steady conflicts between these two, but they kinda overcome them without their relationship really improving, even if there's moments in which Michael tells Hagen that he is the only one he can trust now. No Fredo, nobody else.You can surely say that Michael also has a tendency to not trust anybody. There was a good quote on that too. I think it came from Pentangeli about the difference in how Michael dealt with the Jews and how Vito did. Speaking of Vito again, as I am getting close to the end of my review, let me of course mention his moment of great revenge when he kills the man who is responsible for murdering his father, his mother and his brother. That had to be included 100% and you simply knew it was going to happen, even if the bad guy was very old at that point already and Vito literally opens his chest with a massive knife. Disguised as a potential olive oil deal. So yeah, also some Italian cuisine aspects included here. No pizza really though. But politics and law. A senator has to find out what happens when he makes an enemy in Michael Corleone. And there is a fairly lengthy courtroom trial too that culminates basically in the scene with Pentangeli's brother that I mentioned earlier already. So many great metaphors and symbolisms in here. Look at Fredo acting almost like a dad towards Michael's son before his demise and how he can finally say that (with the help of God) he was more gifted than his brothers. Even if it was only about fishing. How he talked about fishing being a family tradition etc. How De Niro's character pretty much won over the bad guy in his story line thanks to his grit and courage. And then still proceeded to kill him in the following scene. Sneaky over the rooftops. There's really too much to choose from what your favorite scenes could be. Or favorite shots too. I mean look at the very final shot with Michael having succeeded with every plan of his. How he sits here. This would have been amazing ultimate closure too without a third film happening 15 years later. Back when this was made, Coppola was just in his early 30s. What an achievement for a pretty young filmmaker! Now he is in his early 80s. \"The Godfather: Part II\" is a must-see. Huge thumbs-up. Thanks for reading.",

In \"Part II\" , we see him lose his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. The devolution of Michael Corleone is counterpointed by flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito (Robert De Niro). These scenes, taking place in Sicily and old New York, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. What we have are two compelling narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. \"The Godfather: Part II\" then becomes a film that everyone who values movies at all should see.",

Regarding the ongoing Michael Corleone story, it is about seven years since the events that concluded The Godfather. With the murders of the heads of the other four New York / New Jersey families, the Corleone family has unassailable control in New York. The move to Nevada went smoothly and Michael Corleone controls several hotels and casinos in the state. Frank Pentageli, the man who runs Michael's interests in New York, comes to Michael, asking if he can take out the Rosato Brothers as they are infringing on Pentageli's turf and business interests. However, the Rosatos are backed by Hyman Roth, a business partner of Michael's and a long- time ally of Michael's father, Vito Corleone, and Michael refuses. An attempted assassination attempt is then carried out on Michael's life, in his own home. Michael investigates who is trying to kill him, and suspects that there is a traitor in his family. Meanwhile. Michael and Hyman Roth fly to Cuba to finalise some business deals there. The Cuban trip reveals all. In a story interwoven with the present day, we see the backstory to Vito Corleone. From how his parents and brother were murdered by a Don in their home town of Corleone in Sicily, to his escaping, as a boy, to New York, his adult life and his rise to Don Corleone.A great follow-up to one of the greatest movies ever made. Gritty, solid plot, superb direction by Francis Ford Coppola and excellent performances. The closing scenes are incredibly powerful, showing just how much Michael has changed from the innocent man we met at the start of the first movie.Six Oscar wins, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. Robert De Niro won a Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Vito Corleone, making two Oscar wins for two different actors playing the same character (Marlon Brando got a Best Actor Oscar for his performance in the first Godfather). Al Pacino, Michael V Gazzo, Lee Strasburg (of method acting fame) and Talia Shire also received acting Oscar nominations.Not quite in the same league as the first movie though. The first one had a much tighter plot and better pacing: this does feel a bit padded and slow at times. Not as enthralling and tension-filled as the first. Then again, we are comparing this movie to one of the greatest films of all time...",

Additionally, it intercuts this story with the story of Vito Corleone's rise to power in Italy/early-20th-century New York. All of the camerawork/acting/scoring is still just as good in this movie as in the first one. The Vito Corleone sequences are also enjoyable; IMO just as much as the first movie as well. For me, the Michael storylines - which is the majority of the movie - wasn't as enjoyable as the first movie. Part of it is because he's decidedly more evil and less relatable in this movie. The pacing also seemed worse-executed here; a lot of the jumping back/forth between cities and homes and Michael's traveling around just didn't keep me as engaged. Still a good mob movie, but nowhere near as perfect as the first one.",

Admittedly I watched the film first before Godfather 1 and was astounded with its beauty even after I watched Godfather 1. I realized well after watching Godfather 2 how the character of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone developed well throughout the film, and I quite grasped as well very well his character after I watched Godfather 1. The film was double layered. Viewers would understand in this film Vito Corleone's origin, how he grew and feared by many. On the other hand shows the present son of Vito: Michael, who is struggling to deal with his father's family business left to him. The characters and atmosphere were simply superb, and you could understand well how the story progresses. How Michael got the similarity of the situation he is experiencing as contrast to his father during the early times. We see Vito Corleone 's life progresses during his early years, and we see Michael, being the youngest of the family, adhere to his father's legacy and lived through defending his family and business. We can see how well the father and son got their similarity of managing their business and tried well not to mix family in it. I was so touched in Godfather 1 concerning Michael's affection to his family, most especially to his father. And I was moved with his affection towards his family now in Godfather 2 after his father died how he held on what was dearly important to him. I got the bleak understanding how crime worlds works except since after I watched Godfather 1. Italian countrymen got their pride, their history, their nature, and Mario Puzo had brilliantly depicted a beautiful story out of it. Funny though after I watched the film I didn't even realized that it was Robert De Niro who plays the part of the early Vito Corleone, how mesmerizing.",

            "content": "RELEASED IN 1974 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, \"The Godfather: Part II\" is part sequel and part flashback to the first film with the main story focusing on Michael (Al Pacino) in the late 50s as the stalwart Corleone son who has taken over as 'Godfather' with events taking place at Lake Tahoe, Miami, New York City, Havana (during the Cuban Revolution), and a congressional committee in Washington DC. The flashbacks concern Vito Corleone as a kid in Sicily and his arrival to Ellis Island with the story focusing on Vito's life in New York City when he was in his mid-to-late 20s (Robert De Niro) where he cleverly and boldly establishes himself as the formidable new Don.MAIN CAST: Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom, while John Cazale appears as the weakest Corleone son, Fredo. Diane Keaton returns as Michael's wife, who tries to put out of her mind her husband's shady business with Talia Shire reprising the role of Corleone sister, Connie.The good news is that the flashbacks pertaining to Vito (De Niro) are good, starting with the shocking opening scenes. The saga of Michael (Pacino), by contrast, is relatively dull, particularly the first half, which mostly involves overlong scenes of talky drama. Michael's story simply lacks the energy and highlight-every-15-minutes of the prior film. Moreover, Pacino is thoroughly one-note solemn as Michael, lacking the character's interesting story arc in the first installment and the dimension of the third. I'm not blaming Pacino, as he simply played the role as written and does it well. I'm just saying that he's not a very captivating character, particularly compared to Brando or De Niro as Vito. He's just too one-dimensional and therefore uninteresting. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half culminating with an explosive showdown between Michael and Kay, which had to happen in light of the climatic scene of the previous movie.The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Life's hard enough without taking that shady route.Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with some highlights, but IMHO it's not in the same league as the first movie in overall entertainment. It's good for what it is, but it's overrated by people who can't see beyond nostalgia-tinged glasses. If you're a fan of the first film it's almost mandatory that you watch this one; just don't expect the same dynamic greatness. I know it's sacrilege to say this, but Part II is on par with Part III in tone and quality, although I personally give Part III the edge in all-around entertainment value.THE FILM RUNS 3 hours & 22 minutes (overlong) and was shot in Sicily & Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy; the New York City area; Lake Tahoe, California; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Acireale, Catania; Las Vegas; and Washington DC.

The \"senator we are all part of the same hypocrisy\" resonates what the film is about. De Niro aka Vito brilliants acts out a story of a man pushed into crime who is a ruthless killer, and also plays with his children. De Niro's dualism creates ironic realism of the Vito character. The Godfather Part two sub stories of betrayal, honor, dishonor, corruption, and the damage of the characters' sin is a story which leaves an impact.

Michael will need to flush the rats and determine how deep they've penetrated his infrastructure and if moving the family is the right next step...This movie is directed by Francis Ford Coppola (Dracula) and stars Al Pacino (Scarface), Robert De Niro (Heat), Robert Duvall (Apocalypse Now), Diane Keaton (Annie Hall), Talia Shire (Rocky) and John Cazale (Dog Day Afternoon).The parallel Robert De Niro storyline in this is absolutely amazing and does a great job of transitioning characters from Brando in 1 to De Niro in 2. Al Pacino delivers another compelling, stone cold performance and I also adored how they depicted society evolving and how the family has to adjust to it. The characters in this are so fascinating and you can't wait to see how they're going to handle circumstances...and when.

The same thing happens again in \"Part II\" but with devastating results. And that's emblematic of the movie as a whole; it marks every box on the sequel checklist (more this, bigger that) but in the context of a profoundly downbeat story. The brilliance of this film is the use of flashbacks to a young Vito Corleone (De Niro). It's contrasting his rise with Michael's fall and moral decay, tracking the various bombshells in each man's life (the hits on Fanucci and Ciccio, an abortion, 'You broke my heart, Fredo.\"). It's ideal for showing just how badly Michael is operating under the strain of power. The paranoia is palpable. \"The Godfather: Part II\" is always the movie that's cited when discussing superior sequels. I don't know that I'd go that far, but I think it's a fantastic movie regardless, and certainly warrants any claims to greatness. If anything, it lacks the original's tight and near-perfect packaging, but makes up for that in undeniable ambition. Both are exceptional, but for different reasons. 8/10",

The story outlines the earlier life of Vito Corleone in the early 20s and follows Michael Corleone in the 50s, but does so with very little coherency or flow. Francis Ford Coppola has shown very limited improvement from the first \"Godfather\", failing to realize the weaknesses of the first. The dialogue is still lacking authenticity, and the crypto-fascist undertones are still ever present. It doesn't help when any of the actors, in particular Al Pacino and Robert de Niro, fail to deliver any of their lines with any real conviction. The story is fairly interesting, but the lack of quality in the script is hard to overcome, and especially so in the hands of Coppola, who has proved over and over again that he does not deserve to be in the company of such legendary directors like Paul W.S. Anderson, Michael Bay, and Wych Kaosayananda. Watching the film, it's obvious the troubles Coppola had in handling the material. There are many inconsistencies in the mood and atmosphere, and he doesn't seem to hold a grasp of the material that was so masterfully outlined by Mario Puzo. The film hasn't aged well at all, and the boring cinematography highlights that combined with all the weaknesses pointed out in my review. \"The Godfather Part II\" marginally improves upon the first \"Godfather,\" but still contains many weaknesses that make it hard to enjoy or appreciate.",

            "content": "*spoilers* I recently decided to give Godfather Part II a second try (no pun intended) and I still must say that I like Part I more. There are several reasons for this and normally I would avoid talking about a movie's predecessor in reviewing it, but it is a *sequel*, and it's called Godfather PART II, not Godfather II. This, of course, implies a direct connection not only to the characters, but also to the story of the first one. So - the second part is both a prequel and a sequel merged into one movie. It's a great prequel in that it tells the story of the rise of Vito Carleone so naturally and realistically that the metamorphosis from boy to gangster is seamless. De Niro is phenomenal as Michael's father, a role performed almost entirely in Italian (hardly a handicap for De Niro whose first language [I believe] is English). He has the emotional range that Al Pacino had in the first Godfather. From extreme benevolence, even grief (Fredo gets sick vs. old Don Carleone in the first movie gets sick) he turns to cold-blooded, calculated murder. However, Godfather Part II focuses primarily on Michael, telling his story as both a continuation of the first part's tale and as an antithesis to Vito Carleone's rise to power. In that, Godfather Part II is one of the best sequel's ever made, it fleshes out the original story and it adds more plot and character depth to the original. The movie doesn't serve at all as a money-making scheme, but rather a second part of a book that's already got you hooked. Still, I belong to the group of the purists, those who enjoy the first part more than the second. While Godfather Part I portrays Michael's almost unknowing (definitely subtle) takeover of the family, Godfather Part II already finds him knowing his way around the family, capable of doing anything to his enemies. It's about Michael's complete collapse - he murders or gets rid of virtually every person in the movie, including (most tragically) his own brother, ultimately alienating himself from the family he seeks to protect. The tragedy here, however, is in some sense less subtle and nuanced than the tragedy of Godfather Part I, which is about a deep and complex father-son relationship that foretells its own ending. There exists an element of love and responsibility that naturally leads to and cannot escape from Michael's return to his family. Godfather Part II re-examines these themes (which detracts from some of its originality - but that is hardly a complaint), but Michael's character has somehow shed any notion of mercy or restraint. In fact, he does not change in any significant way, but merely continues down the path the first film set for him. The murder of his brother is simply yet another point of no return, much like the scene with the doors closing on Diane Keaton's character ending the first film. In any case, my point is that the Michael Carleone section of Godfather Part II is mostly an entertainingly told story that expands on what was already introduced in the first film, which I believe is much stronger. The best part of Godfather Part II is De Niro's performance, and its contrasting role in Michael's descent into continuing alienation and violence. (And of course it is remarkably directed by Francis Ford Coppola, with a good performance by Al Pacino, but it remains in the shadow of the first Godfather - inevitably so.)",

            "content": "Part II continues the epic crime saga of the Corleone family. This time, we have an amazing performance by Robert De Niro, who shows he can do so much with such limited dialogue. Vito Corleone is a true icon as far as characters go. Pacino is once again great, but I did find his performance in Part 1 more of an achievement. The highlights are the flashbacks of the past life of Don Vito, probably the best scenes in the saga so far. However, I found Part II more inconsistent and ultimately at times less intriguing than Part I. However, it still makes up for a great story. Amazing cinematography, direction, score, and performances.Should I bother with Part III?",

            "content": "Do not let the title fool you. You can easily view this film without ever having seen Godfather I, and get even a better feel for the Corleone family than the first film. The addition of Robert De Niro as a young Marlon Brando in this one adds greatly to the intensity of The Godfather experience. In my opinion, De Niro has a much tougher persona than Brando, and the origin sequences therefore, are that much more dramatic. The cinematography is gorgeous, the music is top-notch, and the acting by the entire supporting cast to Al Pacino is superb. My favorite moments of the film were the De Niro sequences, and especially the entry into New York harbor. You can easily see the first Godfather and watch this film at a later date without missing a beat to the extended story, or you can actually see this one by itself; it is a stand-alone masterpiece.PS. On IMDB, this film is rated below The Dark Knight. LOL. It would appear too many children are voting and not enough adults are participating in the poll. This is like letting children vote in general elections (which might not be a bad idea at some point). Maybe having an age restriction for voting might help a bit, or having a different section for children under 18.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II is not only one of the greatest films ever mad but is also the greatest sequel of all-time that is an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece that combines amazing direction,terrific acting from a great cast,a wonderful script and a haunting score. All of those elements make The Godfather Part II film making and Francis Coppola at their best.Set in Las Vegas,Nevada in the 1950s and in New York City in the 1910s and 20s,The Godfather Part II tells two parallel rise and fall stories. The rise story depicts the rise of young Vito Corleone(Robert De Niro),showing Vito as an Italian immigrant who gets into a life of Crime and becomes a Don. The fall is the story of Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)who is still running the Corleone family in Las Vegas but has to deal with betrayal and the family falling apart.The Godfather Part II is simply a masterpiece of cinema and is the greatest and most ambitious sequel of all-time that is not only an instant classic from the moment you watch it but also an amazing and powerful follow-up to the original giving viewers not only a great continuation of The Godfather saga but giving viewers the sequel to end all movie sequels. I won't say which film is better because in my opinion saying Part I or Part II is better than one another would be disrespectful to the two films because both are works of art. With The Godfather Part II Director Francis Ford Coppola has created not only created just a sequel but a film that is more epic with a bigger and larger scope than the first film giving viewers a powerful experience that never lets you go from the opening frame. With The Godfather Part II viewers are not just given a movie about the Mob,Gangsters or the Crime world but a movie about the on going tragedy,sadness and doom that hangs over The Corleone family while showing the rise of a young Vito Corleone. This film is probably more darker than the first film because when we see the fall of Michael Corleone and the rest of the Corleone family is almost like the fall of the Roman Empire. Unlike most sequels The Godfather Part II doesn't make the same story like the original but gives us something new and fresh with a great tale that is on par with the first film. The Godfather Part II is an epic film in the truest sense of the word not just in the way it's film but the length of the film(at 3 hrs and 20 minutes)but the film moves by seamlessly that you forget you are watching a three and half hour film. I think the film moves at a fast pace is because of the amazing storytelling that Coppola does with the film giving the movie a nonlinear style with the movie moving back and forth with the time periods but never getting lost in the narrative. In GFII we are given two tales about Michael's downfall and young Vito's rise. Michael,while still a don and running the Corleone family has become more ruthless and colder then he was in the first film further isolating himself from his other family members and becoming less trusting with the people all around him whether it's business associates or family where everyone was his enemy which leads to Michael's tragic fall. In contrast we see a young Vito Corleone,a man who is about business but is also about his family and friends despite being in the violent world of the Mob and Vito handles things with calm and cool style. When we see Michael and Vito the lighting is different with Michael constantly being surrounded by darkness and Vito is surrounded in bright light showing the contrast in atmosphere. With Michael and Vito we see how complex and different they are not just as Dons but as people. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is outstanding with scenes and dialog that is memorable and on par with the first film. While GFII isn't as violent or bloody as the original and doesn't have a huge body count GFII still has a few violent scenes that done with attention to detail and build-up. The ending of The Godfather Part II is one of the best endings in movie history because it's sad,tragic and somber matching the dark tone of the rest of the movie and the ending will punch you in the gut. A powerful ending.The cast is perfect. Al Pacino is excellent,powerful and at his best as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being cold,intense and ruthless in the performance. Robert De Niro is brilliant in his Oscar winning role as Young Vito Corleone,with De Niro being cool and charismatic. Robert DuVall is wonderful once again as Tom Hagen,The Corleone's lawyer. John Cazale is amazing as Fredo Corleone,Michael's dim-witted older brother. Diane Keaton is outstanding as Kay,Michael's suffering wife. Talia Shire is sensational as Connie Corleone,Michael's sister. Lee Strasberg is terrific as Hyman Roth,an old time gangster and associate of the Corleone's. Michael V. Gazzo is captivating as Frank Pentangelli,a member of the Corleone family. Bruno Kurby and John Aprea are great Young Clemenza and Young Tesso. G.D Sparadin(Senator Pat Geary),Dominic Chianese(Johnny Ola),Frank Sivero(Genco)and Richard Bright(Al Neri)give great performances as well.The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is amazing and stylish,with Coppola bringing a beautiful and haunting visual style to the film. Terrific direction,Coppola.The score by Nino Rota is outstanding,powerful,haunting and beautiful matching the main scenes in the film. Great score,Rota.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster films,Mob movies,the first Godfather or movies in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather Part II,an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema and is one of the greatest films and sequels of all-time and is a movie that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

            "content": "This film follows the movie \"The Godfather\" and continues the story of the Corleone family, now headed by Michael after the death of Vito. In this film, the audience is confronted with two realities: the rise of the family during Vito's adolescence, and the psychological contradictions of Michael, who want to get out of illegality, but needs it to prevent rival families to put at risk the safety of his family. From Nevada to Cuba, the illegal investment of the Corleone's will bring them a new golden age?Like the previous film, it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novels of Mario Puzo, who collaborated on the script. The cast kept most of the actors from the previous film but introduces new characters as well. The soundtrack continued in the experienced hands of Nino Rota. It won six Oscars in 1974 (best film, best supporting actor, best director, best adapted screenplay, best art direction and best soundtrack).After the resounding success of \"The Godfather\", any sequel was condemned to fail but, on the contrary, this film has managed to maintain it's level high and the same popularity, which is a rarity when we talk about sequels. I cannot make big negative reviews except, perhaps, the very long duration of the film. Al Pacino had probably one of the greatest performances of his life as actor. Irreproachable, he incorporated Michael with an almost petrifying naturalness. The same can be said of Robert De Niro that, with his performance, opened the way for other important works of his career like \"Goodfellas.\" Robert Duvall also had here one his most outstanding works. Those who like action scenes may not like this movie. Its a quieter film, where the deaths are violent but made with almost surgical precision. The Mafia does not kill at random. Tense from start to finish, it has a powerful suspense that holds the audience, but the complexity of the script, full of twists, can confuse the most inattentive, so pay attention.",

In addition, the parallel between the story of Michael and the young Vio Corleone further reinforces the characters and their purpose in history. Michael is now a worthy successor to his father and is definitely the godfather while showing the network of betrayal and mistrust he is subject to and the brilliant way in which he overcomes the obstacles and gets his purpose.The film has few details as part of a brilliant subtext to make us understand better, and immerse ourselves in the complexity of its history. The direction is magnificent at all levels, demanding more from the actors and pleasing the audience. Photography and visual complements, as well as lighting, are totally adequate, giving the film an excellent atmosphere that blends perfectly with the story. No doubt, Francis Ford Coppola made us an offer we could not refuse.",

Personally, I feel that Vito's prequel story was far more interesting and the time skips weren't timed with good purpose so I lean a bit towards the \"distracting\" interpretation. The story is quite different from The Godfather and it really feels like a new film that is not tied down by its predecessor, which is good. The style and cinematography are even better than the original, especially in Vito's story. However, it suffers from the same pacing issues as the first film and I would not call it a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Times go on a-changing. The second generation, with a few flashbacks to the very origins of the Corleone family, how the last male survivor of the family is smuggled out of Sicily to the USA where he can start a new line, by changing his name circumstantially since it is a not too wise customs officer that gives him unknowingly a new family name, and without forgetting the vengeance he will have to achieve later rather than sooner for the killing of his father and brothers by the local Don in his village in Sicily. We see him establish his business in the 1920s by killing the local mafia boss in his neighborhood and taking over in a more humane and just way. But this is a flashback. We are interested in the next generation and what they can do in the 1950s. The takeover has already been dealt with in the first part. The appointed son for this takeover has already asserted his power over the five families that could challenge him in the previous film. Now he tries to develop his business. Drugs had been allowed but he remains rather distant from that trafficking. He develops his business in gambling, hotels, entertainment, in one word luxury industry or commerce. He tries to get into Las Vegas but is rebuffed by a local Senator, so he forgets about it. Then he tries to move into Cuba and take over some business there but too late it is the arrival of Castro. So he goes back to New York and Nevada, back to his traditional activities. But these attempts enable Coppola to show some new problematics that are coming up in the second half of the 20th century. First of all the strong sectarianism Italians have to face from politicians who declare they support Italian-Americans as good patriots in front, and behind try to make them pay twice a service or to ostracize them out of their constituencies. At the same time they have to face congressional and judicial complications with hearings about their businesses and business practices that are accused of being too criminal to be accepted. In other words we are beyond the time of Al Capone and Prohibition. And the world is also changing. Cuba of course is a big change. But women are no longer what they used to be in this Sicilian culture. Women do not want to be simple ancillary appendices to men they do not see any more. This second generation Godfather is confronted to the abortion of his third child and second son by his wife while he is in Cuba witnessing Castro's conquest of the island. Then she tries to take his children away and eventually get a divorce. She will get nothing except a separation but not the children. He also has to fight against some remnants of the old world that are handicaps and obstacles to his projects, such as the fact that he is the head of the family business and yet he is not the eldest son : hence he has to face his elder brothers, and that has been going on for a long time. The world is changing his way this time and he has to fight against the survival of what the world used to be. At this point this trilogy is becoming a vast fresco about the history of Italian-Americans or should I say Sicilian-Americans ? When the fresco is too vast we can wonder if it does not lose some of its possible meaning by diluting it into too many elements, periods and events. But it is certainly interesting to follow this intricate family history that verges onto a sitcom at times.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",

I'm not sure it added to this story as a whole and might have been better as a prequel in its own right as I think it had the better focus and potential to show a character that we were already curious about his origins.The actors were all very good, but nobody really stood out for me this time, except of course Al, who manages to twitch his face his slightly to imply his desires to his men. There's a lot said by his face that words can't do.While the time jumping was confusing, the film in general was put together well. I do think it could have been about an hour shorter though.I'm not sure we needed to find out what happened to Michael after the end of the first film, but I can appreciate why others might like this one and why some might prefer it, but for me number 1 just had more going for it.Michael is not a happy man, having fallen in to his position, despite his attempts not to. It's a hard balance for him to maintain his family and his \"business\" life. As a result the film is quite sulky and dark. He doesn't want that life and it's difficult to watch him so unhappy and with no one he can trust.I don't dispute that this is a good film, it's just not my sort of film.

The event is the Holy Communion for Michael Corleone's (Pacino) son, and much like the wedding with which the first film began, it represents the beginning of a new venture; of a new tale, or of a new chapter in life or in the franchise that is the Godfather films, a new addition to the lives of this collection of Mafia based individuals whom are forever being deconstructed on screen. And what a tale the piece eventually branches out into, giving us the next chapter in the lives of those in the 'present' tense, as well as seamlessly incorporating an interesting mesh of the rising of one gangster twinned with his lust for revenge.This second strand is, of course, the tale of Vito Corleone (De Niro); an Italian immigrant of the Andolini family based on Scicily and his coming of age in early 20th Century New York. The Godfather Part II is an extremely assured film; a film that is mostly everything a crime film can be, complete with a patient and mature aesthetic which helps in the distinct placing of it in the annuals of contemporary American cinema. The film is split into two equilibriums, one occurring from the late 1950's onwards while predominantly focusing on Michael and his family and friends, where as the other initially unfolds in the very early years of the 20th Century before branching out into the 1920s. This segment sees Vito marry; get involved in petty crime; come up against a local crime kingpin as well as have a son but always retain an eye on a certain larger goal which awaits him back in Scicily.Each of the two equilibriums offer very different studies of the human condition. The equilibrium in the 'present' tense takes on a certain amount of substance to do with honour and trust; as well as incorporating the notion of expansion and moving on, which ties in with the idea of modernity and branching out in an attempt to keep up with the times. These are ideas Michael brings up in the first Godfather film, mainly through fear of his family's safety that they need to 'go straight' but additionally because he feels real estate and so forth acts as a healthy means, money-wise, to sustain the family for the years to come. The other equilibrium sees a much more simplistic and routine chain of events; a tale of revenge and a certain degree of ruthlessness brought about within one man as this study of this character evolves him from an innocent and frightened child; to a young man who is very much observant of this new world he's in; to cold-blooded killer.The installation of Vito's story here is simplistic but very well done in both a story telling and character driven sense. Vito becomes aware of the notion of crime in New York and learns of the rules of hierarchy. He observes his initial, more local, nemeses in Don Fanucci (Moschin) in a close to voyeuristic manner; not necessarily gazing at the individual but at what the individual is: feared but additionally respected. Vito is not afraid of Fanucci, but the study of Vito's involvement in crime, which begins with the stealing of someone's rug and the temporary holding of a neighbour's illegal firearms, act as lures into a world within the historically proclaimed 'new world' he has already arrived in. You might view Vito's tale as a tragedy, since it is Vito's entry into this line of work that will propel him into the mindset of a criminal and, ultimately, it is this line of work that develops the attribute of a cold blooded killer which enables him to fulfil his goal of revenge.The passage of film looking at Vito sees the film revisit one of Vito's ideation from the first edition; the notion of always killing for business and that there is nothing personal behind 'hits' - it is strictly business. Vito and his goal as a young man in New York exist before these rules are drawn up; Vito's hatred of Don Ciccio for the death of his father during the prologue is not business, but very much personal. It might be this that makes Vito's strand of The Godfather Part II the better of the two, and it may well be the reason people have more of a reaction to this edition of the trilogy; in the sense it is a piece establishing ideals and ideation's; before having, what is arguably its strongest character, confront what we already know he believes in and threaten its integrity.Michael's segment of the film covers broader, more personal issues such as life and family ties and marital relationships. It is about expanding an empire on the outside just as much as it is the narrowing down of an empire on the inside: finding out who is actually who and where they stand. There is one such brilliant scene in which Michael and Fredo (Cazale) confront one another and they fall out of favour. It is an establishing of power as Michael, standing, towers over Fredo who up to this point has become more and more of a loose cannon. Michael's segment of The Godfather Part II isn't so much about the mafia or crime as much as it is the human condition; it uses said setting as a means to explore these conditions within a criminal world, as death and increased pressure to make moves dominate person's lives. Its dedicated and calm approach to psychologically chaotic and unnerving subject matter allows the film to retain a certain juxtaposed sense of dread throughout. Perhaps undoubtedly, The Godfather Part II will remain a somewhat timeless study of emotion, angst and so much more.",

You can't feel that you are watching a movie of 70s.Fifth, RETRO FEELING - i don't know why, but i am attached to that old environment.Sixth, MOTIVATION - yup, after watching the movie, i am so inspired with the character of Micheal Corleone and learned lot of philosophical matter.Seventh, COSTUMES - the costumes of the mafia gang is so cool. In specific the costume of micheal look badass when combined with his nature.Last, CHARACTERS - you got attached to each and every character easily.Now let's talk about some Negative points :-First, in some part the AUDIO QUALITY is not so good.Second, as i am not proficient in english language, and this movie have so many HARD WORDS which i can't understand.Third, the LENGTH of the movie is so long, you can't watch it in one time. If you spend that much time in front screen, it is not good for your eyes. So i suggest you to break it down in parts.Fourth, despite of having enough time to explain, it is still CONFUSING in some parts and i have to watched that part again to understand.Fifth, why they put VITO'S HISTORY - that story has no connections with the present storyline. They can easily remove the vito's part to reduce the movie's length or they can make a separate movie of vito's history.Sixth, the movie has NO PURPOSE, it is like a flow concept. That's why the ending of the movie is not so mind blowing type.Last, in the movie, you found so many USELESS CONVERSATION which can be easily cutted from the movie.That's all from my side, hope you like it.",

This films tells the story Michael Corleone's upbringing in Sicily and into the 1950's as a Don in New York and his ambition to expand the family business into Vegas, Florida and Cuba. Much of this film revolves around family relationships and how hard it is to keep trust with various family members as well as others in his...line of work. It additionally portrays that the more power, respect or control Michael strives for the more he actually loses what matters most; trying to be vague there. That is the 10,000ft overview. This movie flows in from Part I and smoothly matches the tone and atmosphere and brutal violent moments. The absence of Brando is noticeable but of course Pacino has the chops to carry you through. It is a true epic.",

            "content": "Where I should start here is that this is a classic. I saw this around the time that I watched the original one which would have been late in high school. My buddy Craig and I decided to seek out the great 'mob movies'. I've seen this a few times with the most recently with Jaime as we are working through the Internet Movie Database poster. She had never seen this one.For this one, we take place years after the original one. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) oversees the family. He has sole control of the criminal organizations after the events of the earlier movie. He is still trying to realize the dream of his father to go legit. It has taken longer than he told his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton).This also shows us the event that led to his father, Vito (Robert De Niro), becoming the man that we see in the original. We see the humble beginnings in Sicily and how he ended up in New York City. We also see how he became the 'godfather' and gaining the respect of the neighborhood.Michael also has problems to deal with, which are keeping the peace within his own 'family' with Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) and with Kay. He also is expanding into Cuba with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg). It can be difficult to know who he can trust, even with those that are within his group.There isn't a lot more that I have to say here. Francis Ford Coppola co-wrote this with the writer of the novel Mario Puzo. Coppola also directs. This is a masterpiece. The cinematography is amazing. We have another all-star cast. This also does something interesting in showing how Vito became who he is and how these correlates to what Michael is dealing with. It is almost a mirror of the first one. Michael is now Vito so the rise we see here is Vito becoming the powerful man that he is. The only other thing to bring up the soundtrack which fits spot on with the tone and giving it that Italian vibe.If I have a gripe, this is a long movie. It doesn't necessarily feel the whole three and half hours but I do think there is some that could be trimmed personally. This doesn't ruin the movie. Don't get me wrong. I think I prefer part one to this sequel. They both are as perfect a movie as you can get to me though.My Rating: 9.5 out of 10.",

It is without a doubt my favorite film and arguably one of the greatest of all time.In my opinion, Al Pacino gives the best performance of his career, alongside Godfather Part I, Scarface, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and Scent of a Woman. Pacino shows us the dark, ruthless and powerful side of Michael Corleone that was only shown for a brief time in the Godfather and delivers it to perfection. The loss of Marlon Brando has absolutely no effect on the film because he is still there in spirit and Pacino more than makes up for the absence.We are also given a glimpse of Vito Corleones early career as a Mafia figure. Robert DeNiro gives an amazing performance. Through this we are able to make the connection between Vito and Michael. We learn that Michael has, in fact, great reluctance compared to Vito in the process of living and accepting the Mafia way of life, although their motives are exactly the same: family.This film is more than good acting and plot, it is epic story telling at its best. Although very different in many ways from Godfather Part I, which chronicles family, Part II we realize the entire Godfather saga is more about the epic tragedy that is Michaels life rather than the Corleones.I have watched this film dozens and dozens of times and I never get bored. It is dramatic, suspenseful, emotional and clever. The script is phenomenal, the story is capturing and engaging and the acting is mind-blowing. If you have not seen this, or any of the Godfathers, WATCH THEM! (in order of course)Best ever. 10/10 would be an understatement for this film and for the Godfathers in general.",

            "content": "WARNING: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FOR PARTS I AND II.When \"The Godfather\" was released in 1972, it instantly became a classic, and has now gone on to become a cinematic legend. I find it rather surprising that \"The Godfather Part II\" was made at all, as \"The Godfather\" is not exactly a franchise film, but what is more surprising is just how good this sequel is.\"The Godfather\" was the story of the Corleone crime family: Vito (Brando), the Don of the family; Michael (Pacino), his youngest son; Sonny (Caan), his hot-tempered first-born; Tom Hagen (Duvall), his adopted son and legal adviser; Fredo (Cazale), his middle child; Connie (Shire), his daughter; and Kay Adams (Keaton), Michael's girlfriend. Over the course of the film, Vito is seriously injured, causing Sonny to become Don, but due to his temper, he is promptly shot dead, thus causing Michael to take over duties as Don, and he and Kay are married.\"The Godfather Part II\" begins right where \"The Godfather\" left off and continues chronicling the struggles of the Corleone family as they attempt to become a legitimate organization amidst the corruption they are tied to. But the film also switches back and forth between this storyline and that of young Vito (Baldini, De Niro), showing us how he rose to power.\"The Godfather Part II\" has about the same pace as the first film, the same beautiful gold-tinted cinematography, the same operatic approach to the subject matter, and I think it is almost on par as far as quality. But the thing that really makes \"Part II\" amazing is Pacino's mesmerizing performance as Michael. He was spellbinding in Part I, as well, but this film really gives him a lot more opportunity to develop his character. The most compelling moments in the film are not the scenes of confrontation or violence, but the scenes of Pacino's intense brooding. No other actor has ever so effectively developed their character without uttering so much as a single solitary syllable. A perfect example of this is the scene where Michael and Fredo embrace after Michael had told him he never wanted to see him again. The look in Pacino's eyes is just out of this world. Actually, Cazale's performance is notable, as well.Francis Ford Coppola's direction skill is at its pinnacle with this brilliant piece of celluloid, and this, unfortunately, was to be his second to last great film (his last being \"Apocalypse Now\"). Another thing that majorly contributes to not just Part II, but the entire trilogy's greatness is Nino Rota's absolutely beautiful and undeniably memorable score. Not since 1944's \"Laura\" has a composer utilized a repeated theme so well.Unfortunately, the \"Godfather\" series failed to become a trilogy of masterpieces when the bland Part III put a blemish on its greatness, but the sheer power and remarkable film-making of the first two chapters will be forever remembered as two of the very finest films ever made, and rightfully so.9/10",

            "review_title": "Disguised as a film about the mafia, in fact what we see is a study of family complexities. It is definitely Coppola's best work",
            "content": "This premise of drawing a temporal parallel between father and son, showing the ascension of both one and the other, manages to establish an excellent philosophical analysis about the relationship that exists between the choices of one over the other. While Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), moved by love for the newly started family, makes his business grow based on the game of waist and punctual demonstrations of power; Michael finds strength and constant intimidation the best way to keep things \"under control\" and thus preserve the family name, the memory of his father and the safety of his wife and children. And it is precisely at this point that we observe the son making the mistakes that the father avoided. Michael is much more moved by the blind obstinacy of duty to the past than by the yearning to build something solid for the future. He wants to finish what his father started. This becomes perfectly clear as the film progresses and the stories intertwine. While facing the hatred of other families and the persecution of the Senate that seeks in every way to exterminate the parallel power that the mafia represents, Michael does not realize that the reason that, in the speech, he uses as a justification for his questionable actions, is flowing among his fingers. What would it be? Yes, your family.This is one of the best conflicts in the film, by the way. More than the fierce arguments between Michael's lawyers and the politicians who pursue him; more than the shots that are exchanged between your generals; the \"battles\" carried out by his family are the center of the plot. Coppola achieves the feat of presenting interesting developments for each character, to a lesser or greater degree, allowing his actors to stand out in their roles. Part II, however, brings new directions to most of them, taking everyone to a higher level: even more mature, Al Pacino gives new touches of paranoia to Michael Corleone; Diane Keaton as the wife, Kay Corleone, stands out. Revealing the nuances present in a woman left aside, Keaton conquers us through the construction of the phases that the end of a marriage goes through. She starts faithful to her husband, but as he gets lost in the world of the mafia, the efforts she stars in are exhausted, as well as the love she once had for that man; Strasberg proves what an \"Method\" actor is capable of by bringing cynicism and bitterness beneath Hyman Roth's calm facade; and John Cazale is the greatest asset of all, winning the chance to turn his character's apparent stupidity into a particularly tragic figure. Despite all its epic scope and its many bumps, Part II manages to appear more intimate by following these characters.Vito Corleone's origin is magnificently well built. The reconstruction of that historical period, both in Sicily and in New York, brings a strong poetic air to the film. Combining this with the opera atmosphere that the original already possessed, the result is a magnificent cultural and social painting - merits of director of photography Gordon Willis who, like his predecessor, manages, with an almost theatrical light, to assertively portray the tense environment of history. Counting the arrival of Italian immigrants to New York, the film shows how Vito (played by Robert De Niro) developed and what his motivations were, as well as those of several other secondary characters, such as the gangster Clemenza, his partner at the beginning of the formation of the Corleone empire. These leaps in time and the impeccable reconstructions of the period also help to create a romantic panorama of America at the beginning of the 20th century. The temporal reconstruction in the flashbacks is also to be admired, all enhanced by the magnificent soundtrack of Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola, creating new Italian themes based on the musical notes of the first film - the result is epic.The current Don Corleone is not in serious danger of life - to the viewer he is considered to be a practically invincible figure. Mike's real fear is losing his family, something that is made clear in a remarkable dialogue with his mother, in which she comforts him by saying: \"you can never lose your family\". It is interesting to note that since his transformation into this monstrous figure it is the first time that we have seen him really afraid. As much as his apparent sociopathy dominates his disposition towards the world in the vast majority of scenes, Al Pacino's work ensures that we see the care that this man has regarding the blood of his blood. The progression of the storyline, however, continues to transform the character - this time in a subtler way than in the first film, of course - taking him from a ruthless figure to an even more traumatized man, who opts for the dark and the silence, abandoning practically all the warmth he showed towards his family.The first of Mike's impacts on the film, of course, comes from his brother Fredo's betrayal and the discovery of that fact practically takes all of Michael's air. What is interesting, however, is the way in which the script by Francis and Mario Puzo does not leave this factor only in black and white. Fredo didn't know that they would try to kill his brother and he clearly regrets it later. John Cazale, who had a background character in the previous work, gives a real show. \"I should take care of you\" he repeats to his younger brother, at the same time that he practically shakes in the reclining chair and shakes his hands without the slightest force on his wrist. Here we have the same fragile and childish figure from the first film, leaving us with nothing but a real pity for his final destiny, Michael Corleone's greatest sin.The second impact comes from the breakup with Kay and the revelation that she miscarried her son. Al Pacino is an actor who notably likes to perform scenes in which his character explodes in anger and here we have the best of the entire trilogy. It is worth noting that the loss of his calm in those moments reiterates his concern for the family. The monster that Michael becomes is practically undone here, when in his expression we can feel all his anger showing. There is a human behind this figure and it is sad to see that, after this explosion, he falls even more, almost completely burying that young veteran we met at the beginning of The Godfather.The tension generated in the viewer, however, is not limited to Michael's downfall. Coppola knows how to work with precision the suspense of these two hundred minutes of projection. Since the initial problems, we do not know who the protagonist really considers the culprit for the attempt on his life. Was it Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg, actor suggested by none other than Pacino) or Frank Pentangelli (Michael V. Gazzo)? Or both? The audience is left in the dark for much of the feature and, ironically, when the villain reveals himself the other also becomes one, leading us to audiences seeking to incriminate the Corleones, an element that is inserted masterfully into the story by using the parallel narrative, that oscillates between Vito and Mike.Both narratives, as they walk and reveal the fate that their protagonists will have, also close this excellent assessment of family inheritance. In Michael's life everything goes wrong. The choices he makes - no more spoilers; watch the movie, please - lead you to a path of guilt and loneliness. With Vito, on the other hand, we have a beautiful scene of the family gathered in the dining room waiting for him. As much as his son tried, he is not like Don Corleone. The overlap that takes us out of his dark room and takes us to the joyful father's dinner appears as a reminder, a reflection, the realization that he failed in his mission. He did not become the man his father dreamed he was. Coppola's option of making sequences in the past and present longer works perfectly, making the rhythm of the work easy to follow. Each scene acts as a chapter within the narrative, in the director's own words, as a short film. The fragmentation of the projection is then disguised by the aforementioned contemplative moments that perfectly unite the past and the present. Disliking one side of the story is almost unthinkable, while both manage to engage us from beginning to end. Michael's perspective continues his sad fall, while Vito's introduces elements that we learned to love in the first film, in addition to offering well-positioned comic reliefs within the heavy climate that has been established since the opening minutes of the projection.The Godfather: Part II achieves the impossible: to overcome his predecessor with a cohesive text, very inspiring performances and excellent direction. Disguised as a film about the mafia, in fact what we see is a study of family complexities. It is definitely Coppola's best work. Part II may not be superior to the first part of Coppola's trilogy, but it is as powerful a film as it is ambitious - for both good and evil - and definitely one of the best and most successful sequences in cinema.",

I don't know what it is about short badly dressed street thugs going around saying badder bing and shooting someone in a pizza restaurant is so appealing to everyone who happens to be a film buff I guess it's a hero worship thing you have to look up to somebody so why not some idiot who makes poorly adapted films from boring source material or dick heads who go around inflicting torment and anguish on normal people, I won't reviewing the third movie as it is just as bad as this probably not so bad because it doesn't go on for four years like this film does and Coppola did an interesting thing at the end of that one when he had Pacino screaming like a girl on the steps outside the opera with the music lifted from raging bull",

I wish he only do 1 film of the Godfather trilogy, the one that contains all the parts of the novel and maybe this could be the perfect film.This film is a little boring because now you don't have Brando and now you don't have the essence of the novel, now is like more of the same whit out the charisma of Sonny and whit Pacino more mature and more boring. I don't say that this is a bad film because Robert De Niro always save the day (I really love the part of young Vito) but what i don't like is the fact that Coppola wants to make more films from a perfect beginning so 7.6/10.And please don't watch the Godfather III.",

A few well inserted flashbacks will help you to understand better the biography of Don Vito thus completing a few aspects the first movie had left in the obscurity. The rest is the usual story of the struggle for power among mafia families but very well told in a captivating way. Which doesn't prevent the director to go on presenting those gangsters like human beings with their family problems interfering sometimes with their criminal activities. Murder is an ordinary event normally used to punish a betrayal but also to attain the gangsters' purposes in the attainment of their businesses. Although the acting lacks the superb performance of a sacred monster like Marlon Brando in the first part of this saga, it's good enough and all players do their parts convincingly well with special prominence to Al Pacino and Diane Keaton.",

His arrival in New York and rise amongst the Italian American community to Godfather status in the first film.Robert De Niro plays Vito in young adulthood.The second timeline follows Don Michael Carleone (Al Pacino) and his grip on the family after the second world war.Some interesting scenes are witnessed in Cuba with the revolution of Fidel Castro.De Niro and Pacino put in electrifying performances in their respective segments.The production does look very polished with some memorable scenes and cinematography.Where as the first Godfather film focused on the solidity of the Carleone family here we see the grip of Michael Carleone on the family fall apart.Well worth the effort of the three hours plus running time.

This companion piece jumps between the rise of Vito during prohibition and Michael running the family in the 50's.  There are many beautiful scenes in part 2.  The most beautiful scene in my opinion is at the wake for Michael's mother and when Connie begs Michael to see his brother Fredo begging him to forgive him and when Michael walks through the house to Fredo and they hug each other.

II starts to suffer from over-bloatedness (which III had in spades). I wasn't involved in the Robert Deniro backstory as some people, I was somewhat groaning when we were going back in time.. But in the present time, like when Al Pacino is on the screen, THAT I enjoyed. I think Pacino is at his best here, since he knows the character so well. Keaton and all the rest of them are great too.

            "content": "\"The Godfather\" (1972) was, and still is, in my eyes as well as the eyes of most people, one of the greatest motion pictures ever made and without any doubts, the one that featured the quintessential cast for a mafia movie. It took me a long time to getting around to it, but at last a few weeks ago, I had the privilege to see director Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of the trilogy. And during that long span of time, I had heard a lot about \"The Godfather: Part II\" and how some have even built up the nerve to call it better than the original. I doubted it would even come close, even if it was great. Boy, was I wrong. \"The Godfather\" (1972) is still great and a true masterpiece, but much to my surprise and delight, Part II is even better. That's what I call a feat.Perhaps the reason why \"The Godfather: Part II\" matches and overpowers the original is because\u2014at least to me\u2014that it is really not a sequel, but rather a continuation of the first film, which was really just a warm-up for what was to follow. The first film ended with Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone dying and his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) turning from the weak little college kid who wanted nothing to do with his family, turning out to become the exact image of his father. And in Part II, we still have him as the image of his father\u0085only worse. While Don Vito was ruthless, he was also sympathetic and likable. The new Michael Corleone, by contrast, is one of the most bone-chilling villains ever seen. Part II follows his endeavors as he carries on in his father's name and mixed up with this continuation is a flashback sequence. You see, Part II is both a continuation and a prequel to the original. Inter-spliced with the sequel footage is a second story detailing the past of Vito Corleone, now played by a young Robert De Niro in an Oscar-winning performance as the dumb-witted boy from Sicily who became one of the most powerful mobsters alive.\"The Godfather: Part II\", like its predecessor, is a legendary film for many reasons. Apart from being one of the most important and entertaining films ever made, it also set new standards and records that have yet to be matched. It because the first sequel to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, it started the now-common formula of using roman numerals for sequel titles, it has the irony where it, as well as the original, have an Academy Award win for two different actors playing the same characters (Marlon Brando as an old Vito Corleone in the original and Robert De Niro as a young Vito Corleone in Part II), Michael Corleone is one of the more frightening villains ever realized, and the look of violence and horror of a mafia world is twice as terrifying as what was seen in the first film. And of course, it marked the beginning of Robert De Niro's career.The irony of the first \"The Godfather\" (1972) was how Michael Corleone was transformed from a \"nice college boy\" to quote his brother into a vicious crime lord who at the end of the first film authorizes the assassinations of all of his competitors without flicking an eyelash. And the irony of \"The Godfather: Part II\" is not only is he now worse than his father ever was, but Michael Corleone is still driving himself down a road to his own relentless destruction and the moral destruction of those around him. His son, his wife, his sister, brother, brother-in-law, and close friends are both brought closer to him and alienated from him at the same time. Alienated because they fear him. Brought closer because they know better than to run away.In regards to the film's second story, the prequel about Vito Corleone, it's not only brilliant, but necessary and phenomenal. The prequel is one of the few major chapters from Mario Puzo's incredible book that could not be fitted into the original film. That's alright, because to me, the flashback was the only slow and unnecessary part that Puzo wrote. But here, in this film, in this continuation, it not only fits and correlates, but belongs. Again, it's to show how Michael Corleone is more vicious, more dangerous, more terrible than his father, who was at one time brutal and devilish. There was originally a scene that called for Marlon Brando to return as an old Vito Corleone, but I think the magic of this prequel footage would have been lost if it had, for we then compare the Brando performance from the original, the De Niro performance from the sequel, see how they blend perfectly together, and our imaginations become our eyes and ears.In regards to the film's music score, Nino Rota scores even higher than he did with his soundtrack for the first film. One noticeable thing is how the original theme score was sad and almost depressing, but the music for Part II is even more sad and even more depressing, for it's really a tragic story. Rota knew what Coppola and Puzo were trying to show with their second film and he was dead-on with his somber, almost ironic musical score.\"The Godfather: Part II\" also boasts a great deal of truly shocking moments that at times makes you jump in your seat and at other times, hang your jaws in awe, in a bitter disbelief to accept what has happened and the latter most certainly comes about in the final shots. And that ultimately is the power of Coppola's film and that is why it is considered so terrific, even to the point of surpassing its superb predecessor. I honestly didn't think it was possible for Part II to be better than the original, but it is. This is a compliment of the highest order.",

After watching The Godfather, one of the best movies ever made, I found it hard to believe that Part II would improve upon its predecessor despite the critical acclaim. However, The Godfather Part II is truly a phenomenal movie (just as good if not better than the original), and in addition to continuing the story, it compliments The Godfather perfectly.If The Godfather was taught you to respect the Corleone family's power, then The Godfather Part II gives a broader scope to that power. It alternates the journeys of a younger Don Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), and Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). This is to chronicle the rise and fall of the Corleone family. Vito rose to prominence through gaining the favor of the people, and liberating them from Don Fanucci. Michael operates out of self-interest, which causes chaos within the family, and ultimately burns bridges. By the end of the movie, you know full well that the Corleone family dynasty is crumbling, they won't even be legit too much longer. The Corleones are like the Roman Empire.This movie also features two amazing lead actors. De Niro and Pacino both gave bold performances which both influenced the flow of the movie, and the perception of reality. It was possible to capture the wisdom and of Vito, and the greed of Michael in a way that truly sticks with you. This was also in part to a very well conceived soundtrack, great location shots alive with colors, a very intricate screenplay, and Coppola, a great director who knows how to conduct beautiful cinema.If there is any statement that The Godfather Part II successfully makes, its that the complexity of the Corleones could not be realized with only one feature film. This movie casts new light on the family you've come to love, and the portrayal gives the movie a darker tone. The Godfather Part II is a winner in all categories: entertaining, brilliant, deep, it flawlessly parallels two stories, and it's brutally realistic in it's demonstration of power.",

In 1958, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) reflects on the problems of being a Mafia don, and those of his father (Robert De Niro) before him.The Godfather Part II is one of those rare sequels that genuinely eclipses the original film - quite an achievement, in this instance. But Part II fleshes out the history of the Corleone clan, showing the rise of young Don Vito and reflecting on the increasingly icy demeanour of his son Michael as he accommodates himself to becoming a ruthless don. The scenes in Sicily, beautifully shot, have a lyrical, almost Edenic quality, tinged with foreboding: we all know this idyll can not last. De Niro is spellbinding as young Vito, while Pacino almost visibly transforms himself into the man Michael Corleone is becoming. It's an astonishing popular masterpiece.",

            "content": "In ways, I guess I could say that the first Godfather changed my outlook on film, in that you can enjoy movies for their artistic aspects, and that you don't necessarily have to understand the film inside out, in that you can enjoy for what it offers, and that is basically the experience of it. When I watch a gangster movie, I felt that the element of brutality was something that was lacking in the first Godfather, in that it came off too pretty and sophisticated, but I actually came to appreciate its dynamics in that the brutal scenes come as the plot escalates in that it serves as a contrast to the more sombre, melancholic elements of the film. I have to say that it brought forth something unique with that concept and gave the film a sense of grandeur that made it stick out in the crime genre.And the things The Godfather did in setting the bar, Part II further expands on its ideas and opts for a darker, malevolent approach that greatly differs from the first film that has more of a sense of warmth. To see Michael's transformation was astounding in the first film, but to see what he has become is gutwrenchingly heavy. What Don Vito Corleone created was a foundation for his family, and to see Michael become corrupted to the point, he would do anything to stay at the top is horrifyingly disturbing. What makes this performance so intense is the lack of any human emotion or empathy coming from Michael, that makes him just pure evil. What is brought to this role is the stuff of legends and I cannot give enough credit to Al Pacino. He deserves every amount praise bestowed upon him, but who I think shines just as much as Al in the film is Robert De Niro and his portrayal of a young Vito Corleone during his rise to power. I would have never thought it would feel natural to have someone other than Marlon Brando portray the original Don, but Robert De Niro actually exceeded my expectations. From his accent to his mannerisms, he got the character down to a hair.And not only with great performances, we are offered a great character study contrasting a father and son, and what drives these men to kill. We know how Michael came into his position, but as the film progresses we begin to see how Vito and Michael handle their business, as we see both their stories reach a conclusion that is downright brutal. The Godfather Part II shows what is set forth by Michael's rise to power and the movie retains its ambition, but becomes its own film that is gripping and memorable in its own unique character.I originally preferred the first one, but then I realized how much the second one is dependent on the first film. While the second one is more gripping, the first one is grandiose in that it was the first to bring out these great ideas and execute them in a way that is incomparable, but I like to see the first and the second as one long epic story in that it depicts the rise and fall of an empire and while I prefer the first one, the sequel does something different, adding different angles to the story that are equally as compelling, dramatic and shocking as the first one. To make a sequel that does just that was no easy feat and this is the mark of Francis Ford Coppola's talent as a director. Even if the first Godfather were to never have a sequel, it would still be awesome on its own, but to have a sequel that is this good is more than anyone could ask for from a great director. The Godfather Part II is a film that you should definitely not miss out on.",

            "content": "'The Godfather, Part II' is often considered the best sequel ever made. Although it is a powerful and moving story, the film has deep flaws that are not revealed upon initial viewings. First of all, the movie has many of the fine qualities that made the original movie a classic. All the performances are incredible and emotional; Al Pacino give one of the best performances I've ever seen. The complex story is slowly and subtly developed by Coopola's nearly unmatched talent as a director. Certain moments are so haunting and unforgettable, they have become classic moments in the history of film-making. I don't need to tell which sequences these are because so many people are already familiar with them.With all the great things the movie has going for it, 'Part II' has a lot of flaws that reveal themselves after careful viewings. The flashbacks nearly ruin the movie. Although they explain the beginnings of the Corleone family, they greatly deter the on - going struggle of Michael with his enemies and his own family. The flashbacks also make the movie way too long. The failed murder attempt of Frankie Pentangeli is so confusing I couldn't figure out who was doing what. The film should have done a better job of explaining the pre-Castro Cubian situation to the viewer; the actions of the rebels and the rioting are also confusing. Kay (Michael's wife) and Fredo (Michael's brother) has sudden bursts of anger that come out of nowhere. The film does a poor job of showing beforehand why the two characters were so mad at Michael.Nonetheless, 'The Godfather, Part II' has many positives that outweigh the negatives. If anything, one should just see the movie for the performance given by Al Pacino. Al Pacino commands the movie by stealing every scene he is in. His character is frightening, untouchable, cold, calculating, and invincible. It is one of the most awesome displays of acting ever put on film.",

At the top of that particular list stands THE GODFATHER, PART II. People are often quick and harsh in their assessment of all the things that were wrong with the third sequel, and they are especially hard on Sofia Coppola. But even if she had turned in an Oscar-worthy performance, think about it...did Francis have a snowball's chance in hell of topping the Perfect Sequel?First of all, we get a two-fer: not only do we get the magnificent performance from Al Pacino as Michael, the reluctant new Don Corleone, who has come full circle and has assumed the very mantle he had always hoped to avoid, as well as everything that goes with it, but we get Robert De Niro's breakout portrayal as young Vito in the old country. We get to see how the Family got started, and that the spiritual, moral and financial dilemmas that father and son had to face, spanning nearly a century, were not as different as either one of them might have thought. The continuation of a story that deepens the situations and our insight into the characters; Gordon Willis' peerless photography; Dean Tavoularis' amazing sets and Theodora Van Runkle's costumes; the Nino Rota/Carmine Coppola themes that are so familiar to us now that they're almost subliminal, and that note-perfect casting of all the supporting players, even the appearance of some faces you may have forgotten were associated with the series, especially people like THE SOPRANO'S Dominic Chianese and CITY SLICKERS' Bruno Kirby.

            "content": "The Godfather: Part II is perhaps the most famous example of a sequel generally held in as high regard as its predecessor and it's easy to see why; where part I was about Michael's rise, this is about the fall which I think ceteris paribus makes for a better film. Personally I think it's probably slightly weaker than Part I due to the stories being a tad weaker and less focused. Being 25 minutes longer, one might think that it's grander in scope or more elaborate but it really consists of two less elaborate stories; in present time, we get to follow Michael Corleone's aforementioned fall, while a flashback chronicles his father Vito's rise to power during his formative years.That being said, the two stories are interwoven and juxtaposed quite elegantly. Michael begins with getting his hand kissed as a newly appointed \"don\", and ends with him symbolically left alone at the kitchen table of a family dinner during a flashback. Vito starts at rock bottom, having been made an orphan and forced to leave Sicily for America, and ends up if not on the top, but then well on his way. As another contrast, we get to see shots of Vito's family (including Michael as a baby) flourishing right after Michael's marriage is falling apart.Furthermore, Part II does contain some of the best stuff of the trilogy, especially towards the last half hour or so when all story lines come together quite beautifully; the marital breakdown of Michael and Kay. The conversation between Tom Hagen and Frankie Pentangeli followed by the latter's suicide. The visceral and character building scene in which Vito shoots Fanucci. And maybe the most striking of them all \u2013 the calamity of Fredo's (John Cazale outplaying everyone in the impeccable ensemble) death, happening off-screen as if it was too cruel to show the viewers. Better or not, this is in all respects a fine continuation and expansion upon the previous film and unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I.",

            "content": "If you asked me 1 year ago about The Godfather or The Godfather part II , I would say The Godfather 1. But, after my 5th watch to The Godfather part II, it's my favorite for many reasons.In my opinion The Godfather II , I think it's a difficult movie when compare to the first one, as the movie follows 2 time lines, the younger Vito and Michael. Usually most of movies that follows this kind of structure (2 time lines ) might not be successful, but in this movie it was brilliant as we can see how Vito trying to build his empire and the most important thing for him is his family. On the other hand, the film shifts to Michael and how his leadership is different from his father , which it main goal is power without taking care of his family. In addition, there are some cultural differences between the two movies, especially in the wedding scenes, in The Godfather 1 we can see how the Italian culture still exists, such as the music. On the other hand, in part 2 this thing slowly dying when Frank Pentangeli asked the band to sing an Italian song but the band didn't know what's the song (which shows the cultural differences between Michael's era and Vito's era).The second point is that , there are a lot of scenes that doesn't have a dialogue but it explains a lot of things. For example, some people wondering how Michael knew it was Fredo who betrayed him ( we all know it's Fredo when he received a phone call to help them again after the assassination of Michael failed, but Fredo refused ), it was obvious, ( look to Michael's face when they setting together in Cuba ) he had some suspicions, and his suspicions was confirmed when Fredo said that Johny Ola ( Hayman Roth assistant) told him about this place.The third point, the Cinematography was amazing, how Coppola showed Us in the 1920s and Cuba in the 1950s.The Final point is the casting in both movies was amazing, and the music especially \"The Immigrant\" theme ( you must listen to it), and \"in cuba\" song when Michael arrived in Cuba (it's not available in the music album of the movie).In conclusion, I hope my review is helpful to you.Thanks.",

I simply hate the whole concept of a continuation story - if it was the whole and complete body of work why would it need any additions? I always said, unless the sequel is bigger, better and brings something new and fresh it can be considered as such. There are not many thoroughly well done second parts, you can literally count them all down with fingers of one person's hands, and one of those is naturally \"The Godfather Part II\".As with the first movie the second follows two people - Vito, from his youth years to his greatest successes, and Michael, continuing his story of self-exploration, vengeances, trials, tribulations and family matters. What I disliked though that there was way more time devoted to Michael instead of dividing their screen time with Vito equally because I felt that his story was more interesting and intriguing than that of Michael's. Vito was the man who built himself from scratch and surrounded himself with love and adoration from almost everybody who knew him well whereas Michael took over whatever was left from that adoration and love but perverted it and unknowingly for himself turned it into almost unanimous hate. The picture shows this contrast between the rise of Vito and personal demise of Michael very clearly with the help of its amazing cinematography.Part II has won six Oscars, winning yet again the Best Picture, giving the much deserved statuette to Francis Ford Coppola for his remarkable direction and to Robert DeNiro for his phenomenal portrayal of Vito - he certainly based his version of him on Marlon Brando's but gave him his own vibe and touch which made this character so extraordinary. I would also like to point out Diane Keaton and John Cazale whose both characters have gotten more screen time in the sequel to fully blossom and shine and they did the job splendidly. Al Pacino was somewhat stale in his performance, and so was the whole story in general, in my opinion, but by the end of it his Michael has grown into a more vivid person than ever which makes \"The Godfather Part II\" so great as a standalone movie and a near perfection as a sequel.",

I also didn't care for the constant cutting back and forth from the more interesting 1950's Cuba / Political Corruption / Rival Gang story to the 1900's Vito Corleone origin story. It just felt like the film was a little too bloated for sake of completeness where some judicious cutting and a couple more shootouts would have helped keep things moving. Added to that, it's extremely talky with scene upon scene of Pacino meeting with people in dark rooms, trading lines and brooding stares. It's also a bit confusing with Pacino playing so many characters off each other at the start, making you wonder if he's telling anyone the truth or lying to everyone. This only becomes clear(er) with the big kiss.That said, the film is an emotional roller coaster in a way that the other two films are not. It takes Pacino's Michael Corleone into all new realms where he is easy to root for in some scenes and easy to hate in others, yet all the while mesmerizing to watch. His relationships with his wife, his lawyer, and his brother all come off as multi-layered, complex, and somewhat relatable. For those of us who loved THE GODFATHER, which in my opinion is one of the top 5 greatest gangster films ever made, this film serves as a solid companion piece and exploration of \"what happened next\" without besmirching the original's legacy.It's high on dialog and low on action and murders, so while not my favorite of the bunch I'll still certainly recommend it. Love it or hate it, this film is meticulously crafted in a way that any other sequel would dream to be.

In the first, the plot exercised the relationship of a mobster father (Brando) and his son (Pacino) following in his footsteps; this time, prequel sections of the film exercise the similarities and difference between the two men in seemingly two different worlds. Robert De Niro made his career off of his Oscar-winning role as young Vito Corleone. First sequel to win an Oscar.**** (out of four)",

            "content": "Two different eras are depicted as comparisons of Vito, and his son Michael, and the generation that defines them.  Past sequences showing Vito as a young man are written with a feeling of nostalgia.  Contemporary moments involving Michael at same age is framed in a declining mode.  Two films in one to show how different father and son were from each other during the same age they are shown as.  One thing in common with both people are their tragic upbringing.\nThe Godfather(1972) dealt with the family structure and the difficulties which comes with the territory.  The Godfather Part 2(1974) is a study in corruption and power.  The theme of power in The Godfather Part 2(1974) is explored in a historical perspective by director, Francis Ford Coppola. Power as represented by Michael Corleone is cold blooded, iron clad, and shadowly.  Also, film contrasts Michael and Vito in how their deal with power at a comparative age.\nThere are some instances where Part 2 is better than Part 1.  First, the acting of Al Pacino is much improved and extraordinary.  Second, the characters and story expand to give them more depth.  Third,  Part 2 adds another dimension with inclusion of backstory to compliment main plot. Overall, The Godfather Part 2 is a masterful followup to the first film.\nTalia Shire develops her character further in Part 2 with her loose woman portrayal of \"Connie\" Corleone.  Robert Duvall again performs brilliantly in the role of Tom Hagen.  John Cazale gives a performance full of pathos and tragedy.  G.D. Spradlin is convincing two faced and sleezy as Senator Geary. Diane Keaton turns the character of Kay into someone who is unable to coexist with criminal element of Corleone family.\nOutstanding performance from Robert De Niro that was worthy of the Oscar he received for role in movie.  Mean Streets(1973) gave De Niro recognition and The Godfather Part 2(1974) give him a breakthrough role.  Among the five top performances, the legendary actor has contributed to the big screen.  One of many examples in why I think he is the greatest actor who ever lived.  He doesn't just play Vito Corleone, he becomes him.\nPlot focuses on the decline of the Corleone family, especially Michael Corleone.  Michael went from being an idealistic young man who didn't want to have anything to do with family business to becoming a cold and ruthless mob boss.  Al Pacino injects some new character facets which weren't in Part One.  Al Pacino brings a complexity to his role that makes Michael a tragic figure.  The moments involving \"Fredo\" and Michael are touching and tragic.\nMichael's marriage to Kay is more out of convenience and fear of loneliness than love.  Apparent in how they treat each other in the second film.  I believe things might have turned out differently for Michael as a human being if his first wife wasn't killed.  Hearing sequences balances between the comic and the dramatic.  The New York as depicted in Vito's youth feels authentic and nostalgic.\nMurder of Fanucci by young Vito Corleone is played out with heart beating anticipation.  In the book, THE GODFATHER, the murder of Fanucci is played in a more conventional manner with Vito following him to an empty warehouse where he kills him.  In the film, the murder of Fanucci is more stylized, and reliant on building out suspense and tension.  Handled well by both actors involved in scene and Francis Ford Coppola.  Fanucci is memorablely played by Milano Calibre 9(1972) star, Gastone Moschin.\nAt one point before production started, Martin Scorsese was considered as a possible director for The Godfather Part 2.  Because of the first film's box office success, Francis Ford Coppola was kept on as director for second film.  James Caan makes a small but vital cameo during flashback scene near the end.  Reconstructs the events that lead to Cuban Revolution in subjective fashion.  A key line in Godfather trilogy is spoken by Michael when he says;\"If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is you can kill anyone.\"\nIts a key line because it symbolizes how the Corleones do business within their political and organized crimes ties.  There is a lot of truth to this line from Michael because its a representative of what has happened throughout, and will continue to happen in the course of human existence. Corleone family is beset by tragedy that began with murder of Vito's father, and continues on in Michael's generation.  One of the saddest moments in cinema history are \"Fredo\"'s final moments in the house and the fishing boat.  Danny Aiello and Roger Corman have small roles with latter playing a Senator.",

            "content": "This film is a sequel to one of the most celebrated films of the 70's. A lot of people would give this full marks but I for one did not think this held up along with the first film. I think maybe Chinatown or The Conversation should have maybe won the Academy Award for Best Picture.This film is a continuation of Michael Corleone's position as the Don and detailing on his goal to make the Corleone family legitimate. At the same time, it also shows the beginnings of Vito Corleone. This is, for me, where the good and the bad side of the film is apparent. I'm going to start with the bad side. What made the film so great was that it was really a focus on family and the culture of the Italian people. This film feels like it just focuses on Michael and the consequences of his actions, the destruction of relationships and the creation of enemies. The business being focused on in this film, in Michael's story, doesn't work a lot for me as I find it a little boring. Hyman Roth is so dull as a villain that I did not care whether or not he succeeds or fails. The good side of the film is the focus on Vito Corleone's rise in New York in the early 20th century. It's very fascinating on how he became who he is as it's supported with an interesting villain, Fannuci. The crumbling of Michael's soul is definitely an aspect that I liked, as we felt that he has definitely changed since the beginning of the first film; but I wish the story behind it was just stronger.Coppola did not exactly screw this film up, it's definitely strong and the more you watch it the stronger it gets but I felt his work on the first was most definitely his best within the trilogy. It was brilliant on how he decided to have this film edited. Juxtaposing the rise of both father and son and how different in the direction both of them go, gives it much more weight and effect. The man pretty much made a sequel and prequel at the same time and not be a disappointment.Gordon Willis, like in the first film, creates this feeling of an old photograph due to the image giving off this golden hue. The film really feels like a period film, and it helps us feel like we are watching a film created in that time. I guess Willis didn't really get much from this film compared to the first because it's not something new. Nevertheless the photography is still strong even today.The music here is a little different and at times a little darker but that's just because of Michael's fall from grace. It still has that iconic music by Nino Nota from the first film and when it appears, you get this feeling of nostalgia.The acting was excellent as expected. Pacino was able to make this character who was frightening without doing much. There are many moments where this guy feels really ruthless. The supporting cast was also great like the first film but there is a shift in focus on Michael rather than the whole family. In the flashback sequences, Robert De Niro was the only one really focused on and the rest had very little to do. De Niro may have gained more popularity in Scorsese's Mean Streets but I think this is where he really shines and where everybody took notice of him. Lee Strasberg was fine in playing a villain who really doesn't do a lot, he doesn't even feel threatening but Gaston Moschin as Fanuuci was fantastic. The man showed the he owns this side of town and everybody must respect him or else. Overall they are all deserving of credit.I may be a minority who think this film is not a masterpiece but I just do not find it as strong as the first as Michael's storyline felt flat. The flashback storyline and terrific acting and direction makes this film a must watch.",

            "content": "Even though \"The Godfather: Part II\" isn't as good as the first \"Godfather movie it is still one of the best mo movies ever made and is probably one of the best movie sequels ever done in all of movie history. The movie shifts back between the present day in the past but in the present the movie picks up where the first movie left off with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in charge of the Corleone crime family while still having his family members along with him, his step brother Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his older brother Fredo (John Cazale), as well as his younger sister Connie (Talia Shire). Also a new change was that he is married to his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) and had two children. Unlike most directors who have directed mob movies in the past Coppola shows a different side to the people in the mob than others like Michael Curtiz or Martin Scorsese who have also directed masterful mob movies, but the only difference is that Coppola shows a more dramatic side as well as Curtiz, but Scorsese shows a much grittier and evil side. The flashbacks in the movie talk about the early life and the immigration to America of none other than Michael's father Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, whose dialogue is all Italian.) This movie isn't like any other sequel in any other franchise that I've ever seen because most franchises are for action/adventure type movies, but The Godfather series is the only popular crime franchise. However like the first Godfather movie this one is nearly as flawless as this one with a great story, great cast, excellent and very effective dialogue co-written by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo (who also wrote the novel), as well as excellent performances throughout. In this review i'll try not to spoil anything but some of the most effective scenes in the movie are where Kay divorces Michael, Vito exacts his revenge on the man who did his family harm, and where Michael doesn't love Fredo anymore. This was a great movie and it makes me much more eager to see part 3. Even though there were other great films in 1974 such as Roman Polanski's \"Chinatown\", and \"The Conversation\" which Coppola also directed, but this one tops them all. In other words, this is the best movie of 1974.",

His is a totally disgusting,inhuman character without redemption. Why should we even watch over half of the movie with him in it if we don't like the character? It was at least interesting in the first movie that we get to witness the transformation of \"that's my family (not me),Kate\" Michael to cold killer mastermind. Since he had become that, what's the point of watching this character losing more of his humanity as if he had some left. Good thing must be said about the production thought, it was even more sumptuously filmed and choreographed than the original. But that's the only credible thing.

Great writing by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Highly under-appreciated but great acting by Richard Bright and Bruno Kirby in bit parts. A well written score is a staple of this movie. Flawless directing of the two coinciding stories of young Vito Corleone and his aging son Michael as the heads of a powerful mob family.

This has 2 parallel time lines: Flashbacks showing the young Vito Corleone rising to power and the continuation of the first film showing Michael Corleone handling both business matters and his personal life. It shouldn't have been as good as it is, but it knocks most sequels ever made into a bin liner. It's not quite as brilliant as some say it is. It's a bit too sprawling and tries to pack too much in. While the length in the first was excessive but just bearable, the second one has a bit too much. It can be a bit confusing and dips, but rarely. Otherwise, this sequel has it all: Amazing acting from everyone, even better direction from Francis Ford Coppola than the first and a powerful, moving screenplay. The final hour of the film is perfection and the last shot of Michael sitting alone in isolation, having lost everyone, has more emotional power than most films would squeeze into a ten minute monologue.Al Pacino gives one of the best movie performances of all time and it is a total outrage that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Everyone else is great. Although the script is a bit sprawling, it gets a lot done and is very powerful. Many of the scenes of assassinations are suspenseful and at times genuinely heart breaking. I didn't understand what was so great about Robert De Niro's performance, but you can certainly see Marlon Brando in his acting. Coppola's direction is less subtle this time and he shows even more of his directional brilliance. Some of the scenes, visually, and utterly phenomenal. It's darker, raises the stakes and expands the story like a sequel should. It's a moving, sobering story about power and how corrupting it is. In terms of sequels we could hardly have asked for a better follow up. Aside from the excessive length and the fact that it makes the memory of Al Pacino humiliating himself in Jack & Jill even more painful, this is a sublime sequel and one which set the bench marks for all other sequels.9/10",

            "content": "\"The Godfather: Part II\" (1974), whenever I think of great movie sequels, this film always comes to mind, every time. Not only is it just as good as the first Godfather movie, it's even better in some aspects! It's tied with the first one as one of my top ten all-time favorite gangster films and it's also one of my top ten all-time favorite movie sequels. The crazy thing is, not too many sequels can hold a candle to the first film. But, \"The Godfather: Part II\" is the epitome of a sequel done right. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot for this one is a little different in terms of layout compared to the first movie. For those who think it's a continuation of the story, yes, it is that. But, it's also a prequel at the same time. In this film, we see a young Vito Corleone's rise to power, along with Michael Corleone's rise to power. Now, that plot line has been done before in other movies. Some do it well and some don't. Granted, a story like that can become convoluted if it's not executed properly. That being said, \"The Godfather: Part II\" does it seamlessly and it all ties together in the end. Since it's a prequel and a sequel all at the same time, you're essentially watching two different movies for the price of one! They could've very easily split these two coinciding plots into their own individual films. But, they took a risk and spliced them both together, which was a huge gamble that definitely paid off. The runtime is 200 minutes in length and that could very possibly draw people away from watching it. That being said, the film makers utilized every single one of those minutes to perfection. There is always something going on and it keeps you hooked all the way from beginning to end. It's probably the fastest 200 minute movie you will ever see. Seriously, you blink and it's over! Plus, for a complex plot such as this, the long runtime is crucial for showcasing the story and not one of those 200 minutes are wasted. All of the acting is top-notch once again, from every cast member! The lineup of actors and actresses is absolutely insane. You have: Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, Talia Shire and so much more. What a cast! One thing I was a bit worried about when I first saw this film, was the fact that Marlon Brando wasn't in it at all. He was fantastic in the first one! Instead, Vito Corleone was played by Robert De Niro. His portrayal of Vito Corleone was sublime, he really nailed the character! So much so, that you won't miss Marlon Brando's presence on the screen. All of the performances from the whole cast is perfect, but, my personal favorite character portrayal in this movie is Robert De Niro's performance as Vito Corleone, with Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone as a very close second. This film has some of the best acting I've ever seen in any movie! They all nail their performances flawlessly and the chemistry between each one of them is nothing short of impeccable. All of the sets/locations are breathtaking and give the film a stunning atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are all perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack once again composed by Nino Rota, is a masterpiece. His film score sets the perfect tone and it helps tie everything together. \"The Godfather: Part II\" is a home run in the aspect of sequels, and especially crime/gangster films. It may not be my favorite crime/gangster movie, but it's definitely somewhere in my top five! I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen \"The Godfather: Part II\", what are you waiting for? Go see it today! I guarantee that you'll love it, especially if you enjoy the first movie as much as I do. The film makers have managed to make lighting strike twice with this flawless sequel. If you don't see it, then Michael Corleone might mark you as a traitor!",

The empathy for Michael Corleone has been drained completely, and with the exception of Tom Hagen, none of his underlings is nearly as interesting as those from the first film. Michael's antagonists are also uninteresting. The dullest character is Hyman Roth, who has NONE of the menacing charisma of the gangsters from the first film. The first film is steeped in Italian culture and family relationships, giving the characters a dimensionality that's completely missing from that of Roth. Lee Strasberg's performance is utterly lifeless. Watching him is like watching paint dry. I will say that the sequences with Robert DeNiro depicting the rise of Vito Corleone are good, but they don't make up for the boring aspects of what happens to Michael.",

Part 1 was a good film... I enjoyed it as you can read below... but part 2 was a better story.This film has 2 stories in it... the rise of Michael Corleone as the new mafia boss, and the other story is about Don Vito Corleone when he was young making his rise as the Godfather.The casting as before was brilliant. Al Pacino returned as Michael, and he played the part really well. Robert DeNiro played his father (a younger version) Don Vito Corleone. DeNiro was a fantastic choice to play the Godfather... he looked the part. I could imagine DeNiro growing old to look like Marlon Brando. Excellent stories.Again though, it was pretty slow paced during parts of the movie... it is such a long film. I don't think it needs to be that long. I know I say that a lot about films, but it's how i fell. I don't think that about all long movies... there are some movies that I love that are over 3 hours long... but these films felt long. It probably didn't help that I had to keep pausing this movie all the way through. I actually watched it in 2 halves because it was taking me so long.I will give this film a 7 out of 10... I know I gave part 1 the same mark, but they are 2 completely different films.Great story!For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",

I don't find the story all that interesting - various criminal masterminds trying to wrestle power off each other.The only thing that makes this movie OK is the performances of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. It really is a tour de force from both of them. Al Pacino's character, Michael Corleone, is a nasty piece of work. He tries to emulate his father Vito Corleone, but he is mistrusting and has an evil streak. He's prepared to cut off, in fact kill, close family, and will not be satisfied until he gets his way. Al Pacino plays it brilliantly.Robert De Niro, playing the young Vito Corleone, makes a great contrast. More relaxed, friendly, but also prepared to commit crime and kill to forward the interests of his family. But you can't help but feel he has a warm heart.Great performances like this aren't enough to turn a 3 hour plus dull storyline into a great movie though. I still got bored.",

Oh, and by the way: what a reminder that there was a time when Pacino actually tried to act...\nNow, the only reason I didn't give it ten stars is that I did not like the casting of Diane Keaton as Michael's wife. Even in the original film, she seemed totally out of place. But by now I just hated every scene she was in. It just didn't feel right. She never should have been in that role. Also, the fact that she has done a lot of comedy, and in my mind evokes outrageously silly scenes with Woody Allen, really spoils her appearance in a film filled with such family drama.",

            "content": "As I've said before, I really hate sequels.  Technically, this may not strictly be a sequel (since half of this, the flashback half, was in the original novel), but what the hell; this is the rare sequel which is not only great, but improves on the original.  If you held a gun to my head and asked me what my favorite movie was of all time, this would be the one. Though I disagree with Coppola, who felt he romanticized the Corleones in Part I, without that feeling, there would have been no Part II, and we must thank him for that.The way time passes from present to pass effortlessly, the way we see how past affects present, the way the story of Michael Corleone achieves the level of Greek tragedy, the direction, the performances, the score, everything comes together even deeper than in the first one.  But the primary reason to see this is Al Pacino.  It is my humble opinion that not only is this the best of his five great performances from 1972-75 (the others being THE GODFATHER, SCARECROW, SERPICO, and DOG DAY AFTERNOON), it is the greatest performance by an actor I have ever seen, period (Liv Ullman's performance in PERSONA is the best performance by an actress I have seen). Michael Corleone becomes more closed off as he achieves power.  He alienates friends, family, even the people who work for him, because he completely closes himself off from humanity.  Yet we feel for him, partly because Pacino NEVER plays for our sympathy, but gives a closed performance.  It's easy to overact, it's hard to play still and close to the vest, and Pacino chooses the more difficult path.  We also feel for him because we can sense Michael acts this way because it's the only way he feels he can run things. If he ever came out of his detachment, he'd have to admit he was a failure and was being immoral(which he does in Part III).  A masterpiece.",

The movie casting is one that will remain in the mind of film watchers for a long time.The film depicts the different paths in which the Corleone family took, as Vito took the high road of peace during his regime; Michael took the path of violence and taking all his enemies out the moment they show their face, to the point that no matter whom there were, friend or family you cross Michael you are dead.Partially based on Mario Puzo's 1969 novel, The Godfather, this 1974 sequel is in part both a sequel and a prequel to The Godfather movie released in 1972. The movie features two parallel dramas, one focusing on Michael Corleone's reign and him trying to gain control of the family business, the other story is based on flash backs of how Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), rose from his childhood in Sicily Italy in 1901 to his coming to America and the founding of the Corleone family.The plot shows how Michael was looking into expanding his family business to Las Vegas and Cuba. During the process, an attempt on his life was made, and the person behind it was someone close to him, this led to Michael taking out more people. Michael's ruthless behaviour affected his family and trusted friends.Being the first film to have part II in its name, The Godfather part II was a box office success and it received critical acclaim as one of the best films ever made. The production had some production problems initially when Pacino not wanting to be part of it because he felt the script wasn't OK enough, so Coppola had to re-write it, before Pacino came on board.The American Film Institute's 10th anniversary of greatest films has the movie rated number 32, and its ranked 3rd in IMDb's Top 100 Movies of all time, with its predecessor The Godfather ranked 2nd. It also got 11 Academy Awards nominations and it won Best Picture for that year. Out of the 11 nominations it won six Oscars which included Best Director for Francis Ford Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for Robert De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo.Al Pacino got a nomination for Best Actor but didn't win although in the BAFTA Award he won the Best Actor award for the film.The Godfather part II is a classic sequel to one of the best films ever made, so there is no need to see the first if you are not planning of crowning it with the second.www.lagsreviews.com",

It's a slow, boring study of an obsessive, boring, violent man. Many of the lesser characters are even more uninteresting. And for this it's highly rated? The attention given to the incidents in Cuba seem to be an attempt to add something lively to the movie, but just go to show how little there is to the main story. Bright, patriot son can't break away, starts slow, downward spiral, and ends up alone, friendless and depressed. And this is a great movie?",

I like the voyage in time and space that the viewer is allowed to take here: From the arid hinterland of Sicily to the stuffy brownstones in Hell's Kitchen to the grandeur of Lake Tahoe, to the elegant beachfront hotel in Cuba. In two occasions the meeting of crooks (that's more ore less what The Godfather in all parts is about) takes on the guise of a true art house movie: Hyman Roth's little birthday party on the roof terrace of a ritzy hotel in the Caribbeans and \u0096 above all \u0096 the passing around of an immensely tasteless golden telephone in the conference room of a Cuban ministry. Here it becomes more manifest than in any bloody murder scene: These guys are genuine carnivores!I loved the outstanding performances of actors Lee Strasberg and John Cazale, both long gone now. Strasberg gives the sly, but old and exhausted schemer Hyman Roth a striking image. Amazing how much of a personality you can convey with moving so little! His difficult breathing, the faltering yet firm voice are just perfect. Cazale's portrayal of the Don's older, frustrated brother also left a lasting impression. You can almost grasp his unhappiness with your hands. The final conversation between him and the Don is a fantastic piece of acting. Slumped utterly dejected in a deck chair, he tries for the last time to stand up to his brother. \"I'm smart!\" he shouts, and his voice cracks miserably. I feel acting can't get better than that.",

            "content": "Keeps the authentic, beautiful and rich feeling of the first film, while adding a level of intensity and interest throughout. The idea of producing parallel stories depicting the rise of a young Vito Corleone (played to perfection by Robert De Niro) and the loneliness and betrayal of Michael Corleone (the subtle and frighteningly intense Al Pacino) was a brilliant one. However, this is where the majority of the film's flaws lie. In creating these two separate stories, they made one much more interesting than the other. When watching the slow turn of paranoia and danger in Michael's life, all I can manage to think about is what will happen next in Vito Corleone's rise to becoming the Godfather. Either way, these are two of the strongest and most complex characters of all time. Vito loses his father, brother and mother to the same man who he luckily escapes from. He gains a family and rises to power, murdering another Don in the process in one of the most intensely suspenseful scenes of all time, and returns to confront this now bitter and alone man.The death of Don Ciccio is one of the strongest scenes of the film, and certainly portrays how much more brilliant De Niro is when he's playing quiet strength instead of shouting at the top of his lungs. In the late Don Ciccio, we also see a parallel to the story of Michael Corleone throughout the film. A man who is simply trying to keep his family in tact, while remaining at the same level of respect and power as his late father. Instead, he falls into a world of betrayal on all fronts and the constant paranoia of being at the top of the food chain. He begins to feel as though he is the strongest man, waiting for the inevitable opportunity for another to bring him to the grave (just like what Vito had previously done many years ago). This leads to a life of utter alienation, even from his family. Three images in this film portray the most sympathetic form of isolation in cinematic history (Michael looking out the window as Fredo sails away, Michael sitting in the park bench alone at the end, and Michael sitting alone at the dinner table while everyone else joyously surprises Vito on his birthday). We see the loneliness and rejection of a man who lives his life for his family, but eventually loses them all. The final dinner scene has so much complexity it left me stunned well after the credits rolled. Definitely a film that has earned it's iconic status, featuring two performances that rightfully lit the fuel for the two most acclaimed careers the film industry has ever seen.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II is a complicated film. In its 3 hour run time it manages to pull off telling two stories. One that takes place in the 1950s, and one that takes place in the 1920s. In the 1920s we see Vito Corleone arriving in New York City and making a name for himself among the wealthy gangsters, starting a family, and eventually becoming Don of the Corleone crime family. The exact parallel is the 1950s story, where we see Vito's son Michael in his new role as Don of the Corleone family as he starts his own family. The Godfather Part II is a superior film to the original because it tells a much more interesting story, and it does a better job at portraying what an organized crime family is really like.All of the great actors from the original are back including James Caan in a flashback sequence. Al Pacino comes across as a great bad guy, and he seems to be ten times more cold hearted than his father ever was. He's a changed man. He started off a legitimate man who wanted nothing to do with his family's business, but now he's more into it than ever before. This movie features Al Pacino's second best performance in a film (second to Dog Day Afternoon), and it shows what kind of actor he truly is. This is the film that made Robert De Niro a star, and rightly so. Robert De Niro portrays young Vito Corleone on his rise to power in New York. This is Robert De Niro's first big role and he plays it like he's been doing it for years. The best thing about it is that just about every line of his dialogue is in Italian, and yet you still enjoy his performance.The Godfather Part II contains the most realistic view of the mafia ever portrayed in film. In fact it's so realistic that the central characters don't even refer to it as the mafia. The Godfather Part II tells a more interesting story than the original, and it's more fun to sit through. The Godfather Part II is a great film that is both dramatic and epic as well as entertaining. Great movie.9/10",

            "content": "...\"The Godfather: Part II\" is probably the best sequel ever made.  As you all probably know, the story is cut in two: one half focuses on Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) battle to keep his power in the crime syndicate and the second focuses on Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) - the character played by Marlon Brando in the original - and his rise to power in America.  Both stories are done very well, but in the end the latter is more interesting. As everyone knows, Brando did a great performance and created a memorable character in the original, and it is very entertaining to watch De Niro give it a try.  Except after watching this film some may agree that De Niro did a better job.Unfortunately, Michael's story suffers from the loss of James Caan's character, Sonny Corleone.  He spiced up the first very much, and it truly is disappointing to see him disappear from the second.  Of course, Pacino still does an amazingly memorable (and villainous) performance.  The supporting players, consisting of Tom (Robert Duvall), Clemenza (Bruno Kirby), Kay (Diane Keaton), Frankie (Michael V. Gazzo) and Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) also do well.Coppola scored big on this one, and De Niro and Pacino make it even better, 9/10.",

            "review_title": "The Godfather is more important. But the Godfather part 2 is better",
            "content": "The Godfather is a more important film, of course it is. But the Godfather part 2 is a better film. It's more ambitious, it's more elegiac, it delves deeper into the soil of Italian-American myth, plus... what were they thinking of, trying to match the critical and commercial dynamite of the first film? The Godfather Part 2 was, from conception upwards, an insane project. But it worked. When The Godfather premiered in New York on 14 March 1972, co-screenwriter and novelist Mario Puzo had already started work on the sequel. That's how sure Paramount were that they had a monster hit on their hands, despite some exhibitors turning up their noses at a preview screening: too little action, too much talking, and too long - proof that in no way are exhibitors a bunch of popcorn-selling philistines. After two days of release, cinema managers were being offered bribes by punters desperate to get to the front of the queues which busted the proverbial block. There was something of the Mafia about the way in which Paramount doubled ticket prices for weekend shows to squeeze extra revenue from their new cash cow. The sequel, announced on 16 April and working titled Don-Michael, was a commercial inevitability (\"When you've got a licence to make Coca-Cola, make Coca-Cola! Said Charlie Bluhdorn, head of Gulf and Western, who owned Paramount). The Godfather grossed $101 million in its first 18 weeks, and nobody was going to stop the studio having another cake and eating it. But Francis Ford Coppola, the young director whom the studio had almost fired from the Godfather but who was now feted by Hollywood and the world, wasn't that interested. So they offered him a million dollars plus a huge 13% of the profits and total artistic control. Altogether now: it was an offer he couldn't refuse. Thus, out of this sticky climate of money-grabbing corporate opportunism did cinemas greatest part2 emerge. Pub debates about the diminishing returns of the sequel usually collapse at the mention of it's name. So why does it work? Why isn't it Police Academy2:their first assignment? Much of it has to do with the unique power of it's own part one, which established it's family of characters so vividly. Audiences were gagging for more of Michael, Tom, Kay, Fredo and Connie. Bit the Coppola-Puzo masterstroke was to develop the saga in two directions, forwards through the faustian ascendance of Don Michael, and backwards into the early 1900s, tracing Vito Andolini's first steps into mafia hood (he earns the surname Corleone-the name of his home village-through a mix-up at Ellis Island's immigration control). As with all of Coppola's best work, the casting was inspired.(And as with The Godfather, fans can while away hours mulling over who might have been cast. Try this one: dying Miami mobster Hyman Roth, played with precision by acting coach Lee Strasberg in the film-could have been Laurence Olivier, Ella Kazan, or blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo!) Robert De Niro, plucked from the rising star racks after Mean Streets, seems born to play the young Marlon Brando, Pacino, Coppolas wildcard in casting the Godfather, grows into the central role of Michael in perfect parallel with his character, and Diane Keaton proves the quiet lynchpin( which is no mean feat in this male-dominated film). Everything that was majestic and mythic about the First film is more so in Part2,its scenes deliberately matching the original. Author of the essential Godfather book, Peter Cowie, describes the two-part saga in musical terms, as \"Coppolas suite\", with bass lines , motifs and rhyming patterns. (\"As a whole, Coppola said, the first film ought to haunt the second like a spectre.\") So instead of constantly reminding us that the first film is better, part 2 builds on it's operatic sweep and cranks up the drama, both narratively and visually. Cinematographer Gordon Willis goes into sublime sepia overdrive for the flashbacks. Production designer Dean Tavoularis tops his own evocative 1940s New York streets with a living, breathing Italian immigrant community circa 1912(actually the Ukranian quarter). The epic 26 minute wedding scene that opened part one is echoed in part2 by the altogether tackier confirmation party at the new Corleone compound in Lake Tahoe(the lake itself claiming the life of one of the family in part2s chilling climax.) Actually, claiming that the second is better than the first is like saying Lennon's better than Mcartney. One cannot exist in isolation from the other ; they must be watched by anyone who loves American Film consecutively. Apparently, they made a part3 too. 10/10",

            "content": "No matter how stormy it is outside, the family is always the warmest haven.The new and old godfathers are family-oriented, loyal and dedicated, but their endings are different. The wife married by the old godfather is a Sicilian. The woman there is pure and kind and cares for her family, and she lives in a mafia, so she can accept her husband's career. And they are supported by the trouble and together, so the relationship between husband and wife has been very harmonious. The old godfather is a person with a great sense of family responsibility. The original intention of the struggle is also to make the family better. No matter how much trouble is encountered outside, it is always a breeze to return home. Go to the theater to see beautiful women with friends. Friends said that the actress is beautiful. He said that is what you think, in my mind, only the wife and children are the most beautiful. So he will educate children, men who do n't take time to spend with their family, not real men. He will ask Mike if his wife and children are doing well. In his mind, no matter how big the outside career is, the family is always the most important. Why the godfather is a must-see movie for men to grow up, indeed, learn from the old godfather how to be a real manThe new godfather, under his father's words and examples, also paid great attention to the family. So he will fight back when his father is stabbed. After the death of his brother, he took the burden of the family, even if his original intention did not want to go this way. When Fredo helps an outsider talk about him, he will be very angry and say that you will not be allowed to unite outsiders to fight against the family, never. This also helped Fredo to betray the family several times, and finally he was buried and buried. Mike and Kay feel more that the two are suitable to talk together, and the elements of love are quite few. Kay called and asked Mike to say that she loved her, but Mike never said. And he fled to Sicily without saying a word, and never contacted him later. Perhaps he had always wanted to marry a wife like his mother, so when in Sicily, he would fall in love with the Sicilian girl at first sight. And soon a wedding was held with the girl, why many people talked for a long time but couldn't get married, and can quickly marry another person after breaking up, it is important to meet the right person at the right time. Unfortunately, the two were together for a short time, and the newlywed wife was killed by the bodyguard. Since then, the girl has always been a cinnabar mole in his heart. Mike came back to Kay only a year later, when the family was in a precarious situation, and Kay was the most suitable wife. Because they knew each other well, Kay also loved him. After all, he waited for six years, so the two got married. But the two of them did not hold a grand wedding in the movie, maybe the form was forced at that time. Kay is a native American. Her education and religious belief made her unable to accept Mike's triad family and even less understand the business he did. Therefore, the two were in conflict, and eventually moved away. Later, Kay killed Mike's child and said some unsympathetic words, completely breaking Mike's heart. So when Kay wanted to leave without keeping, Mike secretly closed the door when he secretly visited his children to leave. Like the last scene in Godfather 1, the door between family business and her. If the first wife is not killed, perhaps all three will be happier. Kay can find a thorough American marriage and establish a happy family. The first wife will be like Mike 's mother, praying for him to have children, taking care of the family, and not afraid of blaming him for his career. It is a pity there is no if, the road to the king is finally lonely.",

Coppola and Puzo juggle two stories, the growth of the Corleone family under the direction of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) as he grimly tries to take the business legitimate, and the early life of his orphaned father (played here Robert De Niro in a bemused but attentive manner, with dialogue almost entirely in Italian) as he struggles to find his place in the New World. The filmmakers (and this is a collaboration between director and co-scenarist, make no mistake) with the success of the first film have the freedom to relax and tell a thorough story and it unfolds over more than three hours with pinpoint precision and convincing detail. The history it encompasses includes a fascinating foray into Cuba on the eve of revolution and it seems fresh, significant--a subject hitherto unexplored on the big screen; it makes the film seem special, independent of its older sibling. The performances are, again, wonderful and include a startlingly bitter Diane Keaton, a nuanced, graceful Lee Strasberg and a heartbreaking John Cazale. While no film can quite stand alongside its predecessor, this one comes as close as one can come and no film can quite stand alongside this one either.",

            "content": "The success of the first film about gangster wars and its popularity led to the imminent creation of the second film of the future trilogy. The same team gathered again to continue the history of the Corleone family. Now Michael stood at its head, calculating and intelligent, bold and unshakable.The second film, of course, is remembered for the fact that the legendary Marlon Brando is no longer in it. However, the work shows us a new genius. And his name is Robert De Niro. The actor plays a young Vito Corleone and the path of his formation. And although in the first frames you clearly realize that the actors are absolutely not similar to each other, over time this idea is lost, because De Niro perfectly fits into the image. His game doesn't look like a parody. The actor fits perfectly into the narrative. Probably, thanks to the storyline where Robert appears, this film is my favorite in the entire franchise.The second part shows us two story arcs developing in parallel. In one, we see Michael Corleone continuing his father's path, leading his clan. In the other, as mentioned above, the young Vito Corleone is going his way of becoming.Al Pacino as Michael looks great again. He vividly demonstrates how it is not easy for his hero to stay in the center of unfolding events, including conflicts with other families, pressure from the police and personal life.The picture perfectly demonstrates how cruel the world of criminals is. Let them wear suits, pretend to be decent family men, their inner world is very dark. And behind the luxury lurks fears and cruelty. One competes with the other and at the same time coexists together. Otherwise, as if, nothing.The further the story goes, the scarier Corleone becomes. It seems that he loses touch with reality and the continuing deaths lead him, it seems, to the top, but at the same time they destroy the man in him, the soldier with whom he once returned home, the man his wife fell in love with. This is how a monster is born that will not tolerate competition and is ready to hold on to power, rising higher and higher, stepping over mountains of corpses.Two parallel stories show similar worlds for father and son. The film clearly demonstrates how power dulls people's feelings, makes them cruel, impenetrable, and makes their families cry. And even at such moments, the main characters do not really think about what kind of people they have become, since their loved ones are indignant. But it seems that the simplest answer for them is to fight for the family, all for the sake of the family. I don't know if they believe in their own words.The visual range, music, acting, shooting - everything is at the highest level. Francis Ford Coppola remains true to himself and makes a high-quality action movie, psychological drama, thriller for the viewer. His vision and corporate identity are easily recognizable and readable. Unhurried, sometimes even somewhat phlegmatic, narration, muted colors, unexpected plot twists - all this allows you to enjoy an excellent quality film.Now it's a classic. But the classics that are still on the hearing, the work that rooted the genre of the gangster saga and became an example for future works of followers. It is unlikely that after 50 years the film will be remembered if it has not sunk into the soul, which means that this is a good movie.9 out of 10.",

The first story deals with Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) rise to power and becoming the Godfather. The other story deals with a bloody war between Michael Corleone and Meyer Lansky based mobster, Hyman Roth.Acting: The characters are not as interesting as the characters of its predecessor because it is a sequel. However it matches this with its slightly superior and superb acting. Al Pacino gives the greatest performance of his life and one of the greatest performances of all time, reprising his role as Michael Corleone and giving an absolutely chilling performance as a man who slowly and subtly succumbs more and more into the world of crime. This is the movie where he should have won Best Actor. Robert De Niro gave another fantastic performance winning Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the you Vito Corleone. John Cazale gave a nomination worthy performance as Fredo Corleone expanding the character from the Godfather by himself and giving new meaning to the word Fredo. Other great performances include Talia Shire, Morgana King, Robert Duvall, Lee Strasberg, and Michael V. Gazzo.Genre/Quality: The movie still stays the same with crime but also raises more family issues. While the 1st film appeared to glorify crime, the continued series deals with the dark side in this movie. As with the first movie the music is great. Camera angles are fantastic. Transition between the 50's and early 1900's are also great. They really made the rise of Vito scenes match the world of that time period.Overall this is a fantastic not to be missed movie which equals The Godfather Part 1 and both are second only to Goodfellas.10/10",

You rarely get to see a movie longer than 3 hours that does not have a boring slow-paced part, but that is the case here. This is one of the most amazing movies ever made, from the setting, the acting, the costumes, the vehicles, the action sequences, the story, the emotions, absolutely everything. Many say Al Pacino is generic since he can act only as a mobster, but did they ever think about if there is someone better? Plus, there is a huge difference in the mafia style in Godfather and Scarface for exaple, a complete opposite, yet, he manages to clinge both rolls. Also, as we see the backroll transition from Marlon Brando to Al Pacino we get even more excited, wondering how many acting legends this ovie has yet to offer? There has never been a bigger, better and more suited anti-hero than that played by Al Pacino in The Godfather franchise.",

Even today attention seeking personality disordered people still say it. Its not as good as the Godfather....but it is still a great movie. Its very well directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and Al Pacino gives a solid performance as the godfather. We are into the 1950s and organized crime is not quite as brutal as it was. Pacino has a lot on his plate...making deals with the unpredictable Hyman Roth (brilliantly played by Lee Strasberg) and finding the traitor in his family is Fredo. This huge mistake by Fredo will (must) cost him his life. (never go against the family) There are flashback sequences about Pacinos father (played by Robert Di Niro) ...his arrival in New York as a simple boy....and his rise to crime boss as he realizes shooting \"big shots\" makes people respect you. In the end Coppola ties things together with a few killings...as he did in the Godfather. This is never a boring film...there are many things \"going on\". Highly entertaining, intelligent The Godfather Part Two is extremely satisfying.",

            "review_title": "\"You Can Never Lose Your Family\"",
            "content": "Here you have the supreme example of a sequel which eclipses its original.  \"The Godfather Part II\" is a majestic tragedy, operatic in its sweep, gigantic in its architecture and a stand-alone masterpiece in its own right - but a film which also amplifies and explains the film which went before it.  In the closing reverie sequence, the superbly-staged flashback, we finally understand what has driven Michael Corleone and why he has so persistently humiliated Tom Hagan.Several narrative threads are embroidered into Michael's story.  The scene shifts neatly from Sicily in 1901 to New York in 1917 and 1941, and to Nevada and Cuba in 1958.  The period detail is nothing short of wonderful. The vendetta is enacted in the exact same locations which featured in Domingo's \"Cavalleria Rusticana\".  Same streets, same theme.Brooding ominously over everything is The Family.  Many of the characters try to escape its clutches - Connie, Kay, Fredo, Frankie Pentangeli - but The Family is all-powerful and its reach is long.  Michael was Don Vito's favourite son, and this is more a curse than a blessing.  The college-educated marine officer expected and deserved to carve out a destiny for himself, but The Family had other plans.  Chosen by fate to be the new Don, Michael succeeds brilliantly but also succumbs to despair as love eludes him and paranoia sets in.  \"You wanna wipe everybody out?\" asks Tom. \"Just my enemies,\" answers Michael - as he plans the death of his own sibling.  By the end, Michael's very existence is surrounded by, and predicated upon, death.Tom Hagan is the non-Italian who has, through loyalty and intelligence, risen high in The Family.  The Corleone lawyer and majordomo, Tom can always be relied upon to be calm, efficient and discreet.  Robert Duvall was rightly accorded second billing after Pacino for his fascinating, understated performance.  \"Tom isn't going to sit in with us,\" Michael tells Johnny Ola, and we see Tom masking his surprise at this humiliation.  At one point he asks directly, \"Why do you hurt me, Michael?\"  For this man, the consummate staff officer, to ask such a thing shows the depth of his pain. At the very end of the film, Michael's desire to wound Tom is explained.\"I intend to squeeze you.  I don't like your kind of people,\" says the brash Senator Geary as he bargains over a corrupt gaming licence.  Later, The Family rescues him from a deeply compromising situation and the Senator becomes yet another Corleone bagman, speaking in defence of Michael at the Senate hearings.  The sunlit frivolity of the first communion party outside jars nicely with the dark dealings inside the tenebrous house, underlining Michael's remarks to Geary on the subject of hypocrisy.Pacino is hugely authoritative as Michael, and carries much of the credit for the film's triumphant success, but it has to be said that Robert de Niro is astonishing as Don Vito.  He grows in assurance as he ages before our eyes, and combines the human decency and the cold ruthlessness which are both the hallmarks of Vito Corleone.  De Niro achieves all of this whilst marvellously and uncannily reproducing the mannerisms of Brando's creation.Fredo is the weak brother.  Lacking Sonny's cheerful brutality and Michael's gravity, he is passed over for the succession. The Rosado brothers manipulate him and make a traitor of him.  John Cazale plays him beautifully as the nervy malcontent who feels he should be the Don, but who is given the whorehouse jobs.  By the end, Fredo has regressed into a childlike state, fishing with the kids and tearfully grateful for being allowed into Michael's presence.The Fanucci sequence is terrific.  1917 comes to life for us as a crowded New York street scene transforms into a theatre interior.  We see a Neapolitan bel canto performance reproduced faultlessly.  This story-within-a-story explains Vito Andolini's rise to prominence with pace and historical imagination.  Similarly, Cuba on the eve of the communist takeover is brought vividly to life on the screen.  We share Michael's growing sense of unease as the Batista regime unravels, and it becomes clear that Fredo has betrayed The Family.  \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\" is Michael's motto, and we see him put this to devastating effect with Fredo and Hymie Roth.For all Michael's success as a leader, he fails his wife Kay (Diane Keaton) and his private life is barren.  Kay has to be protected from The Family's enemies, but to her it feels like a claustrophobic imprisonment. Things have gone badly wrong by the time of Michael's return from Cuba (he has to be briefed on which Christmas present he has 'given' his son).  A richly emotional chiaroscuro scene with his mother brings Michael to admit that he has lost Kay's love.  She is the loser, becoming inexorably estranged from The Family and from her own children.  Michael symbolically obliterates her by closing the door in her face.In the shifting sands of gangland treachery, it is hard to be sure who has double-crossed whom.  Did Roth deceive Michael, or is Michael now hopelessly paranoid?  What was the truth behind the bungled whacking of Frankie Five Angels?  One reality emerges from the chimera.  The Family alone is strong, and it crushes mercilessly those who fall victim to it. Even Don Michael.",

A young Al Pacino returns as Michael Corleone, head of a major crime family eager to expand into new territory. His trials and tribulations -- business and personal -- are spliced with flashback sequences detailing his infamous father's journey to America and rise to mob power.THE GODFATHER PART II is magnificent in so many ways. The acting is impeccable, with Pacino outdoing himself and an unrecognizable Robert De Niro, as young Vito Corleone, stealing the show. They're surrounded by arguably one of the strongest supporting casts ever assembled, highlighted by Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, G.D. Spradlin and Diane Keaton. Despite a screen time of well over three hours, the film doesn't need a grand soundtrack or flashy editing to help hold our interest. The actors do that just fine.Of course the performers don't do it alone. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is inspired, allowing the film fill out its lengthy running time in superior fashion. The writing and plot are absorbing, allowing this sequel to stay true to its predecessor while bringing something new and different to the screen. In fact it would seem everyone involved, both behind and in front of the camera, worked in perfect accord. We come away with the sense that had just one cog in the wheel been less than superb, the end result would not have been so monumental.THE GODFATHER PART II requires a substantial investment of time, but it's more than worth it.

Now I know it is a classic, but the style of the first movie is really anything but modern - a very long slow sit-through that younger movie goers like me might be perplexed with. Which is why I wanted to watch the second part.Now that was a good decision! sure I won't say part II is a better movie, but it has a slightly different pace, for example it has more scenes. But the more important thing is that it completes part I brilliantly, and perhaps necessarily; Because the strength of this movie is how the stories of Michael and the story of Vito reflect each other. Separated, those are simple Mafia-esque plots. But the movie shows us the bigger picture: how these men's lives came to be what they are, how they connect, where they differ, etc. The viewer is overwhelmed by the complex meaning underlying this connection and all it's subtle truths, putting everything into a grand perspective like no other movie has done before. For me this film hasn't been so much about crime and the ethical questions behind it, but more a story of a family, and perhaps a story about an inevitable connection between people's lives, how are bound by this thread of revenge and violence. I mean, all Michael has ever wanted is to keep his family safe and make the corleone legitimate, but alas, he is of course bound by a things that happened decades before he was born.It's a dark conclusion but the humanity of it is just portrayed great- Making Mikael a very good anti-hero character, much thanx to the excellent Al Pachino of course. Great movie and I will check out the third part once I get the chance.",

The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry.

            "content": "The Godfather Part II (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974) is a brilliant film full of unforgettable moments, if marginally less coherent and effective than the original. Set seven years after the events of the first movie, it traces the increasingly alienated don, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), as he expands his criminal empire into Nevada and Havana, while fighting congressional hearings, assassination attempts, and betrayal from within his very family. His cold existence is contrasted with his father Vito's early years, as the future godfather (Robert De Niro leaving an indelible impression) escapes persecution in Sicily and finds a new life in America - where his neighbourhood is dominated by a grasping, merciless small-time Mafioso.The first half of the movie is slightly disjointed, but lays the groundwork for a final hour that is utterly unimpeachable - much like Michael Corleone himself. The visceral violence and quotable dialogue (\"You keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\") are obvious surface pleasures, but once more the film's greatness lies in its more reflective, verbose moments. There's a superb scene between Michael and Fredo (John Cazale) that recalls the apex of the first film (Brando and Pacino's garden two-hander), with Cazale apparently trapped in his chair by rage and regret at being passed over by his father. \"It was the way Pop wanted it,\" Michael says. \"It ain't the way I wanted it,\" Cazale shrieks. \"I can handle things; I'm smart. Not like everybody says like dumb; I'm smart, and I want respect!\" The sequence in which Michael's wife (Diane Keaton) reveals the truth about her 'miscarriage' is also extraordinary to behold. Pacino doesn't just slap Kay across the face, he launches himself at her from across the room - like a coiled spring, or a cat; though really like nothing else on earth. Usually such concessions to melodramatic domestic drama are tawdry, upsetting and unbelievable, but Pacino's remarkable handling of the material makes it chilling, horrifying and impossible to forget.This is a superbly-scripted, brilliantly-acted study of absolute moral corruption, but just as Michael is colder and more ruthless than his father, so The Godfather Part II is more clinical and less emotionally resonant than the first film, provoking a sense of melancholia in place of tears. That's unquestionably fitting, and it feels like nitpicking to point out shortcomings in a film so intelligent, incisive and compelling, but I am going to reverse a long-held view and contend that the sterility and occasionally haphazard plotting of this sequel makes it inferior to the first movie, if only by a fraction. It's still a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Two years after the masterpiece that is The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola decided it was time to direct and release Part II of what would become a trilogy. A movie like this is extremely difficult to review and to have expectations for, especially when it is considered by most to be much better than the original and perhaps the greatest sequel ever made. However, is this an over statement or not? Quite simply said, yes and no! Much like The Godfather, everything works amazingly in this film. In my opinion, it isn't the greatest sequel ever made, to that I say The Empire Strikes Back and I much prefer the original over it but that is by no means a way to say I dislike this film in the slightest. I love this film and that's certain and much like The Godfather, it took two viewings before I truly loved it.*Spoilers contained throughout this review* It has been a few years since the death of Don Vito Corleone and Michael has now become the head of the Corleone Crime family as his business stretches through Nevada. An assassination attempt on his life leads him through a war with Hyman Roth whilst the story of a young Vito Corleone, the to be Don of the family, is portrayed marvellously by an inexperienced actor at the time, Robert De Niro in an Oscar winning performance The major issue I had with this film when its considered to be better than the original is how the absence of Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone really leaves a big and unfinished hole. That was my issue the first time as the word 'godfather' only brings one image into my mind. Not De Niro's Vito but Brando's. Despite amazing and legendary performances by Al Pacino and Robert de Niro, the absence of Marlon Brando still leaves an impact. Luckily this absence doesn't prove too costly for me this time around and most of it is well covered by the two.The strength to the film is a tough one to pick but the acting still stands out. Apart from the acting, the storyline is extremely strong and powerful thanks to amazing De Niro and Al Pacino performances. Even that being said, the film is by no means more iconic or memorable than the first but a perfect continuation to what I believe, the greatest film of all time! The characters in this film are fantastic from a young Vito and his friends to Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola and various other characters such as Frank Pentanjali. Despite not having characters as memorable as Luca Brasi and Sonny and an older Vito, The Godfather Part II is extremely strong in terms of good characters and a fantastic and yet again, an immersive story.Despite containing only a few words of English, my favourite proportion of the film would have to be the story of Vito Corleone as it provides all necessary background story perfectly. Contributing to a rough estimation of one third of the film's story, this is the stronger part of the film and thus, the more interesting part of it too! Words from De Niro such as 'I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!' may not be anywhere near as powerful coming from an inexperienced actor at the time but is nevertheless amazing. One of my favourite lines from De Niro would have to be when he talks to a young Michael stating that he loves him! This falls perfectly back in place with everything Vito stood for in the original film when he stated that he never wanted Michael mixed up in the family business. Vito Corleone was a flawless character in Part I but Part II improves upon everything about his character, giving him necessary backstory that ultimately works superbly in such a film.The iconic soundtrack is yet again, amazing! The first few moments of the film when the soundtrack begins and the title fades in with a beautifully filmed shot of Michael Corleone as the Don was utterly amazing! That has to be my favourite film introduction moment alongside The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The soundtrack is powerful and moving from moments where Michael displays his love for his son to moments such as a young Vito talking to his son. The soundtrack perfectly adds the necessary amount of emotion to each scene without ever attempting to out do itself. Such perfected soundtrack works extremely powerfully in this film.",

Acting (Al Pacino is once again destroying on the role, De Niro is also great, well, everybody are great here), Coppola's direction is fantastic.

The first was (for me) straight to the point, it have one thing, and it moves the plot all along. Well, this isn't a rule or something, the movie can make something diferent and also be great (and this movie is great), but, some things dont fit as much for me. The whole young Don plot, at the end, I didn't saw that much that make this whole part of the movie all that relevant. It doesn't show really how Vito grow up on the mafia thing, I don't know, the parts are good, the mix with some scene of the present are really great, but, at the end, if their aren't here, the movie will still works the same. Another thing is the story of the movie itself, seems like they shows somethings, but not much as they should show, seems like that goal was to show 20 years of his life, and this is it.But dont get me wrong, the movie is fantastic, was the longest movie that I saw and I really was hopping for more at the end, doesn't look like it's more than 3 hours long, and this is fantastic.In the end of the movie is great to look how diferent Mike has became from Vito, when in the last scenes we see him almost completely alone, he lost all his family, and he has not became a better Don that his ever was.Well, in short, The Godfather - Part II is a amazing film, but, for me, the masterpiece is the first one.",

Al Pacino is stand out in the movie cast.You just see the expressions and his eyes it can tell you the whole story. He has completely transformed to a ruthless,heartless and cold gangster but never stopped loving his family. The scene where Kay(Diane Keaton) tells him about that she aborted their child,Al is flawless and most realistic how his eyes pops out and how he knocks her down.He deserved the Oscar for best actor. Robert De Niro is impeccable.What do you expect when two of the greatest actors play two of the greatest characters. De Niro portrays the character with similar talent as Marlon Brando did. The way he speaks with same husky voice also his sicilian. His principles,taking care of things,returning the favor and rise to mafia is just marvelous. The best scenes are where he follows Fannuci at Festa to his house and kills him other one ,obviously where he stabs Don Ciccio and says \"My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you\" is just brilliant. Diane Keaton portrays her character with utter excellence. Robert Duvall is as great as he was in the previous movie,the sophisticated lawyer ,caring brother and a good man. John Cazale character is bigger in this one and he is first class in the scene where he yells his heart out and in the whole movie. Michael Vincente Gazzo's performance is most realistic. The screenplay,style and violence is top notch. Again.Coppola's direction is mesmerizing. Overall,this is one of the best movie and not to be missed.",

Coppola insists on giving us literally every element from book to film - boring, irrelevant bits as well. And yet those very same \"boring bits\" work so well in the hands of the Master that it gives the movie (any of his movies in fact) a more intelligent & rounded gloss.I must admit to preferring G2 to the original because it offered so much richness & character-defining elements than the first. Although Brando was very good & suitably threatening in the first, he would also bring the pace of the film down to a stroll bringing the other characters down with him.However, with the \"unknown\" De Niro playing the young Vito in G2 we get to see a revolution in his character development, in fact all the main characters including Pacino's, Keaton's & Duvell's are given greater scope to expand on their originals.Special mention must go to Robert Duvell, probably one of the most outrageously under-rated stars of our time, who possesses more talent in one those \"Mona Lisa\" like smirks than a lot of so-called big A1 stars of today!I truly loved G2, more so in the cinema than on video because an epic \"Italian opera\" such as this deserves room to breath and a 29\" TV screen just doesn't cut it.G2 is better than the first, although it is just as dependent on it in order to build on the original's foundation. G2 is more intelligent to look at, the script sparkles, the violence is choreographed & not overdone; the acting is memorable and Coppola' talented hand at the tiller is there for all to see & aspire too.*****/*****",

First of Michael is trying to get a gaming license and the senator of Nevada doesn't allow it. Michael uses his muscle to get what he wants and the senator gives in. Now Fredo, Michael's brother has a relationship with Johnny Ola and Hyman Roth who want to conspire to kill Michael. Michael finds out that there was an attempt on his life and he finds out Fredo was involved. If you are a fan of this film you know what happens. Along the way we get an amazing supporting performance from Robert DeNiro as a young Vito Corleone told in reflection as he built his empire in New York and Sicily.

            "review_title": "The greatest sequel ever? Absolutely",
            "content": "The Godfather: Part II came out in 1974 with incredible hype, but when it first was released it was labeled a disappointment. Only a few months later, however, it could be heard among many a debate that this movie was superior to the original. The plot is arguably even more intense and chilling and, unlike its predecessor, it tells two tales: one of how Michael Corleone tightens his grip on the criminal underworld in the late 1950s and another of the beginnings of his father, Vito, this time played by Robert De Niro to outstanding effect, and his business empire. It is this near-seamless change that propels The Godfather: Part II into the discussion of the greatest movies ever, where it belongs right there with the first. Al Pacino returns as Michael Corleone and this time plays him even better. On top of that, De Niro, in the role that made him famous, is sublime as Vito. While De Niro's performance is not as memorable as Marlon Brando's and his character not quite as endearing, it is still one of the highlights in the history of acting in the cinema. It's sad that when most people today think of De Niro it is for his performances in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, or, God forbid, 21st century comedies like Showtime or Analyze This. It's simply amazing that the Holy Trinity of modern American actors- Brando, Pacino, and De Niro, in that order- all were stars in the first two Godfather pictures, and the first two's careers are still highlighted by it.However, I do not find this film to be on the exact same level as the original for a variety of reasons. Make no mistake, this is an outstanding film in its own right, the best sequel ever, and the praise I could give it is very similar to the praise I give The Godfather for it's consistent brilliance and masterful direction. Never before have I seen a pair of films that are so beautifully orchestrated. But unlike its predecessor this movie has a couple flaws.The biggest one is with the Vito Corleone section. In the book, this part is detailed from Vito's birth right up to the events in the Godfather. However, here it only goes to about a Roosevelt administration away from the start of the events detailed in The Godfather. For someone who has only watched the movies this is a huge chunk of backstory that is missing. While Coppola chose to focus on the Don Fanucci part of Vito's epic tale, there is so much more of this brilliant story that is left untold. If an entire movie was centered around this, then the pace this story takes would be perfect. But this is but a part of The Godfather: Part II. You cannot tell two epics in one movie, and there is simply not enough time at this pace to cap off the story satisfyingly. The current model speaks nothing of the war that brought Don Corleone to power. Not only that, but literally EVERY SINGLE PERSON in this tale is Italian and speaks Italian. I understand how large Little Italy was at this time but are you telling me that Vito in his time does not meet one pure American? Is his life that secluded? Once again, I understand the message that Coppola is getting across just fine, the sense of unity and family the Italians have, much like the first one, but it's done less believably here. It's also a bit harder to relate to Italian dialect.The majority of my complaints lie on the Vito tale. The tale involving Michael Corleone is absolutely compelling. Emphasize that as much as possible. It's arguably more thought-provoking than its predecessor, and I would say it is more chilling, with a few parts that will absolutely make your jaw drop. That's one thing about the original, it did not have too many of those moments, but this movie has them in abundance. And not to mention Al Pacino makes these scenes come alive, he is just so fearsome and intimidating when provoked. However, surprisingly, many important plot mechanics of this movie are things you might not pick up your first time through. The major plot dynamic of the original was the transition between Vito Corleone as the Don of the Corleone family to Michael Corleone. In this movie the major mechanic is Michael's relationship with Fredo. It is this that represents the film's greatest intellectual stimulation and chill. Especially the ending, which is among the most haunting and memorable scenes you shall ever see, up there with the original's baptism. It has a bit more closure than that of its predecessor. Still, when I think of The Godfather, I think of Marlon Brando rasping out memorable lines, of Don Barzini falling down the steps, of Michael Corleone shooting Virgil Solozzo in a restaurant. It is only after this that I remember the famous aspects of The Godfather: Part II. The most likely reason for this is that it is a sequel, and we always remember what we saw first. Still, something about this movie is not quite as memorable. It lacks that extra something that made The Godfather so unique. Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. It certainly has better cinematography than the original, some of the best I've seen. But it is less than it's original: just barely, but still less. Somehow the plot is just not as large or alive, the scenes not as enjoyable. Don't take this out of context: this movie still has the magic. It has moral considerations and character depth just like the original, this time mostly about the damnation of Michael. Do not let comparisons distract you from the spectacle. 9.4.\"If one thing in life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anybody.\"",

            "content": "Credited as the greatest film ever made, The Godfather: Part II touches on the key themes of family, power and control. 1974's release proved an instant success, with memorable scenes, unforgettable lines and simply sublime acting performances.Michael, Vito Corleone's son, attempts to expand his family's criminal empire. While he strikes a business deal with gangster Hyman Roth, he remains unaware of the lurking danger.Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, John Cazale and James Caan make up the cast who portray the gritty, slow-paced unfolding of events across the course of the 200 minute watch. The romantic and poetic tone to the film is the foundation to which Francis Ford Coppola builds from. Setting is a key factor which encompasses the tale of Mario Puzo's novel, the confined, bustling streets of New York City contrasts greatly to the sparse, desolate location of Sicily which's warmth provides an unnerving feel to the already tense watch which allows varying demographics to be depicted on screen. Coppola manipulates his screenplay to build anticipation towards a climax while also ensuring the timing is well-measured and appropriate, this is done so by smooth exchanges between characters and sharp moments of spontaneity.Few sequels/prequels raise to the expectations that stem from its original, though, the second instalment exceeded the praise of the first. 6 Academy Award wins in the fields most notably of Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay as well as one for Robert De Niro's scintillating performance in a Supporting Actor role - De Niro was so dedicated to his role that he lived in Sicily for three months and spent time learning to speak Sicilian dialect. The meticulous nature and care put into every detail in the production makes it more than just a movie, it's an experience.",

Therefore, it is just a continuation of the story. Pt.2 also used the same exact sets that they used in the original film, (some of the ones used in the streets of sicily) it might of been shot on location, I think they were sets. So as far as the \"second half\" of this film goes, I just can't find a film out there that I saw over 20 times, that still gives me goose bumps whenever I watch it over and over. The Godfather flicks still do that. The acting is uncomparable to anything, and Al Pacino and Robert Deniero are just phenomenal in this film. Pacino is just so cold hearted and emotionless in this movie that it boggles me. It is a movie that still puts me on the edge of my seat even though I know Fredo will never see the morning sun after that forgiving hug. **** 4stars out of 4Classic!",

Especially after having written my first review such a long time ago, however I have to say that I'm not that much into writing reviews hence the reason I've only written one. But I've decided I will give it a fair shot although I'm wondering how many people will even read it.It should of course go without saying that this isn't as much of a sequel as it is a continuation of the first film, calling it a sequel is to underestimate the importance of this film. As masterfully done as the first one it's for me extremely difficult to actually pick one over the other, the only reason I have The Godfather higher than Part II is not because it's better but because of it being the beginning of the journey, the very introduction to this world, if you'll call it that. (Brando's magnificent performance may also have something to do with this) In The Godfather Part 2 Michael Corleone has, as we all know, become the new Don and the film which takes place in the 50's sees Michael becoming corrupt with greed and power. He pretty much becomes just like his father, it's a transformation so interestingly compelling and grandeur that one can't stop but feel sorry for him in some ways. Meanwhile the story of Vito Corleone from childhood to adulthood is chronicled through the use of flashbacks. We see him arrive to America from Sicily, only a child, and how he creates his Mafia empire. The actor portraying him is of course Robert De Niro whose performance is electrifying. These flashbacks are spoken in Italian which I found to be interesting. But while De Niro captures the mannerisms of Don Vito Corleone it's Al Pacino who gives the best performance as Michael Corleone. He's even better here than in the first film, of course this time Marlon Brando wasn't around who could overshadow everyone, and it's only because of his fantastic performance that you're able to feel sorry for him.Al Pacino was very good in the first film but here he's even greater. The supporting cast is great too; the ever wonderful Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and of course the late John Cazale. The acting is just as great as in the first film. Francis Ford Coppolas directing is amazing as is the cinematography. There is really nothing more to be said about this masterpiece. I know I'm late with this review, but being someone who never really wrote reviews this is my second but not last one.And fitting that it should be about my second favorite film and the second greatest in Cinema...",

This is the most self-contained in theme and form, tracking the origins of the Corleone dynasty and the rise to crime of Michael Corleone. It is the ultimate portrayal of a man allowing himself to fall to the corruptions of power , and lose his morality to murderous evil. He is both victim of fate, of forces which seemed to compel him into this monstrous world, and a willful sinner.The final scene, as he sits alone in his spacious grounds reflecting on his life, encapsulates the true theme of this tale: not 'the mafia', not 'murder', not 'American-Italian culture', but that of a human being losing his soul.",

With its ultra violent execution scenes and well deserved credited acting marks the second film in the ultimate gangster franchise.

Truly though, the first two were the best, i think there was no apparent reason for making the third one, which is supposed to be the worst/not as good one, compared to the first two classics. Number two follows Michael Corleones early life. It flash backs every now and then to his father Don Corleone played by Robert De Niro who does some dirty deals and some killings. So there are two parts to the story, these are: Michael, in present form and Don Corleone, so you can see what Don Corleone did to become Don.The acting is top quality, most probably one of Al Pacinos greatest moments to shine and Robert De Niro, who also ma not be leading actor but still acts like he is. Diana Keaton, who plays Michael wife also demonstrates that she can bring to life the suffering and shocking conclusion of Michael and her splitting up, as you will see in the third one.This film including the acting and direction all made this film worth wild, because of the extreme enthusiasm and dedication from both the cast and film crew.",

That isn't to say that The Godfather Part II skimps on entertaining and rememberable scenes; in fact, the movie's best moments may even be more rememberable than The Godfather's. However, a lot of the scenes in between are just too long and not really necessary \u2013 what would have been needed a lot more were additional explanation scenes as the panoply of characters grows even bigger through the story being set in two different times and the dialogues give more focus to being pointed and quotable instead of making what happens fully clear. This is indubitably important, don't let me be misunderstood, but the huge plot that Mario Puzo has devised for The Godfather is simply too complex and convoluted to be easily grasped without having read the source material. Nevertheless, The Godfather Part II is a cinematic masterpiece that is sovereign and seminal on so many different layers, such as the beautifully picturesque cinematography, the smooth editing, the meticulously conceived set design, the innovative and unforgettable score by Nino Rota, and the tremendous acting cast that is reflected in the five Oscar nominations for acting (a tied record). Thus, The Godfather Part II is an undeniably excellent motion picture that merely suffers from the director's attempt to put too much in just one movie.",

In fact, it pays well for those who are very smart, very cunning, very rich, and very powerful -- otherwise you die. The music is similar to that of the Godfather. Where Marlon Brando was more of a loving man, Al Capone's godfather portrayal is one of of rigid ruthlessness. However, the ruthlessness is necessary for survival of the family's power.",

            "content": "Michael Corleone: \"There are many things my father taught me here in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\"Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The Godfather, parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.Review Although not as good as the first Godfather but a masterpiece nonetheless. The second chapter of the Corleone crime family is part prequel and part sequel as it chronicles the rise of a young Vito Corleone, played by a very young Robert De Niro, to Godfather status. The sequel part on the other hand tells of Michael's growing power over the Corleone crime organisation as he expands his grip from Nevada to 1950's Cuba.A lot of people claims that this film is superior to the first Godfather but I beg to differ. I still find Godfather the best ever and this one coming in at a close second. With the absence of the movie magic that is Marlon Brando as the titular gangster, the backbone and spirit of Part II is just lost but at the least a very young and then unknown Robert De Niro gave justice to the Vito Corleone character and quite possibly one of his greatest performances of all time. What tops this cinematic milestone is Al Pacino as he leads a power house cast to greatness. From Robert Duvall to Diane Keaton and a terrific John Cazale, the powerhouse acting is one of the finest I've seen. The plot is more complex and involving the second time around as it delves deeper into the Corleone's family origins and it never gets boring and overly long as some people have suggested.The Godfather II is a cinematic milestone. Highly recommended.",

Part II is the Best Sequel Ever Made, no doubt about that. Fantastic directing, Acting, Script, and just about everything. The Acting of course is top notch. Al Pacino is brilliant, and in my opinion even better as Don Michael Corleone. He can yell without overacting, every scene he yells at Kay, he makes me scared. The look on his face when Kay tells him she had an abortion is so memorable. Diane Keaton isn't bad as Kay but she is easily the weakest of everybody but she doesnt degrade the movie in anyway. John Cazale is good as Fredo (that never changes). Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strasberg were nominated for their roles and they were great.\nThe thing that makes Godfather II different from any other sequel is the fact that its a half sequel half prequel. Its what I admire most about Godfather II. And what makes it the best is that we get the standout supporting performance from none other than my favorite actor Robert De Niro. He is excellent as the young Vito Corleone. Though Brando is better as Vito you have to remember that this was one of De Niro's first acting roles.\n10 out of 10. #2 on my top list.",

            "content": "Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by \"The Godfather, Part II\" in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters...",

The bad guy of the film - Italian actor Gastone Moschin essentially replaces the original bad guy Al Lettieri (who famously dies in the original) in a piece of good acting.Hyman Roth, a Jewish mobster partly based around the story of Meyer Lansky (like most of the subjects in these movies these men are loose composites drawing from different characters). Roth is played by Lee Strasberg - a great acting teacher who developed the method style of acting deployed by Brando, Pacino and De Niro - but not the greatest actor.Roth has some memorable lines and it is a good performance by Strasberg but the character is really nothing like Lansky's actual character and the film takes a lot of liberties with this storyline which is far from the truth and ends up really muddying the script in some nutty premise which is not believable. I won't give anything away, but Lansky never did half of the things that are suggested here. But his greatest line is about Moe Greene (loosely based as a composite of Bugsy Siegel).Apparently, director Francis Ford Coppola wanted James Cagney to play Roth's part but perhaps Cagney didn't like what Coppola did with the character.Fans of the show Sopranos may be interested to know that Roth's lieutenant Johnny Ola is played by Dominic Chianese who played Tony's uncle Junior.The dialogue is not up to par with the first. Some of the scenes are more for show and effect and impression than substance.There are a number of holes in the storyline which are not properly resolved.There is a quick appearance by the late Danny Aiello.Bruno Kirby makes a good impression in one of his earliest roles.Michael Gazzo does an adequate job as essentially Clemenza/Richard Castellano's replacement but it always feels like he is a replacement player.Pacino's new (and old) bodyguard seems completely out of place the entire time.Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are good in returning roles. Keaton has a memorable showdown with Pacino.All in all this is a great movie, and it is darker than the first - in some ways much darker. Most of its greatness lies in the back story that is told in the flashback scenes.",

It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made.

Furthermore Michael's descend into madness, even going as far as getting Fredo killed in the end is a tad bit extreme but I'll give the movie the benefit of the doubt because everything else is just impeccable.

There is not even any thematic progression - it ends on the exact same note as the original - that this is a bad life to live.The film attempts to make up for these shortcomings by increasing scope, and we travel all across the us, to Sicily and Cuba, looking for other crooked rich guys to murder - I mean - do business with. With flashbacks to the younger years of Vito Corleone, this film is really two films in one. The flashbacks do nothing to aid the modern story, nor seem very believable, but in location and character are far more interesting, and had the filmmakers focused their sole attention there, might have made a very good prequel.

            "content": "IMDb Top 250: 3 The Godfather Part II has a great distinction: it is the sequel to the greatest film ever. It has a lot to live up to. While the Godfather impresses you before it even starts, with Marlon Brando's iconic face on the poster, Part II has to earn your respect. To most, it equals- and to a few, it betters- the Godfather. But to me, it doesn't. Part II is an exceptional film that outclasses many films, but its predecessor is not one of them.The Godfather showed the rise- or fall, however you look at it- of Michael Corleone, and Part II shows him at the height of his power, and his descent. The story is sprawling, like it should be. Betrayal, family, and oranges, Godfather staples, are seen throughout. But Part II doesn't have the charisma of Part I. Without Vito and Sonny, much of the famous Italian factor is lost. Like Michael, the story is more heartless than before.Also in Part II is the origin of Vito Corleone, starring the then small-time Robert de Niro, in one of his best performances. These scenes are so awesome, they steal the show. When we learn about Vito, we don't want it to end, and when we watch Michael, we wish he was Vito instead. There's so much plot in this film, it could've been cut into 2 films, one a continuation and one an origin story, a la the Metal Gear Solid quadrilogy. Who knows the impact that could've had on the quality of Part III.While the film lacks Sonny or Vito, the characters present are very well played. These actors could be these characters in real life. And when Oscar season came, it showed: 5 nominations. Pacino is at his conflicted peak, shown no better than his confrontation with Kay. He is the tent pole: all the other characters aren't on his level, another factor that makes me like Part I more. Others got the spotlight. But as I mentioned before, De Niro is the best part of this film. He sounds like the Don, looks, and charms the the Don. The sets of the 20's scenes are breathtaking. It's a pity there isn't a whole film about him.Together, Godfathers I and II are the best films ever made. But separate, I believe the first part stands alone at the top. Mixing the 20's and late 50's, Part II has much to unravel, and in 3 hours and 20 minutes much is revealed. It's a great film, and one of the best sequels ever made. 9.2/10",

            "content": "\"Sequels are never as good as the original\" is something that can be thrown out the window here.The fire that Puzo and Coppola started for The Godfather (1972) did not burn out, and only got stronger. Both writer and director were on form for these years.Once again we are presented with an impeccably well crafted story, sophisticated and well developed characters, and a multifaceted romance of betrayal, violence , revenge and honour.Michael (Al Pacino), now established as the head of the Corleone Family, struggles with mounting pressures of betrayal from those closest to him, of conflicts from his old territories in New York, and of unsteady new deals in new territories. We see Michael growing into the very man his father never wanted him to be - a ruthless, cold hearted overlord, who holds revenge as the most important part of his position. In The Godfather (1972) Al Pacino played a subtle, quiet and observant Michael Corleone - here we see this clean and sophisticated facade fade and break under the growing pressures and in his inability to control everything.All of this is interwoven with flashbacks to how his father Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) came into power and set the foundation for Michael and his family. Vito, a man who used murder as a means to an end - always siding with and fighting for the small guy - grows ever more respected because of his acts of kindness and helping free people from the clutches of parasites and the corrupt. Michael on the other hand has grown into justifying his brutal actions with weak end goals, and delusions of controlling everyone with fear.A few reasons I would class this as the better of the two films is because here we get more glimpses into the lives of other people - some of the locals in the 1910s and 1920s in the flashbacks, and of Hyman Roth and associates in Miami.The score is once again beautifully romantic and seductive. And the locations and sets are almost flawless.The film is replete with iconic and sophisticated scenes - the empty chair at the beginning behind Michael, implying \"can he fill the chair his father made?\"; Johnny Ola garrotting scene; the kiss of death between Michael and Fredo (John Cazale); Vito shooting Don Fanucci and gutting Don Ciccio; Michael striking Kay when she tells him of the abortion; Fredos death - outstanding and dramatic scenes.The Godfather Part 2 won 6 Oscars - best picture; best supporting actor, Robert DeNiro; best director; best writing (adaptation); best art direction-set design; and best music. All thoroughly deserved. At the time it was the only character played by two separate actors to win Oscars (Marlon Brando and Robert DeNiro playing Vito Corleone). This is possibly Robert DeNiros finest performance sandwiched between two other performances that made his career (Mean Streets and Taxi Driver).Arguably one of the best sequels to ever be made, and arguably one of the best films ever to be made.",

Let's try this one....The night before they strap me into the electric chair, I'm demanding TWO things...a big plate of cheesy homemade lasagna and one more screening of \"G2\" (which should bring my cumulative total up to about 53).This is it. The filmmaker's bible. The ne plus ultra of American cinema. \"TEN\" ain't a high enough number for a vote on this one. This is in a category by itself and should be viewed as a one-piece unit with \"G1\" as THE reason that they invented film in the first place.Not a word out of place. Not a shot that isn't perfection. Indelible. Wanna impress other life forms in the galaxy? Put \"G2\"and \"G1\" in the capsule and send it up. And besides, I understand they need a good recipe for meat sauce on Alpha Centauri.When they look back at our civilization a thousand years from now...they'll recognize this film as our generation's contribution to the development of the culture of all mankind.

LOLIt's could be because the version i watched had no sub-tittle.With all the Italian conversation in this movie(which is around 30% of the movie) i could barely not fall asleep being i don't understand Italian and i had no sub-tittle.It's sure does not help.The acting is superb .But the role don't seem to be much complicated to play.Everyone keep telling me that this movie is the best.But what make a movie the best?The acting?The story?The Action?I'm quite happy godfather 2 for me was boring.I'm an intelligent person that most of the time enjoy great story.But this movie just seem to give retard a reason that they are indeed intelligent and love great movie.I LOVE THE GODFATHER SO I LOVE GOOD MOVIE WOWOWO.When i watch a movie.I want to have some show and not some chatting during 2 hours and pretend that i love this kind of movie because the *acting is superb*.Give me a freaking break.Ace Venture it's a stupid movie.But at least it's entertainingThe music is also over-used.I was quite tired to hear the same background music each frigging time just because they want to enhance the *emotion*.",

            "content": "Why Francis Ford Coppolla received such accolade for this film is beyond me. I suppose he must've hired everyone in Hollywood to do this picture. Do you think everyone had a piece? Piece of what you may ask. A piece of a failure of monumental proportions. This movie reminded me of the Titanic - the boat, not the movie.Why is this movie a failure? This film suffers from terrible dramatic fundamentals. It is a classic example of the movie drives the plot which is not the way it works. Rather, good drama has as its one trademark, the plot drives the movie. Any first year director in any dramatic medium should know this. You do the scenes so that the plot is revealed, not rewritten. The reader is kept on edge, waiting to see what happens next.And that is the key. The following notes on the characters are inconsequential. This movie suffers most from appalling writing that undermines everything. Nice dialogue does nothing if the storyline makes no sense. Who cares? In this film, the reader is constantly wondering, 'what just happened there.' Did I miss something? What are they talking about? Do I need to remember all these characters? No, you don't, Francis just wanted to get his cousin in the picture, so he's wasting your time to do it.That is why the first film, despite its relatively meager budget was a success. Coppola was forced to quell his massive ego and improvise to make it work. He was sloppy and sometimes almost juvenile, but it didn't matter. The plot was so good, all he really had to do is show up. And he almost blew that. Here you see the true Coppola at his ultimate worse. Now you know why the producers of the first film were so worried.All I could think about during the entire film was, 'Where is Brando?'Bobby Deniro and the Italian language were annoying. Deniro was annoying, in general. All I could think about was, \"okay, so deniro wants to join the gang...of misfits.\" Pacino was lost. I started muting his outbursts because they were so predictable. The key to a good outburst is it has to be explosive meaning unpredictable. In Al's case it was just load and annoying. I yawned. The rest of the film focused on Pacino's facial movements from the restaurant scene in the first film. It was like \"Okay Al, remember that restaurant scene? Let's have you do those facial expressions again, for three whole hours. Do you think we'll get tired of it?\" Diane Keaton shouldn't have even been there. The stupid and pitiful moral struggles of family life made me wonder if Coppolla didn't spend his entire childhood watching the Brady bunch. What a load!!!!!! I can't believe he even attempted to address such things. Does he think I'm some kind of idiot? Obviously. \"But Daddy doesn't spend enough time with me.\" \"Don't worry boy, he's in Cuba. I'll buy you a red toy car. let's go fishing.\" I vomit.The first half introduced so many utterly inconsequential characters, I couldn't help but wonder if they were all Coppolla's cousins. I've never seen so many gala affairs and parties in one film. I thought I was reading a travel brochure. Coppolla had so overextended himself that at some point he was probably no longer even part of the film. I don't care how many hours he worked. All he did was serve the interests of his own ego. The artist was left helpless in a pile of rubble. It was a managerial catastrophe.This movie was nothing more than a hackneyed soap opera overblown on a proportion that boggles the mind. Great sets, great music, great cameras, do nothing whatsoever if there is no storyline and the characters are uninteresting. ugh. I couldn't help but think that anyone who actually was a mobster would look at this and say, 'what a load of crap.'Fortunately, you don't have to be a mobster to understand that you are being sold a bill of goods. All you have to do is read this. Oh, and for those who actually liked this film...I'll bet you liked Rocky II.Don't waste your time.",

A mild and indifferent extreme difference also makes their lives completely different, and this difference is also reflected in their different worldviews. If you have more career, you will have less family. It is still the same formula, but it makes people feel the delicate emotions and the difficult growth of a man.

            "review_title": "The Godfather II, the Don of Drama",
            "content": "Exhilarating, intense, passionate. These are words often used to describe Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film, \"The Godfather II\". The film certainly delivers on all of those descriptions, and then some. It maintains the same themes of family, betrayal, and revenge as its preceding film, The Godfather, while still keeping the experience fresh and invigorating to experience.The story is a continuation of The Godfather, following Michael Corleone played brilliantly by Al Pacino. After his father's death he becomes the new Don of the Corleone family. Due to the events that occurred in the previous installment, Michael has pulled out of New York to consolidate his operation in Nevada. While in his home, Michael is the victim of an assasination attempt. He suspects betrayal within his own family, and leads his own investigation into the matter. Meanwhile Michael has ambitions to expand business into Florida and Cuba with his father's old business partner Hyman Roth (played by Lee Strasberg). Throughout the movie it transitions using a flashback to Michael's father, Vito Corleone played by Robert De Nero. It takes us through his life growing up in Sicily, Italy, and eventually immigrating to New York. We see how Vito grew the Corleone name into a respected and powerful symbol, and building his business from the ground up.Coppola displays his creative skill in screenwriting by telling two compelling narratives in the same film. The way he uses lighting to change the mood and tone of the setting adds depth to each scene. It creates an eerie and intense feeling at just the right moments, striking emotion into the scenes. The only problem I found with the writing was if you don't have any historical context, you will find yourself somewhat confused about what is happening. Though the use of history in the story is done perfectly, and adds another creative layer to the Cuba arc of the story. If you aren't paying attention or miss details because of the laid back and casual way lines are delivered at some key moments, then the following scene might fly over your head. My first viewing of the film I found myself asking myself \"Why are they doing that?\", or \"Why did that happen?\". Despite this, the story is still told in a mature and creative way that held my attention throughout the entire three and a half hour run time. All major themes found in the previous film family, betrayal, and revenge are built upon in this one. Each theme plays an important role in each of the decisions that are made. Coppola mixes themes that are like oil and water to make a shocking and compelling narrative. All themes in the film are ones that the majority of people watching can relate to, which allows the viewer to connect better with the characters and what they're feeling. The acting in the film mustn't go overlooked either. Al Pacino delivers his most notable performance in this film. I was able to feel the anger and passion through the screen during a major twist while he was arguing with his wife about their unborn child. All of the context built throughout the film and knowing how important family is for Michael, tears at the viewer which wouldn't be possible without Al Pacino's incredible performance. Robert De Nero and Robert Duvall each play their roles very notably, they where each casted perfectly and couldn't imagine any other actor playing their roles. There are some moments where the acting could be improved, like how a dead body is clearly breathing if you look close enough which can break the immersion. It's a very insignificant gripe, but worth mentioning. The soundtrack in the film is beautifully produced, and at times Coppola uses music being played in the scene to make the setting feel more natural.The Godfather II is truly a timeless masterpiece of a film. It is the perfect example of a sequel done right, building on the key themes and elements that defined the previous film. The use of history and the blending of themes that on the surface wouldn't mix creates a compelling, exhilarating, and intense story that will hook you deep the entire time. Coppola is definitely a titan in the drama genre, which resulted in one of the most influential films of our time.",

Marlon Brando is unfortunately not appearing in this one (he does not show up even in the brief flashback where James Caan does a cameo), but Robert De Niro takes his place immaculately.

Nevertheless, Part II is probably the least enjoyable to watch, though I would never skip over it.Why exactly is this? The acting is superb; the cinematography is great; thematically, the film furthers and develops all the notes hit in the first. Nevertheless, the story, while \"good\" such as it is, it doesn't quite deliver the gripping goods of the first. The backstory of erstwhile Godfather Vito Corleone and the development of his career was worth telling and artistically interesting to contrast with Michael's own headship of the family. Interspersing the two as the editors did may or may not have been a great choice, as it arguably cuts into the building tension of the younger Don's journey.Still, it's not clear that that journey would, uninterrupted, have made for a gripping drama on par with that of Part I. The first doled out a lot of lavish character development and courtly intrigue with just the right amount of shocking action punctuated in. Whatever the inaccuracies with respect to the real-world mafia, the first certainly captured the dynamic of real-world diplomacy and warfare (whether conventional or criminal) in bouts of rising pressure and preparation sometimes - usually with little of any warning - giving way to open battle. There isn't a ton of action in this one, certainly not on the level of the first.Still, it makes for a good evening. I tend nowadays to be doing chores when I have it on - I've seen it often enough - but it's not unpleasant to watch and as with the first there is always a lot of \"new\" stuff to catch or forgotten stuff to rediscover upon rewatch. These are big, dense films, and should leave the real aficionados satisfies in any event.",

I wouldn't have imagined that this movie would be half as interesting if it wasn't for De Niros character as a part of this movie, it felt like his part was something that had to be explored eventually. The brutal side of Michael was slightly reduced as of the previous movie, his character was more powerful than he were violent. Although, Pachino keeps on this particular continual troubled face until the very end, he brings this deep and heavy feeling to his character which sets the mode for the whole movie, and the look he express to some individuals, just like he already killed them in his mind 3 times already.

In a way this movie is a reference to the American dream of success but in this case it is the success of the gangster. Coppola is so great at making this a simple human drama that we forget that it is a film about a criminal element of our society. Older movies, like those with Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney showed us the gangster as cool but with no family ties. Here we see these immigrant people as family people but with a decidedly twisted morality. That morality is explained early in the Godfather 2 when we learn about Vito's past. The combination of this element with the more recent problems of power tha t Michael Corleone has to deal with make this a great and unusual film.",

There is, however, something that most reviews miss about The Godfather Part II.One hears it called more of a continuation than a sequel, hence the \"Part II\" in the title. But it's something more than that: both the Godfather movies of the '70's are studies in dichotomy. The Godfather, the original film, brilliantly shows the contrast of these warm, loving family men who were simultaneously stone cold killers. Part II goes even further in showing dichotomy, as we watch the rise of Vito Corleone contrasted with the struggles of Michael Corleone to retain power.We see Vito Corleone toy with a landlord to make the man lower the rent for a friend of his wife and allow her to keep her dog, and at roughly the same time we see Tom Hagen offer to keep Senator Geary's fingers clean in the savage and brutal killing of a prostitute the Senator favored. We don't have to be told to realize Vito's family would never have sacrificed an innocent to gain control of a politician. We can see the contrast between a beloved Don and a feared Don.And that's a single example. Watch the movie again and you'll see, from scene to scene during much of it, how contrasts are drawn. This movie is a masterpiece, a work of art. Not quite flawless, but very close. It isn't quite as good as the original, but it kind of improves the original in a way. The acting is stellar.

In some ways, I like Godfather better than Part II, but Robert De Niro's performance makes me rethink that. Al Pacino does great again as Michael and the same with John Cazale's Fredo, and Francis Ford Coppola shows why he is one of the best directors ever. In this second chapter, Michael gains complete control of the family and must find a traitor in their midsts. And we go back to the early 1900's New York and follow a young Vito's childhood and early adulthood. I think this is where the movie really picks up. Vito has always been my favorite (besides Sonny) so it was amazing to see his past. The movie does go on a little long and it slows up once in a while, but that is the only minor flaw.

Its sequel, The Godfather: Part II is a continuation of Michael Corleone's goal to create a powerful and respectable family empire. At the same time, the film gives a history of his father, Vito Corleone (played brilliantly by Robert De Niro), and his rise to power at a young age. Both of these plot lines are excellent parallels, although Michael's is much more depressing because of the internal conflict with his brother, Fredo.The plot is much more widespread this time, but still packs a punch. There are so many classic scenes that you'll be left much influenced far after the film is over. Some of the technical aspects are taken directly from the first film, such as the music score (although it feels even more refined). The acting is also comparable to the first film; although Marlon Brando is lost, Robert De Niro completely makes up for this. The returning characters give performances that are worthy of the first film.It is also longer than the already lengthy first film. All the time is used well, so thats not too big of a problem. The tension and suspense from the first film is lacking, but a new mood of uncertainty is produced. The conflict is based more on the characters than the plot itself.The Godfather: Part II is as good as a sequel can get. Like its predecessor, it is worthy of a place among the all time great films. I would probably give the first one a nod because it was more fresh and original. But if you get yourself situated to watch this film, you cannot go wrong.",

Robert Deniro stole the movie with his performance as the young Vito Corleone. No wonder he won best supporting actor. Diane Keaton's performance is actually better in this movie than the last one.The movie's Directing is actually done better than in Part I. Another brilliant script was in this movie. Has more great lines that many people remember today. The two stories helped this movie I think. Even though the movie was a bit longer than Part I you really dont care when you see how well done the two stories were. I think if there was only one story the movie wouldn't have been as great.

            "content": "Magnificent from beginning to end, The Godfather Part II is a superb film that betters what was already a perfect film to begin with. Much more epic in scope and retaining a lot of symbolism and Shakespeare like tragedy, Coppola and Puzo have created a work of art once again. Flashing forward a couple of years after the end of the first film, we find that Michael has well and truly amassed himself as the head of the family. Struggling to turn the business into a legitimate empire, the film flashbacks to the early days of  his father's building of the family business, in what is the first stroke of genius of this sequel. The flashback sequences make the film a much more epic affair and in doing so we see the differences not only in father and son, which is the main thrust of the story of the second part of this trilogy, but we see how much America has changed and how much the dynasty of the Corleone family has altered from small street business to potential empire. The real joy in the flashbacks here is how different father and son are. Whereas we see the love between them in the first film and how much Vito loved Michael, here we see the vast differences between them. As Michael tries to legitimize the family business, we see how increasingly alien like and withdrawn he becomes from those around him. His wife Kay, his 'brother' Tom, his blood brother Fredo and how it all ends in tragedy and with Michael ordering the death of the brother who betrays him. Coppola successfully integrates the flashbacks of a young Vito into all of this. Enhanced by the wonderful performance of Robert De Niro (very young here), we see how Vito built his own empire and we see how different he was to his own son, how he loved his wife very much, how he treated friends with respect, how he immersed himself into their lives, not only of those of his friends and family, but of the people he tried to help on the streets. It is this comparison that makes The Godfather Part II such a brilliant film.The screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo is a masterclass in the art of storytelling. If Shakespeare were alive today, this is the type of film he would be writing. Betrayal plays a big part of this film, as does tragedy. Both the betrayal and the tragedy fall at the hands of the hapless Fredo, betraying his brother and then dying at the hands of a hit organized by Michael himself. John Cazale is a stand out amongst many in this film and the moment where he prays in the boat just before he is killed is one of the most haunting moments ever put on to film. It is both sad in many ways. It reinforces how much Fredo had destroyed the relationship with a brother that he loved and further isolates Michael into his shell, prompting a flashback to happier times and a piece of news that only Fredo reacted warmly to. All of this makes up for a fantastic film. It is truly the greatest sequel ever made. The story is well told, the acting is pure class and the flashback structure is done very well.This is as perfect as perfection will come.",

After seeing it I understand why it was not in rotation, because this is not a rewatch all the time type of films. That doesn't mean that it is a bad film at all. It's just a long and well thought out film. Just like it's predecessor, the casting is perfect and the Italian everyday lifestyle representation is amazing.

Since that time, other movies did come out on the same subject, and good ones like Untoucheables and the Tarantino stuff, so I have problems explaining why it suddenly got rated so much.It didn't age really especially well neither (while the original is timeless), yet there's no doubts that it is still a good mob movie, if a bit over-rated.

There has been done tremendous job on set designing. Especially on scenes which portray life of Vito Corleone at early 20's in New York. That's a wonderful piece of work. You could have no complaints at all. The screenplay is good. It shows how Vito Corleone started his family business, later called mafia. On the other hand, it follows life of his son Michael who tries to enlarge family business to Las Vegas and Havana.Although there is no original Godfather (Marlon Brando), his son Michael (Al Pacino) shines. That's a statement act which became cornerstone in his career. So cool and fearless, like his father. Al Pacino is a deserved Oscar-winner here. This is the top of the mafia films.

A special mention must go to Robert De Niro for his turn as young Vito speaking all his lines in Sicilian dialogue, you really believe this is Don Vito as a young man in 1917 New York city.The senate hearings on organised crime are brilliantly staged and interesting with Michael's denial on ever running the 'biggest criminal organisation' in the USA. I could go on and on about this amazing film but i will end it on saying that the godfather part II is every bit as majestic and tragically mesmerising as the original.ten out of ten.",

In the beginning his parents & brother are killed by the local Godfather but Vito escapes. He then grows up & eliminates The Black Hand before he then finds the man who killed his family & seeks vengeance on him.The other story in the film continues the story of Vito's son Michael as he tries to expand his family's influence & business but has to deal with an attempt on his life, betrayal, a court case etc.It's a great film with great characters & I highly recommend watching it if you haven't already, it's on for over 3 hours but it's worth it!",

A side story telling the saga of how the Corleone family came to America is told in conjunction with the continuous saga of new Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). This is done with a puppeteer's focused hand (pun intended) by co-writer/director Coppola and the result is amazing. He seems to somehow intertwine the two stories of the old and new Don effortlessly and deliver grand entertainment.\nDeservedly the movie won an Oscar for Best Picture \u0096 and for a sequel that's no small feat. Robert De Niro is exquisite (watch those subtle Brando mannerisms) and under-plays elegantly as the young Vito Corleone, while Robert Duvall is brilliant once more as Tom Hagan \u0096 a voice of reason in a dark and sinister mob world.  By and large Al Pacino's film though. Michael Corleone was a great character and a great role for one of the greatest American actors of the 20th century. The new Don has become spiteful and Pacino's performance is harrowingly intense. His anger and pity comes so naturally; it's simply disturbing. Probably Pacino's finest hour.",

As a movie fan and someone who will never forget the GODFATHERS I advise thee all to get a glimpse of this masterpiece.

The first one is, no doubt, a masterpiece that had literally no flaws, with the exception of being very one, but a lot of older films are like that so might as well get over it. This sequel is a couple of years after the original where young Michael Corleone just took over his late father's crime organization and, while, progressing, is also having some personal problems that interfere with his business. He has nearly been killed by a traitor within his organization, his wife is tired of living this way and ends up wanting a divorce, his sister wants to move back in, he is trying to take over a Las Vegas casino forcefully, etc. While some people might think this is all pointless killings and depressing tragedies, it's really all about Michael and his actions which cause consequences around him. He had originally sworn not to be part of his father's illegal business and he ended up being like his dad anyway. What's also cool about this film is it also explains his late father's background, which is explained through flashbacks. It consists of Vito coming to America, adopting henchmen and stopping another Don from ruining his and his town's life. It's once again full of a full-star cast, excellent cinematography and scenery, courtroom drama, top-notch acting and good writing/directing.",

Of course there also are some new addition to the cast this time, in which the earlier mentioned Robert De Niro and Lee Strasberg impress the most. Both also received an Oscar nomination in the category for best supporting actor, along with Michael V.

And some times he was even better than brando himself.\nMichael Corleone's life story after being the godfather was brilliant written and well played by Al Pacino. A man who tried to protect his family and get in the line of work he despised most and some where he started to enjoy it. This was the fate of Michael in this segment. From being a sad army veteran to a necerary devil but in this movie he was a satan who doesn't want to give up power and would do anything to protect his father's legacy and his crime empire.\nIn this movie you would also like the match cut between Vito's timeline and Michael's timeline.\nA Cameo from James caan as Sonny in the end of movie was very soothing and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen was brilliant again.\nFrancis Ford Coppola should be given all kind of accolades for making The godfather part one and two",

Yes it may have been a lazy Sunday for me to watch all 375 minutes but it got me thinking about when these films were made. You could describe those minutes as a series of recollections from a sharp elderly person where the memories come out very clearly but not in chronological order. Therefore Part 2 could be a continuation of the original. That isn't taking anything away from either film but because they were made roughly two years apart its one way of looking at it. I think it is unlikely that these films could be made now because of all sorts of 'improvements' in technique due to technological advances. These two films were produced at the time that they should have been made.

Absolutely. The BATMAN series is one of many such examples. But is THE GODFATHER: PART II an exception? Yes and no.

Much less violent than its predecessor, Part II focuses on Michael's abandonment by family, friends and eventual retreat into himself.Our feature starts in Sicily them moves to New York, focusing on young Vito Corleone and his orphaned youth. He's said to be \"dumb\" because he never expresses himself, but you can see his furtive eyes observing everything and his open ears listening to every detail. Vito leaves Sicily orphaned and bereft of siblings, all of them dead at the hands of the local mob boss. He makes a new life for himself in New York, raising a family and overtaking a mob lord with quick wit and a quicker trigger finger. These scenes in 1910ish New York are superb, from the theatre to the grandiosity of the mob to the rigours of health in that area (Fredo is born with Pneumonia, for example) but our future Godfather survives it all, to his credit.In present day Michael tries to solidify his empire through backroom deals, treachery and the disintegration of his family unit and friends. With Hyman Roth (a Florida mobster), he makes inroads into fertile Cuba but he and his family almost perish in a hit at his own home. Everyone turns on Michael, from a jealous Fredo (older brother given no responsibility) to an estranged Kay (who aborts his second son as she doesn't want to contribute to the mob nightmare any longer) to his mob associates. The only one who comes close to \"redeeming\" himself is Frank Pentangeli , the key witness for a Senate Investigating Committee into the Corleone's business who recants on the stand when a long-lost brother appears at the tribunal.In the end, Michael is alone with his son Anthony while Kay and their daughter is gone, Fredo dead, the mob dispersed and the Corleone clan expanding from Vegas to Cuba to Tahoe to who knows where...this chapter is excellent, even surpassing the original in some spots in character development and analysis. Recommend highly, but see The Godfather first.",

We have the story of the Corleone crime family operations in Nevada. Then we have the early life of Vito Corleone told in flashbacks. Robert DeNiro plays young Vito without a flaw!There are problems for Michael. To begin with, he learns that his brother Freddo may have betrayed the family to Hymann Roth(Lee Strasberg)who has political connections in Washington which prompts a Congressioal investigation of Michael. This leads to more violence of course.While this is going on, we see young Vito taking revenge on the man who killed his mom & Dad. There is also increased difficulty between Michael and Kay(Diane Keaton). They end up separating.This is the best of the trilogy IMHO. Crime is an ugly business-this trilogy demonstrates that!",

Now here comes a problem that turns into a major compliment!Many viewers (like myself) are spoiled with the recent broadcasts of the 'Godfather Saga' (originally shown in 1977) on various cable channels that incorporates about 54 minutes of deleted footage and places the 'Godfather 1 & 2 story in chronological order. As excellent as PART II is, I'd prefer an uncensored version of the saga. The reason: there many more scenes lifted from the book and the characters are further explored. The irony of the rise and fall of the Corleone Family would still have an impact after 7 hrs 15 min's. Long...but very rewarding.Still PART II gets a 10! But now it feels 'edited'.",

Now there are the few that actually ARE as good as the original. The Godfather Part II is one of those movies. In fact, I'm still having trouble deciding whether I liked Part I or II better. They were both very well done.First, there's Al Pacino. That guy knows how to act, there's no question about that. He played the part very well. In the first movie, he was the innocent guy who wanted nothing to do with his family. In this movie, I almost hated him.Then there were the flashback sequences. Those were great. Those flashbacks played with my mind. I completely despised one of the characters from the flashback, but when they killed him, I felt sympathy for the poor guy. In fact, this movie does that in several scenes.The story of this movie is only matched by that of the original. There's not much backing up I can do here. The stories are obviously similar, so if you liked one, you'll like the other.This movie is without a doubt the greatest sequel of all time. It lives up to its predecessor, which is one of the greatest movies of the industry. If you have not seen this yet, I make you another offer you can't refuse: go see it.",

The towering figure of Hyman Roth, a man as if goaded to stick around for kids pining for spiritual security, succeeds in driving home the abiding message inherent in all revolutions, communist or otherwise, that as far as money is concerned, you were, are, and shall always be on your own: if you make it, you'll have to find a family to keep it; if you don't, that's because you have a family to keep it; and if you still have to keep it for want of either, you as a Capitalist will have to beckon Communism because whenever Olive Oil is suggestive of labour lost, Peanut Oil is simultaneously suggestive of Labour wanting to globalise with a call of dibs on either.",

They're both great movies and the Godfather series is the best ever made, including Part III which was nowhere near as good as the others but still enjoyable.\nI prefer II over I. I just think it's more interesting, getting into the darker side of the mob. Al Pacino is outstanding as Michael Corleone. Robert DeNiro plays Vito as a young man in Little Italy. That was part of the book, but not in the first one. I love this movie. It's about as perfect as a movie could be. II together with I & III represent one of the great achievements in movie history.

The stakes and the tension get considerably high because of the plot and the movie overall is well-crafted. The film is undoubtedly far more ambitious and complex compared to the first and it's probably one of the reasons why it's not as great as the first.The first film was easy to follow and it didn't do too much to get you engaged. The second film kind of does something different by doing two different stories (Vito/Michael), and yeah I would say most of it was good but it kind of felt a bit convoluted going back and forth between the two.Nevertheless, The Godfather Part 2 is still a really good film but as I said before, it doesn't come as close to what the first film did.",

I could not stop watching this movie the first time, and every time I start to watch part of it, I have to watch it to the very end.The story is both a prequel and a continuation of \"The Godfather.\"  We see a young Vito Corleone's rise to power.  We also see his son Michael's consolidation of that power at the cost of his soul.  Robert DeNiro gives a stellar performance as Vito, and almost entirely in Italian!  His scenes are so rivetting, I really didn't care that I couldn't understand a word.In any other movie, Michael Corleone would be the villian.  As the main character, we don't have the luxury of seeing him as the \"bad-guy who must be stopped.\"  Al Pacino portrays him with a Machivellian brilliance that kept me glued in front of the TV.This film's only flaw is that sometimes you don't want to switch from Vito to Michael because you're so wrapped up in what's going on.

The darker side of the film feels more personal and less like the Sicilian dogma which the first film focuses on. The film splits a fair amount of time between Michael and his father's back-story. Much like the ending of the previous film, Michael allows himself to become a monster. He is a mere shadow of his father, and that is the real message of the film. The actions Michael Corleone take throughout this film would've been dismissed as dishonorable and unnecessary by his father.The cinematography is near perfect.

Needless to say, when I finished watching the movie I was very satisfied with Coppola's work, the fact that Vito Corleone's rise to power is analyzed through flashbacks is simply wonderful, the story moves on two tracks: in one we have the consequences of Vito's death and Michael's rise to power (Al Pacino is simply magnificent), while in the other track through flashbacks we witness Vito Corleone's arrival to power, which in my opinion is the most interesting \"track\" since from the first chapter we didn't have much information on how he got there where he is. I really appreciated this narrative technique because it is handled very well and not randomly with flashbacks thrown in here and there. In short, it may not be as masterful as the first chapter but it's worth watching for an in-depth analysis of some things not too analyzed in the first, still a great movie.

I'd heard the sequel was supposed to be even better, so I sat and watched it for the first time last week (albeit over two nights).My first thoughts were that I didn't think it was good as the first one - perhaps expectations were too high, but the modern day storyline felt a little dull. I didn't have a problem with the split timelines, but it frustratingly left me wanting more of the De Niro character. As many have already noted, maybe it should have been done as an overall prequel - it certainly felt like it could have been a separate film.The first half is certainly more engaging than the second (post the intermission), where the story becomes less engaging. There seemed to be an odd time shift post Michael's return from Cuba - with the story jumping into events that obviously happened offscreen (senate enquiry, Kay's loss of child etc).Saying that - there are some great scenes and wonderful subtle references of things to come, especially in the sections with De Niro. You can see how Vito immediately thinks Fredo is a \"weak\" child in relation to the pneumonia he contracts as an infant and how he favours Michael in his tour of the olive plantation in Sicily. No doubt there are whole theses out there examining the film scene by scene and it's overall relevance.It was still an enjoyable watch, with some great acting, cinematography and music - but story wise I felt it could have been better.",

Although they say that this is the rarest case of a successful sequel - I don't know, I'm not impressed.First, killer timing. There are films when you sit in front of the screen for 3 hours and rejoice: they say, a good movie should be. Lot. Yes, even the first part of \"The Godfather\" take for example. Dynamic, vibrant, intense! \"Not a moment of rest!\" And then ... Demagogy. Boredom. You can sleep half the movie and not miss anything. Weak, overloaded script, poor editing, a lot of superfluous.A whole storyline dedicated to Cuba, in my opinion, does not matter. Fredo's betrayal, I believe, did not need such a detailed portrayal. A couple of fair remarks like \"we pay the soldiers, but we don't pay the rebels\" are also not worth it. The clash with Hyman Roth is still rather behind the scenes, it is not as colorful as, say, the legendary fight with Barzini and Co. The action movie is being replaced by politics, and this obviously affects entertainment. Talk, talk, talk... Longing.",

In my opinion the second chapter of the extraordinary 1930's Mafia saga has better acting than the original \"The Godfather\", but it doesn't have as good as fluency as the original Godfather had. Probably the stand out performance in this movie is Robert DeNiro's breathtaking portrayal as young Vito Corleone (young Marlon Brando) and how he struggled in crime in America. Definetly more violent than the first, but sort of drags for a minute or two. Too bad James Caan isn't in this one, I liked his character! Marlon Brando is not in this one (because he died at the end of the first one). If you look very closely you will see the actor that plays Johnny Ola is none other than Dominic Chianse (the actor who portrays the role as the funny, bitter, and mean moboss Uncle Junior, in the hit television program on HBO \"The Sopranos\").

            "content": "The Godfather Part II is one of the top 5 greatest films ever created winning 26 awards and 16 other nominations. This timeless film is one of the best sequels, which equals, if not, surpasses the original film. Part two continues the story of the mafia family, the Corleone's. Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino has come into his own as the new Godfather with the passing of his father Vito Corleone at the end of part one. Marlon Brando played Vito Corleone, in his older years, portrayed in part one. In this film Robert De Niro plays the younger version, shown through flashbacks, of Vito. The beauty of this film is in the flashbacks. The flashbacks give the audience the full back-story of how young Vito became the Godfather and how the Corleone family became one of the most influential and feared mafia families in America.Unlike, the film Goodfellas, also starring De Niro, a great film in it's own right, this film shows how Michael uses calculated decisions in \"business\" to handle conflict. In Goodfellas the main characters tend to \"fly from the hip\" and the theme is based more on the friendship of the main characters and how corruption tears their friendship apart. Part II of the Godfather's theme is about a young man that never wanted to be apart of the family \"business\" but out of necessity he was thrust into being the Godfather. Michael struggles in this film, because I think he's ultimate goal is to make the family legitimate. The character Michael is very intelligent and sinister; he will do anything to keep his family safe. This makes Michael very relatable to the audience, as most men have that same desire to provide and protect their family. Pacino's portrayal of Michael is nothing less than brilliant. Throughout the film you have flashbacks of young Vito that correspond with the same conflicts facing Michael in current time that provide a highly specialized mood. Coppola's genius becomes apparent, as the audience is privy to this cycle of corruption and danger that this lifestyle brings. What makes this so compelling is how the same conflicts arise, but are handled differently due to the changes in society. The way Coppola cuts the scenes in to the flashbacks are flawless and makes the story flow in a very unique way. The film uses an objective camera placement throughout much of the film. The use of this technique, in my opinion, was used to make the audience feel as if they were watching the plot unfold as a spectator, because the audience isn't a member of the Corleone family. The respect and secrecy of the family business requires Michael to keep things within the family. The scene when Michael tells his older brother Fredo, to never speak outside the family again reinforces this key element to the plot. The cinematographer used an array of angles, but the most significant angles come from the mid-to extreme close-up shots of Michal and Vito. The audience can see and almost feel the emotion in the faces of these two characters. In fact, most of the flashback scenes end and begin with a mid-to extreme close-up of these two characters. Wardrobe and music in this film must be mentioned as well, as both won Oscars in their respective categories. The costume design used in this film was excellent and portrayed a very realistic sense of the time period being told. Each character had a specific wardrobe that fit the year, scene, and the overall plot seamlessly. The music in the film is extraordinary as well, providing chilling and exciting effect in key moments throughout the film. The score of this film rates very high amongst other films. The theme of family, the need to provide and keep them safe, and the desire to elevate your status is relatable to a vast audience; this is why this film is timeless.",

I can't say the same about part three though, but that's a different story. All the engaging elements the first had are here; top notch acting, storytelling, cinematography, direction, music. But character development takes it to the next level. Pacino's eyes and face expressions do all the work, continuing from part one his metamorphosis to a cold-blooded, distrustful, merciless mogul, accepting an inescapable fate he formerly thought he detested. The first part's weak female presence is amended here, as we get to see more of Kay and Connie and their position/feelings in the mafia world. Some scenes are a bit dragged, but never meaningless. Overall, if you watch part one, part two is a necessity, to get the chance to see \"La Famiglia\" in the making and the outstanding development of Michael's psychopathy.",

Even worse, someone tried to kill him. Michael's suspects are Frankie Pantangelli (Michael Gazzo), his caporegime running the New York division of the Corleone's and Jewish mob boss, Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg).While telling the story of Michael's rise as the new Don, The Godfather Part II also tells the story of Michael's father, Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro in his first Academy Award-winning role) when he was younger and rising to power. These scenes show Don Vito as a young boy from Corleone, Sicily, escaping another Sicilian Mafia clan leader, Don Ciccio. In New York, Vito gets involved with crime but never loses his sense of honor, he meets Peter Clamenza (Bruno Kirby), Genco Abbandando (Frank Sivero) and Salvatore Tessio (John Aprea) who all become top members in the crime family that Vito builds. After becoming experienced in the ways of the Cosa Nostra, Vito returns to Sicily for revenge on Don Ciccio.The Godfather Part II is one of the best sequels ever made and also one of the best movies ever made in general.

Using someone else would have been blasphemous, because i heard someone else was going to take the role because of certain arguments in the high ups department. But when the air cleared, it was back in business as usual. Francis ford Coppola has been in my view a very exacting director and screen writer to bring us such wonderful films. Like the godfather series and also apocalypse now which in my view had to be the greatest war film since Ben hur. Coppola hasn't done much lately these days but it would be nice if he could direct another film soon. One that has his time and critical notions to get him some more Oscars. And who ever gave this film a point of one out of ten really does not know how to appreciate great artwork in film that Coppola has given us in these past years.

Back in Pt1. we had Pacino w/Brando or Pacino w/Caan (Caan was too lightweight but at least he was something weight). Here? Nothing. Duvall's character can't play those roles and I don't think would have been the right casting choice if they'd written the character to have nastiness. But the sort of replacement, Strasberg/Roth? No. Not doing it. The De Niro sections are better and De Niro's performance significantly better than Pacino's but he's let down by yet another lightweight supporting cast choice in Kirby. Overall, motivations behind changed attitudes of characters in the film seem even less well supported than they did in Pt1.I also have 2 \"buts\" the same as with (and my review of) Pt1.First, it all feels heavy, flattened, less textured, less alive than any top quality production should. I lay that firmly at the hand of Coppola, a director I find uniformly overrated.Second, I think the material works much better in The Godfather Sage. \"I think\", because that is the way I first watched Pt1 and Pt2 and I thought highly of it at the time. I've seen the theatrical versions now twice since, years apart, first in a cinema, now at home, and neither time thought as highly of each. I wasn't in any hurry to watch either again (this second time) but I hadn't seen the restored version and had access so gave it a go as I never see the Godfather Saga. I also read several reviews which overall tended toward preferring the standalone cinema installments. So gave it a go.Unlike most 7 star or above productions, I can confidently say I won't be watching The Godfather Pt.2 again. It was also insufficient enough for me to choose not to watch Pt.3, which surprised me.",

The flashbacks were a little too prolonged to be \"'flash'-backs\", which meant that I wasn't sure whether Vito or Michael was the main character. Is part II meant to follow or complement part I? I guess both - it's like it tries to be both a sequel and a prequel. Another review put it well when they said that it felt like a whole season of a show crammed into three and a quarter hours (and that one may need to be a scorecard of the characters).Really, I'm being picky, since I expected a flawless film; nevertheless, these things impacted my experience of the movie.

Both were once humble and completly away from the mob and they both were corrupted by power, with all the casualities associated with that.\nIn that regard, I loved the final shot in which we see Michael some years before, declaring that we would make his own destiny away from the family business, because at that point we are so used to see Michael as the \"Godfather\" that we more or less \"forget\" who he once was.The movie is also utterly suspensful, just an exchange of looks can make you at the edge of your seat.Al Pacino's performance was just indescribable and Robert De Niro's slow incorporation of the singular Marlon Brando's voice just astonished me.The moment in which Kay said that it was an abortion and not a miscarriage was probably one of the most painful experiences I ever had while watching a movie.A movie that will certainly stay in your mind forever.",

For a long time, this viewing pattern has occurred, oddly enough, with a few films that are considered among the greatest sequels ever made (\"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\"). I can add a new title to that list: \"The Godfather - Part II\". Yes, I must confess, I STILL have not yet seen the original 1972 crime classic about the beloved mafia family - but I'm sure I'll get around to it someday soon. I've seen PARTS of it here and there, anyway...and this epic, Oscar-winning sequel didn't surprise me in making me think of it as most likely superior to the first one (and certainly FAR superior to the third one in 1990, which I heard was a bit of a clunker, unfortunately).In any case, this is truly one of the finest FILMS, not just sequels, I have ever seen, with a scope and power that very few other pictures can rival, quite frankly. I was blown away by much of the virtuoso performances from most of the actors - of course singling out Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as the most amazing ones, especially De Niro.A masterpiece of storytelling, beautifully directed and told.

The story seems overly complicated at face value, but I found I understood more than I thought I did. And it was great.I thought I'd not enjoy the film a second time round, but no I still loved it.This chapter in the Corleone saga is better than its predecessor and Part III because of so many reasons. Part I I feel was not as interesting, and that Marlon Brando's Vito (many will disagree) was not as intriguing a character as Michael, or even De Niro's Vito. Part III was a decline in the trilogy while still a worthy end (in other words it fell short of Return of the Jedi as 'best final episode of a trilogy'. So much had happened between II and III that wasn't explained in detail and seems that it may have been pivotal - even Robert Duvall's excellent Tom Hagen character was just implied as dead, and no more so. Where's the 'closure' you US folk are on about (no offence)?Anyway I think the three films are all amazing, but II stands proud among them all as the best of the lot, and the best film of all time.",

But such is the genius of Francis Ford Coppolla that it is considered by many as the greatest sequel of all time and many of those same people even consider it to be better than the first.I for one do not agree, at least not about it being better then the original, however I find it difficult to dispute the claim that it's the best sequel of all time. The impossible job of proceeding Marlon Brando as the Godfather fell on the shoulders of Robert De Niro. He later went on to win best supporting actor, proving the impossible to be quite possible for someone of De Niro's talents. Brando and De Niro became the first actors to win Oscars for performances of the same character. De Niro's performance as a young Vito Corleone was the highlight of the sequel and it was genius from Copolla to move the story backwards as a pose to moving in a linear fashion.Another masterstroke from Copolla was the rise of Michael who becomes the Don of the family. We see Michael become a man and bypass all his brothers straight to the top of the family. It's almost a romantic twist in an otherwise pretty gritty and dark story.I would put the first and second Godfather films right up there with the best of all time, perhaps even in first and second place. You simply can't call yourself a film buff and not watch these films. 10/10",

            "review_title": "The best number two.",
            "content": "The Godfather Part II was the film that made sequels respectable \u2013 a true piece of art that remains quite as powerful now as it was when it was made. The reason for this is simple: Coppola is a master storyteller. Too often a sequel is ruined because it seems obsessed with the mantra: \"bigger is better\" \u2013 more action, more explosions, and more special effects. Part II succeeds because it places its focus on its characters and lets the story unravel around them. In some respects however, Part II is a bloated film with many affecting and individual characters spanning two story lines, abundant with plot twists, drama and yes -- plenty of action, all packed into its eye-watering 200 minute runtime. It's a testament to Coppola's ability that he is able to balance all these individual elements and create what is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.Part II follows Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) efforts to strengthen the family business through expanding his gambling ventures into revolutionary Cuba. After an attempt on his life, he must plot and scheme to ensure that those responsible are punished without derailing his business endeavours. Interweaved with this story we see the life of Vito Corleone, (played by Robert DeNiro) from his tragic upbringing in Sicily at the turn of the 20th Century, to his rise to power in New York. Coppola's decision to include both stories is not just a means to test his audience's endurance abilities \u2013 it allows for his viewers to analyse the differences between Michael and Vito - between father and son. Those who have no interest in exercising their critical faculties can simply sit back and enjoy a smartly structured and expertly paced story of ambition and loss in capitalist America.For a movie that places such an emphasis on family; in particular upon the relationship between father and son, we see surprisingly little of Michael together with his children. Vito was an intelligent man who had genuine love for his children, and knew from his miserable upbringing the effect that the Mafioso lifestyle could have for his family. By placing these two stories together we can better understand decisions Don Vito made in Part I in attempting to avoid bloodshed and compare the frenzied decisions made by Michael in Part II. It's questionable what kind of a man Michael would have been if he had genuine loving relationship with his children, or indeed the rest of his family, who leave him, one by one, over the course of this film. Furthermore one might question whether Michael had genuine love for any of these people \u2013 throughout the film there is evidence that he finds value in people and things because they are his brother, his family, his property. Take the scene where Kay confronts Michael about a possible divorce his anger stems from the fact that she is trying to take away his children, who get most of their love and nourishment from their mother and who receive little interest from himself. There's further evidence in his treatment of family consigliere Tom Hagen (a wonderful, understated performance by Duvall) who, not being a blood brother, Michael always seems to give the short stick.Eventually Michael's choices and lifestyle leaves him safe, but alone, as he slowly alienates everybody who cared for him. This loss is reflected in Coppola's haunting final shot, where we see Michael alone, contemplating his actions. Pacino's performance works because he shows us two sides of Michael \u2013 quiet and pensive at one moment, then a raging, scheming monster the next. This is the kind of controlled intensity which a Pacino performance sometimes lacks. Yes, the times where Michael loses his cool are spectacular in their bombast \u2013 particularly when his wife Kay confronts him about his children; but these are not the only images I am confronted with when I think about what makes the performance great. For instance, Michael's simmering unrevealed rage at Senator Geary's attack on him, his family and his people. Michael's quiet disbelief and anger as his brother Fredo unwittingly reveals his treachery. Michael alone at the dinner table as his brothers rush away to greet their father in a flashback. These snapshots of an isolated man can serve to humanize a character, who gives us no real cause for sympathy.Then there's Nino Rota's masterful score, which is of such importance to the film that it is impossible to imagine the two apart. Robert DeNiro's superb Oscar-winning performance \u2013 indeed fantastic performances across the board. Spectacular cinematography of Sicily and New York. I could go on, but there's no need \u2013 everything that could be said about this film has already been said. The joy is in experiencing it for one's self.",

Michael continues to expand the Corleone family business while faced with betrayal, inner-family conflict, and legal trouble.The Godfather II continues the themes portrayed in the first film in the series. Loyalty, devotion to family, and defending the down-trodden remain essential to the story and characters, and as before, these features are displayed against a backdrop of vigilantism. There is a duality with helping those in need and putting your family first, while at the same time, using evil or illegal methods against others. The Godfather II walks the line between these opposing ideals perfectly.Anyone who enjoyed the first film will most likely enjoy the second just as much. It is simply more of a good thing.

And we see this idea, that the family needs to be protected at all cost, taken to its extreme logical conclusion, with Michael killing his own brother.Part II also adds to the stakes of family by having a parallel story of Vito building the family in the last generation.In the end, Michael is able to protect the family, but at the cost of having torn it apart: having killed his own family members and casting his wife out.Part II is a great film that takes the premise to its gut-wrenching extreme but logical conclusion.

If the film doesn't show you how great cinema can get, you must see this film more and more until you see its brilliance.It is also a very classy film that doesn't show itself off but rather pulls the viewer in the film to show how good it can be. And that, my friends, is very rare in film. Most films nowadays like to brag how good they think they are while they are really wastes of time and money; and others, though great films, just like to carry it on how great they are, by giving off hidden boasting in the film. But this film is just a humble masterpiece that doesn't say that it's good or not, but shows you what it's decent at.It shows drama in ways that are very hard to do in other films. Although most of the characters are obviously gangsters, you could feel their pain in hard situations. Like Al Pacinos character struggling to have the family completley legit in one scene with his wife. Other scenes are even more powerful.The acting? Also excellent. Al Pacino is as always great as Michael, Robert Duvall is at his highest mark in his career, and Robert De Niro, though he has limited screen time, is excellent.When I look at other films today, barely any of them can match the sheer drama, the brilliant direction, the impeccable acting, and rare humblity of The Godfather: Part Two.Overall, this is a classic piece of cinema that everyone should see. It's a brave, different, and rare film. Best watched after The Godfather though.10/10",

            "content": "Carrying on from our last review, it is time to review not only another masterpiece under director Francis Ford Coppola\u00b4s belt, but what many people consider to be one of, if not the greatest film sequel of all time, The Godfather Part II. Now, this one is fairly interesting, since it is deemed by many as one of the rare occasions where a sequel is deemed better than the original, and while I can defiently see why, for me anyway, Godfather II isn\u00b4t really much better than Godfather I.This does not mean it\u00b4s bad. Far from. It\u00b4s still a fantastic experience.The main reason why I like it it\u00b4s because of the fact that, unlike most movie sequels, which just continue the story of the first one while expanding its universe and lore, Godfather II is both a sequel, showing Michael Corleone (still excelently portrayed by Al Pacino) succeding his father\u00b4s role as the new don and showing how this new role affects himself and the others around him, and a prequel, showing a young Vito Corleone migrating to New York and establishing his new business there and eventually becoming the mafia boss he became in the first one.These stories are both wonderfully told and provide several improvements to Godfather I\u00b4s story, with the sequel part talking about several interesting themes about succession and toxic family tradition along with a well done documentation on the Cuban Revolution, fantastic cinematography, memorable death scenes that rival that of the ones in the first movie, great acting and a nice Miami setting to boot, with the prequel serving as a great origin story to Don Vito, my favorite character from the first one, whilst expanding on certain character traits of his and a great lead actor in the form of Robert De Niro.This is all good fun and all, but for everything this sequel does right compared to the first one, it does unfortunately do one very thing weaker compared to the first one, and that\u00b4s its emotion. One of the main things I loved in Godfather I is how emotional all of its scenes were and how it made you sympathize with the mafia of all criminal organizations, and while this sequel tries its best, its emotional core is much weaker compared to that of the first one, as the characters aren\u00b4t as likable as the ones in the first movie and the death scenes are nowhere near as impactful, resulting in a much more sour experience than last time.But overall, The Godfather Part II is still a must watch for anyone above 17 or 18, with a lot of what made the original Godfather so fantastic and having some new things to like about it. However, it is pretty weak in terms of conveying emotions, which results in a movie that\u00b4s not worse than the first one, but not better by any means; it\u00b4s just as good as the first one, which still means it deserves a 10/10.",

            "content": "Different personalities determine different fate, and the contrast of fate is the core technique of the godfather series to build the story. Like the older brother Paul of Victor Jr. mentioned at the beginning of Godfather 2, it should be a young boy with strong blood. He vowed to avenge his father, but the result was the same as his father. On the contrary, Victor, who spoke little, was able to escape from danger and miraculously escaped into life. This is like the contrast between the second generation Sonny and Mike. A strong but too impulsive, and a calm and low-key yet bold. The fate of the two brothers is also surprisingly similar. This is a direct portrayal of character determining fate.Similar examples abound in this series. The most obvious contrast is that the hot side of Widow's character corresponds to the cold side of Mike's character, which makes the two generations of godfathers dominate the road differently. The same is true for the supporting actors. The two chiefs, Clemenza and Tessio, one is a little bit reckless, and the other shows a shrewdness in calmness. This different character leads them to make different judgments at critical moments. By mistake.Also has some more marginal supporting characters. Their character and fate are also closely linked, which makes the Godfather series of movies show a true to cruel atmosphere. Like Moglin mentioned when Hemingros sent his power to Mike, he knew that Mo's temperament would easily offend people, so he was not surprised when he learned that Mo died in a bad life. And Frank Pantancurie said when he mentioned his brother, he could have been king here, but he stayed in the small village with two donkeys in his hometown.The group image created by the response between these personalities and fate makes me care about my personality and fate, and calls for correspondence in my heart. This is a deep and excellent way for Godfather 2 to impress the audience.",

I haven't seen the third movie yet but for now, this movie was better than the first one. Why? Because in this movie we saw the young Vito Corleone's life which was a good subject to curious about. About that, the other awesome part was Robert De Niro as young Vito Corleone. I've gotta say that, nobody could act any better. His moves, his gestures, the way he speak they all was like Marlon Brando's. Actually that's why I love this series so much, there are just great actors ever; Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale...And then there is Al Pacino as \"the Godfather\" on the other side which is really awesome. He really is the one who should be the Godfather after Marlon Brando. He acted very good and he had this severity which is a trait if you are a \"Godfather\". The scenario and fiction was better for the first movie I think, because in this movie they showed two stories and that was the key for me. They gone to the past, they came back to the present during all the movie, while we warm up ups, the whole 3 hours were gone. As soon as possible I am going to watch the last movie but I heard some rumors like \"the third movie wasn't that good after all\" kind of things, anyway I hope that is not correct. I am freaking recommend to you this awesome production to watch. Take care.",

Reassembling many of the talents who helped make the \"The Godfather\" A Legend and the most successful motion picture of its time, Francis Ford Coppola Produced a movie of staggering magnitude and vision like any other. The Godfather 2 is undeniably the best sequel ever made, and maybe even superior to the Original \"The Godfather\" which is considered to be the best movie ever made by many critics and actors. The movie is one of the few movies close to perfection. Francis proved his worth and created the level of greatness when it came to direction in the movie industry through The Godfather Saga. The Acting skills shown in The Godfather 2 by Robert De Niro and AL Pacino are truly something you have to see to believe. Robert De Niro portrayed the character of the young Vito Corleone with such effort that he actually made people believe he was the young Marlon Brando. But AL Pacino even topped De Niro and gave a performance which is one of the few characters to be present on every list of great characters in the film history. AL Pacino's Portrayal of Micheal Corleone was so believable that people forget that they are watching a movie when he was performing. Legendary method actor Lee Strasbourg also made his debut in the film industry with this movie and he proved why he is considered to be such an Icon in the world of Acting. Even the characters which are not that important leave a mark of their own. The Godfather 2 is truly one of the greatest films ever made, and there never will be a sequel like this again or one this good.",

            "content": "It's hard to imagine how 1972's \"The Godfather\" could have been bettered.  A massive commercial and critical success, the first chapter of the Corleone saga was a breathtaking piece of film.  When work began on a sequel, few could have thought that it could be a more accomplished film than its predecessor.  It is.Granted, \"The Godfather: Part II\" cannot be viewed to full effect without viewing the first film.  The complex nature of its storyline requires previous knowledge of characters and events.  But this is something director Francis Ford Coppola took as a given.  In fact most people that went to see this film had probably already seen the first more than once!Coppola's biggest trump card was the retention of the majority of the cast of \"The Godfather\".  Only Marlon Brando and Richard Castellano declined to return.  Interestingly it is Castellano's Clemenza that is missed more sorely than Brando's Vito Corleone (Clemenza's character is replaced by Frankie Pentangeli, played by Michael V. Gazzo).  This film does not document the latter years of Vito's life, as in the first film, but continues the story of son Michael (Al Pacino), whilst also foretelling how Vito Andolini, an orphan from the town of Corelone in Sicily, ended up becoming one of the most powerful men in the United States. \nPacino returns as the forlorn Michael.  Even more distant than at the conclusion of the original, Pacino's lack of emotion is utterly draining, yet brilliantly portrayed.  Other key characters such as Kaye (Diane Keaton), Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Connie (Talia Shire) and Fredo (John Cazale) also return.  Cazale is brilliant as Fredo and his character, which was only a brief mention in the first film, is one of the pivotal elements of this sequel.  Method acting guru Lee Strasberg appears as Hyman Roth, Michael's cunning business partner and former associate of his father. \nThe role of a 20-something Vito Corleone went to Robert De Niro.  In a 95% Italian speaking role, De Niro launched his career here.  The similarities between himself and Brando are superbly executed and we are convinced that they are one and the same.The film opens in early 1900's Sicily.  In the town of Corleone the male population is slowly being decimated by a mafia lord.  Fearing her son's life, Vito Andolini's mother sends her youngest son away to leave the violent shores of Sicily for the opportunity of America.  Alone, stricken with smallpox and malnourished, young Vito takes the name of Corleone after his home village.  With the Statue of Liberty visible from his Ellis Island window, the world awaits him.The film then jumps forward to the late 1950's.  Now relocated in Nevada, the Corleone family has made inroads into the casino business.  Michael's pursuits of power continue to grow.  Along the way his path is blocked by numerous naysayers, but the power of the Corleone family often ensures these obstacles are removed or altered without much effort.  Doggedly pursuing the goal of absolute power, Michael's single mindedness becomes his undoing.  A business partnership with aging criminal Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) is centred on hotels and casinos funded by US money in Havana.  Before the business deal gets off the ground Michael's intuition works to his advantage as he uncovers a double-cross.  He also finds a traitor inside the family and has to make a decision on how to deal with it.  We share Michael's despair as the slow deterioration of the Corleone empire unfolds.  It is an utterly engrossing yet bitter tragedy.Watching the young Vito in tandem with Michael's decline is initially unsettling, yet once we get used to seeing De Niro as Vito we settle into 1900's New York easily enough.  Coppola's depiction of Corleone as a man simply striving to make a better world for his family smacks of dewy eyed reverence as little too much, but as an audience we take pride in Vito's code of honour.  Like a 20th century Robin Hood, Vito Corleone is a criminal we can be proud of.  De Niro's performance as Vito is excellent and he is supported by a stellar Bruno Kirby, who plays the young Peter Clemenza.  The early associations that Vito makes stay with him for life \u0096 unlike Michael's continuously deteriorating ties with the New York old school capo's. \nOne thing that we notice with Michael's story is how much it represents the American dream gone wrong.  At one stage Roth says to Michael \u0091We're bigger than US Steel.'  The Mafia, which once operated as a community, now runs like a business.  As in big business, allegiances are easily made and broken and Michael finds that it is no longer about code and honour, but wealth and power.  This is clearly illustrated to the audience by the paralleled stories of Vito and Michael.The end of \"The Godfather: Part II\" leaves the audience exhausted, but in a subliminal way.  It's a Shakespearian tragedy in the best sense.  It would have been best to end the story there, with an audience that etched out its own idea of where the Corleone family ended up.  But Coppola couldn't resist the temptation from Paramount to round the story off in the good but not great \"The Godfather: Part III\".  However, viewed in tandem with the original and the second sequel, it is this chapter of the saga that stands out.  Cinematic genius is not a term I throw around, but this film encapsulates it.  A timeless classic.",

            "content": "In many ways, \"The Godfather Part II\" was the sequel that either matched or topped the original! It had twice the budget, it got nominated for 11 Oscars like the original and it won twice the Oscars with 6 wins: Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro), Best Art Direction - Set Decoration (Dean Travoularis, Angelo P. Graham), Best Music, Original Dramatic Score (Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola), Best Adapted Screenplay (Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo), Best Director (Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Francis Ford Coppola, Gray Frederickson and Fred Roos). The movie didn't bring in as much money as the original, though. Many people see this as better than the original, and even the best movie of all time. For the time being, I actually prefer this movie over the original. Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Gazale and Diane Keaton returned to star, and new actors were brought in, including Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strassberg.The Godfather Part 2 would carry on the legacy of perfection that The Godfather presented to the world. One of the reasons being is the second spectacular screenplay by Coppola and Puzo! The movie is straightforward, and even though it's a more complicated plot than the first, it's not THAT hard to follow. Many iconic lines are introduced once again, and the idea of making this movie a prequel as well of a follow-up seems unique. Al Pacino delivers an even more complex and disturbed performance as the now chilling and psychotic Michael Corleone. The Michael Corleone in the original movie was relaxed and could act human, whereas he (in this movie) coldly kills anyone, and I repeat, ANYONE who stands in his way. Pacinos performance is believable all the way, and the relaxed attitude he expresses on-screen, echoes back to the permanently relaxed Michael we saw in the original. He can talk almost robotic and give a cold stare to a man, and explode with rage in the next second, and Pacino sells it. Pacino delivered one of the greatest, if not the greatest villainous performance of all time, and possibly THE greatest performance of all time. Robert De Niro is one of the other stars in the movie! He plays the part of the young Vito Corleone with finesse and a nice calmness, all the while maintaining the virtues that made Brandos's first performance so special. His performance stands as one of the best supporting ones, and he isn't even my favorite supporting character in the movie. Michael V. Gazzo's aging and hot-headed Frankie Pentangeli is a joy to watch on-screen, although his performance is significantly weaker when compared to some of the other performances in this movie. Lee Strassberg delivers yet another spectacular and moving performance as the long-time gangster Hyman Roth. But the one supporting performance that really shined for me (more than in the original), John Gazale as the brother Fredo Corleone. His performance was delicately layered and moving all the way, and by the end of the film I felt such pity for the guy. Shoulda' been nominated for an Oscar.The musical score in this movie is very much the same, and therefore as brilliant and as memorable as the first. The cinematography, the sound and the set decoration are spectacular, and makes the movie feel more epic.I prefer this movie to the original for a number of reasons: For what seemed to be an impossible goal to make the movie better than the first for some, for the stronger characters, the stronger performances, the epic feel to it, the perfection carried on, the more complex plot and the magnificent ending. This movie must never be deemed a sequel! It carries on the perfection of the first already perfect movie. A must-watch for everyone! 10/10",

            "content": "GODFATHER II simply destroys the myth that most sequels to major films are usually inferior products and rather bad ideas. The film easily ranks as one of the finest sequels in movie history and, in fact, may be preferred by audiences to the original! While GODFATHER I is unquestionably a classic film and makes virtually every critic's all-time top 10 movie list, GODFATHER II stands right beside it combining the three mighty elements of movie making: engrossing script, brilliant direction, and powerful performances from every actor who steps in front of the camera. The sequel simply has so many watchable and engrossing scenes in the Corleone family saga that audiences never seem to tire of them even after viewing them over and over for years. The opening sequence at the Corleone First Communion celebration along the blue waters of Lake Tahoe is a fresh and welcome juxtaposition to the grim, New York Depression years of GODFATHER I. The story moves intriguingly along as the confrontation between Michael Corleone and Nevada Senator Geary serve as the impetus for the family's new business interests: establishing a foothold in the Las Vegas hotel empire. Geary refuses to assist Corleone's attempt to acquire a liquor license; Michael's sister Connie (Talia Shire) asking for money so she can marry her beau Merle (Troy Donahue); the shift to Las Vegas where weak Fredo's buddy-buddy relationship with Hyman Roth (Lee Strassberg) seals his doom; the attempted Michael Corleone assassination attempt at the compound; senate racketeering hearings; the brilliant performance of acting maestro Lee Strasberg as Corleone antagonist Hyman Roth; the bitterly unforgiving retribution Michael delivers to his brother Freddo and wife Kay (Diane Keaton); and, of course, the entire flashback to the early Vito Corleone days in early 1900's New York where we witness Michael Corleone relieving the Italian community of the \"The Black Hand\" and thereby establishing the roots of the family syndicate.Not to be overlooked, is the memorable performance of gravel-voiced Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) who plays one of the Corleone's most loyal lieutenants. Pentangeli's wrath over not being able to wipe out the competing Rosario Brothes spills over to his betrayal of the Corleone's which ultimately seals his own doom. After being placed in the Witness Protection Program and delivering a deposition, Pentangeli sits at the senate committee table ready to sing--until he glimpses the sudden appearance of his brother from Italy being escorted into the courtroom ominously by Michael. Pentangeli reverses himself and refuses to incriminate Corleone.If there's a lesson that comes through just about every frame of all three GODFATHER films, it's that trusted disciples almost always become a Judas. Virtually every loyal Corleone lieutenant, it seems, eventually betrays the family and is doomed to be crushed under the Michael Corleone boot. Even poor Abe Vigoda goes over to the competition and ends up taken for a ride. What comes through most effectively in the Corleone character--as it must come through--is Al Pacino's portrayal of the Godfather's iron fist and harsh retribution. Pacino's performance as the Don is a masterpiece in film history for its brilliant economy and understatement. Everything that needs to be stated or conveyed is done so with either a few sentences, harsh glare, or nod. Corleone's single, and most memorable verbal outburst, comes at his wife when she reveals she aborted the child he wanted. The vengeance Corleone exacts against those he feels betrayed him are conveyed with a sense of unswerving and inevitable doom: for when one double-crosses a Corleone, one pays the ultimate price. Al Pacino's performance as Micahel Corleone is movie legend. And GODFATHER II should make everyone must-see list, especially those who were enthralled by GODFATHER I and the tale of the Corleone's.Trivia: A woman I currently work with appears briefly in the Lake Tahoe celebration scene at the beginning of the film. She said she was vacationing near Homewood (east Lake Tahoe) during the filming of GODFATHER II when Coppola pulled her and many other extras off the street saying he needed \"a lot of people.\" She received nothing for appearing.....Troy Donahue made a cameo as Connie's beau in GODFATHER II playing Merle--which was Donahue's first real name...Dennis Caracciolo",

And at the same time, we see the origins of the imperium made by Vito, his beginings.And my favorite Part of the movie was that one, the Vito's Part.

            "content": "Only 8 out of 10 because of the violence. As a Believer, I want more positive films. However, it's a classic nonetheless. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions). Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did. Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in \"The Godfather Part II,\" Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.",

ANd since the first part of the trilogy is probably the best American movie ever made, this one is nominated as one of the best movies ever made. Am I exaggerating? Check out my arguments please, and then make up your mind.It's a long and slowly evoking film. I must say that I almost understand the people who say they're bored from it. But to the people who know a thing or two about cinematography, it's an absolute masterpiece.The plot is great. While we see Pacino's life sinking into a nightmare of uncertainty and solitude -by the end of the movie, he's lost his wife, his mother and his brothers, we are brought in parallel to an early-20th century New York, where young and poor immigrant, Vito Corleone -Pacino's father- makes his first steps into the world of blood and domination. The two figures don't appear ever at the same time on the screen. In that way we can compare the major difference between them: Vito is poor but going up. Michael is rich and powerful, but he's losing each one of the people he loves. Thus, whereas the first movie deals with power, this one's dealing with relationships and feelings.The acting is outstanding. DeNiro symbolizes the Corleone character, by avoiding showing too much on his face -Brando did the opposite in the first part. Pacino is also splendid. He isn't a young and ambitious man anymore. In this movie he is a man who has lost control.The cinematography is also magnificent. Starting from where the fist movie ended, Coppola avoids too much general plans and gives weight to the gros plans. The photography is very nice and the music, once more, over the top.It's OK if you don't like it. It's very long -more than three hours, slow and difficult. But I won't change my mind: It's really one of the very-very best ever made. Humangousely recommended. Cheers.",

But back in 1974, it was almost unprecedented for the makers of a Best Picture Academy Award-winner to return to the well. It's significant that this is called The Godfather Part II rather than Godfather II, since Coppola and his collaborators did not give us more of the same, but extended the original story of the Corleone family backwards and forwards, while deepening the characterisations.Darting back and forth in time, this follows Michael (Pacino) through the 1950s, as his would-be legitimate business gets into sleazy deals in Cuba and the US Senate, and he is forced to break the ultimate taboo by having his own brother murdered. Meanwhile, we see his father Vito (De Niro) as a young man, organising a street gang in turn-of-the-century New York. Coppola, steeped in Italian-American myth of the immigrant experience, canonises Vito, who founds the Mafia to protect his people from more predatory dons, while exposing the way Vito's family business harbours the seed of his son's monstrously corrupt empire.This was the film in which Pacino and De Niro were first teamed, though the exigencies of the narrative mean that they never actually meet. Both are electrifying but Pacino is especially strong, his hollow gaze showing the high price Michael has paid for his position. And with supporting roles from the likes of Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Lee Strasberg, to say nothing of Roger Corman and Harry Dean Stanton in bit parts, this is nothing short of magisterial.Courtesy: Empire magazine",

            "content": "In my opinion, \"The Godfather 2\" is much to positive regarding the mafia, even sympathetic to it.With the two layers of the narrative, the rise of Vito Corleone, caring and with a loving wife, cut against Michael Corleone, struggling and living in disharmony, the movie actually portraits the changes to society that had taken place between the pre-war and post-war society and between Sicily and America as something bad. It follows a \"The Good old times \"clich\u00e9, which is in itself already ideology of the mafia.This motive is already present in the first movie, but more subtle: Michael finds his true love in an uneducated, maybe underage Sicilian women, that is pimped by her parents to this mighty man and he only returns to the educated, working girlfriend in America because a) his true love has been killed and b) after 1 year he found no other option in the USA.Especially the portrait of Michael's wife shows a huge anger against women, who are not completely obedient to their husband: This women performs an abortion, because she does not want to give another air to her husband.This is the same kind of stuff the trials against witches of the middle ages are made off: it is pure hatred and an attempt to link independence of a women to wickedness and insanity.So in my opinion, the movie is poisoned by the material it tries to put on screen - and this is a warning to every cinematographer, that the subject of a movie is not to be taken easy, the subject might dominate. If it is about power like with the mafia, it might taint the whole result.",

            "content": "I have just watched <The Godfather: Part II> again.  It is an ambitious story, spanning more than fifty years.  It is a story of the first half of the twentieth century in America, as the country coped with waves of immigration, prohibition, war in Europe, the post-war boom, and rebellion in Cuba.The first part of the Godfather trilogy offers only a foretaste of the heart of the Godfather story arc: the genesis of the Corleone family business with young Vito Corleone, played with easy confidence by Robert De Niro; and the hardening of Michael Corleone, played with mesmerizing intensity by Al Pacino.* spoilers from here onward *The movie is peppered with iconic and powerful images: a young Vito Corleone (Andolini) singing hymns while quarantined at Ellis Island, Vito executing his first hit with a towel-wrapped pistol, Michael bestowing a kiss of death on his brother Fredo, Michael gazing out his boathouse window as he awaits the fate of his brother, Hyman Roth's Lee-Harvey-Oswald-style assassination in a scrum of press and security.The movie is shot artfully, though at times is lit a bit dimly.  The location selection and set decoration are attentively and evocatively rendered as we follow Vito's rise.  It is easy to forget that the segements showing Michael's fall are also period shots, set about twenty-five years prior to filming, as they are unforced and ring true.The vengeful, unforgiving Sicilian code depicted in the film undoes all that is good in Vito and Michael.  They are devoted family men, loyal to their sympathizers, supportive of their community, and admired for their wisdom. But they kill to win their independence from authority, to secure their power, to eliminate dissenters, and to settle decades-old vendettas. Michael's obsession with securing his power causes him to imprison then estrange his wife, order the death of his own brother, betray his old friends, and embrace his rivals.  He is left with an empire and no one to share it with: his parents and brothers are dead, wife gone, children afraid, and so on.  His only solace is the brow-beaten sister who returns to live with him in the family compound, and his similarly brow-beaten adoptive brother, Tim Hagen.The supporting cast is excellent, particularly Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall, as well as Talia Shire, Lee Strasberg, and Bruno Kirby.I had previously recorded my vote for this movie as an eight, but have now revised it to a nine of ten.igm",

Godfather Part II is like a completely different story, because it's the new Godfather, who's more cruel that his father. Genius making itself more genius and smart. Godfather Part II is definitely, in my eyes, the best sequel ever made, and will probably be the greatest sequel. It's a wonder how such two great, and nearly perfect films could be ended with Godfather Part III, which was a complete letdown. Watch Part II, and don't watch Part III.

The scenes at first are subtle, yet powerful. Take for instance, the beginning where you have the humble Don singing in Italian at Ellis Island as a kid and the scene changes to Antony's first communion in Reno which is just a front for the Senator to do business with Michael about the acquaintance of new hotels for double the price of the arranged price in order to milk the family as much as possible. There is hatred for the current family that Michael controls from outsiders such as Senator Geary. The Vito plot flows smoothly of how Vito gains power by meeting Clemenza and killing the current powers in Little Italy in New York and later getting revenge on Don Ciccio in Corleone. He starts by stealing and then running molasses with several partners while doing favors for certain people. Michael's story is about Roth trying to take over Michael's control over the hotels he owns by having a partnership with Cuba, Michael's investment in some new hotels in Cuba, all while trying to overthrow him by having Fredo betray him unintentionally since he knew that everyone in the family stepped over him because he is weak minded. While Vito is becoming the new Don in the 20s, Michael does the unforgivable and orders the hit on his own brother since he never forgave him for his betrayal and the ending is truly the end of this franchise with the haunting comparison of a young Michael with his dad waving goodbye and then it goes back to a cold Michael pondering his brother's death. The irony also is that when Michael joins the Navy and everyone on the table questions his decision, Fredo is the only one who embraces his decision.",

There are two towering, brilliant, outstanding performances from Al Pacino and Robert de Niro. I cannot think of two greater performances on screen - and ironically they didn't meet!They seemed to make movies differently once: this is about 'atmosphere'. And the atmosphere generated is truly astonishing. It's such a contrast to today's cinematography which has to ladle on the obvious because, one assumes, people are too stupid to follow. One can only laugh at the notion that Jackson's Rings trilogy could find its way into a comparative top 10 with the Godfather. The latter belongs to a universe of brilliance and sophistication that Jackson's work won't achieve even if he goes through 100 successive re-incarnations trying to get there.(Spoiler alert)I love the contrasting way in which Vito builds friends out of nothing, but by careful and adept people-working, whereas Michael starts out with a clan, and ends up staring in loneliness across the lake. Pacino develops this aspect quite superbly, as de Niro does the converse.It's outstanding stuff. And the two taken together may never be matched.",

Take the cannoli.\" Marlon Brando, James Caan and Al Pacino deliver some of the greatest performances in cinematic history. The Godfather II continued the momentum and the acclaim of the first film, an amazing feat. And, yet, I do not love the film as much.I have read both the novel The Godfather and Mario Puzo's first work, The Fortunate Pilgrim. His soaring poetic prose grounded in family relationships in The Fortunate Pilgrim are impressive and lay the groundwork for The Godfather. His depiction of mental illness overtaking a teenager's life has haunted me. Puzo has prosaic skills that many contemporary authors could not match. Stephen King or Dean Koontz, for example, could never produce a sentence with the poetry of The Fortunate Pilgrim. Here is an excerpt by Mario Puzo:\n\" He cantered through the hot summer night, his desert a city of stone. Women gossiped on wooden boxes, men puffed cigars of the De Nobili while standing on street corners, children risked their lives in dangerous play, leaving their blue-slate islands to climb on the moving freight train. All moved in the smoky yellow light of lamp posts and the naked white-hot bulbs of candy-store windows. At every intersection a fresh breeze from Twelfth Avenue, concrete bank of the Hudson River, refreshed horse and rider, cooled the hot black engine that gave warning hoots behind them.\"Yet, Coppola has spoken of Puzo as \"a collaborator,\" even detailing how he took plot points (Kay's abortion) from Talia Shire, his sister, rather than from Puzo! (Source: Indiewire) Puzo did not want Michael to murder his brother, but Coppola wanted to show how Michael was becoming a monster.And Fredo is my problem with the movie. It's a journey I never wanted. Cazale's performance is too good, rendering a character so loathsome that I cheered when he died. Why Fredo? Why Cuba? Why De Niro flashbacks to the early 1900s? All of this is done in a perfect cinematic way with top notch actors, yet I wonder about the choices and a movie that could have been even greater if different ones were made.\nIn light of The Godfather III, I began to wonder if Coppola was trying to repeat his winning formula on Patton: one megalomaniac star takes over the film. Did Coppola's vision favor Al Pacino's Michael so much that Puzo's Corleone family suffers for it? I love the moment where Michael offers a \"Judas kiss\" to Fredo before saying: I knew it was you Fredo. You broke my heart.\" But is this the moment Al Pacino ceases to be Michael from the first film, becoming the over the top Al Pacino of Scarface?",

While Part II lacks Brando's Don Vito Corleone, Sonny (except for a flashback), Clemenza and Sollozzo, it makes up for it with De Niro's young version of Vito, Hyman Roth, and Frank Pentangeli. The beautiful music also carries over from the original. The two stories of Michael expanding his empire to Nevada and Cuba and how young Vito started his career in New York are perfectly played out.In fact, what many people don't know is that while the original is based on Mario Puzo's novel, Part II, with the exception of the story how Vito's rise to power, is completely original material.

Michael looses touch with reality and loses control, he sees everything which is real break right in front of him. An epic film with truly great actors.I think in the scene with Michael and all his brothers near the end shows how he, even back before he was tarnished with greed, wasn't a family orientated man. He wanted to live for himself, be successful on his own accord. Join the Marines. He never had plans to become part of the mafia.

It is another dark, stunning portrait from a master director. A pitch-perfect screenplay leads the brilliant actors through a world few filmmakers can accurately show. It is a masterful companion piece to \"The Godfather (1972).\"This movie tells us two stories in two different times. One is about Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) criminal organization, and how he is struggling with opposition, his failing marriage, and his kids that don't understand the truth behind their father's seemingly gentle eyes. Michael is trying to buy \"legitimate businesses\" during the Cuban Revolution with the help of Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), but there may be more to the picture than either of them realize. It is also the story of Michael's adopted brother Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who feels he is starting to be left out of the picture. Diane Keaton as Kay is ever more strained from her murderous husband, and Connie (Talia Shire) is losing confidence in her brother. John Cazale as Michael's brother, Fredo, is beginning to get confused about what is best for his family. The movie's parallel story is about the immigration and early life of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), and his rise to power in the early 1900s. The struggles, the love, and the violence that dictate the future of the Don's decisions.As I have already mentioned, the movie is brilliant, and so are the stories. While Michael's rise in the criminal underworld is fascinating, I found the story of the young Vito Corleone to be even more so. It is the only part of the book that Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola left out in the first one. It is done here magnificently. I still like the first one a little bit better than this one. It is very close, but I think there's a good reason: we were knocked off of our feet by \"The Godfather,\" because we did not know what was coming. It was the first time. This is the second time. Is that a negative? No, this film weaves in perfect acting by Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, John Cazale, and Lee Strasberg with superb storytelling, magnificent direction, beautiful cinematography, a worthy script, and and an overall great production. Robert De Niro, in his Oscar-winning performance, gives one of the shows of his life. He steals our attention with his magnificent acting. One of his best career moves.Thanks to Francis Ford Coppola, the director/co-writer/producer, who has transformed an amazing book into two movies that will remain is history forever as masterpieces. Thanks to co-writer Mario Puzo, who without his book and screen writing, there would not be this movie. Beautiful.",

It is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was that says a lot. The Godfather Part II is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. People may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. Of course, but I think that was deliberate. Both this and the first Godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling.For one thing, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. The music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. Then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. The film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where Vito flees Sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.The acting is superb once again. Vito is brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro in one of his better performances. I was also taken with Robert Duvall as loyal Tom, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. But the picture belongs to Al Pacino. He was great carrying the first Godfather movie, but he is even better here. He is simply phenomenal, and to be honest I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived.",

To be honest though, recently I am not as enthralled with The Godfather.  Over time, Part II has become a much better, richer movie going experience.  Not that there's anything wrong with The Godfather, I just happen to prefer this one.  I think that it paint a broader canvas thanks in part to jumping between the two stories.\nThere are just so many wonderful scenes.  The film starts off with the story of how Vito Corleone came to America.  This part of the movie is in Sicilian and even shot on location in Sicily.  Then we jump to the 50's and the confirmation of Anthony, Vito's grandson.  Like the wedding in the first one, we get an idea of who the main players are going to be.  One of my favorite shots in this part is when Fredo's tramp wife meets Connie's gigolo fiance.  Coppola cuts to a shot Mama Corleone saying something to Consigliori Tom Hagen in Sicilian.  it is a brief shot, not more than 2 or 3 seconds but you get an idea of the relationship between them.  This is of interest to me as a Godfather obsessive since in the original novel, it is noted that the adopted Hagen never thought of Mama Corleone as a mother nor were they particularly close.  This shot shows how in the enusing years since her husband's death how they developed a bond.There is so much good in this movie to rave about.  Coppola apparently loves commerative events: the wedding reception in the first movie, the aforementioned confimation party (which of course has little to do with the confirmation and everything to do with Michael's power) and New Year's in Cuba.While we may remember the big scenes, there are also some wonderful simple scens just between two characters: Michael's visit to Hyman Roth in Miami, his drink with Fredo (a banana daquiri?) in Cuba, Kaye's leaving Michael (\"this Sicilian thing\") and Tom's final meeting with Frankie Pantangelo. All these scenes are written with wonderful, intelligent dialogue accompanied by solid acting.",

What elevates this film making it better than any other film sequel ever made, is the fact that the film is a sequel and a prequel in one.Robert DeNiro does a brilliant job reprising the role that Marlon Brando made so famous as Vito Corleone, showing how the Corleone family rose to power, and in the present day Michael Corleone, (Al Pacino in his best performance yet) is now the head of the family business, who gets so caught up in success and himself that he ends up losing his entire family. Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, and Talia Shire also do fine jobs reprising their roles.My favorite scene in The Godfather Part II is at the end, when Michael has flashbacks to the way his family used to be, and how everyone left him alone at the table when he announced he enlisted in the Marines, which fades into the final shot of the film as you see Michael Corleone sitting all alone with no one else in his life (as if he were in hell for his sins). It was an intensely gripping scene.You haven't seen enough if you have only seen The Godfather, so Part II is one of those rare sequels which completes the story. Need I say more?",

The first movie was how capitalism, the Catholic Church, big business and the goverment are all the same as organized crime. The second movie with a Marxist theme, is an expansion of that idea and tells how destructive capitalism is to three different types of Families. The movie did not intend to totally portray how the mafia works, but goes beyond that. With this in mind, The Godfather is a great movie and the violence is used to make a point.Furthermore, if you do a little research, you will find out everything I said about the movie is true.",

The film expands the character and arc of that which is Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino (reprising his role from the first flawless film). It is a saga in all senses of the word. The most obvious thing to be disappointed by was its comparison to its predecessor. No one can compare \"The Godfather\" to anything else. It's a league of its own. As a stand-alone movie, \"II\" is great. Fantastic. But not flawless.The one major thing I found was its pacing. If I were the director, I could have ended it 45 minutes earlier. The immediate plot arcs are resolved, and all that is left to tell is Michael's descent into darkness. If that was the story Coppola wanted to tell, fine. I just preferred a more upbeat ending (call me what you will). I almost got up to turn off the DVD, but then there was another scene. And another. They, truthfully, felt like add-ons. This is not to say, once again, that I didn't love the movie. Easily one of the best ever. It just COULD HAVE been better. Once you have tasted filet mignon, would you go back to hamburger? Perhaps. But you might rather that burger be made out of the filet. This movie was more like a 40 oz. prime rib steak- tasty, juicy, so flavorful, but just too darn big to love.",

Dark, brutal yet also hyper realistic, with no gangster film like that ever seen before. So the idea of a follow up in 1974 was a bit strange. Granted, Coppola was back in the director's chair, but some fans were wondering; what else was there to tell? Well, in my opinion, this movie took a bold chance and further explored how much humanity can be sacrificed for the \"greater good\" and sometimes that doesn't have a boundary. We see Al Pacino as Michael in a desperate attempt to hold onto power while dealing with family, betrayal and violence. It makes the viewer wonder if he has any decent mercy left. But on top of that, and why I personally like this film, we also get the backstory to a character that was done by one of the greatest performances of all time. Who could possibly play the younger version of the Oscar-winning Marlon Brando? Robert De Niro, of course. This not only won him his first Oscar for acting, but also cemented him as one of the big heavy-hitters in terms of acting in the gangster genre. Seeing how a child can come from obscurity in Sicily, with everything trying to kill you, yet become successful enough to become the epitome of power at a price. This was the first sequel to win Best Picture and remains the only one to win along with its predecessor. At a time when The Godfather was said to be the perfect movie that can never be topped, Godfather 2 tried and not only succeeded but exceeded everyone's expectations. It's hard enough making something like Godfather successful once but to do it twice and BOTH times win Best Picture? That is a DANG impressive achievement. It literally \"gave us an offer we just couldn't refuse.\"",

After years of people crushing me to see Part II (and the heavy weight of the Oscar Gold it had won) I finally caved in, rented it, and came away from it a changed man.It is difficult in any film to tell two separate stories that co-exist on the same level.  They accomplished that.  It is near blasphemous to take a heralded character in the original and watch him self-destruct in a sequel. They pulled it off.  And it is unthinkable that one brother could possibly betray another.  Believe it.Part II tells the parallel stories of a Young Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro speaking virtually no English) rising to prominence in New York's Hells Kitchen and his son Michael (Al Pacino in his best performance ever), many years after Vito's death, trying to make sense of the business he never wanted to be a part of.  The Rise and The Fall of two very different, but ultimately the same, men.Vito's inherent goodness bleeds through his performance.  Once doing away with the \"Black Hand\" who rules the streets through terror and oppression, Vito takes control of his neighborhood through kindness and compassion.  He knows the problems of his people and understands why, in some situations, they can not afford to go to the police for help.  He is their Robin Hood.However, several decades later on the banks of Lake Tahoe, his youngest son Michael has embraced the hypocrisy of his profession.  He intimidates his adversaries, yanks power from his father's trusted counselor, and turns his older brother Fredo (the much missed John Cazale) into a glorified errand boy.  After an attempt on his life is botched, Michael goes on an international trek to consolidate his potential enemies and turn them against one another.  It is on this journey that he learns the true nature of his enemy and realizes that to overcome him, he may lose his soul.Shakespearean to a fault, emotional as hell and one of the best (tragic) endings I have ever encountered.

They believe 'the life' is for the greatest benefit for their family, but then take it too far.Films up to this point had a narrow view of the motivation of the accomplices in organized crime.

At the funeral Vito's older brother is also killed, and the mafia chief is determined to murder Vito too. His mother begs for his freedom, but the mafia chief knows that if he lets him go, Vito will one day come back for revenge. Vito's mother bravely picks up a knife and holds it to the chief's throat, allowing him to escape, but she is quickly gunned down. Vito then immigrates to New York and arrives at Ellis Island. The movie then flashes forward through time and the darker story of his son, Michael Corleone, begins.The movie then starts to alternate between the stories of Vito Corleone as he rises in the New York Mafia in the 1920's, and Michael Corleone as he struggles to maintain his father's empire in the late 50's. So it acts as both a prequel and a sequel. I thought that this was the most interesting part of the film, because you see how Vito started with nothing and built an empire, while Michael starts with this empire and has to keep it all from crumbling. Another thing that you see throughout the film is the extreme transformation of the character of Michael. In just a few years, he had become more brutal and ruthless than Vito ever was. You see just how corrupted Michael had become when he does something at the end that is horrifying and unforgivable. That's the point when his job and corruption from power had driven him to do something that destroys his family and himself.Another strong part of the film is its performances. The movie dominated the Academy Awards nominations for Best Supporting Actor/Actress, with Robert De Niro (Vito Corleone), Michael V. Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli), Talia Shire (Connie Corleone), and Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth) all nominated for that category, and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone) nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Robert De Niro was the one awarded the Oscar, one of the many awards that the film has been given. Robert De Niro was also awarded an Oscar for his performance as the character). Al Pacino also did a great job of portraying the change of his character from the first film and throughout this one. He went from a young WWII veteran trying to break away from his family's \"business\" to being the country's most powerful mob bosses.All of these things are what make the movie a masterpiece. It won many awards, including Best Picture at the 1974 Academy Awards. The characters are great, which is helped by the award-winning performances of the actors. The two alternating stories are what made the movie so much more interesting than the first. It's currently number 32 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years\u0085100 Movies list, and number 3 on IMDb's top 250 movies list. I agree with the reviews, and I think that it is one of the greatest films ever made.",

            "content": "The Godfather part 2 is a spectacular, all-out brilliant film - the reason it does not better the original is the missing characters Sonny and Old Vito and Clemenza. And there aren't as many memorable moments.Don't get me wrong however this is still a masterpiece of cinema and reminder of how films should be made rather than all the hyped up garbage we see on our screens today.Al Pacino is BACK as Michael Corleone - the all powerful head of the corleone family. Robert Duvall returns, as does John Cazale, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (also Morgana King, Richard Bright, Tom Rosqui and Joe Spinell) and are joined by 3 major new characters - Clemenza's replacement Frank Pentangeli (Michael. V. Gazzo), Meyer Lansky clone Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) and the slimy senator geary (G.D. Spradlin) There is also a supreme prequel section which takes up about a third of the film - This introduces Robert De Niro as the young Vito Corleone, flanked by Genco (Frank Sivero), Tessio (John Aprea) and Clemenza (Bruno Kirby) . And pursued by Don Fanucci (Gaston Moschin) and Don Ciccio.The performances are superb - No doubt about that Pacino, Duvall, De Niro, V.Gazzo - all outstanding but special mention to the late GREAT John Cazale - who took his character Fredo Corleone from a brief role in the first film to elevated it to a sincerely higher plein.  He was simply outstanding and should have won an oscar for his incredibly realistic and stunning portrayal of a resentful, useless, fool who can't accept that baby brother is better than him (and wouldn't we all) we can understand the way he feels and in a way we are sympathetic.Cazale's supremacy aside, The film is 9 1/2 out of ten and i strongly recommend it , should watch part 1 first though.",

After all, the first Godfather film is no easy act to follow. But, Coppola continued to pay attention to his characters and the locations in which he staged them.Without comparing this to its predecessor it's close to being without flaw. The prequel segments are beautifully done, shot, and staged. The pace is quicker and a lot more happens in this film, but in being the minority -- I don't think it's better than the first film. The parts with young Vito are certainly brilliant and Robert DeNiro gives a powerful performance of an emotionally restrained Vito Corleone.The music is still good, although not as good as the score from the first. The main theme has changed, and I -- for one, miss it and think there's something seriously wanting about it. Yes, it's beautiful; but I don't believe it compares. Al Pacino's performance here is un-rivaled, in almost any film. There are 4 pivotal performances I commend ahead of everything -- and that's: Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in The Godfather, Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, and Robert DeNiro in The Godfather II. There are so many great moments in this film. Michael confronting Fredo in Cuba, on New Years eve, is my favorite film of the sequel continuation. Otherwise it'd probably be Vito Corleone following Don Fanucci through the roof tops and then waits for him at his apartment. The light flickers on and off lighting up Vito's face and all you see is ice cold menace.Some film fans like this film without even liking the first one, but I say the first is slightly superior, and only because Marlon Brando's missing and it just doesn't seem like \"The Godfather\" without him.A+: A memorable experience.",

The other plotline is the rise of Vito Corleone.  This is well played by Robert DeNiro, who received an Oscar for his performance.   The movie viewer has a complex soap opera that does not disappoint.  It's deep and dark. It shows that unlike his father, Michael has to sacrifice his wife and children to hold the family name.  Meanwhile, Vito shows his ability to lead by taking out the local boss and establishing his own racket. Michael is seen as the tragic figure, the one member of the family who wanted to be legit and turns out to be more ruthless than his father.   It's a shame this wasn't the original Godfather.

The film shows that while Vito had a very strong, ambitious character, Michael showed equal strength but underneath he hid sadness and depression.Of course, a complex character comparison/contrast like this needs great actors to fulfill the job. Al Pacino, fresh from his Oscar-nominated turn in The Godfather delivers one of his most memorable performances while Robert De Niro, a relative unknown then delivers an Oscar-winning performance. The two intercuts between Michael and Vito motionless is probably the most memorable images of The Godfather trilogy and shows what 'star power' really is.

            "content": "There is a chapter in Godfather Trilogy analysis called \"Major Character Analysis\", which makes some comparisons between the two godfathers. Some of these comparisons seem superficial, so here's a personal comparison between Vito and Michael godfathers.The differences on the surface of Vito and Michael, I have always believed, must not be analyzed solely by the differences in the character of two people, but I prefer to analyze the way these two people behave from the times and experiences they live in.One notable difference in careers is that Vito have a good grasp of the godfather role (ease), while Michael have been making great achievements but always seem laborious; another notable difference, for example, is that Vito maintain the family fairly well, and Michael is much worse. The authors of Godfather Trilogy Analysis tend to interpret both as Vito is a very enthusiastic person, but Michael is a cold-blooded.. The analysis is simple, however, because one obvious thing is that Michael have different personalities before and after becoming a godfather, that is to say, many of Michael personalities have evolved after becoming godfathers.For three reasons Vito have a good grasp of the role: experience, interest, and historical background. Vito is from a poor boy who has nothing step by step to the godfather's throne, from childhood to adulthood along the way with a variety of people, including his close friends as brothers, but also his opponents. He was also closest to and tortured by two different-style gang bosses (both Italian style and American style). From the experience, it Vito clear how to be a gangster who is feared by the enemy, trusted by his godson and loved by his loved ones. And do Michael have such experiences? Too bad. He may have never thought of inheriting a profession like his father since childhood. He wants to live like the average American, he has an American name, he has an American sense of honor (joining the Navy), he looks for 100% of American women as girlfriends. So Santino death, Fredo incompetence led to the arrival of the godfather position is too sudden for Michael, how can we expect such an inexperienced man to be able to make the godfather as handy as his father in the short term? Vito used to help people solve the trivial things of rent. Michael? To represent huge family affairs and mass killings of real guns. Vito got Clemenza such a capable arm along the way, adopted and cultivated Tom Hagen such a perfect-minded family lawyer; and",

            "content": "Few Hollywood films succeed in presenting a second part that matches the first part of any successful film, as major production companies often take advantage of any film that achieves success and gains popularity to catch it with another part, but we rarely find attached parts that meet the same conditions for artistic success that led To the fame of the original part... The Godfather in its second part was one of the first films that broke this rule. Many critics and fans of this series consider the second part to be the best part on all levels... script, direction and performances.After the resounding success of the first part of the film, Paramount announced its intention to produce a second part, and many initially expected the failure of the project from its foundation and Coppola's inability to create the necessary ground for a strong scenario on which the plot of the film was based to match what was presented in the first part, but Coppola was able with the help of Mario Pozzo proved the error of expectations, when he was able to present an innovative scenario, in which the two screenwriters not only followed the film from the end of its first part and moved forward with the new godfather, but also returned the scenario to the past to illuminate the beginning of the path of the child Vito Corleone and the journey of ascension from Sicily to the leadership of families in New York ...in a scenario that managed to find many intertwined threads between the two pivotal stories... Michael's current story and Vito's previous story, and he blended the two stories in a distinctive way.Coppola started his movie where the previous part ended, to begin with us with an opening scene that focuses on the face of the new Don as he accepts loyalty and assumes the reins of family rule, before taking us far back .. this time to Sicily, to find a mother who loses her husband and her son in a story of revenge, and there is nothing left for her Only a young man desperately tried to save his life, before he met the same black Sicilian fate, and the boy found himself alone in the face of his destiny, which leads him across a ship crowded with immigrants to the Statue of Liberty .. Which gives him a look that sums up many of this boy's future aspirations and his quest to be a significant name In the land of opportunity and lost dreams.And as if it were a reminder of the glory of the Corleone family in the first part, Coppola takes us back to the present time with a big party in the family home, to see Michael behind his chair as Vito was, listening to people's requests and meeting various personalities of different degrees of importance...politicians, officers and senators in Senate. We do not glimpse in the eyes of the Don that confidence that we saw in the eyes of his father, the problems above the head of the young godfather from all sides.. The empire has not yet recognized its new emperor, and the Don must strike firmly to gain the high status that was for the previous Don.Michael and his family are exposed to an assassination attempt, and between his attempt to expand the family's influence across Miami and Cuba, and his attempt to find out who was behind the assassination attempt... The dramatic sequence of the story rises to its end... With a return to the past to see Vito in his early days in the Italian neighborhood of New York. Coppola gracefully moves us through the two stories with his clever use of flashback, stopping at specific points in the lives of both characters, and leaving the viewer in front of their reactions to the many similar situations they went through.Just as the director of the work provided the opportunity for many names through their roles in The Godfather in its first part, Coppola paved the way for the talent of Robert De Niro, an American of Italian descent, who demonstrated a strong presence before the Godfather, by appearing in \"Hello Mom\" with Brian De Palma, and in \"Despicable Streets\" With Martin Scorsese, and while Coppola was thinking of assigning the role of Corleone to Marlon Brando himself, he found the issue of giving the role to a young character the most compelling, and playing this role was a great challenge for De Niro, because introducing a character as Don Corleone as a boy was required in him It is very difficult as a famous character whose presence in the first part was only about a year and a year ago, most of her movements, accent and her raspy voice are still present in the minds of those who followed the first part, in addition to the difficulty of the young actor's position by placing him in comparison with a star of Brando's value.De Niro headed to Sicily before starting filming his role, and he stayed there for a while to be able to master the Sicilian dialect perfectly, especially that Coppola depicted all the ancient story of Vito from Sicily to the immigrant neighborhood in Italian to give the story more real dimensions. Indeed, De Niro succeeded in playing his role through two paths: the path of \"reincarnation\" of Corleone's character with its movements and stillness, and the path of \"creating\" De Niro's own touch. Coppola did not want De Niro to be just an ordinary reincarnation of the character of Vito, and De Niro excelled in presenting his character brilliantly, which earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 1974, to be the character of Vito Corleone, the first cinematic character to receive two Oscars for different actors.The role of Vito was a prophecy about what could be presented by De Niro, a prophecy that Martin Scorsese later picked up and embraced the talent of the young man to present with him works worth \"Raging Bull\", \"Taxi Driver\", \"Deer Hunter\" and \"New York, New York\".De Niro's overwhelming presence in the second part did not prevent him from noticing the high performance of Al Pacino when he presented the role of Michael in a different way from what it was in the first part, according to the requirements of the new phase of the text, that young officer no longer exists in the mind of the Don, and we no longer see The distraction in his eyes, on the contrary Michael's gaze seemed harsher. Despite the terrible challenges that the character went through by trying to kill her, or limiting her influence, or what she suffered from family problems - with his wife Kai -, Michael's character remained strong until the last moment, and despite the internal fracture that afflicted him after discovering betrayal The people closest to him.. but the godfather is the godfather, he should not bow no matter what the circumstances.Pacino embodied those facts brilliantly, and just as his role in the first season earned him a nomination as Best Supporting Actor, this time he received a Best Actor nomination. Supporting, this time he was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role.Coppola's parallel attention to all the details of the characters of his film gave the opportunity to stand out for everyone in their supporting roles, starting with De Niro... and passing through the almighty Lee Strasberg, who embodied the character of Hyman Roth, the two-faced Jew, the gentle old man on the outside, a thin shell that hides inside a monster that does not hesitate to do anything He gets to his point... and ends with Michael Gazou, who plays Pantangeli, the ex-godfather, who later breaks with the family before facing his last fate. Even Talia Shire, who played the role of Aunt Connie, took a wider space than the role she played in the first part. She was no longer that nervous, spoiled girl, she got older, and realized that she had no refuge but family and Michael, despite knowing in her heart that he had killed her husband Carlo.In the same Sicilian approach and with the same dreamy fluidity, Nino Rota presented very beautiful melodies, and with a high musical sense, for which Rota won an Oscar for best soundtrack.One of the most beautiful factors that gave the film its luster was the excellent cinematography through the ingenuity of photographer Gordon Willis in capturing that distinction and difference between the two eras that the film talked about. While he brings us back with an image that has a kind of sharpness and color contrast when he returns to the current story of the film...a small detail that Coppola carefully took care of, realizing that the success of big films is based primarily on the smallest details.It is an invitation to watch a second part that is as beautiful as the first part of this movie, if not superior to it in many respects.",

What makes the second part of the Godfather movies the greatest of the series, and ultimately the greatest movie of all time is the way it contrast and compares the America of the present (the 70's) with the America of of then. It shows the family rising to power under the dominance of Vito Corleone, while also showing the family's power and control crumbling as Michael struggles to live up to the legacy that was his father. While watching the movie, you can't help but be swept up by the history. Just the ambience of the movie is enough to make it great. Then you add in the tremedous cast, firm directing, and moving script, and you have the movie that surpasses all others to become the greatest of all time.",

His mother is shot in front of him and his facial expressions would make him seem like a facially catatonic schizophrenic. Not a single tear. Born psychopath? Despite him being portrayed as a person with heart for his loved ones, even if he has to go clich\u00e9 godfather on Alfredo... Ludonarrative dissonance by accident. The prequel part is an average execution at best, with some really cheap text explaining what should have been shown instead of what they kept in it to drag unnecessary scenery and ambiance. A lot of deleted scene worthy material. You could cut time a big amount by not stretching so many moments unnecessarily and instead give me an actual reason to connect to Michael in his early years. The useless time jumping instead going proper with the development in a timeline, because it doesn't matter for understanding the story any way it's presented, so why not just cut to the chase and save the jumpery and just properly go from start to finish? Oh yeah, because people think it makes for some actual understanding of the actions in the present if you blend in the past. Sadly watching the past first and then the present would have had given 1 to 1 the same understanding to the viewer. Also the endless burials and festival scenes. Side character scenes where no one gives a crap 5 secs later, because the effect, the reason the next scene has to be fueled with, with the action of the prior, is not always reasonable to even been shot. Especially so many scenes in the time they show Vito raising Michael. Vito having no job wasn't the reason to become what he did, the reason to bring the streets don down in COMBINATION of needing to care for Michael is a solid reason which could have been boiled down to a more efficient scene. It's draggy and in the good moments. Michael's bodyguard trying to kill Hyman Roth, but he is failing as the regime soldiers march in at the wrong moment. Instead the director decides to shoot the scene so fast you don't know if Hyman AND the bodyguard are dead or just the bodyguard. Instead you anticipate the next scene where it's explained by Michael saying Hyman survived. And it's always happening like that. Not to mention, yes, this tries to be mature as possible but seriously. All the empty threats of striking at the right moment etc, and failing miserably with such cringe worthy scenes such as hyman's assassination... give me a break. Whenever the movie tried a climax, it either dragged it, broke it or failed at it, even if it's intentional, it's not satisfactory. What the movie was best at: good actors, with good dialogue, good acting and good presentation. What it failed at: pacing, climaxes, proper resolutions (best one actually was when it was an abortion and not a stillbirth) and often more than not, some clich\u00e9s here and there with cringe worthy acting like with the character of Don Fanucci.",

It is one of the few films ever to have made an indelible mark on popular culture with it's script even being referenced in the tv mafia drama \"The Sopranos\". Al Pacino's performance is unbelievable emanating the coldness of death that is alluded to in the novel.  Pacino is able to build upon the script to make Michael Corleone one of the greatest characters ever seen on celluloid.  His performance alone is worth watching by itself.  Michael's ascent to the top of the mafia in America and his descent in his family is the essence of this film.  Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall are excellent with John Cazale giving notice of his immense talent which was tragically never fully realised due to his premature death through illness.  The script is itself magnificent particularly where Michael and Fredo are together in the family home, Hyman Roth's (Lee Strasberg) speech on \"who gave the order\" and Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) apparent first use of \"make him an offer he can't refuse\".  The script helps to make this film the natural completion of the \"Godfather\" saga.  The third film is an irrelevance in the company of two of the greatest film's ever made as it is only average.  There may never be a better film made or story written as \"The Godfather Part II\".",

The epilouge is excellent though with the court-case and final cold-blooded end for the weak willed Freddo.  DeNiro is magic here as the young Vito and thoroughly deserved his best supporting actor award, it was a difficult task to fill the enormous shoes of Brando's left behind from his unforegettable performance as the Don in the original but the young DeNiro was fantastic.  In my opinion, Robert may have been a better Michael than Pacino.  But it was still perfect casting the way it was.  A strong 8/10",

I understand that Chris Kyle did his job well. But that does not mean he should be honored as a hero. I love the United States. This is an amazing country. And so it bothers me when Hollywood portrays an American hero as someone who is willing to kill people without critically evaluating why they should be killed, who sees war as purely good versus evil, and who is hopelessly blind to the bigger picture. If there is ever to be peace in this world - heck, if we want to protect the US - we need to glorify people who are compassionate, who can put themselves in other people's shoes, and who act in ways that promote trust and love - instead of fueling the cycle of anger and hate.

Filmmaking has changed very much from the 70s and that is clear in this film, as it's slow paced to the point of stopping entirely at moments. Most of the time it worked but some of the time it dragged a little. Furthermore it's a very dialogue heavy film, meaning you need to pay close attention to everything, which in a three hour film is a little different at times. Despite this, it's clear why this is hailed as such a good film, as it's one of the best examples of the continuation of a story from its predecessor. It very effectively shows the struggles this man has with both maintaining g his reputation and his personal life and both performances by De niro and pachino show this struggle between the cold calculating side and the emational side.

            "content": "The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (\"Keep your friends close .....\", \"I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies\"), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.",

And then in 1974 came it's sequel/prequel The Godfather Part II which is EQUALLY as good, possibly better, than The Godfather itself. It scooped 6 Oscars including Best Picture, Director, and Supporting Actor (Robert DeNiro).Opening again with its mesmerising score by Nino Rota comes Michael Corleone taking a kiss on his hand, then revealing the throne, while Pacino plays it perfectly in one of films greatest performances. Then we are introduced to a marvel of sheer brilliance, flashbacks to the young Don Vito Corleone's time (played in Part I by Marlon Brando), involving brilliance after brilliance. The film continuously switches between the Vito flashbacks and the current time of Michael Corleone, before and after the time of the original film, and in each has a gripping and powerful story that pulls you in and doesn't allow you to escape. From brilliant storylines as traitors, break-ups and of course killings, The Godfather Part II is arguably better than Part I.Al Pacino is absolutely brilliant as Michael, this is possibly his best performance. And while Pacino plays his character like a God, Robert DeNiro plays young Vito uncannily similar to Brando's original Vito. Both give two of films greatest performances. Like many have said this must've taken a pact with the devil because I don't know HOW they could do something like this, something equally, maybe better, than the greatest movie ever made (in my opinion), and in itself possibly the greatest. And when the tragic end comes, you can't help but feel that you have witnessed more than just a movie.You have witnessed raw brilliance rarely acheived as great as it was here.",

The intertwined time line is genius. All actors do a good job and particularly de Niro.This film is slow. Very slow. 200 minutes in a steady pace. Thus, many viewers will fall out from time to time. This makes it difficult to follow the complex story. Unlike part I it's sequel also suffers from not having any dramatic highs and lows.

That aside, I'm pretty sure this is one of the best sequels that were ever written. It's a movie in itself, and I feel it goes much deeper than Godfather part I. The movie explores the dark side of being involved in crime, it's clearly more melancholy, it's again very atmospheric, especially New York in the yearly years of the 20th century. De Niro and Pacino are, as always, fantastic. They portray profound characters, scary and touching at the same time. It's 3.5 hours of sheer delight.",

The flashbacks of young Vito becoming a well-respected man building his empire compared with Michael, leading it into destruction, killing his brother, kicking out his wife and turning his own sister into a woman who is mistreated by men make great contrast. The beginning with the house and the family in total darkness, forced and fake happiness compared with the light hearted party in the first film where people are actually having fun, is just great. Going to Cuba and a greedy world full of Americans that cannot last forever, I just love. In the first film when he shoots his enemies it has got music and a sense of victory to it, while the murders in the second film feel sad and dark. How in the first film one of his goons shut the door on his wife, whereas now he himself shuts the door.\nWell, that is it, I hope you liked it.",

Also an extremely good performance by Robert de Niro as young Vito because Robert de Niro is a genius and i just loved it when he sliced the chest of Don Ciccio.All in all this is without doubt one of the greatest films ever made, with some of the best acting ever, which i will never grow tired of watching.",

            "review_title": "Not a sequel in the strictest sense...",
            "content": "*Attention Spoilers*There are two scenes in \"The Godfather Part II\" that completely describe the mastery and eloquence of this wonderful film. One scene is at the very beginning. I am referring to the party celebrating Michael's son's first communion. The music and atmosphere play in strict contrast to the beginning of the first film. In \"The Godfather\", the Corleone family was fully emersed into the Italian life. They were completely outside the American ideal, basing their lives on values learned through Sicilian experience and heiritage. The music during the wedding was Italian, even the food was Italian. During Michael's party in the second film, the music played is distinctly American, so much so that the pure blooded Italian, Frank Pantangali become upset and insulted by the whole presidings. He tries to get the band to play Italian music, and they rebel. He accuses Michael of ignoring his heiritage by moving to Las Vegas and drinking champaign (instead of the wine that Italians usually drink). The irony, is that Michael probably thought that ignoring his ancestory would help the family eventually become legitimate. Instead, by vacating everything thing that defines him, Michael becomes a castle among himself, a powerful man who is as hollow as he is evil.The theme here, is that the American capitalist system is in many ways more corrupting than anything ever seen previously. For example, in the first film, the villains (including Vito), although evil and corrupt, are still men of honor and take action based on this honor, no matter how misguided. There may be backstabbing, but it is, as many would say, strictly business. Michael in this film, by contrast, seems to have forgone any resemblence of these honorable traits. He kills men without any basis other than for the acquisition of complete power. He commits fratracide because he wants to destroy all those who have wronged him, even though he has done more harm to his family then Fredo would ever think of doing (especially to all those close to him: Kay, Tom Hagen, his children, and of course Fredo). But again, he's only working under the system he's entered into. This is clear when he negotiates with a corrupt Senator at the beginning of the film. This Senator clearly has no guidelines or values to follow, he only wants what many people in his position want, money and more Power. But Michael is smarter, and understands that having such a man as an ally is better than killing him. Vito, by contrast, probably would have had Luca Brasi put a bullet through his head for a man of his power treating others of similar status with such disrespect. Thus, there is no longer a showing of decorum in the American system, only crass \"directness\" and dishonesty. I think, the corruption in the American system is part of the reason why \"The Sopranos\" is so popular today. With all the scandals like Enron, many criminals in white collar society can screw people over, even their friends and get a mere slap on the wrist. In \"The Sopranos\", if you go against the Family you get wacked. Plain and simple.The Vito scenes in \"The Godfather Part II\" are used to contrast those of Michael. Yet, even though Vito's actions seem more honorable, he is slowly getting corrupted as well. It is clear, that killing the town boss was not a selfless act of a caring man. It was a power play, a way for Vito to acquire power himself, because just as he hated that boss, he strangely admired him as well. In a way, Vito loses his innocence the moment he witnesses the bosses power at the play, and continues on a dark path that Michael embarks and completes by the end of the film.My favorite scene in all \"The Godfather\" films is the scene at the end, where we see all our favorite characters (except Vito), some dead, at the table and Michael announces that he is going into the army. This scene is one of great sadness, because Michael was such an intelligent man that he knew what the \"life\" would mean to his soul. He knew that he would lose everything if he went on that dark path, and that is the tragedy...9/10 Grade: A",

            "content": "Francis Ford Coppola was in his prime as a director in the 1970s with  GFI and II, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now.  This is probably one of the best sequels ever made because like all good sequels (Empire Strikes Back, Rocky II, etc.) it borrows from the original but has its own unique story that is more than the recycling of former themes, structures and philosophies.Spoiler Warning.GFII tells parallel stories of the young Vito Corleone and of his son Michael.  Coppola does a good job of knowing when to flash back and flash foward.  We see Vito as an orphan coming to America, establishing his influence by killing the local Don, building up his business and getting his revenge on the Don who ordered the death of his father, brother and mother. Michael tries to legitimize the family business by buying casinos, creating ties to political figures and investing in the Cuban government which will become communist at the beginning of 1959.  We see his personal life deteriorating as there is an assassination attempt that his brother, Fredo, was somewhat responsible for.The lighting and music is great in this film.  I liked the acting by Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and especially Lee Strasburg as Hyman Roth.  It's a movie that could stand on its own.\nMost memorable scenes:  The images of the Statue of Liberty, the young Vito stalking Don Fanucci before killing him, Pacino's reaction to finding out Fredo is the traitor and later finding out his wife had an abortion, and the sequence that sees the death of Pentangeli, Roth and Fredo leading to a flashback that features men who have been murdered or alienated by Michael, except for Sonny.  Michael talked about not becoming a man like his father and years later we see he has become a much worser being.  He sits on a lawn chair and reflects upon the decisions and their consequences as the film fades darkly to the credits.",

            "content": "The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (\"Keep your friends close .....\", \"I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies\"), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle.",

However, having watched them back-to-back last night, then argued the relative merits with my friend, I have to say I disagree.Let's look at the evidence.  OK, so 'The Godfather' has better death scenes, better villains, James Caan and Marlon Brando.  These things are not to be ignored.  But 'Part II' is arguably more epic, and definitely more poetic. Here we get two films for the price (although admittedly not the typical length) of one.  And in these two separate storylines we get two immense performances.  At this time, it seems that if De Niro and Pacino were to share the screen, it would simply explode.Al Pacino and De Niro both transform themselves to celluloid legends. Pacino eminates a presence that was only hinted at in the first movie, as we watch him chillingly guard the interests of his family.  He visibly ages throughout the course of the movie, yet never loses his humanity.De Niro not only delivers a spot on young Marlon Brando, but develops Don Vito and gives him a subtle and wholly appropriate sense of humour: just look at the scene where nothing more than a knowing smirk is needed to cause a previously tyrannical landlord to lower his rent $10!At the end of the day, I just prefer the whole atmosphere of 'Part II'. What it may lack in the set pieces of its predecessor, it makes up for with its beautiful direction and cinematography, and an air of incredible confidence afforded by the success of the first instalment.",

However, having watched them back-to-back last night, then argued the relative merits with my friend, I have to say I disagree.Let's look at the evidence.  OK, so 'The Godfather' has better death scenes, better villains, James Caan and Marlon Brando.  These things are not to be ignored.  But 'Part II' is arguably more epic, and definitely more poetic. Here we get two films for the price (although admittedly not the typical length) of one.  And in these two separate storylines we get two immense performances.  At this time, it seems that if De Niro and Pacino were to share the screen, it would simply explode.Al Pacino and De Niro both transform themselves to celluloid legends. Pacino eminates a presence that was only hinted at in the first movie, and we watch him chillingly guard the interests of his family.  He visibly ages throughout the course of the movie, yet never loses his humanity.De Niro not only delivers a spot on young Marlon Brando, but develops Don Vito and gives him a subtle and wholly appropriate sense of humour: just look at the scene where nothing more than a knowing smirk is needed to cause a previously tyrannical landlord to lower his rent $10!At the end of the day, I just prefer the whole atmosphere of 'Part II'. What it may lack in the set pieces of its predecessor, it makes up for with its beautiful direction and cinematography, and an air of incredible confidence afforded by the success of the first instalment.",

But the thing in mafia business is that you can't trust anyone. So Micheal learns that you really can't trust anyone, not even your family. This movie is better than the first one because it also shows the story of Vito Carleone when he was young and how he built his empire, but the movie focuses more on Micheal's part than his father's role. I didn't like it as I wanted more of Vito. So Micheal who is now as powerful as his father and has made new enemies who want him dead. So he deals with them in a great way. He also faces some family drama and treachery. In this movie, life of Vito and Micheal is shown side by side and you can see the differences. Vito who becomes mafia by his own choice but Micheal was forced to involve in this business because of the family pressure. While Vito has many people to trust, Micheal has very few. The movie ends with a message that when you are involved in these types of things you always end up alone. Overall, this movie is great, fabulous acting by Al Pacino and other stars, direction of the movie was good.",

On the other hand i really enjoyed dumber and dumber and i would recommend watching that or anything with Will Smith in especially I am legend that is a great film.

            "content": "This Is good Movie. I like this movie very much. It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.",

            "review_title": "More of a stand alone epic. Either way a triumph",
            "content": "The Godfather, Superman, Evil Dead. There are textbook answers to the question of sequels that are better than the original. The sequel of The Godfather, though, is a very different project to the first, engaging in something so unfathomably far-reaching and ambitious, a story of such epic proportions, that if it had gone wrong, it would have gone WRONG. Instead, we have a rolling, multi-dimensional, poly-era masterpiece. We must not compare the two as it does not make the prequel any less formidable (as is often the case with a successful sequel) but it is worthy of standing alone but also being recognised as part of the saga. A rare position and a lucky one but it seems to rather deserve it.\nIn the first review, tribute was paid to those who claim to not like the first film. Tribute in the form of contemptuous scorn and disrespectful suspicion. Here it will be the same. Once again if someone says it is too much for them, or they like simpler films, or have a problem with the violence, etc and do not like it for those reasons, this is perfectly fine. However, any folk saying it is just not any good are not being honest with themselves. It is a spellbinding triumph of incalculable dimensions with timeless honourable merit and standard-bearing assumed by its creators. So, if this is you, get some therapy, and another film review. You do not belong here. For the rest of you, let us begin.Very differently we begin in Corleone, Sicily. We learn of the brutal instances that cause Vito to leave, alone and orphaned on a strange vessel, marked for death by a Mafia chieftain, headed for the New World. As he lands on what would become Ellis island, we see an understated but vital scene. Young Vito, a mute and barely eight years old walks in front of a crowd of fellow immigrants all staring at the Statue of Liberty. Vito also looks, but unlike his fellow boat-people, he is walking forward while looking up to the symbol of America while everyone around him stands still. The analogy does not take much figuring out.\nSmallpox quarantined, alone, and scared, for the first time, in his small single room with a table and a bed, we hear his voice as he sings to himself.\nTime leaps to his grandson, Anthony, many years later in Tahoe, Nevada, at the same age. The rise of the family under Michael (Al Pacino) has moved into politics, a naive senator tries to strong-arm. An entertaining piece. A series of events leads to a violent head, Michael leaves to find out who betrayed them and nearly cost him his life. Temporarily the illegitimate German-Irish lawyer and Michaels assumed brother, Tom Hagen is at the helm after being stepped-over in the first movie's climax.\nThings take hold in Cuba, in a story meant to mirror that of a true Mafia event, The character of Hyman Roth, played by acting legend Lee Strasberg is painfully obvious in its basis upon famous Jewish mobster Meyer Lansky. A capable but mute bodyguard accompanies Michael everywhere as he weaves around finding out who betrayed them, who paid them too, and how to come out on top in both the long term and in the Cuban dealAs happened in real life, history decides the latter as Cuba collapses under Bautista as Fidel Castro takes power and throws the Mafia out., The traitor is revealed and Michael must act, but how he acts will be determined by actions he must control. Back home a wronged subordinate, manipulated by Michael's enemies, turns government witness to a senate committee (once again drawing from an event of recent history). Michael must also outwit the US Senate, treachery is everywhere and duplicity is lurking.\nMichael uses his wit and cunning with typical aplomb to outwit and crush his enemies at a cost of maybe losing his family. His main betrayal coming from a source that troubles him for the rest of is life. He remains at the top and yet it is at a terrible cost.\nAs all this happens, the second unit story evolves. Young Vito played in breathless mystery by a spellbinding pre-embarrassment Robert DeNiro in post-WWI New York. For you young-'uns who see Bad Grandpa, Meet the Fockers, and Joker, you may wonder why he is so revered, and it is a good question. The answer, is probably more than anywhere else, evident here.\nA young Vito, a grocery boy, is made unemployed by a Black-Hand (a particularly ferocious offshoot of the mafia) operatives and thus christened into the crime world by that often-occurring phenom in these movies, the life-changing chance encounter. This time is with a jolly but lethal neighbourhood tough called Clemenza. From here he rises, using his quiet viper-like strength and ability to listen and not react. He rises to the top of New York and returns to his home of Sicily to repay those who forced him out. If anyone has not seen it, they should check the deleted scenes on YouTube for a more detailed explanation.The two parallels play together perfectly. The rolling camerawork of following young Vito across the rooftops of Little Italy as he pursues his quarry, interspersed with pyrotechnics and scenery from the Saint Genarro festival is something to behold. It shows that panoramic shots do not need to have half of Montana in the background and can even be poorly lit. All of the scenes of this section are dim and rather dusky and shot at close quarters. This is to express the claustrophobic nature of railway cold-water flats and tenement rows in early 20th-century New York. Somehow though, it has an epic feel too. In fairness, the cinematography of part II is way superior to the first installment, but that is possibly the way it is meant to be. The way a young colt of an experienced stud racehorse will have speed and strength its parents didn't, but all are remembered as fondly.\nA lot more happens in this installment. As mentioned, Cuba falls. Then the act of betrayal at Michael's home is far beyond anything seen before, and the brutal slaying of an innocent prostitute simply to aid a blackmail case by the fearsome Al Neri (Richard Bright) is an act far beyond the romanticised broad-Brooklynese movie-star, ferret-faced behatted mobsters of the first film. One of the moral criticisms is that it glorified the Mafia (a word never uttered in the film) and it led to a backlash against this romanticised image of mobsters only killing other killers and raining gold on the innocent. You certainly do not feel this way at the end of part 2\nIt is full of crescendo-like scenes. The music of Nino Rota is used to explain for those looking away. The camerawork is ambitious, for example, a scene in a courtroom where Michael uses a defendant's brother to silence him, is often praised, but I have always found it clunky and out of pace. I think trying for too many cuts and bustling tension is a bridge too far in a movie that is all about subtlety. For example, Connie wants the children to leave the room, they ignore her, although they are so very young, just a glance from Michael shows his power among all who he rules.\nParadoxically, we are shown that Vito does it differently, he gives people a chance to not fear him Take for instance, a quirky little comedy involving a reactionary landlord of a friend of Vito's wife is another testament to Nino Rota and his score. With a different tune it could have been terrifying, yet here it has a flutey Italian jig playing, so it is taken lightly. Michael never has such a frivolous sound accompaniment. His interactions have the whistling background of deep piano foreboding and in one of the most depressing scenes I have ever encountered, he returns to his wife, who is sewing and there is no love left. He gives no one a chance and is cruel, particularly to his step-brother, Tom, who is loyal beyond question.A very complicated movie that no-one could fully comprehend in one sitting. For the most part, there is no book to refer to (except for Vito's segment being part of the original novel). It deserves multiple watching, it is a towering achievement in modern motion-picture artistry that will provide food for all thoughts. At once it is both a soap-opera and a mystery. It remains never-bettered by imitators. This is mostly due to it has been, aside from the hilariously inferior Once Upon a Time in America, largely unattempted. Not being one to romanticise the past, it is daft to say it could never happen I truly hope it does as it would be some kind of film to watch.\nUntil that day\n9.5/10",

He does something that I have never seen any actor do, which is use his eyes to primarily show his intentions.

Reading the other numerous reviews on this site, one would think this is the movie of all movies. Well, perhaps that may be the case for some. But for the average movie goer to which this movie was made for, it was totally lacking compared to the first, original Godfather. There was not much for character development which made you feel distant to the characters. Too many scenes of unnecessary standing around with poor dialog that really needed a Brando type boost. I could not find that presence here at all. It was indeed a watchable movie with great cinematography and that classic look. Overall this movie seemed to abandon the gangster/mob genre and become more daisy drama. I think in the first half of the movie there was one gun scene and a mild at that. It truly dragged along carrying only the die hard fans of this saga and leaving behind a trail of dissatisfaction for those whom watched the original movie and expected epic type, early mob style composition.",

The cinematography in the film is fantastic, especially the scenes in Sicily, but that should not take anything away from the stirring and very moving sound track as well. The reason why I think this is better than the first Godfather film is the fact that we get to learn more about why Vito, michael's father, came to America, and how difficult it was to scrape a living in the era, especially for southern Italians who thought they would escape the mafia and poverty by emmigrating to America, only to find they had both already got there before them. Every time I see the scene when the ship arrives in New York, with the fantastic and very emotive score accompanying it, I can't help but cry my heart out, it just struck a chord. Please, don't just watch this film because of it's mafia content, because it has so much more to offer, not only with it's fantastic performances(De Niro particularly, as it's hard to speak Sicilian dialect at the best of times), but also because it gives us an insight in to why a group of people would want to leave their homeland.",

This movie gives a way better screenplay than most modern movies do, and it doesn't disappoint the viewer in any way.I never excepted a 70's movie that has so good story and narrative!My rating for the original was 10/10 and this one was way better movie, and it deserves an IMDB rating of more than 9.5/10.By far, the best Crime Epic I've ever seen in my Life!",

            "content": "Francis Ford Coppola's sequel to his original Godfather movie continues with the themes of greed, family and corruption whilst telling the tale of how an infamous mob lord's son handles the huge burden on his shoulders. (Don) Michael Corleone has changed vastly from when we first saw him at his sisters wedding in the original godfather. He no longer has the will to make a name for himself without having to rely on his background. He is still calm and calculating but with a more sinister feel and the feel of a man so powerful and brutal that he is feared by most people up to the point were his own family are frightened by his potential and he is left alone in his life which the ending symbolises. With the scenes of his father's past to give us an insight into the rise of the Corleone family and a further insight into the character of the original Godfather Vito Corleone. Michael makes wise investments in pre revolutionary Havana Whilst continuing with his business in the U.S some may argue the movie is giving a almost propaganda style view at communist Cuba. But if that was the case the American senators would be portrayed as straight politicians and not corrupt businessmen. So the movie ends with Michael delving into a brutal but yet cunning mindset up until the point were he kills his brother. There is no secret that he loves his family but the lengths he would go for them are terrifying. Michael ends the movie with his wife having left him taking his children. The ending shows how a young innocent men has turned to a point where he has alienated his wife and killed his brother. Fantastic film.",

            "content": "**SPOILERS**The opening scene is of Michael Corleone sitting in his chair in his office recieving respects from his advisors.  The scripts states this as Michael being \"in profile\".  He looks glumm and slightly stares down at them.  Then the title reveals the that chair he was sitting in.  An aspect of his life we have seen and preview.\nAt the beginning of the film, we get a view of the mafia that we didn't get in the first one.  Of actual Sicilians in Sicily.  This is probably the most brutal part and area of the hepacracy that is witnessed in the film.  Don Ciccio is an evil mafia cheftain, asumed to be into all sorts of corruption including inteferring with civilain lives (such as \"protection\").  When Antonio Andolini is killed for an insult made to the Don, he is of course killed.  His son Paulo, probably one to have give spiritual inheritence to Santino, swears revenge and of course is killed in turn.  Antonio's wife makes a reverent pleed to the Don to spare her last son, Vito.  He refuses with a simple and cold \"No.\"  Vito escapes as his mother is killed.  When he arrives in Ellis Island, he is given his name \"Vito Corleone\".\nIn Lake Tahoe, Navada, the Corleones have achieved wealth and are making their way.  A great celebration is made for Michael and Kay's son Anthony. Michael meets with a recsenting senator, who even made a nice a comment in a speech \"Anthony VYETO Corleone.\"  He refuses to submit a gsambling licsense to Michael at a reasonable and fair price.  When the meeting ends, Michael finally leads up to put \"My offer is this.  Nothing.\"\nKay is preagnant with a child.  Connie has had at least one other failing marriage.  Her next choice is mostly a complete stranger and anyone can see that the relationship will be useless.  Michael even puts in to his sister like he does in battle talk \"Connie, if don't listen to me, and marry this man, you'll disapoint me.\"  Michael truly is in the business he never wanted.\nMichael's intentions are to make a deal to own hotels in Vegas with long family friends Hyman Roth and Johnny Olah.  Roth coneects with the Rosato brothers who another long family friend Frank Pantangili despises.  So, he aks for the murder which is refuse.  Before Michael knows it, his bedroom is shattered by bullets from hitmen.  Thus brings us into the battle hyme.\n**SPOILERS**\nVito lives in New York City in a \"minature Italy\" area with his wife and infant son.  He is finally brought into something when Clamenza asks him to hide revolvers for him.  There is a local mafia family known as the Black Hand.  One of the main men and collectors is Don Funnucci, an evil \"protector\".  Because of him, Vito loses his job at a baker, but kin heartedly reponds to his boss with \"You've always been good to me and watched over me like a father, and I won't forget it.\"  When he arrives home, he is in fact enjoyed.  When he meets Clamenza, he rewards him by going into \"a friends\" house and taking a carpet for the apartment.\nWhen Vito and his friends' business in corrupted by Funnucci, Vito dfecides to make a go at it.  We get his line of ealier age \"I make him an offer he don't refuse.\"  Some of the best directing is put in when Vito goes into an apartment from the rooftop.  He has a revolver and a dinner cloth.  Vito unscrews the lightbulb and Funnucci taps it to get it back then soon discovers Vito.  Vito fires through the cloth.  Funnucci does't pay sattention to his attacker  He wrather examines the wound as Vito fires more ans soon the cloth is on fire.  He finally gives him a mout shot and escapes to the roof where he throw the cloth aout and destroys the pistol by breakng it into pieces and throwing them into chimneys and pipes.  An absolutely genious scene.\nWhen Michael discovers that his brother Fredo is the traitor adn gies him the kiss of death, we must be skcocked at the emotion.  The script, of course, is real tight and spreads a lot.  They finally pull themselves out of tight spot with a senate comittee by intemadating thei key witness Pantangeli with his brother from Sicily.  I've seen the film five times and there's there's still a lot I could probably pick up on.  Kay leaves Michael and informs him that she delaberertly termanated their coming child.\nVito takes his family on a trip to Sicily where he can expand hs olive oil business and take care of some certain matters.  When he makkes the visit to Don Ciccio, he show the respect of kissing his hand and respecting him verbally.  Then there's his line \"My father's name was Vito Andolini and this is for you!\"  He slices him accross the stomach.  Brilliant cene, of course.  Then there's that train trip back where he holds Michaells hand out to wave good-bye.\nAt the funeral of Mama Corleone, Connie says she'll stay closer to the family and convinces Michael to fordive Fredo who has been eliminated from the family as far as Michael is concerened.  there's the intensity of holding him and looking up at Neri who knows what's to be done.  Michael is determined to have Roth killed.  When Tom abjects he puts \"Tom, ya know you surprise me.  If one thing's certain.  If history has taught us anything, it's that you kill anyone.\"  Also there's \"I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom.  Just my enemies.  That's all.\"  Tom makes a visit to Pantangialli.  They talk about reference of the Corleone family being the Roman Empire.  Tom assures him \"Don't you worry about anything Franky Five Angles.\"\nIn Tahoe, Kay make a goodbye to the children.  Connie rushes her on account of Miachael who does show up and, like before, shuts her out at a doorway, now from her own family.  Fredo intends to take Anthony out on a boat ride to fish.  Anthony is called in to go to Reno, so Fredo goes alone with Al Neri.  Then there's the seguence like the one in the original with killings, only, of course, shorter.  Roth is to be handed over to protection at a Miami Airport and he give interviews.  Rocco, as a reporter impersonator gets close up and shoots him in the stomach.  Michael, being so nice and consederate, didn't bother at all tog ive Rocco protection and he was killed as well.  The FBI break open the bathroom door to find Pantangiali in the tub, filled with blood, dead.  Michael watches from the boat house as Fredo says his procedure for catching fish, a hail Marry.  When he finishes, we are closes on Michael and hear a shot ring.  Then we see Neri get up in the boat.  Michael then sits down.\n\"Hey everyone, pay attention this is my friend Carlo Rizzi.\"  The flashback is exactly what is needed for emotion.  It's the Godfather's birthday and the day or a few days after Pearl Harbor.  Sonny, looking for someone for his sister, introduces Carlo to Connie.  Then Sal Tessio comes in with a cake.  He referes to the men who have inlisted as \"A bunch of saps.\" Michael questions him and says that he quit school to join the Marines.  An innocent and patriotic man who had recentment for his family who put him in an infirmary.  Sonny and the others are shcocked and unpleased with this news.  As their father comes in they go to sing \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" while Michael sits alone at the table.  Then there's the scene of Michael eing held by Vito, waving good-bye to Sicily.  Finally, there's the incredibly pignant scene on him in his side yard being closed in on. Miserable and completely alone.  He will now not be forgiven (at least by a good part of the audience) and is truly more evil then ever.\nThe score, of course, is very emotional and filled with good compasition. Coppola got the oscar for directing he deserved this time.  Everything about the film is great.  The acting by Pacino and De Niro.  Cinemotagraphy Everything.  There's the great powerful paralax of a man arising to hope and being a hero to his people and there's the crookid,villainess successor who destroys what the whole matter of the particular orginazation was and was to protect.  Family.  This is an encrddible film and an abolute great sequel about a serious subject.",

            "content": "In its ten years of existence the \"Monsters on Vacation\" franchise managed to become a national hit, and its characters could be remembered not only by children, but also by parents. The cartoon series broke the classic notions about the characters of famous monsters and was a kind of satire on our troubled world. The famous animator Gennady Tartakovsky imagined the lifestyles of every monster as strongly reminiscent of human life, and so the situations of monsters and humans were similar: the head of a large family, Wolfych, was tired of work, and Murray the Mummy could not figure out the intricacies of romantic relationships.The main storyline was a family conflict between the vampire daughter who fell in love with an ordinary man, and her father, Count Dracula, who seemed too strange beloved. Raising topical themes made the first monster cartoon a success, which led to the release of several sequels. And if the second part held the bar of quality of the first film, the third became a failed sequel, which has lost the spirit of the first parts. The news that not only a fourth film would follow, but also a short film about pets, was hardly accompanied by hope for resurrection: it became clear that nothing good awaited this series anymore. \"Transformation\" was a kind of finale of the whole series, summing up the results of the previous parts. The plot centers again on a dispute between Dracula and his son-in-law Johnny, this time concerning the inheritance of the Hotel Transylvania itself, which Drac wants to leave to his children and retire. Johnny's succession is questionable: a popular place among monsters could be ruined in an instant. To gain the hotel owner's trust, Johnny decides to take the bold step of transforming himself into a monster with Van Helsing's magic beam. However, something goes wrong, and not only does Johnny become a monster, but Drac also becomes a human. To find an antidote, they must travel around the world together and finally find common ground. \"Monsters on Vacation: Transformation\" is a film that is unlucky in almost every way. First of all, it is worth noting that the film was supposed to be released last summer, but it was postponed for several months, and then it went straight to the online services. Another Sony animated film, Mitchells vs. Machines, had a similar fate, which only played to the cartoon's advantage. The problem of the impact of technology on human life was reflected in the real world, because many people watched the film on their gadgets. Here the situation is almost the opposite: \"Monsters on Vacation: Transformation\" is an adventure cartoon for viewing in cinemas during the hot summer vacations.It was also unlucky that the creator of the first parts, Gennady Tartakovsky, did not find the time to fully approach work on the final franchise. In \"Transformation\", he acted only as a screenwriter, and the duo of Derek Drimon and Jennifer Klusky (the authors of the short film about the pets who live in the hotel \"Transylvania\") were appointed as directors. Therefore, and jokes built on the visual uniqueness of the world, in the new part disappeared. And in general \"Monsters on Vacation: Transformation\" can hardly be called funny: the satire on the modern world is gone, and instead there are scenes about how the strong personality of Dracula is trying to break the conditions of the human world.The new part also lacked the charm of the main characters. Almost the entire old cast of monsters turned into pathetic caricatures: the Mummy took the image of an old man falling asleep on the move, and Frank became a brutal narcissist who brags about his muscles. There are also problems with the script itself, which simply brings nothing new to the table. The conflict between Dracula and Johnny from the first parts made its way into the fourth with little change: the differences between the characters were again an occasion for family arguments that only Mavvis is able to resolve. The lack of a field for new solutions became a tugboat for the development of old lines, so the transformation itself had no effect on the characters: Johnny is still a choleric, and Drac is a grouch who wants to find idyll in everything.The finale seems to bring the characters to the point where the picture began. Trusting Johnny, Drac gives the young couple the opportunity to rebuild the ruined Hotel Transylvania, but the youngsters create the same building, only changing the decor inside. Perhaps in this there are similarities with the cartoon itself, which remained a copy of the first parts, never becoming a logical finale for the entire franchise.",

But for me this is truly the best, and let me tell you why!First and foremost this is ACTING and DIRECTING at the highest level possible. You got Al Pacino, Robert DOE Niro, Lee Strasberg ( master of acting ), John Cazale and Michael V.Gazzo to be leaded by Francis Ford Coppola.The movie starts where \"original\" ends with congratulations to the new Godfather and then you are \"transported\" in Sicily 40 and some years in the past, where young Vito is with his mother at the funeral of his father that has been killed by the local Don. At the funeral Vito's older brother also gets killed so logical next one should be Vito, but that would never happened because Vito immigrates to New York. Meanwhile the movie shifts to Nevada where Michael ( Al Pacino ) holds the meetings between his business partners and enemies ( but hey,they don't know that )at his son's party! Then he is tried to be killed in his house, so he leaves everything to Tom's ( Robert Duvall ) hands and goes to Miami to fix this problem with his friend/enemy Hyman Roth ( Lee Strasberg ). At the end he fixes his business life and becomes even stronger as The Godfather but his private life is at rock bottom after his wife,sister,friends leaves him all alone at the top. On the other hand Vito ( Rober DOE Niro ) climbs to the top don in New York and he manages to do that and he is also respected as a person because he is man of his own words. At the end he goes back to Sicily to revenge his mother,father and a brother!This movie can't be put into words, you gotta watch at least couple of times to understand the meaning of this film.

As for the cast, Al Pacino is back in his role as Michael Corleone, now head of the family. Marlon Brando gave place to another film legend: Robert De Niro, who gave a performance almost as good as Brando's in the first film. Robert Duvall is back as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton reprises her role as Kay, and, thanks to Coppola, John Cazale (who had a regretfully short career) and Talia Shire had more screen time and gave brilliant performances.

If \"anyone\" can be assassinated, then I think Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Khomeini, Saddam, Bin Laden, etc... easily disprove that theory.

The audience is tortured as a first-person observer of the decline of the once great Michael Corleone. Coppola, via an excellent screenplay, brilliantly portrays how a life of crime, murder, and self-pity take its toll on even the most formidable of souls.  As Michael falls further and further from grace, eventually committing the consummate sin in killing his own brother, we can feel little sorrow for Don Corleone. The Godfather Part II is a brilliant examination of the human dilemma, making the audience face with brutal realization the effects of a seemingly fancy-free world encountered in The Godfather. Perhaps what sets this movie apart into the pantheon of classical lore is its contrast of Michael disintegrating the family with Vito's building its foundation of trust, honor, and respect.  Coppola so perfectly intertwines two staggering stories  that the movie becomes absolutely irresistable. Kudos go to Mario Puzo and Coppola for their exquisite writing, Coppola for his outstanding direction, and especially to Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.  With the strength of two amazingly gifted performers, we allow ourselves to be swept away in an orgastic viewing experience.  I consider this the best piece of American cinema to ever grace the silver screen.",

Drawing parallels between the initial growth of the Corleone empire under young Vito for relatively noble reasons, and the greed and corruption that brings the family close to self-destruction under Michael, the film takes everything that was great about the first movie and builds upon it.

From the beginning of the end, you can clearly see that this movie has no flaws! i mean there couldn't be any movie out there without flaws. Well thats wrong, this is the perfect movie! From acting, to directing, from the script to film editing and sound or visual effects, everything is perfect! This is probably one of the greatest achievements in cinema history! Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself! Coppola made some extraordinary movies such as apocalypse now, the conversation and now the godfather! but with godfather part 2's release, everything changed, i mean i though no movie could surpass godfather, and yet the part 2 did just that! Do me a favor, and if u have the chance to watch this, do it, but after you watched part 1 first! This is Coppola's greatest achievement, and quite possibly the greatest movie in cinema history! 10 out of 10",

            "content": "I'm a decade or so too young to remember the cinematic days of the first two Godfather movies, but I bet that when rumours of a sequel first began to circulate, many moviegoers would have doubted the need for it and would have had serious doubts over whether it could possibly do justice to the masterpiece that was the first film.Such sequel let-downs as Jurassic Park II and Die Hard II had sadly all become part-and-parcel of my 1990s moviegoing experience. The only rule of sequels which I was familiar with as I grew up was that they'd almost certainly get progressively worse from movie to movie. So, after loading the cassette for Godfather Part II, can you blame me for hitting the play button on my VCR with some trepidation?Yes you can! I should have known better. The Godfather Part II is such an outstanding movie that, in fact, to call it a sequel to the first movie does it little justice. Call me clich\u00e9d, but 'companion piece' is indeed the best way to describe it in relation to the first. In terms of scope and magnitude of its vision, I don't think it has a rival, anywhere.\nIt is also one of those movies in which every little department is so perfect, that without even one of them, you can imagine the whole thing collapsing.Nothing needs to be said that hasn't already been uttered innumerable times regarding the casting and their respective performances. Pacino and De Niro are simply mesmerising with Duvall, Cazale and Strasberg providing the rock-solid support. Coppola and Puzo's script charts Michael's moral demise so graphically, it almost pains you to think back to the squeaky-clean war hero presented in The Godfather's opening. As for the bold move to write flashbacks, they serve a hugely meaningful purpose throughout the movie and without them, the main storyline wouldn't impact half as much as it does. Nino Rota's music captures in just one theme (that which first appears as the young Vito approaches Ellis Island with fellow asylum-seekers) the grandness and sinking tragedy of this movie, and his incidental music is magnificent without being intrusive.Perhaps the greatest individual plaudit should be reserved for Gordon Willis's cinematography; It captures the mood of the film perfectly and he betters even his work on the original. In itself it could be labelled a Cinematographer's Bible. And anyone who has borne witness to that final shot of the movie will know exactly what I'm talking about, but for now, that's for my fellow sequel-doubters out there to discover. An unparallelled masterpiece.",

Not because of Vito's youth which is really useful for appreciating the Godfather - part I. This part really enlightens the first film and allows to understand many things untold in the previous one, especially the section in Sicily. But, may be compared to his father - and the parallel between the story of Vito and that of Michael along the film helps the comparison - Michael appears too hard, much more harder and less nice than we could have guessed from the first part. I also dislike and find strange, as a woman, some of Kay behaviors.

Al Pacino portrayed his character perfectly, and not just Al, everybody.The plot was more confusing than the first one, and you may have to watch it more than once to get it, but of course I didn't mind watching it again. This one focuses more on Michael's relationship with family and friends rather than business (however, business was still a major part of the plot). We also go back into the old days when the original Godfather was just a young man, and we see how his character developed into the person he was in the first movie.I didn't pay too much attention to the music in this one, partially because I was too busy trying to figure out what was going on. However I'm sure it's great...Cinematography and effects. Once again, camera work is out-standing. And like the first movie, the action scenes were in good taste, and the death scenes were relevant to the plot. I explained this in my review of the first movie, so I don't want to repeat myself too much. The balance between dialogue and action was a bit heavier on the dialogue side this time.

Now, a couple of years later, and far wiser, I must say that in my humble opinion, that Godfather Part II is just a little bit better than the first. Again, the same cast is here, save for the characters who passed away in the first chapter. Once again, I believe that the actors gave unscrupulous performances, some far better than they gave in the first Godfather. Talia Shire, for example: sure her character gets a lot more screen time in this one, however she seemed much more grounded and into character in this sequel. Al Pacino completely takes Michael Corleone to a completely new and fantastic level, completely making a 360 degree turn from the Michael we first met as a Marine Corps Captain who wanted nothing to do with the family business. He actually becomes a feared and somewhat hated character in these movies. In this sense, hated is not a bad thing. You want to hate him for killing his brother. You want to hate him for the way he treats his wife. The dramatic turn of events between Michael and Kay is so powerful it is awe-inspiring. And how can you not love the story that is also being told at the same time of a young Vito Corleone? A marvelous performance by a young Robert De Niro, who brings to life the beginnings of who would become the unquestioned lord of legalized crime. De Niro is marvelous, and the only actor who could have possibly pulled it off better is Marlon Brando himself, but for obvious reasons could not play this role. You see a young Vito witness the deaths of his mother, father, and older brother and escape from the local crime boss in Corleone, Italy on a ship bound for America. You see him as a young man, graciously losing his job because he had to be let go, and then gaining friends and earning respect whenever he himself kills the \"Black Hand\", a figure in the New York slums who took full advantage of his high position. The reason I believe this movie is better than the first is only because of the more complex story and the dramatic, bittersweet climax of the characters. This movie is truly brilliant, and it is a very close call between this one and the first which one is the best. Truly beautiful.",

Otherwise, the film has several unresolved twists and forced situations, which keep lingering even after it ends. Michael (Pacino) is almost a psychic man who can read tiny almost invisible cues and understands what is in the future from mere observation of other's interactions. He plans ahead of everyone double his age, and removes hurdles from his path often before they are exposed. With the help of Tom (Duvall) he plans murders and defamation (senator in the brothel) and evades legal committees with unusual ease and adeptness which seemed pretty unreal. Same goes for Vito's first murder, it was rather coincidental that Fanucci's family was absent on that day, and Vito's gunshot noise was exactly timed to be masked by the firecrackers, even when Fanucci clearly saw his assassin and could have counter attacked if the shooting was late by seconds. Or when Vito murders Ciccio, how his knife travels across the ribs, and how can he escape so easily from Ciccio's own house with a wounded gunman on the back of his car.The movie lacks reality in several places, but there are some touching scenes like the flashback with the brothers during the end, or how baby Sonny cries on the rug that his father robbed for the first time. Or when Vito thanks his employer and refuses the gifts and comes back home to his wife after getting fired, and of course the strong sepia tone all over, which make this film stand out from the rest.But I am sure, real life gangsters should not be so lucky as Michael or Vito Corleone were in this film.",

            "content": "The Godfather II is not really a movie about the mafia. The themes that run throughout the film are of power,corruption of power and family. Coppola expertly tells the parallel stories of a father and his son with the use of flashbacks and flashforwards. He simultaneously shows how the father builds an empire and how his son subsequently unwittingly destroys it. The scenes involving the son Michael Corleone are very serious in nature,whereas the scenes involving the father,a young Vito Corleone, are presented in a more jovial manner.Before a flashback or flashforward, Coppola uses an effective technique of having children or the mention of children in the scene in order to emphasize the generational link through children. The flasback scenes are also photographed using different methods of lighting to contrast the different moods.Metaphorically, the story of the Corleones parallels the rise and subsequent corruption of America. The ultimate symbol of America in the form of the Statue of Liberty appears throughout the film. The assassination of Hyman Roth the jewish Mafia chieftain, is eerily similar to the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald the alleged assassin of President John Kennedy. Coppola effectively uses symbols such as the orange to represent evil. Several scenes show characters that do evil holding an orange (the fruit being a biblical symbol of evil).In an early scene Johnny Ola an emissary for Hyman Roth brings an orange to Michael Corleone from Miami. In a flashback scene, Don Fannucci (the black hand), is seen handling an orange before his demise. Michael Corleone is eating an orange as he plots the murder of his enemies. Coppola also uses catholic religious rituals as backdrops in major murder sequences. As Vito Corleone murders Don Fannucci there is a religious procession on the street. As Michael's brother Fredo is being murdered he is reciting the Hail Mary prayer. In the end Michael loses his soul and family to maintain his power. A great film by a talented director.",

            "content": "The Godfather part II is by far the best sequel ever made.  Francis Ford Coppala did a great job of directing this movie.  Al Pacino will always be known as Micheal Corleone to me and I don't see how he didn't win the Oscar for best actor.  Robert DeNiro also did an outstanding job playing the young Vito Corleone.  It is amazing to watch Micheal Corleone evolve from a young, unassuming war hero who knows nothing about the family business to the cold, ruthless Don we see at the end of the movie.  My friends and I have debated on wheather or not Fredo had to die.  My friends all say that Fredo was too dumb and careless therefore he had to die; I feel that Fredo had learned his lesson and was content on being a good brother to Micheal and a good uncle to Micheal's children.  Anyway, the Godfather part II is by far one of my favorite movies of all times and I strongly recommend it along with part one to everyone.  I was very disappointed in the Godfather part III so for me the Godfather concludes at the end of part II with Micheal sitting on the bench thinking back on his life.",

Also, I thought that scenes between Michael and Fredo were among the best i've seen.

The film is both a prequel and a sequel at the same time, not only developing the characters more, pushing the lore forward, and improving on the first movie, but also making the first movie even better. It is likely the greatest sequel to have ever been produced. I have literally no faults for this movie.The editing is perfect, seamlessly weaving between two different eras, and effortlessly sucking the viewer into this complex, dark, yet beautiful world. Gordon Willis' cinematography is just as good if not even a little better than the first Godfather film, with it inventing the \"flashback look\".The story is tight, yet dense with material, filled with thought provoking and profound themes, engrossing family drama, powerful and relevant social commentary, and extremely fleshed out and memorable characters.The acting is on par with the first film as well. Al Pacino gives possibly the greatest acting performance in cinematic history. The fact that Pacino in this role can scare me more than 90% of most horror movies I've seen is just absurd to me. Pacino absolutely masters the art of acting with his eyes, and gives easily his greatest performance ever. The rest of the cast is great as well from Diane Keaton to John Cazale to Robert Deniro (who won an oscar for his sublime performance) to Robert Duvall, and others.This music as well is brilliant. I don't even know what to say about it apart from that. The score that plays during Vito's life is amazing and memorable while the score that plays for Michael is haunting.This movie is my favorite ever, and for good reason too.",

            "content": "It doesn't happen very often, but now and then a sequel - if you can call this film such a thing - ends up improving upon the themes and dramas of the first film. In this second slice of Corleone murder, intrigue and family ties, one misses Brando for about five minutes, and then Pacino takes the screen in what must surely be the finest piece of acting he has ever done. An Oscar for Scent Of A Woman? Typical blindness on the part of Academy voters, because Pacino blows everyone else away with just a look of hatred and coldness from his eyes, and by the way he reacts on the screen. By the end of the film he looks like a 20th century Richard III, complete with a blood-red shirt and a pale, almost lifeless face. Coppola, already scoring points that year for his excellent conspiracy drama, The Conversation, delivers what is, in my opinion, the best ever film made between the years 1970- 1979. In short, from start to finish, this film is totally mesmerising. DeNiro steps into Brando's shoes as the younger Don in a wonderfully evocative recreation of New York in the early part of the century, and yet come his last scene you will have no problem in believing that this will be the man who, in twenty years time, would grow up to be Marlon Brando in The Godfather. Twenty-eight years of meatier gangster flicks (Goodfellas, Once Upon A Time In America) have failed to erode its power and undeniable genius. This is because The Godfather part two is like every other classic work of cinematic art - it never ages and its power will never fade. Alas, a third part helped to remove some of its shine, but only a tiny part. A third chapter wasn't really nessecary - The story of Michael Corleone ends right there - on Lake Tahoe.Movies like this come round once every decade, so do yourselves all a big favour and sit down for 200 minutes and indulge in a brilliant movie experience. You'll thank me later!10/10!",

In the movie Michael is trying to make his family strong, while trying to kill off his enemies. When in attempt is made on Michael's life he tries to root out the traitor in his family, who turn out to be his older, but less capable brother Fredo. The story is well done; Michael tries to hold his family together, and in doing so, resorts to violence. This dynamic is especially present when Micheal is eliminating all his enemies, and in doing so, decides to kill Fredo. The story has intrigue, drama, and violence which makes the movie both intriguing, yet questionable as it portrays the distinct morality of the Corleone family. Al Pacino continues to be a be an exceptional actor; he has the perfect mix of paranoia and fury when faced with certain situations. He asks friends and family questions to test their loyalty, and is shaken when he discovers that his child was aborted. The flashbacks of Vito are a good method to compare Micheal and his father, who he tried to be like. Robert De Niro is also a great actor, capturing the mannerisms that Marlon Brando had in his role as Vito. Though the flashbacks provide an interesting look into the Corleone family, they do take away from the focus of Micheal's story. All-in-all the film is a impressive and fitting sequel to the first movie.",

It is as wrong as saying that the paintings of Renoir are better than those of Rubens because Rubens' women are naked and just don't care about it. We don't need moral education by film directors. What filmmakers can give us is examples of what life (and death) can be. Only bad artists (like almost every Hollywood director) judge their characters. Coppola does not.Michael, on the surface, is more cold and remorseless than Vito. But he has no choice, because he is also under a much higher pressure than Vito. His face has a pasty skin, almost yellow. The constant worrying about his family and business makes him look sick and exhausted. He is a man on the peak of his power (on the peak of the whole family history), but it is eating him up. That is why I saw him not only as a frightening but also as a pitiable man. Take the scene when he comes home from Cuba, sitting on the sofa and refreshing his eyes with a wet towel while hearing his wife has \"lost\" their child. Or when he watches Kay sewing and refuses to go kiss her. His loneliness is overwhelming.But is Vito really a more warm-hearted, more \"social\" person than Micheal? E.g., young Vito lies without hesitation to his pals (Genco, Clemenza), if he can derive an advantage from it. His generous favors for his neighbors have the only purpose of building up a network of dependants. Typical for Vito (standing for the mob in general) is to use \"friendship\" for business, because to him the main things in friendship are obligation and debt - and not goodness and leniency. These are reserved for the family only. In this, Michael is his pupil, who merely expands these principles from neighbourly help into dimensions \"bigger than US Steel\". There is one single thing that Vito would not have done, as Michael knows: kill his brother (\"Mrs. Corleone: But you can never lose your family - Michael: Times are changing.\"). And this is the only time he is in doubt what to do.But Michael *is* a complete different man. He reflects about his life and position in a way Vito never would have done. Vito acts by instinct, like a predator, while Michael is a modern manager, adopting elements of the culture of his homeland, with a WASP wife, army service and so on. Michael has *decided* to become a mobster, for the sake of his family, and is it with great effort and unprecedented success, while for Vito it is simply in his nature. That this permanent strain is far more wearing, sickening, seems to be clear. Therefore the change in Michael's character from Part II to III is not plausible to me. At least it should have been made more clearly *how* he became so gentle and well-balanced.In German literature you can find a story very similar to this: in the novel \"Buddenbrooks\" by Thomas Mann, which has nothing to do with crime...",

Also in another scene where he is picking up the kids from Kay he gives this look to Kay which such a vicious look without saying a word.These are just some of the examples of Pacino's great acting in this. Another aspect that I love about this movie is John Cazales role as Fredo Corleone. We got a view of Fredo in the first movie and it left us wanting more and we did get more in this second movie Cazale plays his role to a T and he makes you feel sorry for his character during the latter of the film.

            "content": "The Godfather Part Two opens right where the The Godfather left off. Nino Rota's masterful and romantic score whispers off in the distance. The screen fades in from total darkness, pure emptiness. We see a focused man sitting stoically in a leather bound armchair. Darkness expands around him on all sides. This man is Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. Around him his associates kneel, showing their utmost respect. Michael is being crowned the new Don of his family. In the last film, his father, a powerful New York mob boss, had passed away, requiring Michael to now lead his family. With this action, Michael is closing the door on his old life and returning fans are quickly reacquainted with this epic tale.The Godfather Part Two was left with the task of filling an extremely large pair of shoes, as its predecessor is considered one of, if not the greatest, film of all time. The second film does surprisingly well in accomplishing this enormous undertaking. With its stellar combination of all elements that make a film great, The Godfather Part Two easily works its way into the discussion of the greatest movies of all time.This film effectively flips back and forth between two different plots in two separate time periods. After being reintroduced to Michael, we are immediately transported to the beautifully recreated island of Sicily at the turn of the century. We are then shown a young Vito Corleone (Andolini), Michael's father. We are also told that Vito's father was recently murdered and that his brother has fled to seek retribution, leaving only young and timid Vito and his mother. Vito's innocence is exemplified by the quietness and minimal dialogue in this opening scene. Quickly after, we are informed that his brother has also been killed by the same man and he and his mother go speak to the mob boss that has committed these acts. In attempting to plead with the local boss, his mother is murdered and Vito flees to New York. Once in New York, the plot documents Vito's exciting rise from a poor Italian peasant into one of New York's most powerful mob bosses. He overthrows the current boss, and he along with his friends, put themselves into power. During this portion of the film we are introduced to younger versions of characters from the first film, such as Peter Clemenza and Mama Corleone, Vito's wife. Throughout this tale, Vito also seeks retribution for the murders of his family. The final words he utters to his families killer are, \"My father's name was Antonio Andolini\u0085 and this is for you\u0085\" This event show Vito's rise to power coming full circle.Interwoven between this story is also the tale of Michael Corleone's personal struggle. He struggles in keeping control of his family and also trying to legitimize his business ventures, involving such groups as the US Senate. In this plot we see the development of Michael from the timid young man he was in the first movie to the true face of evil he becomes. Al Pacino's beautiful performance, such as his soulless glare and heartlessly delivered dialogue, accent the corruptness in his character. We also see his life slipping away from him in many different ways because of his terrible actions, most specifically the act he commits towards the end of the film. This final scene shows the completion of Michaels's transformation into pure evil. The plot ends with one of the greatest climaxes in modern cinema.Even without the legendary Marlon Brando at the helm, this film still contains one of the greatest ensemble casts of all time. Al Pacino, now at the fore-front, is supported by the likes of Robert DeNiro as Vito Corleone, Diane Keaton as Kay Corelone and Robert Duval as Tom Hagen, to mention a few. Every character has an added depth due to these talented actors' ranges. This phenomenal cast makes the viewer care about family aspect of the film and believe that all of these actors could truly be related.Though a long film, totaling over three hours in length, excellent pacing keeps the viewer interested at all times. There is never a truly dull moment in the plot. The expanded run time allows for a more complete tale to be told. Also, exceptional editing mixes both plots together. I disagree with Roger Ebert when he says the two plots, \"\u0085provides for itself a structural weakness from which the film never recovers\u0085\" I think the two plots strengthen the movie as a whole. Over the course of the movie, the viewer is never confused and the plots never seem to run over into each other.Francis Ford Coppola and Gordon Willis continue their partnership as director and cinematographer to create one the most visually compelling films of all time. In discussing Willis's cinematography, Vincent Canby of The New York Times said, \"The photography by Gordon Willis, so effective originally, is now comically fancy \u2013 the exteriors are too bright and glowy while the interiors are so dark\u0085\" He is discussing Willis common use of darkness in his shots. I feel that Willis's continued use of his dark and shadowy style adds a deeper emotion to every scene. Coppola's dynamic choices on shots contribute to the sensation in scenes, even ones with very little dialogue. Together they beautifully recreate settings such as Sicily, Las Vegas, Miami and Cuba.The Godfather Part Two surpasses all goals that it set out to achieve. Its stellar cast highlights one of the best written tales of family and honor in the history of cinema. It is hard to define The Godfather Part Two as purely just a gangster movie. It is much more easily defined as a masterpiece. Combining all of the elements that produce a great film, the team behind The Godfather Part Two created one of the greatest movies of all time.",

            "content": "'The Godfather' is an excellent movie. It displays the flip-side of the American dream, personal struggles to hold onto family values in an ever-changing world, and taps into the ultimate beauty of human relationships, even between the worst people. I saw 'The Godfather' a year ago, and thought it was superb. I do not, however, feel that it was is good as 'Citizen Kane' or '2001'; I just don't feel that it's a pinnacle of American filmmaking, and have always been puzzled by its credit as such. I just finished 'The Godfather, Part II', and now I understand. I enjoyed the first film, but this film left me stunned. The complexity and beauty of the emotions on screen were impeccable. The performances were among the finest ever committed to film, Mr. de Niro deserving special mention. This film doesn't go for easy answers, and doesn't pander to its audience: it is, in my opinion, the ultimate drama film. Perfectly nuanced screen writing and utterly superb direction give the impression of watching real life unfold in a setting designed for drama. The power of Al Pacino's performance didn't sink in until I realized that I'd been watching the credits roll for five minutes, thinking about his enigmatic facial expressions. I won't give anything away, but be ready for shock. People tease around the idea that this film is better than the first. They say it, but then back away, muttering about Marlon Brando. They think it, and then rub their hands together, considering Sonny Corleone. Well, I appreciate all other opinions, but I'll just say it: This is better than 'Goodfellas'. This is better than 'Scarface (both of them)'. And, finally, most controversially, this is better than 'The Godfather' This is the greatest gangster movie ever made, and the quality of this film validates the international acclaim of the duo. PS You may have noticed I haven't mentioned the third film. There is no third film. Seriously. Never happened.",

He said a few ramblings that I understood, but the rest a nothing but a made up language made up to be Italian...then again, since I do have Sicilian friends, agreed with me. Sicily, a part of Italy, has its own dialect, but I never have heard it though. Since I have two close Sicilian friends, they really don't talk about their dialect. But if you ask me...if young Vito spoke a dialect, how come the children didn't speak the same dialect, especially in the Sollozo/McCluskey meeting Michael scene. Sollozo di speak the Italian I know, and Michael also spoke it well enough and understood it well enough to understand Sollozo so McCluskey wouldn't understand what they were talking about. Also an addition to Michael in Sicily when meeting Apollonia's father that he wanted to meet his daughter. He could have used the Sicilian dialect. Because according to on of my buddies, they are taught in reality two languages: Italian and Sicilian. In this case, Deniro could have practiced Italian a bit harder, the language itself is not difficult to speak and pronounce. But what irks me the most is butchering a beautiful language like Italian.",

            "content": "As a huge fan of the Godfather series, (yes I even like part three) I have to say that part two is my personal favorite. Part one shows us the title of Godfather being passed from Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to his son Michael (Al Pacino).The second film begins with Vito as a young boy being smuggled out of Sicily after his entire family was murdered by the local mafia. Then the story re-joins Michael in his now powerful position as mafia Don, and head of the Corleone family.The film is divided into sections of the present-day story of Michael trying to gear the family to bigger deals in Cuba with his fathers old partner Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) while also dealing with the uprising of the Cuban rebels; and the betrayal of his brother Fredo (John Cazale). One of the great scenes is when he gives Fredo the \"kiss of death\" at the New Year's party.The other section of the film is comprised of a young Vito (as played by Robert De Niro) making his way in old town New York. It shows his way up the organized crime ladder, making friends and connections that would later (and earlier) carry the story.Francis Ford Coppola delivers masterful genius in this epic reprisal of a gangster classic. He uses soft, brown textures and dull sepia tones to perfection. The lighting has yet to be duplicated in any film. The way some of these shots are framed have been studied in film schools the world over. In short, if your looking for the epitamy of cinematic enjoyment mixed with that good ole' classic gangster violence, this is the movie for you. I would recommend it to anyone.",

Michael Corleone, helmed impeccably by Al Pacino, now has a face creased by a mask of implacable hatred \u2013 his character arc now much more refined and polished as Francis Ford Coppola explores his newly formed salivation for power.Once again, Coppola encompasses the sizzling world of Italian Mafia perfectly, but now with much more stunning narrative flourish as the audience delves deeper into the roots of the Corleone family. The transitions into Vito's early life are sublimely entertaining and masterfully executed, especially the opening scene of Vito's mother's death which immaculately sets the tone for a controlled and layered film. Not only this, but the explicitly violent vengeance by Vito towards the end of the film is directorial genius as Coppola presents a complete, impactful and invigorating tale of Vito in the most astute form imaginable.However, it would be wrong not to mention the contrast in exhilaration between the subplots of Vito compared to Michael, with Al Pacino's story arc being far less entertaining or interesting (although it does have its fair share of enthrallment, including his tantalizing riff with Fredo). The absence of defining action or hard-hitting set pieces in the third act of Part II, with Coppola refraining from grandeur, and focusing more on the characters, is what sets the film apart from perfection, but it would be criminal to deny the brilliance of this film",

The original movie on its own is cinematic brilliance delivered at it very best and has a cult following since generations. The second one however, is an inch even more perfect. May it be young Michael (Al Pacino) filling the boots of his infamous yet benevolent father Vito, may it be the portrayal of young Don Corleone played by Robert De Niro who is flawless at his job and may it be the transition of events before and after the movie, it all falls perfectly in place. It's also De Niro's first academy award win pretty reminiscent of the fact he subtly carves out Vito's early life struggle in America, his abandoning of his natives in Italy and rise to power in America. Diane Keaton (Kay) plays a woman who feels oppressed being a part of a family that is a part of a notorious criminal conglomerate. Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen) plays a shrewd advocate who is also the consigliere to the family. John Cazale (Fredo) plays the passive push-around as he was in the prequel but has more depth and purpose to his character. Overall it has more than what any ordinary Mafia based movie can offer. It shows the struggle of power to be the very best, and eventually the realization that the top spot isn't a single persons affair and knocking down your counter part by cunning and treacherous means is the only way to hail supreme in the business. And yes, all this coupled with a perfect setup to the post independence american scenario while reminiscing Vito's early days. I'd go for eleven even if i entitled to do it for only a single movie.",

Unfortunately, it also means the glaring faults of this flick are all the more obvious with each viewing. This film contrasts the rising nationwide fame and influence of Michael Corleone, a more cold-blooded version of his brilliant father Don Vito, with the early life of Don Vito and the beginnings of the Corleone crime family. Problem is, even though Robert De Niro's portrayal of Vito is brilliant, to be honest, we don't care. The current situation in late 1950's Las Vegas is more interesting and faster paced, making the retro turn-of-the-century scenes anti-climactic and an unwelcome break in the real action. More flaws abound. An assassination attempt against Michael is blamed on two different parties at once, and we are left wondering which one Michael really thinks betrayed him. When Michael finally tells Fredo, we are left wondering if he's telling the truth, when I think we're supposed to be fully aware at that point. Michael always knows a lot more than we do, and that's a problem. Hyman Roth could have been a great movie villain, but nothing he does or says in this movie makes any real sense. Again, his motives are murky, and he knows more than we do. Is he motivated by revenge for Michael's killing of Moe Greene? or by greed? we're never sure. His health is so bad, we might believe he should retire, but why he doesn't is left unclear. There are several major choices made by characters in this movie that I didn't buy. One by Michael, one by Fredo, one by Kay. Of them all, I'm most inclined to buy Fredo's, but even then, the flick doesn't explain it properly. At the end of this flick, as a result of Michael's choice, Connie should have a very emotional reaction, similar to her final scene in the first film, but Coppola, inexplicably and unfairly, robs her of that. The film ends before we can see it. I think there was a constant tug-of-war between Coppola and Puzo that resulted in these issues. The first flick was a direct adaptation of the book, but there was no book this time around. The purpose of this flick, which it accomplishes to a certain degree, is to show Don Vito building a family and a life in America, and his cold-blooded heir Michael destroying it. If the plot threads had made more sense, this could have been a great film.",

            "content": "Is The Godfather Part II better than the first film?  It is difficult to decide, but there is no disputing that these two films must always be considered together, as part of a greater whole.When first I viewed both parts, I was a teenager.  I found the first film to be much more satisfying.  My initial argument was that part I covered a longer period in less screen time, and was therefore better-paced and more interesting.  Since then, however, my opinion has changed somewhat.I was able to see both films back-to-back a couple of years ago, and found that Part II really had moved up in my ranking.  I have heard the argument that part I ended with Michael's full corruption, and therefore didn't need to be sequelized.  However, I feel Part II is much more the second half of the story than just an overlong epilogue, as some people say.While THE GODFATHER: THE COMPLETE EPIC (parts I & II chronologized) is a good telling of the story, this film is stronger for the juxtaposition of Vito's rise to glory with Michael's fall from grace.  To watch for six and a half hours, only to see Pacino's Michael turn from the young, optimistic, \"It's my family, Kay.  It's not me\" boy to the cold, lonely man who has just had his own brother murdered, it is one of the most affecting transformations in film history.  In the third film (unnecessary and inferior, to be sure, but not a bad picture), the only truly moving scene is Michael's confession in the garden, which refers to the events of Part II. The end of Part III is even a pale copy of the final 1959 scene in Part II, with Michael on the bench, surveying his dying empire.The final scene in Part II, the flashback to Pearl Harbor day, is perhaps the most touching reminder of the man Michael once could have grown up to be, especially after seeing what he has become: fatherless, brotherless, and without his estranged wife and children.  And ultimately powerless.  A beautiful elegy for a life that could have been.",

            "content": "You know, in my opinion, in order to write a decent review for a film of the scale of The Godfather: Part II, you need to lie on the mattress for at least a day or two and draw on all your inner writer's reserves. But what to do if, against the background of the difficult modern life, which is in full swing, there is no time to conduct any fundamental research, and God has deprived God of literary talent? And there is nothing but naked enthusiasm, mixed with movie fanaticism, available. And the film is hooked, but to pay tribute to him, oh how I want to! This is where amateur reviews like mine are born. So do not judge strictly, dear friends, for what will be written below.Right away, I think it's worth shooting in the direction of honorary, more deserved than ever, but at the same time too stamped (by the way, about stamps: the title of this review is my little whim) and template titles: \"Kinoclassika\", \"Masterpiece world cinema\" and \"Reference crime drama\". All of them are quite reasonably used by several generations of viewers and critics, so activating these levers of influence on the reader now is a rather pointless exercise. We (most of us) already know that this is a great movie, therefore, we can do without intrusive accents.I happened to read a wonderful novel by Mario Puzo and, one might say, firsthand, I am familiar with the fact that fragments of the book, which were not included in the previous film, were used, dedicated to the formation of Vito Corleone (Andolini at birth) in inhospitable New York in the first quarter of the twentieth century. They added the original script to the adapted script and got something from the \"two in one\" category. At the same time, flashbacks from the life of Vito Corleone are extremely organically woven into the narrative around Michael Corleone in the late 50s of the twentieth century. Father and Son, the Rise and Preservation of the Corleone Empire. Probably, it was possible to give two screenwriting Oscars at once.Everyone knows that before the amazing \"Heat\" and obscure \"Right to Kill\" was \"The Godfather 2\". Two inhabitants of the actor's Olympus in one film (even if in the first of them they are separated by several dozen plot years, and there is no need to talk about the appearance in one frame) - it's worth a lot. They can sing praises endlessly, but for real moviegoers, this song is no longer a novelty, and a jammed record, you know, tends to bother. I will limit myself to a couple of theses.Al Pacino acts as a constant, undoubtedly the key to the success of the dilogy. The role of the godfather in the second generation is performed by him with filigree accuracy and the necessary intonations. The whole genius of Pacino is especially clearly realized in the pre-final scene of a family dinner, when we see young Michael smiling and strikingly different from Michael \"after twenty years\".Brando, who had already played his best roles, was replaced by the young De Niro, who had yet to show his remarkable talent. For the role of the same character, both actors received an Oscar. Symbolically. Fair.So, what can the viewer remember (probably still having a shorter time than the main one) about the young Vito Corleone, the future Godfather of the Italian mafia in New York? I think it's true drama, a wonderful performance by the spectacular De Niro, especially heartfelt music from Nino Rota, and moments that refer to the first part of the saga and make you exclaim something like \"oh, yes, this is the same Clemenza!\". There are several iconic scenes in this part of the film. Here are just a couple of phrases from the lips of Vito Corleone describing them:I make him an offer he don't refuse.Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.The main part, which tells about Vito's son Michael Corleone, or rather the state of affairs at the time of its initial scenes, can be described by dialogue:Kay: It made me think of what you once told me: \"In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.\" That was seven years ago.Michael Corleone: I know. I'm trying, darling.Yes, hard times have come for the Corleone family. We draw a picture executed in rather gloomy colors and interiors (despite the abundance of sunny locations, such as Miami or Cuba), suggesting unoriginal thoughts that membership in the Italian mafia is not a job that you can quit of your own free will, but the status of the Head of the Family imposes huge obligations on its bearer.Michael's relationship with Kay is going through a severe test that could lead to the door being slammed in the face of the mother of their children.Michael's relationship with his brother Fredo and sister Connie is also far from ideal. Especially with Fredo, the one who became the culprit of such a catchphrase:Michael Corleone: I know it was you Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!The root cause of the family drama is obvious:Michael: I've always taken care of you, Fredo.Fredo Corleone I'm your older brother, Mike, and you're taking care of me? Did you ever think about that?In the outside world, there is Frankie \"Five Angels\" Pentangeli, who still remembers the good old days:Those were the great old days, you know... And we was like the Roman Empire... The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire...And also Hyman Roth (whose prototype was the mobster Meyer Lansky), the author of the golden words \"This is the business we chose\", the one about which Michael says that \"Hyman Roth has been dying from the same heart attack for the last twenty years\", and Frankie gives him this characterization \"Your father did business with Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth... but he never trusted Hyman Roth!\"And now Michael has to build his relationships with these people, wading through the thick of criminal intrigues, often threatening his life and the lives of loved ones. The response will not keep you waiting:Michael Corleone: I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies.Tom Hagen: It would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.Michael Corleone: Tom, you know you surprise me. If anything in this life is certain - if history has taught us anything - it's that you can kill anybody.Well, as a result of all these events, the viewer will receive several more cult scenes, the crown of which will be an unforgettable dimming of the image of such a powerful and at the same time such a lonely Michael Corleone. Icons of world cinema. Eternal Godfather.",

            "content": "I have to agree that calling \"The Godfather II\" a sequel is pretty insulting. This is one of those rare sequels that almost surpasses the first one, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was, that says a lot. \"The Godfather II\" is longer, but in some ways richer. People may say that, as in the case of the first one, it is slow and takes time to open up. Sure, but I think it was intentional. There is something elegiac about both this and the first Godfather, which makes them even more irresistible.On the one hand, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply magnificent, whether it's dark, autumnal or picturesque, and the scenery is amazing. The music is great again, it catches and sticks in my head for a long time. In addition, there is a brilliantly written script, smart and thoughtful, a masterful direction by Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. There are indeed some great scenes in the film: the scenes where Vito escapes from Sicily have the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid clumsiness and confusion, and the climax is extremely frightening. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.The acting is once again great. Vito is brilliantly played by Robert De Niro in one of his best roles. I was also attracted to Robert Duvall as Faithful Tom, John Casale and Diane Keaton. But the painting belongs to Al Pacino. He was great in the first Godfather movie, but he's even better here. He's just phenomenal, and to be honest, I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, a terrific movie and one of the best sequels.",

It's a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own. Occasionally it repeats a point made in \"The Godfather\" (organized crime is just another kind of American business, say) but its insights are fairly lame at this point.\"The Godfather, Part II,\" which opened yesterday at five theaters, is not very far along before one realizes that it hasn't anything more to say. Everything of any interest was thoroughly covered in the original film, but like many people who have nothing to say, \"Part II\" won't shut up.Not the least of its problems is its fractured form. \"Part II\" moves continually back and forth in time between two distinct narratives. It's the story of the young Vito Corleone (who grew up to be played by Marlon Brando in the first movie) seen first around the turn of the century in Sicily and then in 1917 in New York, where he's played by Robert De Niro, and it's the story of Vito's son, Michael, played again by Al Pacino, the new Mafia don who sets out to control Las Vegas in the late nineteen-fifties.One story doesn't necessarily illuminate the other, it's just additional data, like footnotes. I can't readily imagine what Mr. Coppola and Mr. Puzo were trying to do, except to turn their first film into a long parenthesis that would fit between the halves of the new movie.Even if \"Part II\" were a lot more cohesive, revealing and exciting than it is, it probably would have run the risk of appearing to be the self- parody it now seems.Looking very expensive but spiritually desperate, \"Part II\" has the air of a very long, very elaborate revue sketch. Nothing is sacred. The photography by Gordon Willis, so effective originally, is now comically fancy\u2014the exteriors are too bright and glow while the interiors are so dark you wonder if these Mafia chiefs can't afford to buy bigger light bulbs.Nino Rota's old score keeps thumping away like a heavenly juke box. The performers, especially those repeating their original roles, seem locked into waxy rigid attitudes. Mr. Pacino, so fine the first time out, goes through the film looking glum, sighing wearily as he orders the execution of an old associate or a brother, winding up very lonely and powerful, which is just about the way he wound up before. Mr. De Niro, one of our best young actors, is interesting as the young Vito until, toward the end of his section of the film, he starts giving a nightclub imitation of Mr. Brando's elderly Vito.There are a couple of notable exceptions. Lee Strasberg, the head of the Actors Studio, makes an extraordinarily effective screen debut as Hyman Roth, the powerful Jewish mobster (reportedly modeled on Meyer Lansky) with whom Michael attempts to take over the Havana rackets under the Battista regime. Mr. Strasberg's Roth is a fascinating mixture of lust, ruthlessness and chicken soup. Michael V. Gazzo, the playwright (\"A Hatful of Rain\"), is also superb as a Corleone captain who crosses the Family. Another more or less non pro, G. D. Spradlin (a former politician, according to publicity sources) is absolutely right as a crooked, very WASPish United States Senator from Nevada.The plot defies any rational synopsis, but it allows Mr. Coppola, in his role as director, to rework lots of scenes that were done far better the first time: family reunions, shoot-outs, ambushes and occasional dumb exchanges between Don Michael Corleone and his square, long-suffering wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). \"Oh, Michael,\" says the slow-to-take-offense Kay when Michael is about to sew up the Vegas rackets, \"seven years ago you told me you'd be legitimate in five years.\"",

John Cazale does a great job of creating the Fredo character, and his relationship with Michael is heartbreaking. As the end of the movie approaches, Michael has become a ruthless man. He has killed men for business, he has killed his own brother. And he is alone because of it. The second last scene takes us back to an earlier time. Everybody is happy and laughing, but Michael is again alone. The last scene is back in present time, and depicts Michael sitting on a bench alone, contemplating what he has done.

            "content": "The Godfather Part II is a classic film that follows the story of the Corleone crime family and their rise to power in the world of organized crime. The film, a sequel to the original The Godfather, is a masterpiece of storytelling and acting, and it remains one of the most highly regarded films of all time.The Godfather Part II picks up where the first film left off, with the character of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) now fully entrenched as the head of the family. The film follows two parallel storylines: one set in the present, where Michael is dealing with the challenges of running a criminal empire, and another set in the past, where we see the early years of Michael's father, Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), as he builds his own criminal empire.One of the things that makes The Godfather Part II so special is the performances of the cast. Pacino and De Niro give career-defining performances as Michael and Vito, respectively, and their chemistry on screen is electric. The rest of the cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, and Lee Strasberg.The film is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who also directed the first Godfather film. Coppola's direction is impeccable, and he perfectly captures the mood and atmosphere of the film. The cinematography is also top-notch, with beautiful shots of New York City and Havana adding to the overall visual appeal of the film.Overall, The Godfather Part II is a must-see film for any fan of the crime genre. Its compelling story, top-notch acting, and beautiful visuals make it a true masterpiece of cinema. It's a film that has stood the test of time and remains just as powerful and relevant today as it was when it was first released.",

Coppola manages to take a great original and somehow add to it in a way that elevates it from simply a good movie into true art.The story of Michael Corleone is dramatic in that it explores very seriously some themes that, by comparison, the first film only touches upon. Sure, it explains that Michael had a strong chance to make something of himself very far away from his father, and that he threw it all away. But in Part II we finally see the real reason why Michael's path was doomed to failure: He and his father were very different men with very different lives.The finality and veracity of that message is so effectively transmitted in film that it comes off looking like an adaptation of ancient Greek drama. And like Greek drama often does, Godfather II dramatizes a particular moral idea by taking it to extremes. The simple version of the message: Tradition itself is worthless. You can try to hold the same values from generation to generation, but times change and those values don't guide you through every new situation. Vito Corleone's experiences as a Sicilian immigrant to New York are one thing, but Michael learns some dramatically different lessons in Batista's exploited Cuba.The storytelling is so great, and so effective with the cast (especially with regard to Robert de Niro's historical reconstruction), that you can almost feel yourself walking down the streets of the Lower East Side around the turn of the century, and the memories evoked seem to erupt from your own head rather than from the screen.

For those of you, like myself, of Italian-American heritage, the scene where the young boy arrives in Ellis Island is especially poignant.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but the central theme of the movie is that Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) must come to grips with the fact that despite all his efforts, he cannot escape becoming the same kind of man as his father, perhaps even worse. And in the end he must deal with betrayal and confront the ironic ends to which he will go to \"protect his family\" at all costs. The lessons in this blown up morality play are profound and timeless.Like the original movie, the acting is brilliant, perhaps even better than the first movie thanks to a stunning turn by Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth (very loosely based on real life mob figure Meyer Lansky) and a typically awesome performance by Robert Deniro as the young Vito.10 out 10",

Any fan of films should have already seen this masterpiece. If not go rush to the store now. Vito's consolidation of power and the founding of the Corleone Empire is delivered in perfection. Any questions the audience had about the inner workings of the Corleone organization is answered very clearly. One of the best endings also, it really makes you hungry for more, at the same time not disappointed or cheated. Robert Duvall returns again to play the legal representative of the Corleone family as well as Diane Keaton as Michael Corleone's (Pacino) wife. Both fill the roles well, particularly Duvall who plays the character who always plays it safe. Not a common trait among the organization. Only Francis Ford Coppola could have pulled so many complex strings together to create this landmark film.",

            "content": "Moving through the deep shadows and heavy glooms of his vast estate, Michael Corleone presides over the destruction of his own spirit in \"The Godfather, Part II.\" The character we recall from \"The Godfather\" as the best and brightest of Don Vito's sons, the one who went to college and enlisted in the Marines, grows into a cold and ruthless man, obsessed with power. The film's closing scenes give us first a memory of a long-ago family dinner, and then Michael at mid-life, cruel, closed, and lonely. He's clearly intended as a tragic figure.The Corleone saga, as painted by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo in two films totaling nearly seven hours, has been a sort of success story in reverse. In a crazy way, \"The Godfather\" and its sequel belong in the same category with those other epics of immigrant achievement in America, \"The Emigrants\" and \"The New Land.\" The Corleone family worked hard, was ambitious, remembered friends, never forgave disloyalty, and started from humble beginnings to become the most powerful Mafia organization in the country. If it were not that the family business was crime, these films could be an inspiration for us all.Coppola seems to hold a certain ambivalence toward his material. Don Vito Corleone as portrayed by Marlon Brando in \"The Godfather\" was a man of honor and dignity, and it was difficult not to sympathize with him, playing with his grandchild in the garden, at peace after a long lifetime of murder, extortion, and the rackets. What exactly were we supposed to think about him? How did Coppola feel toward the Godfather? \"The Godfather, Part II\" moves both forward and backward in time from the events in \"The Godfather,\" in an attempt to resolve our feelings about the Corleones. In doing so, it provides for itself a structural weakness from which the film never recovers, but it does something even more disappointing: It reveals a certain simplicity in Coppola's notions of motivation and characterization that wasn't there in the elegant masterpiece of his earlier film.He gives us, first of all, the opening chapters in Don Vito's life. His family is killed by a Mafia don in Sicily, he comes to America at the age of nine, he grows up (to be played by Robert De Niro), and edges into a career of crime, first as a penny-ante crook and then as a neighborhood arranger and power broker: a man, as the movie never tires of reminding us, of respect.",

Al Pacino gained excellent, well-deserved reviews as he convincingly plays the cool Michael Corleone. Robert Duvall also deserves a mention for his vital role in the movie, he plays the family's lawyer Tom Hagen as impeccably as in the original Godfather. Before I saw the sequel, I believed that the Godfather was the greatest movie ever made but the Godfather Part II surpasses the original, which is not common. I thought having two stories running parallel throughout the movie was a unique and intelligent idea but the most impressive element of the movie was the broader picture of the mafia family's dealings given to the audience. As great as the original was, I thought it was somewhat limited. However, where its predecessor fails the Godfather: Part  II succeeds resulting in an exquisite movie.",

A arguable downside in the first part could possibly be the fact that Brando was a gentleman, not a Don. DeNiro does this a lot better. Of course the quote \"I'm gonna make him an offer he don't refuse\" is used again, and a lot have been added, like \"keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\". Pacino is better in the second part because here he plays a Don all the time. He's a cold-blooded killer, exceeding his father. He ditches his sister, brother and wife and becomes the most powerful man in the US. Everytime a Pacino scene ends, you don't want it to end, and the same happens when a DeNiro scene ends. Connie Corleone is incredibly annoying, Fredo Corleone is incredibly pathetic and Michael and Vito are incredible. Probably an underrated actor in part I and II is Robert Duvall. You never see him mentioned but he acts great. Frank Pentangeli is very funny. Don Fanucci is a \"Chazzer\", and if you don't know what a Chazzer is,  you ought to watch Scarface. 2 downsides are: No Santino (James Caan), and the fact that Pacino and DeNiro never play a scene together.",

It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.",

The mood, the acting, dialog, directing, cinematography was a feeling which I have yet to discover again. Every time I watch it I get the same feeling. I discover new things, small little details which I had not noticed before. A cinematic masterpiece of the highest degree.

This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the creative decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Mario Puzo, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a memorable look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone.The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing cast of brilliant actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Richard Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire and many more. I love how the film handles Michael Corleone's character arc in this film and Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is one of the greatest performances in cinema history.Honestly, there's really nothing to complain about this film, as it's highly agreed to be of the greatest films in history. The Godfather brilliantly weaves an intriguing look into the world of organized crime along with innovative storytelling, focused direction and astounding performances.",

The great Walter Murch cut the movie with a steady relaxed hand, it seems to just go forth by a energy completely of its own. I also have to mention the production of New york city in the 20ies. I mean, its just so much more fancy then any of the marvel movies that just seem so fake, this is the real deal, you actually feel transported. THAT is what this movie is about.",

            "content": "After seeing \"The Godfather\" for the first time, it instantly rose to the ranks of my favorite films. Because I loved the film so much, I didn't think either of its sequels could surpass it. However, I was wrong. The Godfather Part II contains some of the finest acting, direction, screenwriting and design that has ever been seen in film. To call this film spectacular is an understatement of near criminal proportions. This is a masterwork, and however varied Coppola's career has been since, \"II\" will always redeem him.Enough people have described the plot, so I won't go into that. Instead, I'll focus on the performances. De Niro is wonderful as young Vito Corleone. De Niro uses more facial communication than speech in the film, like Brando in \"I\". In De Niro, we see a hungry young man who comes the the U.S. with anger and a desire for vengeance, and watch him evolve into a man who obtains the power to achieve it. Additionally, his character's arc provides the perfect contrast to Michael's. Young Vito is a man who builds ties with others, has good professional and personal relationships, and would never lose his family. The last shot of his character is a tender moment between father and son.As good as De Niro is, Pacino outshines him (and everyone else) in his part as Michael. In the last film, we saw a young man who gradually became caught in an undesired life. Here, we see him grow into that life, and what he does with the power he's attained. Pacino is brutal in this film. He commands the screen whenever on it, and his character's destruction of the family and enterprise his father worked hard to create is devastating. You feel for Michael, a man who is despicable and has lost the honor he had at the beginning of the first film, but who has also been caught in a world that he never could have avoided, much as he might have tried. As Michael becomes colder, harder and continues drawing his family's organization away from what it originally was, Pacino's character continues to become more sympathetic. Even his eyes communicate the change this character has gone through from the beginning of \"I\" to the end of \"II\". It's a brilliantly played part, and it isn't surprising that Pacino hasn't been able to surpass it. In fact, it could be argued that this is the greatest performance captured in cinema.The other performances are uniformly spectacular. Keaton and Duvall are standouts. However, John Cazale, someone who deserved a career like Pacino or De Niro's (though the career he did have while he was alive was impeccable) is also brilliant. Michael's destruction of his family has much to do with his relationship with Fredo, and Fredo's inadverdent betrayal. Cazale is brilliant as a man who has always been viewed as a weakling and lived in the shadow of his brothers and tries to get out, only to bring about his own fall in the process. It's nearly as devastating a part as Pacino's, and Cazale plays it perfectly.In conclusion, I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It enhances \"I\", and surpasses it at the same time. While \"III\" is a good film, it doesn't achieve the perfection that the first two have. If you haven't watched this series already, set aside a day and enjoy film perfection.",

He fails to realize at what cost he sold his soul. The ends don't always justify the means. I must say it took me a few viewings to understand this all, but it was definitely worth it. As bad as he gets, you still feel sorry for him because you understand why he makes certain decisions. Watching the younger Vito grow into the great mafia don is also a great part of the movie. De Niro's ability to use body movements, facial tics, and expressions is what made his portrayal of Vito one for the ages. Please see the movie if you haven't yet. There's a reason it's been rated as a top-notch movie for the past 37+ years.",

The cinematography is absolutely stunning, with excellent shots portraying the rich history Sicily has. The acting is, yet again, flawless. Robert De Niro shows his true skill portraying young Vito, growing up in a corrupt and violent world. But who steals every scene is Al Pachino, playing Michael Corleone. Al Pachino portrays a man who is slowly breaking apart. A man who is torn between his family life, and his life of crime. Michael has gone from being an innocent military man, to a cold and bitter monster. Pachino held this role very delicately and with precision. What do you get out of that? An excellent performance which shows that he is truly a master of his craft. The plot is quite literally a roller-coaster of excitement, and surprise. With a sensational mixture of Michael fighting for his sanity being the don of the biggest mob in the US, intricately knitted with flashbacks of how Vito Corleone came to power. This movie is not a sequel, it is a clever brother of the film made two years before. A true masterpiece and will stand the test of time.",

Scenes like Vito's mother getting shot; Vito's emerging as man to be respected in his neighborhood, outweighing Fanucci; Michael's scenes with the Senator; the review committee scene, which brings in Frank's brother towards the end, and the climax scene; each of them makes the story as interesting as it could.

Also we get to see Robert Deniro as the wonderful Don Corleone. Also how Micheal transforms into a dark monster over the years running the family business. The best scene is the surprise party for Vito and it was just brillant to add that scene in. I think that is one ingredient that helped this movie pick up best picture. Not to mention the godfather 2 is the first sequel to win best picture. This sequel may be better than the original and if not it is just as entertaining which makes at a good sequel. The godfather 2 is brillantly acted by Robert Deniro and Al Pacino. Al Pacino should have won best actor in this film because he does such a good job as Micheal Corleone.

Francis Ford Coppola has managed to do something very difficult - to surpass the first part of The Godfather saga. The cinematography, the dialogue, the script, the acting and every other part of this movie are impeccable and amazing. I strongly believe that Al Pacino's performance in this film is maybe the greatest acting performance of all time. The way he develops his character from a young, innocent boy to a ruthless crime lord is mind-blowing. I cannot believe that he lost the Oscar, since this performance, in my humble opinion, is the best in his career. Robert De Niro is also mesmerizing, less than Pacino though, but nevertheless he won a very well-deserved Oscar. Robert Duvall shines as Tom Hagen and John Cazale is very convincing as Fredo. To sum it all up - this movie is a masterpiece, a must-see, it's literally flawless!",

It shows the corruption of the dark side of the American dream throughout the 1900's with Michael's story going on in the present and the background story of Vito beginning the advancement of his family in the early 1900's. The characters in this movie are very complex and evoke strong emotions throughout the movie. The audience feels the decisions they make as if they are the ones deciding. The work of cinematography is amazing. The camera angles and lighting are the most apparent in making specific scenes timeless. It has won many awards and is considered to be one of the greatest American made movies ever created. This movie is rated R for adult situations/ violence and language.

            "content": "The Godfather part two is as exceptional if not better than the original. It is true that the theme of soul corruption had been explored to great length by the end of the first film however through the genius of Coppola this is re-investigated albeit in greater depth. Michael's transition follows it's natural devastating conclusion, and his relationship aswell as his desire to emulate his father is far more prevalent. Michael's motives for becoming head of the family were like his father's, the protection and consolidation of his family, however  he loses sight of this and loses most of that foundation and solidarity through death and divorce and is left with no-one, this arguably becomes the greatest irony of the series with the perpetual insistence on the importance and virtues of the family.The second film is vital in charting this trajectory more clearly and the importance of family becomes secondary to that of survival and power. Coppola intelligently looks at the  situation in Cuba in the 1950s and the wealth and corruption in abundance under the direction of what would have been Battista's regime. From Cuba Michael learns that although money is power the determination of one individual to sacrifice his life for a cause is infinitely more powerful, in this instance Coppola offers us hope rather than nihilism.The story of Vito Corleone's rise to power adds a rich subtext to the film and the two are interwoven throughout highlighting the contradictions between Michael and his father who's life he so covets by the end of the film. Both part one and two in the Godfather series  inspire thought provoking analysis into the human condition and the sense of of catharsis at the end is more reminiscent of King Lear than a gangster flick. Coppola's achievement was to produce two entirely different films and with the genial masterpiece that is the Godfather as its backdrop part two is extremely accomplished and no simple task for any director.",

            "content": "In the Godfather, we saw Michael Corleone transform from idealistic youngest child to all-powerful mafia don. He successfully protected his family and led its resurrection. Part II is a roller-coaster in theme: Vito Corleone in his younger days(another one of De Niro's classic roles)rises from poverty, personal tragedy, and personal weakness to become the Godfather, a man whose family is healthy, safe, and affluent. He is a moral man, but does not rule out murder and crime as an option. He only uses it to help his family, however. The downward slope of this roller coaster is the story of Michael. I can't think of any tragedies I have seen in film that matches this one. Coppola does excellent at making us both sympathies and lament with a man who is evil, cruel, and destructive. Michael Corleone is now in firm control of the family. All seems well: his wife Kay is pregnant, they have two children already, Anthony and Mary. But these scenes early in the movie only serve as the diving board into the abyss. The night of his son's communion, an assassination is attempted against Michael. This is the beginning of the end. Michael trusts no one, save for Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall where were you for Part III? Save us from George Harrison please!!). But by the end, Michael trusts no one, especially after he finds out that his brother Fredo(another tragic character) was connected to his near assassination. Michael does some business in Cuba that only aids in the destruction of his soul. By the end, Kay and the children have left him, Fredo has been killed by him, and Michael is left alone. The end of the movie is a series of the best shots ever put into film(with the exception of some in Apocalypse Now). The dinner conversation summarizes the tragedy of Michael. He says he's joining the Marines and Tom and Sonny scold him. \"I have my own plan's for my future.\" It is Don Vito's birthday and the family is there to greet him at the door for a song, but Michael sits alone at the table thinking. The final two images are of a train ride with Vito and Michael, showing a happy and successful Vito and young Michael and then the next, the most powerful shot of all time, is of Michael, sitting alone at his Nevada home. He sits there, broken, alone, invincible to his enemies but dead on the inside, a man whose sins will haunt him forever. Then the picture fades to black and in that instant will see what was wasted. Michael and Vito both were great men, but fate put them in their roles. Wasted greatness is the ultimate theme of the Godfather Trilogy and the tragedy of Michael Corleone is epic. Like Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet, destiny was against Michael. That is what ultimately makes us sympathetic.",

You can see how he changed, in Godfather 1 he looked so pure with a warm heart, a war hero whose father kept him from all the dirt so he can be a senator or a governor with an upper hand, but here his eyes just look empty scary and his face has only one firm impression that doesn't change the whole movie, like how he was so nervous and terrified to kill Mccluskey and Sollozzo but now he's able to pull the trigger in a blink of an eye, Al Pacino definitely done a wonderful job so you can notice that these can't be the same character just because it has the same name! now for Robert De Niro performance that was remarkable! the young Don Vito Corleone couldn't be played better how he speaks, sits and puts his hand on his cheek when he's listening carefully and that \"I'm going to make him an offer he can not refuse\" line it's all just perfect he really earned that Oscar. Connie and Fredo play an important role there too with of course Robert Duvall it all fits. the most thing I loved is how the flashbacks blend with the scenes of the movie and it's not disturbing or distracting you! now I know why this is a movie that people can't forget for more than 40 years.",

Everything, from the acting, story, script, directing, cinematography, sound, lighting; you name it, is perfect. Many people agree with me that Part II is a tad bit better than Part I. However, many people also don't, only because the great Marlon Brando was not in Part II (not including flashbacks). However, a young Robert De Niro made up for Brando's absence to give possibly the best performance of his life as the young Vito Corleone. He also did a great job in delivering the Sicilian dialect of Italian (since that consisted of most of his lines). I cannot go on any further without mentioning spoilers, so I will leave it at this. This movie definitely has to be seen before you die. The length of this movie is actually a good thing, as well. It just draws you into it even more, and time flies without you even noticing. So if you have about 3 1/2 hours of time to watch a great movie, put this on and relive the magic. And if it's your first time watching it (be sure to watch Part I first), then you're in for something magical.

The Godfather Part II is a darker, more sprawling and perhaps subtler beast than its predecessor. Fewer classic scenes but a ton more character development. You can almost see the fragile psychological mechanics of each character ticking away throughout the film. Al Pacino projects the demise of Michael's soul as if he is personally conjuring the storm cloud that follows his character in every scene. In contrast, De Niro shows Vito climbing the ladder of crime with scene-stealing power, control and charisma. Vito is at peace with himself and with his family. And that's all this film really is at the end. A story about family. Where Vito's family comes together in the cauldron of old Italian America, Michael's shatters into a million pieces. Having these two stories running parallel to one another is a masterstroke because Vito's story of new beginnings and hope for his family gives Michael's descent into cold, lonely crime lord even more tragic. The end scene in the Corleone family dining room where Michael announces that he is joining the marines and Fredo is the only person to give him support is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema.",

Both megastars, Pacino and DeNiro do not out do each other, and play their roles really well, as their Oscar nominations reflect this, with DeNiro actually winning one! Deniro played young Vito Corleone, and the film showed how the Vito Corleone became so powerful, from a peasant in Sicily to a big-time Godfather! Deniro's part was a prequel to the original film. From my point of view, Rober De Niro wasn't trying to play as young Vito Corleone, but tried to play as young Marlon Brando (RIP). He played it so well, that the Deniro scenes were more enjoyable to watch than Pacino's scenes. The directing was great in this film, and how the camera angles taken, the lightening, and how well the movie flowed.This film is probably the best film of the 19th century, with the best actors, the best directing and a great storyline. This is easily a MUST-SEE!!",

From the material given, the viewer can already guess how the De Niro character rose through the ranks and the events we witness feel a little bit superfluous. Sure, the pair of assassination scenes are excellent, but the rest just feels obvious and expected.Meanwhile, the Pacino narrative also has its problems, although cast and director aren't at fault; Coppola reunites many of his principals here and to excellent effect. However, there isn't nearly as much incident in the narrative and the whole story feels a little dragged out, a little over-emphasised. In the first film, the Pacino character had three or four major plot points to deal with, whereas this time the events are limited; for example, the entire film focuses on the situation with Roth, whereas in THE GODFATHER that would have just taken up half an hour or so.",

This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that \"God created man in his own image.\" It also says to, \"Love your neighbor as yourself,\" which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider.

            "content": "Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo's The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks \u2014\"they are animals anyway.\"This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college-educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life\u2014marriages, baptisms, family feasts\u2014become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.THE GODFATHER (MOVIE)Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; written by Mario Puzo and Mr. Coppola, based on the novel by Mr. Puzo; director of photography, Gordon Willis; edited by William Reynolds, Peter Zinner, Marc Laub, and Murray Solomon; music by Nino Rota; production designer, Dean Tavoularis; produced by Albert S. Ruddy; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 175 minutes.",

It's a stunning narrative flourish: mysterious and moving.The Godfather films have, with some reason, been accused of glamorizing the bullies of organized crime and indeed for being a how-to-behave manual for generations of wannabe wiseguys. But what power, even grandeur there is in these films: a top-down history of political intrigue.It is commonplace to call Godfather 2 \"Shakespearean\"; I find myself remembering the BBC's I, Claudius. After Vito's death, young Michael Corleone is susceptible to a new quasi-father figure, aging Florida boss Hyman Roth, played with quiet style and potency by Lee Strasberg. Michael is persuaded to test family loyalties by expanding his empire with Roth into Cuba: together they will typify the corruption that brought Fidel Castro into being. The action flashes back and forth with the life and career of young Vito Corleone, played by rail-thin Robert De Niro, in 1920s New York. Vito shows his instinctive grasp of how to combine strategic violence with operatic displays of sentimentality and generosity. As a teenager, he first sees how some ganging-up is needed against the florid local Don, who threatens the theater-owner's daughter. (When I was in Sicily, a guide told me the word \"mafia\" was derived from the phrase \"non tocca ma figlia\", \"don't touch my daughter\" \u2013 an interesting explanation that I have yet to see confirmed.)Robert Duvall is brilliant as put-upon consigliere Tom, and Diane Keaton is memorable as Michael's outsider wife Kay, the sole unhappy voice of sanity and modernity",

Simply as a story, the Michael scenes in \"The Godfather: Part II\" engage our emotions. I admire the way Coppola and his co-writer Mario Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he handles delicate decisions involving Hyman Roth (Strasberg), the boss of Miami; Fredo (Cazale), his older brother, and the shooting of Sonny (James Caan).",

It succs you in and makes you almost empathize the mafiasystem because you come to understand al, the acts of vengenance. What's wrong what's right? The world isn't black and white.And then there's the superb acting, the music, the camerawork, the directing.... It's the best oft the best. And by going back in time when Vito became the father of Sonny, Fredo and Michael and as a watcher of part 1 you know what lies ahead you get chilled to the bone knowing the tough choices that have to bemade.And although ir was many years ago that I watched the three movies I still know perfectly well when certain scenes appeared for example when Kay asks \"Why are the curtains open?\" Unforgettable. And the scene where Tom takes a boattrip with Fredo and of course in part 1 the horse... I still haven't watched this part with my daughter (she's a horsegirl) but if I do I will tell her to get me a beer in the kitchen.So my advice: watch this movie, watch all three of them. Yes , I know part three isn't as good as part 1 and 2 but they belong together. The ending, if I remember correctly, is so pure and simple with Al Pacino just falling of his chair while sitting in the garden and in that moment it rounds the circle since his father Vito Corleone also died in his garden while playing with his grand son. So The Godfatheris about crime, love, family, revenge, ethical dilemma 's, forgiveness and life.",

I found myself humming along to some of the instrumental tunes played during the celebration scenes. The dances and optimism start the film on a light note, I feel, although we can't not be suspicious that darker moments are (surely) to come. The colour in this film is very yellow heavy at times - giving it an added nostalgic sense to it. Indeed the subtitles themselves are in a light yellow tone. Speaking of dialogue (pardon the pun), it is again often quite hushed but I managed to follow the majority of it, so it wasn't too much of an issue. I suppose it does add to the sense of tension. I liked that it explained the origins of the families name (surname, to be precise). I liked seeing the classic cars and scenes set in dark lit pubs - its quite atmospheric.\n\nThe performances are very good - facial expressions well put across. I particularly liked Robert DeNiro playing the young Don Vito. I like that the characters are fairly low key (big action scenes aside). It makes the plot more intriguing. I found myself, at times, almost literally wondering what may be around the next corner., so I found it suitable engrossing\n\nOf course I've no direct knowledge of the Mafia/gangsters or anything of the sort but it did seem to me quite authentic, or at least the performances were very believable and I admired the cinematography, with some scenes set in picturesque places such as Cuba, as well as Italy and of course the US. I could almost feel the heat from the scenes set in hot countries.\n\nIf I were asked what one thing stood out the most for me in this film, I'd say the music, including live performances. Its quite absorbing overall, certainly compared to sequels of other big films. I do still prefer the original film to this sequel but their both very good films overall. I particularly liked the subtelty this film has. In any case, of course I would recommend this film, yes.",

It is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was that says a lot. The Godfather Part II is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. People may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. Of course, but I think that was deliberate. Both this and the first Godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling.\n\nFor one thing, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. The music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. Then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. The film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where Vito flees Sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.\n\nThe acting is superb once again. Vito is brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro in one of his better performances. I was also taken with Robert Duvall as loyal Tom, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. But the picture belongs to Al Pacino. He was great carrying the first Godfather movie, but he is even better here. He is simply phenomenal, and to be honest I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Putting two 90-minute movies together the way they did meant double the exposition & double the rising action, but the relatively tepid nature of the prequel story didn't result in double climactic finales to compensate. Even the Michael story had much lower stakes than the first movie had; the drama this time was contained within the family rather than being an external effort to kill them all. The film score wasn't better than it had been in the first movie and the supporting cast were less interesting (save for Strasberg's character). I did like the sheer ambition of merging the two movies together and that Keaton had a larger role here, but overall I'm just thoroughly surprised that this is considered on par with the first movie.",

We see how the \nCorleone family became a part of the organized crime. So you can imagine how would have turned the family if Clemenza wouldn't have giving his guns to DeNiro's Vito Corleone. Never Michael would have ended up like that and none of the brothers would have died. Maybe. And that is what is nice with seeing the backgrounds of Vito, you can see time changing a family of honest citizens and understand how little events can change someone for the rest of his life. For good or for bad.\n\nI also liked the score that is simply marvelous. The story is good. There is simply no plot holes. Everything is cover and it permits you to follow the movie more easily. The end with the flashback and the killing of Fredo was perfect but really destructive because you could see Michael when he was still \"orthodox\" and then you see him order the murder of a brother.

Thanks to a clever and insightful script from director Francis Ford Coppola and novelist Mario Puzo, both storylines are compelling with seemingly more character development than in the first installment.  Additionally, Gordon Willis' cinematography is great, especially the interior shots where Willis uses effective lighting to obscure the presence of henchmen in dark corners and to mask the emotional expressions of the characters in shadows.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II: What is the Price of the Choices We Make?\nThis Week I watched the 1974 film The Godfather Part II directed by Francis Ford Coppola and Starring Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro and John Cazale. Set both before and after the events of the first Godfather, the film tells the story of Don Corleone's rise to power while simultaneously recounting his son Michael's further fall from grace. As a young boy in Sicily, Vito Andolini attends his father's funeral with his mother when he receives news that the same Mafia mob that killed his father has now killed his older brother. When his mother pleads to the Mafia head, Don Ciccio, to spare her last son, he orders her killed. When Vito runs off he orders him killed as well. Vito escapes to America and takes the name of his home town of Corleone. Without money or family, he sets out to provide for himself and make his fortune. Michael Corleone starts the film in much the same way as Vito did in the first Godfather, this time business interrupts the festivities of his son's first Communion. The family has moved to Nevada and Michael, as Don, is trying to keep the family fortune by strategic alliances, purchases and assassinations. As time goes on and in an attempt to keep his father's legacy, Michael loses many people near and dear to him while trying to keep his crime family going. The thing that struck me most about the film overall is that not only does it continue the great style of storytelling from the original, it's narrative structure is one of foreshadowing; with promises made and kept done quite intelligently and in the most effective and sometimes devastating way possible. A great example is in an early scene we see Michael's brother Fredo's phone ring in the middle of the night. The caller is identified as Johnny and the nature of the conversation, though vague, tells the audience that Fredo is in league with another organization. Later it is revealed that this \"Johnny\" is Johnny Ola, the right hand man of a rival mob boss named Hyman Roth. Fredo Tells Michael that he has never met Johnny before when the two of them go to meet him at a New Years Eve party. When Fredo lets it slip in Michael's hearing that he had actually talked with Ola before, Michael knows that Fredo has betrayed him to a rival gang. By a brief prior scene, the film makes us suspicious of Fredo's allegiances so that his lie to Michael can be understood as Michael understands it; as a real betrayal. Michael talks with Fredo afterward and the latter confesses his past correspondence with Roth and his bitterness toward Michael being the Don and not him, Michael disowns Fredo but says to his capo that nothing is to happen to Fredo when their mother is alive. After the entreaty of his sister Connie, Michael reconciles with the penitent Fredo at the funeral of their mother. However as the two embrace, Michael looks to his capo with a grim expression reminding us of their previous exchange, and that this reconciliation is not sincere and Michael is determined that Fredo must pay for his unfaithfulness. Other moments of foreshadowing are more poetically significant than narratively. When Tom, The Corleone Lawyer, goes to visit Frank Pentageli in prison, the nature of the scene between them seems to indicate a rather long winded way of Tom convincing Pentageli That the Corleone family holds no hard feelings for his near treachery. However When Pentageli recounts how conspirators against the Emperor in Rome would bleed themselves to death in the bathtub rather than be prosecuted for conspiracy, we know that by associating their situation with his, Pentageli is not convinced of the Corleones good will and all is still not right. Sure enough, not long after, Pentageli is found dead in his bath, bled to death. These are just a few of many examples of great foreshadowing in the film. The Godfather Part II tells its story just as personally and as powerfully as its predecessor but juxtaposes the rise to power in crime of the first generation with the fall from power of the second generation. Putting us the audience in the life of crime where normal domestic existence is impossible, circumstance traps honorable people in dishonor and Two Men: Vito and Michael, by the choices they make, fight for their survival and doom those around them to suffering.\nThe Godfather Part II, though incredibly personal, creates an atmosphere and world for its characters to exist in. One of ferocious intensity and violence coupled with beauty and affection. Right off the bat at the opening title Nino Rota's haunting score paints the perfect mood with the sound of a single trumpet playing a mournful tune. The production design immerses with its beautiful simplicity and transports the viewer to two different countries and time periods through masterful attention to detail. The cinematography is gorgeous (as films of that time period were apt to be) but never showy. The camera shows only what it needs to show and does so with simplicity and skill. Every aspect of the film points to the drama of the characters, and behind the drama are the actors. The weight put on the performances is exactly what should happen with a human drama such as the Godfather. Character is the most important element and without the acting to show for it, the film drops. All the actors give wonderful and emotional performances with stand outs being Pacino, Cazele, Keaton, Duvall and De Niro. De Niro deserves special recognition because of his ability to not only embody the character of Vito Corleone, but portray the younger and more na\u00efve side of his humanity. He was able to perfectly replicate Brando's raspy voice (albeit clearer and younger sounding) and little nuances like the way Brando would break eye contact or scratch his chin during a conversation. At the same time he brought youth to the character. The look in young man's eyes when he sees his first child, or when he first breaks the law, or when he is outraged by injustice. De Niro stayed true to Brando's portrayal and the character of Vito Corleone while adding even more depth and humanity to the character. Both Vito and Michael live in this world, conveyed not created by Writers Puzo and Coppola. They live in a world where things said and done by someone in anger or passion can cause the death of that person; where a man can be living his normal domestic life when suddenly gunshots fire on him and his family. They live in the hyper reality of the mob; where everything done or said can and must have terrible consequences. Both Michael and Vito learn that to make or keep their fortunes they must combat crime with crime. A moral high ground is impossible in crime when your adversaries disregard morals completely. This fact drives both men from a desire to be honorable into what they believe to be a necessary blindness to the moral ambiguity of their actions. The premise of the Godfather Part II is a tragic one. Treachery answered with treachery, violence answered with violence and a place where compassion is unprofitable.\nThe chief dilemma that the film poses is the inevitability of circumstance. When a film about criminals and immoral people succeeds in humanizing its main characters than the prevailing sentiment towards our less then heroic heroes is one of sympathy rather than condemnation. This pattern in crime and gangster movies is one that has caused concern with those who feel that ethics and morals should be clearly stated. Movies that cause us to identify with bad people can make someone want to imitate those bad people. While this may be true in some scenarios and with some films, The Godfather trilogy portrays what is real, and what is real is not desirous. When a film glorifies it's morally questionable and tragic subject matter then it is in a way telling its audience that what it portrays is normal or at least acceptable. When a film portrays crime as it really is then not only is it open for serious interpretation but it shows the realities of the brutal lifestyle one has to live as a gangster. One reason I felt sorry for these characters and especially Michael and Vito is the nature of the circumstances they were born into. Vito's family was killed and he was forced to flee to America at a young age. He tries to live his life right while in a district ruled by the crime boss Fanucci. When his job is taken away from him because Fanucci makes the owner give the position to his nephew and when he is unwittingly involved in a burglary he looks toward the life of crime as possibility for the first time. Michael never chose the life of crime and in fact started out against it. In the first Godfather he tries to go legitimate by joining the Marines in World War II. It seems like fate is against him when his oldest brother dies and he is chosen to be the successor of his father. Suddenly Michael finds it his duty to ascend the role that is necessary for him to don (no pun intended) and begins the ruthless lifestyle that his father started to keep the family afloat. Each man seems to have been driven into crime against their wills and it is heartbreaking to think of the consequences they face for it later.  It is definitely not wrong to feel sorry for a person who does wrong but the reality is that every step they took into their life of crime was as making it harder to go back. Michael promises his wife that \"In Five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate\" but with each choice to operate as the necessarily merciless head of the family he confirms that the family must remain as it always was. Every time each man chose to repay crime with crime they doomed themselves and their children to live the life of tension, fear, mistrust and power.\nThe goal of the Godfather Part II was to tell the further story of the Corleone Family but also to portray the journey of two men in the crime organizations: Vito's rise and Michael's descent, and to show the humanity in the motivations  and reasons for their choices. I believe Vito's goal, though never spelled out in black in white, was one of success. The state he was left in was almost utterly helpless and his desire was to be someone and to make a name for himself (as he quite literally made the Corleone name for himself) and to ultimately provide for his wife and four children. In these respects Vito succeeds. He becomes one of the most powerful men in New York he even gets revenge on the man who killed his family and tried to kill him too and he earned the name \"Godfather\". He keeps his sanity and soft spoken demeanor for the rest of his life and even though he faces trials with his family he dies with his personal life intact and is able to enjoy his last years after he makes his faithful son Michael Don in his stead However even if Vito escaped a great consequence for his choices, those consequences would come upon his children. Michael's goal is to carry on the family business, no matter what it takes. He exacts his policies and commands for murders without second thought for the sake of the business finally has his brother killed. In his attempt to hold his crime family together however, his real family falls apart and in turn his character. The main examples of this are in his final confrontations with his brother Fredo (which I've already recounted) and with his wife Kay. After returning home from negotiating a deal in Cuba, Michael meets with Tom and Tom tells him that his wife has had a miscarriage. When Michael finally talks to Kay about it, she reveals that it wasn't a miscarriage, but an abortion. She had aborted the baby so that it did not have to be born into such a terrible life as Michael was. Not only is it a severe blow to Michael to know that he could have had a child but also a great insult. Kay finally speaks her mind on her disgust with the life that they lead and says that he will never be legitimate. In his anger Michael strikes her and the two separate from that day forward. By his attempts to hold on to the family business of crime, Michael's family splits and at the end of the film, he sits alone, silent, and we the audience are left to reflect with him on the tragedy that is his life. \nThe Godfather Part II is the pinnacle of the epic tragedy. At three hours long it never feels slow paced and never has a dull moment. The Story structure is both intuitive and intelligent. Every production value is top notch and it won numerous awards for it. On top of all that it is one of the best sequels of all time. It brings back everything that was good about the first and provides a script just as if not better written and expands on the story of the original meaningfully and masterfully. It is rather unique in the way that it expands the original both ways, before and after, and never feels disoriented or convoluted because of it. It is a great film in its own right (heck, it won best picture) but gets even better when viewed with the trilogy as a whole (especially the original). It is exactly what a sequel should be while still maintaining the finality and complexity of a standalone film. With all of that going for it, every bit of it the beauty, the violence, the grandeur and the tragedy points to the story and the characters at its center. There in its core is humanity, tragic and imperfect, yet a heart that beats life into a true masterpiece.",

            "content": "Godfather Part II is one of, if not the greatest film ever made. Its a tough call between the first Godfather or this sequel- but I think I actually prefer the sequel. Despite missing Brando's amazing presence- this further continues the descent of Michael Corleone with an all time great performance by Pacino. Dinero is amazing as the newcomer- playing a younger version of Vito Corleone that truly feels like the same man we saw at a much later stage of his life in The Godfather. The dueling storylines are both fascinating, and draw an interesting contrast between the father and the son. \n\nThe father is capable of violence, crime, and theft- but he also has redeeming qualities. He stands up for himself, his family, and his neighborhood, he remains a steadfast and devoted family man/father. Despite his capacity for violence, he isn't a sociopath or psychopath- the violence is well aimed at particular targets. I'm not suggesting that this excuses his behavior necessarily- but Vito unleashes violence on the corrupt Don who murdered his father, mother, and brother. He kills another corrupt Don who threatens and bullies the neighborhood into extortion payments. He is extremely powerful, but not unhinged in his use of this power. \n\nThe son, Michael, on the other hand is every bit as powerful and brilliant as his father- but he is divorced from any moral code. At the beginning of the first Godfather, Michael appears the be the only upstanding member of the family, being not involved in the family crime business. The irony is that we find he has a darker side lurking underneath this appearance, and once he chooses to run the family business in his father's stead- he becomes such a monster that it makes Vito look like a good man. Michael is vindictive, angry, obsessed with power- but for what? Vito does what he does to secure his families future. Michael becomes increasingly detached from the values his father held, and becomes consumed with resentment, rage, and nihilism. \n\nBy the end of this film Michael has fully fallen from grace- becoming purely evil as he has his own brother killed. The final shots of Michael sitting in his chair while becoming enveloped in darkness- fully alone and unhappy- leave the viewer with a haunting image. He is a man who destroyed himself and his entire family in the frivolous pursuit of power and money. The call back to an earlier, more innocent time when Michael was about to join the marines and the Corleone family was intact make the final minutes hit even harder. The acting Pacino gives in the scene where Michael & Kate finally come to blows is absolutely stunning. You can see the quiet rage that constantly simmers beneath Michael's steely, domineering presence. By the end of the film Michael is not only a danger to his enemies and fellow crime lords- he is an immediate threat to the well being of his siblings, wife, and children. \n\nWhat I love about the Godfather films is that they aren't afraid to go in some really dark directions- evoking the feeling of a modern greek tragedy. They aren't necessarily \"fun\" films to watch. But they make you think about fundamental questions of human nature. What is good and what is evil? Can someone who commits violence and crime still maintain a kind of honor or morality? Are we doomed to follow in the footsteps of our parents? What evil lurks beneath regular people who live in a civil society? What might bring this kind of evil to the surface? What happens when power is divorced from morality? \n\nThe more I watch these films the more I appreciate them- they are as challenging and relevant to experience today as they were 50 years ago.",

Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .\n\nAl Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .\n\nWatch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time. 10/10",

This one explores further adventures of Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) reign in the Sicilian Mafia chair and Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) early childhood and young adulthood. In the past, Vito immigrated from Sicily to New York on the run from the Ciccio Mafia after witnessing the death of his father, brother, and mother, and was diagnosed with smallpox upon his arrival. Vito befriends Clemenza (Bruno Kirby) and Tessio (John Aprea) and they steal from mafia boss Don Fanucci (Gastone Moschin). Fanucci later meets Vito and threatens to pay the $600, only for Vito to give \u2018an offer he couldn't refuse,' death. So, in spite of his murder, he becomes head of his own mafia organization, founds his own olive oil trade company, kills Don Ciccio, and welcomes his children: Sonny, Fredo, Michael and Connie. In the present, Michael survives an assassination attempt in Lake Tahoe and suspects it was caused by the Rosato Brothers who were aided by Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), an investor to the Corleone Family who vows revenge after casino owner Moe Greene's death. Michael attempts an assassination on Roth before the new year, but fails once communism takes flight, forcing everyone to flee. Michael returns home, upon hearing the tragic news about Kay's \u2018miscarriage,' as his family gets tried by the FBI, his mother dies, Kay (Diane Keaton) leaves him, Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) commits suicide, and Michael has Fredo (John Cazale) and Roth killed, leaving him in solitude. While not as well-structured as the last film, Part II is still a powerful and satisfying inclusion in the Saga. \n\n(4 \u00bd Oranges from Miami out of 5)",

            "content": "Jeff Barnes \n7/15/18 \n\nThe Godfather 2 \n\tThe Godfather 2 honors The Godfather in many ways with its script and acting, and is about many themes in life such as strength, weakness, and power. The acting as well as the writing very much expands on the characters and the picture honors the original godfather with similar themes, scenes, and set design. However the picture has even slight more imperfection than its predecessor The Godfather. \n\tIn The Godfather 2 the earlier life of former mob boss Vito Corleone is explored while his youngest son Michael seems to can't let go of the criminal acts involving the Corleone family in the past because it contains so much power and control. \n\tThe Godfather 2 precisely examines the subject matter of strength and weakness such as at the beginning of the film when a mafia boss named Francesco Ciccio tells Vito Corleone's at this point Vito Andolini's mother that it's not her son's words he's afraid of but the fact that he'll grow strong when he becomes a man and come for revenge for the death of his father and brother, and it isn't said right out as to why he fears that he'll become strong when he's a man but it's hinted in his face because he has rough and tough looks or expressions on his face and Vito continues to have these rowdy looks through out the film it's noticed that he cries but he never smiles when he's a boy and this is all done tremendously by actor Oreste Baldini.\n\tMeanwhile the character of Michael Corleone is expanded on by being made to realize that being in charge doesn't just mean getting your way all the time but also being powerful and strong but we the audience also realize that having too much endowment can actually lead to vulnerability. Fredo is referred to by his younger brother Michael as weak, and stupid because he allows people to step over him and take advantage of him because he's too insecure to stand up for himself and has difficulty reading between the lines verbally or non verbally such as in the first Godfather film when he works in the family business, and can't comprehend to not take sides against the family or that Moe Green can't be trusted or perhaps the only reason as to why he trusts Moe Green is because he's dangerous, therefore  he doesn't have enough capability or isn't secure enough to not trust Moe Green.\n\t  Fredo also can't read between the lines of a deal that Johnny Ola and Hyman Roth make up that is clearly set up for a hit on his brother Michael. The reason why is because he takes or it appears he takes everything literally instead of figuratively or metaphorically or that he's afraid that he'll get in trouble if he doesn't go along with what anyone says because his brother Michael treats him as a servant by sending him off to do everything for him. \n\tMichael himself becomes weak by wanting too much power. He wants his next child to be a boy because he understands that once the boss in a crime family dies the son is supposed to take over, and it's perceived that he either doesn't believe his son Anthony is capable enough to take over after he dies or that if he has another boy or more boys there will be a bigger line of succession when it comes to taking over the crime family especially since men for many years have been thought of being more powerful than women, but him wanting so much power with wanting more kids and more crime leads to his wife Kay having an abortion because she wants him wanting too much dominance to all end, so in other words by wanting too much dominance Michael gets even less because he wants too much. \n\tThere is even a moment where he hits Kay and this makes him weak because it means that he can't even control his anger because he wants so much endowment that he doesn't want to be limited at all. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has a very fierce and intense look on his face that never seems to stop rising during this moment in the film, and it symbolizes Michael rising too much with his endowment. \n\t   Michael sees his brother Fredo as being weak by not being able to read between the lines of a deal Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola were making however he becomes powerless himself by not being able to read between the lines when his brother Tom Hagen tells him that his wife Kay had a miscarriage, and not being able to apprehend that Kay is really using him so she can have power herself for an abortion because Michael wants so much power that he won't let anyone else have power. \n\tMichael is also feeble with the certainty that he can't bring himself to forgive Fredo because it isn't easy to forgive and all he cares about is power this and power that, which is why he orders his comrade Al to kill Fredo. \n\tJohn Cazale veritably expands on the character of Fredo by really showing his weakness with his expressions particularly when he brings lots of fear to his face the moment after he finds out that Michael knew he was in on the hit during a new years day party, and also when he's sitting slumped over on a chair when he's talking to Michael in a room in Michael's house. \n\tRobert Duvall enlarges on Tom by not only making him genuinely focused but by also genuinely suspicious particularly during a scene when Michael is dealing with a crocked Senator by the name of Pat Geary. \n\tRobert Deniro gives young Vito Corleone the right kinds of emotions at the right times such as when he smiles in a very delightful manner when he sees his friend Genco's pretty sister during a play, but he also makes him look serious and as if he doesn't trust a crocked dealer nicknamed The Black Hand whom he sees at the play. \n\tThe Godfather 2 pays homage to the original Godfather by having many religious themes such as by having it set during Christmas like with having a Christmas tree in Michael's house. It has a day of celebration with Michael's son Anthony's first communion party and the celebration is similar to Connie's wedding celebration in the notion that there's: singing, dancing, music, and food. The communion party is also similar to Connie's child's baptism in the original Godfather. \n\tThe Godfather 2 however is dysfunctional by not adding a little more to Vito Corleone's earlier days or altering his earlier days such as with how he met his right hand man Luca Brasi instead of how he met Clemenza or how he met Hyman Roth, which is strange because one of Michael's associates named Frankie tells Michael that his father: respected Hyman Roth, did business with Hyman Roth, but never trusted Hyman Roth and it's never shown why. \n\tThe Godfather 2 shares plenty of similarities with it processor The Godfather by being ideal and being not quite as good as it but by coming pretty close. I give The Godfather 2 a 9 out of 10.",

The editing is good and the constant shifting from the past to the present. The pacing is also very good, For a near three hour movie. Al Pacino\u2019s performance here tops that of his first one. You can tell how much far he is willing to going down and the people he is willing to kill to protect his family. Robert DeNiro (in his debut movie) is also incredible as the younger Vito Andolini before he became Don Corleone.",

A film that has two stories at its arc but both relating to similar things, including how family is important at the same time as trying to build your empire. We see the differences in the two men Michael and Vito. The scenes with De Niro are excellent as his Italian accent seems very natural and its a very interesting and exciting part of the film. Including the murder of one of big  mafia bosses of the time. The way De Niro waits for his target and the way he wanders on the roof stalking his prey is impressive. From the colours here with very bright colours and light in contrast to Nevada where Michael slowly loses control of his family. Pacino again uses his body language and facial expressions to suggest a troubled individual who trusts no one. Again the music is a highlight and is used well around the film. It has elements from the first movie of course but again is used well with the settings and different time periods. The supporting cast are again excellent, from Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. Its nice that they get more screen time and they are important in the family and what is left of Michaels family. A very interesting movie with the court cases, the business deals going wrong in Cuba and the problems with Fredo. The young Vitos scenes in Italy show the life he was brought into and the amazing shots as he approaches New York, including a reflection of the Statue of Liberty in a window room is great camera work and cinematography. A tale of the American dream with the successes and failures and Michael having less and less influence. The party scene is a nice closure and we Michael sitting alone as the rest of the family leave to meet their father. That says so much about Michael where he was and where he is at the end.",

Every character had their own motivations that were understandable and believable. Not to mention the conniving Hyman Roth being an excellent villain. The ending was especially chilling as both protagonists were worlds apart when they achieved the same goal... solidifying their power.\n\nJustice was also done to make the film feel like the eras portrayed. It felt as if I was seeing real scenes of 1920 Italian New York slums and the rise of Las Vegas in the 1950s. Beautiful.\n\nThe only problem I had with The Godfather: Part II was how Robert De Niro looked nothing like Don Vito. Should I hold that against him?

Pacino is still Pacino, with and extraordinary performance. The plot is a bit more convoluted than Part I. But many things are not as convincing anymore, starting off with the story that drives the movie.\n\nIt's half sequel half prequel: the sequel is just an operation in Cuba, the prequel is about the birth of the family, of which we already know the outcome. Miles away from the exciting fight for power of the Five Families.\nOne big flaw is the character of Pentangeli, presented as a core member of the family, but never heard of before. It's easily explained by the fact that his character should've been Clemenza himself, but they could't find an agreement to bring back the actor, so they created a new one that feels a bit out of place.\nI've felt more detached from the characters in this part II, and as good as Pacino can be, it's impossible for him to fill the hole left by Brando.\nCuriously enough, with just 20 more minutes this movies feels too long when compared to Part I. This means that something didn't work as intended.\n\nBesides these points, it remains an awesome movie. But if after Part I you can't wait to see the sequel, after Part II you wish you didn't have to witness any more the undoing of the family, or wait remains of it.",

The less time consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into power. The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the conclusion of The Godfather, and shows the means by which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba.

The story is exceptionally woven, famously using flashbacks, between the early life of Don Vito and the current life of his son, and heir, Michael and in doing so created an example of one of the best paced 180 minute plus movies ever made.  The period detail is so meticulously enveloping and the score helps amplify emotional reactions to such a degree that it is impossible not to become completely immersed in what is also one of the rare examples of a sequel meriting the argument of surpassing its predecessor.  The acting deserves immense praise as well as Pacino and De Niro excel in their starring roles, while others like Lee Strasberg (as Hyman Roth) and Michael V. Gazzo (as Frank Pentangeli, and one of my personal favorites) add an unquantifiable component that really makes this film a true classic.  \n*2019 Theater #48",

What Coppola was able to capture is something you see only once in a while. The way the movie looks and feels is almost like a documentary. As if we're sharing these experiences with all these different characters. \n\nIt's such a daunting undertaking to take your father's position as head of the mafia and have certain people not respect that. It's crazy to think how rough some of these immigrants had it when they came to America. All the loved ones they left behind. Especially Vito's story, where he came alone when he was just 9 years old. What a greedy pig that boss was that was trying to take from Vito back when he was raising his family of three kids. \n\nI love how the movie goes back forth from Michael's story to his father, Vito. You get to see that they both had to go through some hardships and troubling times where they had to make difficult decisions. That part with the landlord and Vito at his office was hilarious especially seeing how scared he was know that he knew who Vito was. \n\nIt's pretty tragic the things that go on within these mob families. The kind of backstabbing things and difficult choices that members have to make. \n\nIt's obvious watching this movie to see why it's regarded as one of the best movies ever made. Amazing. ",

But seeing the good side thhe conflict of the movie is very interesting and dramatic, as in the first one the performeance of Al pacino and the other actors is great, and the evolucion and the evolution of Michael Corleone is incredible, and i like very much that the movie tells you the orgins of Don Corleone.This movie, more than anything, tells us about Michael's path in the life of crime, everything he is doing and the bad decisions he has made. Finally the ending of the movie is great,because reminds you of what Michael used to have with a scene of him eating with his family and then he changes the scene to a lonely Michael who really has nothing left.",

            "content": "This is definitely not as good as The Gofather (1972) but it's still a very good follow up to one of the most acclaimed films of all time. This is the last of 91 Best Picture winners that I have watched and it's probably one of the best as it's consistently involving for 3 and a half hours and weaves together several different elements to tell a fascinating story. Francis Ford Coppola has made four masterpieces with this, The Godfather, The Conversation (1974) and Apocalypse Now (1979) but this was the only film that he won Best Director for which is ridiculous because he should have three Best Director awards. Of course I would recommend that people watch this film because it is a worthy sequel to a great film and it is extremely entertaining to boot.\n\nThree years after the end of The Godfather Michael Corleone, Al Pacino, has become the most powerful Mob leader in the country and plans to expand his empire despite facing an assassination attempt he believes was organized by his associate Hyman Roth, Lee Strasberg. He continues to do business with Roth even as he tries to have him murdered and faces a serious threat from the investigation of an organized crime commission. We also see how his father Vito Corleone, Robert De Niro, came to America and first became involved in organized crime. When Michael discovers the betrayal of his brother Fredo, John Cazale, and is left by his wife Kay, Diane Keaton, he makes controversial decisions.\n\nMy big issue with the film was that the arc did not feel as strong as that found in the first film as we already know that Michael is evil and willing to do whatever it takes to succeed so his assassination of Fredo had less effect. It's not say that I wasn't engaged in and interested in the story but the dramatic plot beats did not have the same effect as they did in the first film. Yes, it was shocking when I discovered that Kay had her baby aborted instead of having a miscarriage but I cared less about her character than I did about Sonny, James Caan, in the first film or Connie, Talia Shire, who receives so little screen time. The end of The Godfather was so brilliant that it would be difficult to top it and while it could be argued that this film is more quiet and contemplative I still think it pales in comparison when compared to it's predecessor.\n\nThe biggest positives of the film are the performances as Shire and Pacino do some of their best work. Pacino combines the steely resolve he developed in the first film with a touch of sadness as he reminisces about the man he once was with the awareness he can never go back. Shire is fantastic in just a few scenes as we see her as a shameless floosy in her first scene but later witness her attempt to explain her actions and desperately try to convince her brother not to murder Fredo. The performers in the supporting cast are also reliably good as Duvall reprises his role as the loyal Tom Hagen successfully and Strasberg is convincing as the unexpectedly evil Hyman Roth. I don't know if I would have given Best Supporting Actor to De Niro because although he's decent Pacino steals the show from him.\n\nCoppola shows how talented he is as a director here as he weaves together a story that sometimes feels messy to make it coherent and extremely watchable. This film fully deserves the Best Picture award that it won despite strong competition like Chinatown (1974) and Lenny (1974). I wouldn't put it among the top ten Best Picture winners but it's a decision that has aged well and it's rabid fan base proves that it has critical and commercial appeal. Don't go in expecting something excellent but you will get great moments like Tom asking Michael \"Why do you hurt me Michael? I've always been loyal to you\" and really what more could you want from a film than seeing Pacino and Duvall together acting their hearts out, that's what we go to the cinema for.",

Coppola and Puzo alternate between two time lines ... taking material from the book that tells the story of Vito Corleone's rise to power and contrasting it with new material that shows the moral decline of Michael Corleone.  With the switches in the timelines happening at key points that emphasize the contrast between father and son, the movie becomes a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.  All of the performances are great, but it's especially striking seeing how restrained Pacino is here.  He's a commanding presence.  My one complaint would be that Diane Keaton is done a minor disservice being given a fairly dramatic change in character that nearly comes from nowhere.",

            "content": "A deep sequel that parallels father and son.\n\nDirector Francis Ford Coppola proves sequels can be nearly as good, creative, and thoughtful as their original with The Godfather Part II. Coppola challenges the viewer to look further into the depravity of the Corleone crime family. We see Michael Corleone grow older as the ascending Godfather while we witness the origins of Vito Corleone as the first Godfather. Coppola's choice to show these men simultaneously to parallel each other's lives is perhaps the best editing in any movie ever. Similarly, Coppola continues to make relations between Michael and Vito's path to criminality. The Godfather Part II is all about how families are made and break apart. This film establishes the tragedy of Michael Corleone.\n\nRobert De Niro stars as the young Vito Corleone coming from Italy to America. He is as brilliant and kind as the future killer. You get to witness his rise to the status of Godfather. These past sequences are the most engaging and entertaining segments of the movie.\n\nAl Pacino leads the family as Godfather in the present. He devolves into a cruel and calculating murderer unlike his more respectable father. The dichotomy of Michael and Vito is very clever visual metaphor on Coppola's part. He constantly compares their lives and trajectory with visual juxtaposition and unique edits. Pay attention to the transition edits to each era.\n\nThe supporting cast is quite engaging like the first film. Robert Duvall is still steadfast as Tom, Diane Keaton is sympathetic as the brushed aside Kay, Talia Shire is so lovable and misguided as Connie Corleone, John Cazale is pitiable as Fredo Corleone, and Lee Strasberg is contemptible as Hyman Roth. The Godfather Part II succeeds in casting compelling leads and supports throughout the film.\n\nFinally, the music of Nino Rota is comparably beautiful to the magnificent musical compositions in The Godfather. You will have The Godfather's theme song stuck in your head forever. The lush symphonic swells in the countryside to the haunting horns in the city are so memorable. Rota did a fantastic job scoring The Godfather Part II.\n\nIn all, I think The Godfather Part II is a worthy successor to the iconic legacy of The Godfather. It feels quite long and slow in parts, but your attention will be held throughout all the same. I also feel as wonderfully charismatic and horrifying as Pacino acts, he can overact a bit at times. Overall, this is a slick and clever narrative told in a stunningly creative fashion. You'll want to revisit The Godfather Part II every year.",

That said, Coppola and Puzo succeeded in writing a much more somber script for this sequel, as well as include more complex subtext regarding capitalism.

After I initially watched the first film I thought it was only OK, and definitely not my kind of film. However when I revisited it, I found it was basically a masterpiece. My initial impression of Part 2 is similar to Part 1, it has elements that are excellent but I don't know how much I liked watching it. Even though the drama in this film is within the family and not from the outside, it felt oddly LESS personal. I wasn't sympathizing with Michael like I did in the first movie, even though he was facing opponents from every side. But I want to watch again, because I think when I go back I might appreciate more of the subtlety in what Michael is doing. The part of the film that I found most interesting was actually the flashbacks to Vito's rise to power. I had some minor quibbles with the way it was presented, but most of that stuff was fascinating. De Niro is stellar, and he gets some of the best moments in the film. I'm still trying to decide how I felt about the structure of The Godfather: Part II. The interweaving of Vito's past with Michael's present didn't always make sense to me, and some of the awkward time jumps were jarring. However, I recognize there is quality in this film, I can see the elements that people enjoyed, I just need more time with it and perhaps my appreciation for it will grow.",

Although compared to the novel, Fredo Corleone is portrayed as unfairly stupid, I still loved his character.  He is just so tragic.  All he wants is respect.  I also loved the flashback scenes, as I felt that they had a great authenticity to them.  De Niro was great as a young Vito Corleone.

Francis Ford Coppola unfolds two story lines of Michael Corleone as crime boss (in the present) and Michael's father's escape from Sicily and creation of the crime family (from the past).  The inter-play of the two stories is done with graceful transitions.  The beauty and symmentry of Coppola's film is outstanding.  Pacino, De Niro and the rest of the cast creates a film energy which enthralls the audience.  Pacino's line \"senator we are all part of the same hypocrisy\" resoates the brilliance of the Michael Corleone character.  The Godfathers Part two sub stories of betrayal, honor, dishonor,  dishonesty and cleverness make for a great story.  A movie which left an impact on me.  4 and half stars.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part 2 has a really really tough act to follow. The first film was loved by pretty much everyone. However Godfather 2 is one of the best sequels ever made, no doubt about it. In this film we get some of the original cast returning, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton but we also get Robert De Niro giving one of the best performances of his career. Francis Ford Copolla returns to direct and just like last time his direction is flawless. The music is absolutely fantastic, the main theme is one of the best pieces of music ever made for a film. This film focuses on two plots, the first one is about Michael Corleone running the family business as he has to deal with attempted murder, betrayals within his inner circle and the law catching up with him. Al Pacino gives another great performance in this movie, I love seeing him as the boss who pulls all the strings, it's really great. The second storyline follows Robert De Niro who plays a young Don Vito Corleone as we learn about his past, see him become a feared man and plot for revenge against the mob boss who ruined his family. Robert De Niro is fantastic as Don Vito, it's probably his second best performance behind Travis from Taxi Driver. This film while not as violent as the original is quite dark, the violence feels more personal and the drama feels more real. In my opinion quite possibly the best part of this movie is the ending. SPOILER ALERT the two ending for the two characters are both very different and it's great to see two types of ending. With Robert De Niro it's a fairly happy ending for him. He's built his way up the crime ladder and is know a feared and respected man, he gets his revenge on the man who killed his family and he has a loving wife and family, he basically has everything he wants. However Michael loses his wife, loses his mother, has to have his brother Fredo killed after he betrayed him and has pretty much lost most of the stuff that matters to him. I feel that is the perfect ending as Michael had everything and now he's lost almost everything that matters. In one of the flashbacks right at the end we see Michael with all his family when they were alive however they all leave the room until he's on his own. You don't get many endings better than this. Overall the Godfather 2 is a fantastic sequel that is one of the few that is able to live up to the originals legacy. This film is close to perfect, it's one of the best movies ever made and one of my favorite movies of all time. This film is in my opinion equal to the first film although if I had to pick one it would be this one. See this film now.  A+",

Modern directors can learn from films like this; instead of changing the shot every 5 seconds to a new angle, sometimes it is much better to just leave the camera in one spot and let the actors act.

With Pacino's compelling performance completing Michael's transformation into a ruthless, moral-torn Mafia boss, Robert De Niro's Academy Awards- winning portrayal of young Vito is a character born from tragic misfortune. With Michael Corleone leading the family, the chronicle of one man's deal with the devil challenges human dilemmas at best: Has Michael's seedy business that's filled with murder and mayhem made him a family man of integrity he thought he is? Or has this so-called business of protecting his family is somehow a desperate measure for one man's rise to totalitarian power? Say what you want 'cause judging from the surprising third-act, Michael has chosen the path of becoming the man he thought he would never be, a one-way ticket without looking back - a fearful man that embodies insecurity and cold-heartedness all in the name of business. However, his father, Vito Corleone was a man of contrast - he fought injustice and would do anything to defend what he once lost as a kid - family. Such simultaneously parallel play on both traits, the kind and compassionate nature against the vile and ruthless tragic hero, had single-handedly shaped one of Coppola's finest period pieces to date.",

            "content": "Unlike its predecessor, a film which trudges along at a slow and somewhat tired pace, The Godfather: Part 2 is filled to the brim with energy and power, never stopping to breathe in a story which packs more human drama than the prior entry into the franchise. The story revolves around the paranoia Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is experiencing after being nearly killed by one of his own, and as he dangerously navigates his alliances, hoping to rid himself of the threat to his family and himself, we see his slow decline into a man who trusts few and goes out no more. As his life breaks down, we sympathize with him on a human level; something that we couldn't do with The Godfather's Vito Corleone, a man who was too powerful to possibly feel anything but respect for. \n\nGordon Willis' cinematography is all lavish and subtle, far more so than the original, and draws little attention away from the characters. His effectiveness in regards to long takes and contrasting colour palettes establish the prowess of the actors and the beautiful scenery with what seems like ease, and he never seems to miss a beat, whether the camera is moving through crowds or through hallways. Coppola advances the scope for the film, addressing multiple timelines and ranging stories over multiple continents, but he ultimately never loses focus of the struggle that the present day Michael Corleone is experiencing, nor the rapid rise of a young Vito Corleone, played expertly by Robert De Niro in an award winning performance. \n\nUltimately, many will still prefer the first film to the second, and one shan't be judged for such; Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone in the original installment can't be challenged by neither Al Pacino nor De Niro's efforts. But what makes The Godfather: Part 2 so much better is its energy. Raw and unbridled, the story moves fluently and without delay, running through the available plots with smart pacing and invigorating effectiveness. As Michael slowly degrades in his ability to control his friends and family, we see that these characters we're viewing are human; as much as we want them to be sure of themselves and to carry through, they can fail. There is more risk and peril in the second part of this series of films, allowing for more drama, and what unravels is a story about trust, lack thereof and morality, and how no one in this world is invincible.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II is a big surprise for me and I would dare say it is one of the best movies ever made and probably one of the best sequels ever made this is also an example of a sequel that acts as a superior to the original. This movie takes place after and before the events of the first film where Michael Corleone conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. But he also learns that his old companion Hyman Roth is now trying to kill him, Fredo turns against him and his marriage to Kay is now strained. Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies in completing his own corruption. While the events before the Godfather explains the rise of young Vito Corleone and the birth of his son Michael. I seriously love this film and in my opinion this movie seriously surpass the original in many ways and it is the best in the Godfather series since the original if the first film is an outstanding movie with loads of memorable moments that people will never forget, the sequel is a stunning masterpiece that surpassed the original movie. What makes The Godfather Part II a superior to the original is that the film's plot is more intriguing than the original and I love how the movie is focused on two stories in one film one is the origins of the young Vito Corleone the second is the rise and fall of Michael Corleone and Francis Ford Coppola succeeded in combining two stories in one film and he delivers a fresh sequel that is seriously better than the original I mean 100% better than the first film. One of the other highlights of this film is that the film also retains its themes and tones that are similar to the first film's tones and themes even the cinematography, soundtrack and editing as well but even better than in the original plus I also love how this movie is more compelling than the first film and I adore the style and execution of this sequel I was also fund of how this movie further expands the myths and history of the Corleone family and the pacing is almost like the first film. The other highlights of this movie is that this film has loads of scenes that are even more memorable than the first film and there are lots of scenes that are a lot more better than in the first film and they are more memorable than the scenes in the first film I'm serious about it(Hyman Roth's death, Fredo's death, Scenes with the young Vito Corleone portrayed by the great Robert De Niro and the dramatic sequences with Kay and Michael along with Fredo and Michael and the scenes with Michael in Havana)and the look of the film is just captivating and visually stunning at the same time. Now the acting is the second true highlight of this film next to the memorable moments of this film and all of the returning casts seriously exceeded their performances from the first film even the new casts did a very good job with their performances as well. Al Pacino delivered a much better performance in his role as the great Michael Corleone and seriously he delivered an even better performance in this sequel to the first Godfather check out the scene where he talks with Fredo and the scene where he argues and slaps Kay in the face his performance is an Oscar for me. The same can be said to Diane Keaton as Michael's wife Kay along with the other returning casts from the first film. And from the new casts Robert De Niro is the best out of all the new casts and his performance as the young Vito Corleone is an Oscar and Academy award winning performance I love the way he portrayed the young Vito Corleone it seriously fits well for him and this is his best film out of all the films he performed in the later on years in his superb filmography and all of the casts deliver an Oscar performance so far. Director Francis Ford Coppola did a very good job once again in creating another Godfather film and he seriously did a better job with his work on this film than in the first film and he once again turned Mario Puzo's screenplay into a visually stunning masterpiece that beats the original and this film shows proof that Francis Ford Coppola is one of Hollywood's legendary filmmakers in the film industry and he is one smart director when he made one of the best films of all time. The Godfather Part II is an overall stunning movie that surpassed the original thanks to the exceeded performances from the casts and the film's improved and fresh visual style. This movie gets an 11/10. If the first film is an outstanding movie with lots of memorable moments the sequel is a stunning masterpiece with even more memorable moments than the original and this movie will remain as one of the best sequels ever made in the history of cinema.",

The film is remarkably effective at drawing parallels and continuing themes throughout the two stories.  Additionally, both Al Pacino and Robert De Niro give outstanding performances; especial De Niro, who does an incredible job at mirroring Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone.  Coppola's directing is also amazing, as it draws the audience into the film and makes it an experience.

Mostly I miss Brando and this second outing is ten times darker. There isn't any hope as Michael's descent into organized crime and simultaneous rise as the new don of the Corleone family. I do enjoy the backstory of Vito, played by Robert De Niro. You can see the like father like son as Coppola once again uses his mastery of juxtaposition and light and dark to convey how one life cannot live with the other and that one man cannot be master of both. There are many spiritual themes in both parts 1 and 2 captured in the intimate moments where lies become hate and death patiently waits in the minds of betrayed and unforgiving outcasts as it picks off anyone and everyone one by one. Michael truly becomes a villain in this story and one that far surpasses the crimes of his father, Vito, in the early days in New York. Vito's struggle is one born of desperation and vengeance. The sins of the father, paved with good intentions, are passed onto the son who turns on anyone who hurts him. Every good word and thought is twisted and all we are left with is one last Hail Mary and a bullet. Life and death.",

By giving him the original role he auditioned for but set many years in the past, it's great how everything works out like that. It's great that he wasn't put into any supporting roles in the first film because the fantastic acting by him is some of the best. It really shows that he loved the role, as soon as he is introduced he looks very much like a young Vito should, the make up department does it again.\n\nThe Godfather part II is a worthy continuation of the story in the first part, it showcases the rise of Vito Corleone and the decline of Michael's morality and it all weaves together perfectly, both stories are shown at the same time via time skips. At the start the time frame of each story felt evenly dispensed but as the film progressed they began to be individual lengths, sometimes only cutting to Michael's story for a few minutes before going back to Vito's story. \n\nI think it's amazing how well both films are made, considering that this used very little from the book and the first was adapted from the book but left young Vito out of the first film, it's all paced very well and the hefty run time of 3 hours and 20 minutes really does speed by very fast. The story is of course brilliant and has a few twists and turns and it is all very interesting. \n\nBesides that though, the real masterclass here is the acting, this film boasts a huge and distinguished cast of acting legends, everybody here really does do an amazing job, they're all Oscar worthy performances but Robert De Niro was the only acting winner here, it's amazing, he was still relatively unknown at the time and arguably gave one of the best performances in one of the most successful series of all time and all accomplished by speaking about only two lines of English, his career went booming after this and deservedly so. Al Pacino was intense, the decline of his character's morality feels real but he still manages to be a well rounded character, the scenes with his children show that he does genuinely have a care for them. You can tell when he's about to blow, though, it's all in the eyes and it's excellent. Besides the main two, I'm not gonna list everyone because they're all excellent, even when some characters are brought back for a final flashback scene, it's just some of the best acting in history. The music is of course iconic and very memorable and something else that caught my attention was the beautiful cinematography of it all, it was all very clear and very nice to look at. \n\nOverall, it is an excellently made film that raised the bar for all sequels and everything was done amazingly. Perfect acting, amazing story telling and great dialogue, 3 hours and 20 minutes have never been so engaging. I wanted more and I wanted to see it again straight after.",

This is very much just a finishing of the story that started in the first film. If that one could be subtitled \"The Fall of Michael Coreleone\" this one would be \"The Continuing Fall of Michael Corleone,\" and that just isn't as compelling an arc. I felt the first film basically established where Michael's character was headed and this film simply traces that inevitable development. The moment at the end of the first film where Michael shuts the door on his suspicious wife said everything that you might need to know about where their relationship was headed. And then surprise surprise, they actually do fall apart. A second scene at the end of this film where Michael shuts the door on her is not nearly as powerful as the first, although it achieves its goal of feeling crueller. In all, this felt like the direct continuation of a story that didn't really need a continuation.\n\nMichael's enigmatic stoicism was perfectly fine in the first film since he had several other characters to bounce ideas off of, but here his actions are largely inexplicable. The film ends in several pointless deaths that do nothing to advance his interests and merely represent his wrath. The point is that he has sunk to a completely irredeemable level of vileness and isolation but since we rarely hear his reasoning his descent is basically uncharted. I liked Marlon Brando a lot in the first one, although I didn't understand the overblown praise for his performance, and his presence as a father and mentor is really missing here. Michael shared his thoughts with him a bit more than he does with anyone else. All he has now is his brother Fredo and consiliere Tom, and neither of them are really privy to his inner workings.\n\nRobert De Niro is as amazing in this film as you might expect, though I don't really get why he was cast. With the exception of two or three short phrases in English his entire dialogue is in Italian, a language De Niro doesn't speak. Judging from internet sites he did his usual method acting thing and gets the Sicilian accent and pronunciation perfect, but why didn't they just hire a Sicilian actor to play the part? Or give him some English lines? Any English lines? I get that in Little Italy they'd have spoken largely Italian but they must have used some English.\n\nThe cinematography also seems less impressive than in the last film. While the shots are still good none of them match the distinctive quality of the first film. That one had some memorable scenes, especially when it came to hits or potential hits. Here there is only one memorable hit and it comes towards the end. This is partially a problem with scripting as well of course since the film doesn't really provide many cinematic moments that can be treated in that distinctive clinical yet exotic way. The best scene is the final one, although initially I thought it was pointless and random. It's a flashback to the time before the first film where the whole family was alive and everybody was relaxing before Michael tells them he's joining the army. It tells us nothing about why he became who he did, but as the scene goes on it gets more and more confusing as we are reminded of who Michael originally was. At this point in the film you've forgotten how far Michael has sunk so this completely ordinary scene manages to quite powerfully convey its message without the need for any flashy scriptwriting. He was just an idealistic kid, and while elements of his later life are certainly there (his brooding sullenness for example) it's hard to see the killer lurking in the wings. It's a good scene and a powerful one that manages to completely twist what we've just seen around and returns us to the question of why. But this brings me right back around to my original point: that this film seems just like the end to the last one. I feel like this would be better served as one film so that we could see his fall starting from the beginning instead of coming in halfway.",

The first Godfather was a wonderful stepping stone to this masterpiece of art, and is the only true 'Renaissance' film. Ever since the first film, audiences wanted to see Michael truly taking the position of Don Corleone - and it is breathtaking. Immigration is at the center of the heart. Michael was never meant to be Don even if he believes and truly has what it takes. The Sicilian kind heart of Vito is lost and corruption ensues. The flashback sequences accompanied by a fine-tuned score by Nino Rota make this film a combination of two masterpieces, and thus my favorite film of all time.",

Now thats not to say that the original isnt worth merit, not at all, infact the original has next to nothing wrong with it, its just that with 25 minutes more, here we manage to fit in so much  more material that your left drooling for its running time. Part 2 is split into 2 segments that flip back and forth throughout the piece. Part one is a continuation of the first film, we follow Michael Corleone 7 years after we left him, struggling to lead a crime free life that he promised his wife Kay, Keaton. His money and efforts have gone into funding casinos and hotels, however this finds him playing a dangerous game and after an assassination attempt on his life, Michael meets with an associate Hymen Roth in order to settle a deal, leaving Tom to protect his family back home. Along the way his family pop up from time to time and a mass web of deciet and muddled plots emerge leaving Michael in one hell of a predicament. The other part to this story is a flashback to the early 1900's where we learn about Don Vito Corleone, about his life growing up, having his children and starting his empire from the ground up. Its a riveting tale and who is better to play the part of a young Brando than the man himself Robert De Niro. He kills it. he literally thumps it out the park and plays Vito down to a T. The sections sound like way too much is going on in them to work side by side however Coppola knows when to run with either angle and the resonation of respect, family and love keep these 2 stories flowing beuatifully. The outstanding script work and cinematography is back, almost identical but not feeling over used. The acting from everyone again is just majestic and the running time doesnt effect the flow at all, it does come with an intermission for viewers with weak bladders or small attention spans. However this film is so brilliantly crafted it just flows perfectly and allowing a pause for me just ruins the flow. Yes there is a lot more to it, its longer and some audience members may not find this a pleasant watch. However its electrifying and heart wrenching story is just too good to miss out on.",

I like this one just a little better because the pacing in this one is much better and I like the presentation they have on this one better. \nNow that that's out of the way, let's talk about The Godfather: Part II. This time around, the story is a little bit different. The story is about how Michael Corleone is trying to expand the family business in Lake Tahoe, Nevada and Havana, Cuba while it's also telling the backstory of Don Vito Corleone before he was a Don. The story is a rise and fall story... Sort of. While Vito Corleone is becoming somewhat famous in New York, his son, Michael Corleone, is ascending deeply and his family is falling apart. Honestly, I feel like I liked Vito's story more than I liked Michael's only because it's more entertaining watching Vito be successful. The score for this movie, composed by Nino Rota,is still amazing with that main theme song stuck in your head for the next few days. The acting is still amazing, but sadly, this movie has no Marlon Brando or James Caan, but we now have the great addition of Robert De Niro which the series needed. De Niro's version of Vito Corleone isn't as good as Brando's role as the older Vito, but he's close. That's pretty much all I have to say...",

The 3rd best movie I've seen, as well as the best sequel and prequel ever made.  Hard to believe the sequel measures up to the original, huh?  If you really pay attention to the film and focus on its narrative and narrative structure, you'll see why some people (including me) consider this on par to the original Francis Ford Coppola masterpiece.  Continuing Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Part II follows two different stories, Michael Corleone in 1958 protecting his family business ventures after a failed attempt of his life, and Vito Corleone escaping from Sicily in 1901, traveling to New York, raising his family, and establishing the Corleone crime family.  This film does everything The Godfather did, but adds a few new things in order to keep up with the cinematic landmarks the original made.  This film does the usual crime formula by adding in tons of graphic violence and language, giving it the traditional look.  Part II also explores a darker look at the American Dream, and exploring themes of morality, family, loyalty, tradition, power, integrity, and responsibility.  Part II also has the ability to change between time periods at the right time, whether it's focused on a certain character or event, it remains well-timed and relevant.  Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo are able to input the incredible storytelling from the first, and are able to keep everything balanced, as well as keep the pace even, despite the fact the sequel is longer, at 3 hours, 20 minutes.  The length allows tons of depth into the film, showcasing tons of emotional complexity, including complex characterization.  Coppola is able to get the most out of his incredible cast, and is able to capture the look and feel of each scene to a fault, showcasing that the first film helped him craft a masterful film that won him an Oscar for his work (as well as writing), despite wrongfully losing for the first film (although he won for writing, and WHY??????!!!!!!).  The cast showcase some of the best performances ever put to film, and main actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are the undoubted best.  Pacino captures everything about Michael, from his emotion and reaction to events, to his devotion to work and family, and lost an Oscar for it (so ridiculous.  **** YOU ACADEMY!!!!!!).  De Niro won his first Oscar by capturing the physical and emotional struggle Vito went through in New York, as well as convincingly speaking Italian for almost all the times he speaks.  Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola capture the mood of each scene, and craft one of the most iconic scores in film history, and Gordon Willis' work as a cinematographer is undeniable as he captures each scene with finesse, and the camera angles help with the music.  This film is true filmmaking at its best, and a must-see for true film fanatics.",

            "content": "This film is a sequel to one of the most celebrated films of the 70's. A lot of people would give this full marks but I for one did not think this held up along with the first film. I think maybe Chinatown or The Conversation should have maybe won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nThis film is a continuation of Michael Corleone's position as the Don and detailing on his goal to make the Corleone family legitimate. At the same time, it also shows the beginnings of Vito Corleone. This is, for me, where the good and the bad side of the film is apparent. I'm going to start with the bad side. What made the film so great was that it was really a focus on family and the culture of the Italian people. This film feels like it just focuses on Michael and the consequences of his actions, the destruction of relationships and the creation of enemies. The business being focused on in this film, in Michael's story, doesn't work a lot for me as I find it a little boring. Hyman Roth is so dull as a villain that I did not care whether or not he succeeds or fails. The good side of the film is the focus on Vito Corleone's rise in New York in the early 20th century. It's very fascinating on how he became who he is as it's supported with an interesting villain, Fannuci. The crumbling of Michael's soul is definitely an aspect that I liked, as we felt that he has definitely changed since the beginning of the first film; but I wish the story behind it was just stronger.\n\nCoppola did not exactly screw this film up, it's definitely strong and the more you watch it the stronger it gets but I felt his work on the first was most definitely his best within the trilogy. It was brilliant on how he decided to have this film edited. Juxtaposing the rise of both father and son and how different in the direction both of them go, gives it much more weight and effect. The man pretty much made a sequel and prequel at the same time and not be a disappointment.\n\nGordon Willis, like in the first film, creates this feeling of an old photograph due to the image giving off this golden hue. The film really feels like a period film, and it helps us feel like we are watching a film created in that time. I guess Willis didn't really get much from this film compared to the first because it's not something new. Nevertheless the photography is still strong even today.\n\nThe music here is a little different and at times a little darker but that's just because of Michael's fall from grace. It still has that iconic music by Nino Nota from the first film and when it appears, you get this feeling of nostalgia.\n\nThe acting was excellent as expected. Pacino was able to make this character who was frightening without doing much. There are many moments where this guy feels really ruthless. The supporting cast was also great like the first film but there is a shift in focus on Michael rather than the whole family. In the flashback sequences, Robert De Niro was the only one really focused on and the rest had very little to do. De Niro may have gained more popularity in Scorsese's Mean Streets but I think this is where he really shines and where everybody took notice of him. Lee Strasberg was fine in playing a villain who really doesn't do a lot, he doesn't even feel threatening but Gaston Moschin as Fanuuci was fantastic. The man showed the he owns this side of town and everybody must respect him or else. Overall they are all deserving of credit.\n\nI may be a minority who think this film is not a masterpiece but I just do not find it as strong as the first as Michael's storyline felt flat. The flashback storyline and terrific acting and direction makes this film a must watch.",

The original film had several powerful and transcending scenes that will always be remembered in film history which helped captivate the viewer and cause them to forget about the films length. Unfortunately for me I think that Part II simply does not have as many of these scenes as the original. This causes the length of Part II to stick out and really become more noticeable and more of an issue.",

I do like the second installment of the trilogy more than the original Godfather film, no disrespect to Marlon Brando and James Caan, who was absolutely brilliant in the first film. But this film was so wonderful, with the conspiracy and betrayal plot, it was absolutely intriguing! I also like Michael's (Pacino) transformation from the reluctant successor to the full-fledge Godfather, but I guess you can't appreciate the character's evolution without having seen the first film, so in that way the first and second film really compliment each other well. The performance of the cast was marvelous, what a stellar ensemble, they all did a beautiful job and there wasn't a dull or unconvincing performance in the group, even Diane Keaton (who plays Kay Adams), whom I felt gave the least convincing, weakest performance in the entire film but still wasn't as bad as the performance of some leads in movies now-a-days.

When you see how far things have come at the end of this film, the change feels monumental. Robert De Niro as a young Vito Corleone is a strong addition to the movie and it provides a lot of insights from this character we didn't know much about in the first movie. The parallel between father and son is shown skillfully and the movie keeps you invested and paying attention. It does feel overlong and sometimes the movie is much more dialogue focused, which makes it seem uneventful in places.

Meanwhile, the other half of the movie stays focused on the Michael Corleone's taking over the family business. He acts completely different from the way his father did. Perhaps it is because the change of time and it could be because of his relatively reckless and ambitious features. He felt compelled to wipe out all his enemies.

            "content": "It is practically common knowledge among film nerds that a large majority of sequels to critically acclaimed films result in mediocrity for nearly every sequel is usually far inferior to the original. The reason sequels usually are not as good as the originals is because filmmakers often don't know what worked about the original and end of either retreading the same exact plot of the first film or making a huge tone shift from the original. One example of a sequel that does retread the first film exactly is Back to the Future Part II which quite literally shows the exact same footage as the first film just with different perspectives. While there are many awful sequels like Superman IV the Quest for Peace and Star Wars Episode I the Phantom Menace, there are several amazing sequels like Star Wars Episode V the Empire Strikes Back and The Dark Knight. Every great sequel explores the depth of their characters even more with new and unique stories rather than retreading old ideas and perhaps the greatest sequel of all time is Francis Ford Coppola's follow up to his masterpiece, The Godfather, with The Godfather Part II. I was given the privilege of witnessing both Part I and Part II in theaters with a 6 hour and 30 minute Godfather marathon; while certainly long seeing both back to back perfectly displays the uprising and downfall of Don Vito Corleone's son Michael who I personally view as not only the main character but also the most complex and memorable. The Godfather Part II parallels two separate characters' lives, Vito and son Michael Corleone which besides creating a more unique narrative also serves to further contrast the moral state of both men. Coppola could have easily just focused on Michael's story yet he understood the importance of Michael's own moral suicide, so to further express that aspect of the character the director chose to show the early life of Vito Corleone as a more morally respectable man. The characters of this universe are incredibly well realized while always feeling like real people for it is the characters that make The Godfather series such a memorable addition to the gangster genre.  Of course the man behind the camera is the person responsible for creating such a fantastic film and that is writer, producer and director Francis Ford Coppola who is practically a god among film fanatics. He is a true artist of presentation for every single frame of this film humongous 3 hour and 20 minute running time is meticulously crafted aided exponentially by the beautiful soundtrack that easily is on my top five favorite soundtracks of all time. The presentation of Part II and Part I for that matter is the true definition of masterful. My one piece of criticism for this entry in the series is simply that Michael's general plot line is somewhat convolutedly told with not a whole lot of explanation to certain characters and or events, I felt the first film was much stronger in terms of general plot. While The Godfather is indeed a better film, that goes without saying considering the original is a masterpiece of cinema; however the fact that The Godfather Part II is almost as good as the original is an incredible feet because it means that this film is an amazing film. The Godfather Part I-II both culminate into a historic achievement in American film making that is nearly flawless.",

This film has an even broader scope than the original, but does not fall into making the film bigger because thats what sequels should do, its bigger because it needs to be.

And we see this idea, that the family needs to be protected at all cost, taken to its extreme logical conclusion, with Michael killing his own brother.\n\nPart II also adds to the stakes of family by having a parallel story of Vito building the family in the last generation.\n\nIn the end, Michael is able to protect the family, but at the cost of having torn it apart: having killed his own family members and casting his wife out.\n\nPart II is a great film that takes the premise to its gut-wrenching extreme but logical conclusion. It makes us question the idea that the ends justify the means that we bought wholesale in Part I.\n\nRedemption would be called for in The Godfather: Part III, but as we shall see, it will not come easily.\n\nMy Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",

            "content": "This film is a sequel to one of the most celebrated films of the 70's. A lot of people would give this full marks but I for one did not think this held up along with the first film. I think maybe Chinatown or The Conversation should have maybe won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nThis film is a continuation of Michael Corleone's position as the Don and detailing on his goal to make the Corleone family legitimate. At the same time, it also shows the beginnings of Vito Corleone. This is, for me, where the good and the bad side of the film is apparent. I'm going to start with the bad side. What made the film so great was that it was really a focus on family and the culture of the Italian people. This film feels like it just focuses on Michael and the consequences of his actions, the destruction of relationships and the creation of enemies. The business being focused on in this film, in Michael's story, doesn't work a lot for me as I find it a little boring. Hyman Roth is so dull as a villain that I did not care whether or not he succeeds or fails. The good side of the film is the focus on Vito Corleone's rise in New York in the early 20th century. It's very fascinating on how he became who he is as it's supported with an interesting villain, Fannuci. The crumbling of Michael's soul is definitely an aspect that I liked, as we felt that he has definitely changed since the beginning of the first film; but I wish the story behind it was just stronger.\n\nCoppola did not exactly screw this film up, it's definitely strong and the more you watch it the stronger it gets but I felt his work on the first was most definitely his best within the trilogy. It was brilliant on how he decided to have this film edited. Juxtaposing the rise of both father and son and how different in the direction both of them go, gives it much more weight and effect. The man pretty much made a sequel and prequel at the same time and not be a disappointment.\n\nGordon Willis, like in the first film, creates this feeling of an old photograph due to the image giving off this golden hue. The film really feels like a period film, and it helps us feel like we are watching a film created in that time. I guess Willis didn't really get much from this film compared to the first because it's not something new. Nevertheless the photography is still strong even today.\n\nThe music here is a little different and at times a little darker but that's just because of Michael's fall from grace. It still has that iconic music by Nino Nota from the first film and when it appears, you get this feeling of nostalgia.\n\nThe acting was excellent as expected. Pacino was able to make this character who was frightening without doing much. There are many moments where this guy feels really ruthless. The supporting cast was also great like the first film but there is a shift in focus on Michael rather than the whole family. In the flashback sequences, Robert De Niro was the only one really focused on and the rest had very little to do. De Niro may have gained more popularity in Scorsese's Mean Streets but I think this is where he really shines and where everybody took notice of him. Lee Strasberg was fine in playing a villain who really doesn't do a lot, he doesn't even feel threatening but Gaston Moschin as Fanuuci was fantastic. The man showed the he owns this side of town and everybody must respect him or else. Overall they are all deserving of credit.\n\nI may be a minority who think this film is not a masterpiece but I just do not find it as strong as the first as Michael's storyline felt flat. The flashback storyline and terrific acting and direction makes this film a must watch.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers... but I assume you've already seen the film... right?\r\n\r\nI'll undoubtedly get shit for this, but I like The Godfather Part II more than the original. I know, I know... tear me apart, Rotten Tomatoes. But this sequel really sets the bar for sequels in general, and I thought it was fantastic. To be clear: I loved The Godfather, but only gave it 7/10 because I have been told by my parents for years that it was a religious experience, so I went in with impossible expectations. I'll probably revisit it sometime when I've had a chance to think on it.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Part II is a masterpiece. Most films that jump between storylines end up as a patchworked mess (I'm looking at you, Julie and Julia), but this is really exceptional storytelling. Moving between Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) empire's workings in the present and Don Vito's (Robert De Niro) origin story in the early 1900s, it works as a mesmerizing parallel between father and son in the best way possible.\r\n\r\n My two favorite actors of the time period are in the starring roles, so there really wasn't much of a chance that I wouldn't like this. De Niro does a fantastic Marlon Brando impersonation, and is fantastic to watch as he impresses even himself with his capability to bend others to his will. Pacino is meanwhile given the difficult task of rooting out betrayal amongst his ranks, leading to the goosebump-inducing line \"You broke my heart, Fredo. You broke my heart.\"\r\n\r\nOther incredible and memorable moments include the origin of \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse,\" and of course, the tale behind the coining of the phrase \"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\" As always, the rest of the cast is just as spellbinding as the leads, which is bolstered mostly by Robert Duvall's work as the distant and intractable lawyer Tom. \r\n\r\nThe brother VS brother aspect of the film is really taken to the max, when Michael disavows Fredo and refuses to speak to him ever again. When he orders his own brother's death, it's a powerful fucking moment. He stands at the bay window of his Lake Tahoe mansion, watching as Fredo is shot while fishing out on a boat. I can't write a review as Shakespearian as the dialogue in this movie, so I feel like I'm not living up to the standards... so I'll just say it's powerful, powerful fucking shit.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for The Godfather Part II: 9/10 stars. As always, a four-hour movie will have its fair share of somewhat unnecessary scenes, but this film is practically watertight. I can't think of many scenes I'd cut off the top of my head. But like I said, it may not be my favorite over the first... I just had my expectations built up too high for the original. So I'll revisit it soon, whenever I feel like sitting down and watching a movie for four hours.\r\n\r\nAlso, how cool would it be if in Finding Dory, Marlin's last name is revealed to be Brando? That would fucking RULE.",

The primary reason why \"The Godfather, Part II\" feels less cohesive than its predecessor is because of the inclusion of the 'flashback' scenes, which are focused on young Vito Corleone's rise into power. While these scenes are well-made and well-acted, they impact the rest of the film in almost no way, and it half-feels like they were just tacked on increase the running length.

            "content": "Remarkable. Sensational. An epic the likes of which we'll never see again. Since I added 'The Godfather' to my Great Movies list, it's only fair that I add 'The Godfather: Part II', because - after all - it is a better movie. And that's saying a lot.\r\n\r\n'The Godfather: Part II' is everything the first film is not. The first film is a Hollywood motion picture to the umph degree. The story structure is the basic three act structure. The second film is contemporary and sporadic. The story chaotically swings one way, and then another. It is suspenseful and imaginative, and damn good filmmaking.\r\n\r\nMichael is now the Don, with Fredo and Tom as his only brothers left. Trying to rack up more political power in Nevada, they're new location, Michael makes enemies fast. The only question: Who is the enemy? It could be a number of people: Hymon Roth - Vito's old business buddy, who may be trying to cut Michael out of the business deal in Cuba. Frankie - The head of the Clamenza family. Frankie is angry at Michael for doing business with his enemies, the Rosatta Brothers. Along the way, more and more suspects, yet the actual link is a surprise to both us and Michael.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that we discover the foe at the midpoint of the film. Through the second of the movie, we see Michael's world falling apart in front of his eyes. All this playing against a second story: The past life of Vito Corleone. It is interesting that Michael makes many of the same choices that his father makes. But, as Michael says, \"Times are changing.\" Indeed, they are. Vito lives in prosperity with his wife and children for the rest of his life, while Michael loses everything he loves.\r\n\r\nOf course, the other obvious difference is the production value, which is much more gratuitous. Every inch of the frame in every shot is filled with beautiful images. Extras by the thousands, massive sets, incredible costumes. But, the movie wisely doesn't over produce. The streets are still dirty, and the windows have fingerprints. The camera operation is widely enhanced, and again, more contemporary than its predecessor. Copolla focuses more on abstract shots, while maintaining the epic spirit of the first film.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the story is simply more engulfing. The relationship between Kay and Michael is the greatest screen relationship of all time. It's the only thing that saved 'The Godfather: Part III\". I wish there were more scenes between them in this film. The sequence where Kay reveals the truth about a certain accident is both shocking and intriguing. Diane Keaton; what happened to her? She used to do movies like this! Now she does films like, \"Because I Said So\". How did this happen? Please, Diane Keaton, do more films like this! Same goes for Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, both of whom do great in this movie. You do a film like 'The Godfather: Part II' and then start taking roles in trite like 'Righteous Kill'?\r\n\r\nI can't recommend the film enough. It's beautiful, and the score is breathtaking. What an influencial movie. Probably, I'd say, one of the most important movies ever made, not just for what it did for the film industry, but for what it accomplished in popular culture and political influence. How truly wonderful to witness a part of history. 'The Godfather: Part II' is a relic, a holy artifact that will live on in the same light as The Mona Lisa.",

There's something about the very nature of a sequel that somehow means it can't be as good as what came before it- this film defies that and gets away with it- why? Well, who'd wanna start a fight with Pacino or De Niro  as they are here!?\n\nWhen you watch this it quickly becomes clear that the first instalment was just that- an instalment, it was always going to go hand-in-hand with this one and that meant that not only would the sequel be as good, it would also be better thanks to the first film providing an exceptional framework for the next section of the story. The same can't really be said for the last instalment of the trilogy though and that's why The Godfather: Part 2 is my favourite of the three.\n\nIf you look at each element separately- this film should be a failure, nothing more than pasting parts of Puzo's work that couldn't be fit into the first instalment. Of course, it isn't quite like that- this screenplay is planned and executed down to a tee which makes for a more satisfying watch than the first movie and makes for an all round better experience.\n\nThe real magic with this one is that it expands out without ever compromising what made the first film so great- nothing is lost here, simply more added. I swear it's movie trickery because that's just not something you'll see in many other sequels. \n\nNow despite this often being hailed as the best sequel in film history, it's still often seen as inferior to the first instalment and I entirely understand why- there is no doubt that this covers loose ends and that it has it's own loose ends also- it breaks tension through multiple stories and seems disorganised at times but the thing we need to remember is that, despite this, nothing fails in this film- it's gripping and exceptional, just as the first was, from start to finish. The first film has no flaws to overcome, it's a master of it's own destiny, this sequel didn't have it so easy, but it succeeded triumphantly anyway.\n\nThe stories of the Corleones are told so well that it just doesn't make sense to say that having more of them, as is the case here, is a bad thing.",

This film is pure brilliance of all elements that make a movie. The screenplay which like its predecessor is written by Puzo and Coppola is again a masterwork, and Coppola is very skilful in making sure that the two storylines gel naturally and letting the film run smoothly but with great intensity.

When I watch a gangster movie, I felt that the element of brutality was something that was lacking in the first Godfather, in that it came off too pretty and sophisticated, but I actually came to appreciate its dynamics in that the brutal scenes come as the plot escalates in that it serves as a contrast to the more sombre, melancholic elements of the film. I have to say that it brought forth something unique with that concept and gave the film a sense of grandeur that made it stick out in the crime genre.\n\nAnd the things The Godfather did in setting the bar, Part II further expands on its ideas and opts for a darker, malevolent approach that greatly differs from the first film that has more of a sense of warmth. To see Michael's transformation was astounding in the first film, but to see what he has become is gutwrenchingly heavy. What Don Vito Corleone created was a foundation for his family, and to see Michael become corrupted to the point, he would do anything to stay at the top is horrifyingly disturbing. What makes this performance so intense is the lack of any human emotion or empathy coming from Michael, that makes him just pure evil. What is brought to this role is the stuff of legends and I cannot give enough credit to Al Pacino. He deserves every amount praise bestowed upon him, but who I think shines just as much as Al in the film is Robert De Niro and his portrayal of a young Vito Corleone during his rise to power. I would have never thought it would feel natural to have someone other than Marlon Brando portray the original Don, but Robert De Niro actually exceeded my expectations. From his accent to his mannerisms, he got the character down to a hair.\n\nAnd not only with great performances, we are offered a great character study contrasting a father and son, and what drives these men to kill. We know how Michael came into his position, but as the film progresses we begin to see how Vito and Michael handle their business, as we see both their stories reach a conclusion that is downright brutal. The Godfather Part II shows what is set forth by Michael's rise to power and the movie retains its ambition, but becomes its own film that is gripping and memorable in its own unique character.\n\nI originally preferred the first one, but then I realized how much the second one is dependent on the first film. While the second one is more gripping, the first one is grandiose in that it was the first to bring out these great ideas and execute them in a way that is incomparable, but I like to see the first and the second as one long epic story in that it depicts the rise and fall of an empire and while I prefer the first one, the sequel does something different, adding different angles to the story that are equally as compelling, dramatic and shocking as the first one. To make a sequel that does just that was no easy feat and this is the mark of Francis Ford Coppola's talent as a director. Even if the first Godfather were to never have a sequel, it would still be awesome on its own, but to have a sequel that is this good is more than anyone could ask for from a great director. The Godfather Part II is a film that you should definitely not miss out on.",

We pick up a few years later than where The Godfather left off, with the Corleone family now firmly entrenched in Las Vegas.  But Michael (Al Pacino) just seems burdened by responsibilities and mostly he's a drag. Lee Strasberg is pretty great as his crime boss nemesis, however, and John Cazale is heart-breaking as weak brother Fredo.  There are some great set-pieces (in Cuba, in the Senate hearing, and in all those very dark shots by Gordon Willis). We also get to see Vito's early days (with De Niro aping the mannerism of Brando) and these also have a vitality and suspense that makes you wish there was a whole film taking place in this era.  But, in the end, the viewer gets ground down, just as Michael Corleone does (and Part 3 belongs to a very different Pacino).",

The best thing about this movie, for me, was the flashback sequences to Vito's early years, how he ended up living in America, how he got started in the mafia, how he made his first (I presume it was his first) kill, how he set up his most important element: Family. The absence of Marlon Brando is evident here, but its made up for as we have Robert De Niro playing the young Don Corleone. There is a vast difference between Michael and his deceased father, Vito. Vito immensly loved his family and it was evident that family was the most important thing to him. To Michael, that is not true. Note how he smacks Kay across the face, how he refuses to let her see his children, how he orders the execution of his brother Fredo. The final scene, where we got a flashback to the family at the table for Vitos surprise party, is quite a well executed scene, and it was interesting to see the familys reaction to Michael joining the Marines and that it was Sonny who introduced the despicable wife beater Carlo to Connie. Honestly, this film was pretty brilliant, but I, myself prefer the first film. This is definately one of the best sequels though",

It is a remarkable movie, but has some big problems... Problems which you can't simply overlook, and which manifest themselves more and more with repeated viewings.\r The film struggles to maintain the narrative and characters as defined in the first film. It's understandable that Michael has become embittered and has difficulty balancing the life as the 'Don', and that of a loving husband and father. But that element only exists because the movie insists on keeping Kay away from the actual truth about who Michael really is. When, towards the end of the movie, she discovers his duplicity and hard-edge, she is actually shocked..... Even though throughout the movie she clearly doesn't believe Michael's assurances about what he does for a 'living'. It's not enough to wonder where their family's wealth comes from, and it just makes no sense.\r The other major problem is from a Direction point of view. De Palma won an Oscar for this movie (he didn't win for The Godfather, which is a far, far better film!) but the narrative structure is pretty awful. Jumping between Vito (in 1920's New York) to Michael (in the late 50's/early 60's) isn't handled well. The popping back and forth, and the parallels in the two storylines is well crafted, but there are massive pockets in the movie where the pace just falls off. There is a need in the 'Vito' era to introduce the characters who appeared in The Godfather, just as there is a need in the 'Michael' era to tie it into contemporary 'big' events..... (in this case the build up to, and subsequent take-over, of Cuba by the Communist rebels).\r The bottom line is that the film falls well short of the brilliance of the original. Even so it's still a masterpiece compared to the truly awful Part III!!!\rYou don't need to see part II, if you've seen part I.... In fact I'd recommend reading the book, it's far more compelling!",

It's about Michael becoming mentally unstable during a period of time, and the Mafia doing things. However, that doesn't stop this film from having some filler padding like the original.This film is 3 and a half hours long! Why?! The whole Cuba segment could be taken out, some scenes here and there can be removed, I'm just baffled by these decisions. I understand wanting to show your entire vision, but it doesn't work as well when it's so long!The prequel part is great, but even that could be trimmed a bit. The sequel part drags on in my opinion.So I will say it's better than the original based on plot and characters (less characters to deal with and the characters have more development in this film). However, the first film was at least under 3 hours and had more of a unique vision (it felt more artistic).",

Receiving twelve Academy Award nominations, and again winning Best Picture (and this time Best Director forA companion piece in the truest sense of the term, The Godfather Part II garnered as much adulation as its predecessor, if not more. Receiving twelve Academy Award nominations, and again winning Best Picture (and this time Best Director for Coppola as well), the second installment has been rightfully hailed as the best sequel of all time.\r The Godfather Part II is a more ambitious production than the original since it attempts not only to tell a pair of completely disconnected stories, but to do so in parallel. The less time consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into power. The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the conclusion of The Godfather, and shows the means by which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba.\r Plot and counterplot develop, and Michael becomes the focal point of a web of betrayal and deceit, turned against by those he had sought to protect. Assassination attempts and government probes target Michael, but he fights back using every scintilla of ingenuity he possesses and sacrificing much of his humanity in the process.\r For a man constantly battling to keep his family together, a mournful irony of The Godfather Part II is that Michael's efforts succeed only in fragmenting it. If the end of the first film was numbing, this one is shattering. The flashback preceding the final scene presents a stark differentiation of how things once were from what they have become.\r The traditional elements of the Tragedy introduced in The Godfather reach their maturity in Part II. Much of the humanity remaining to Michael at the outset is leeched from him with each deception and setback. Late scenes with a resentful Fredo (John Cazale) and a bitter Kay (Diane Keaton) emphasize the price for Michael of continuing his father's dominion. His flaw is his imperceptiveness and, as is the case for any hero in a story of this nature, its effects are crippling.\r Primarily due to the scope of events, Part II is not as tightly-scripted as Part I. While most of the first film takes place in New York (with a few excursions elsewhere), here the settings vary: Sicily, Ellis Island, New York, Nevada, Cuba, Miami, Washington DC. In letting their characters escape the confines of the \"old neighborhood\", Coppola and Puzo lessen the intimacy of certain interpersonal conflicts.\r Visually, many of Michael's scenes have a more gloomy appearance this time around. Especially during the latter portions of the film, the don is shown in severely underexposed settings, appearing as a silhouette. His is a voice from the darkness - a photographic mirror of what's happening beneath the surface.\r As the beginning of Part II echoes the opening of The Godfather, so too does the end. Because of the manner in which circumstances are handled and considering the people involved, the impact here is more forceful. The tragic flaw has accomplished its poisonous, inevitable designs. Coppola punctuates both movies with a gut-twisting exclamation point.\r Combined, The Godfather and The Godfather Part II represent the apex of American movie-making and the ultimate gangster story. Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one. Beneath the surface veneer of an ethnic period piece, The Godfather is not so much about crime lords as it is about prices paid in the currency of the soul for decisions made and avoided. It is that quality which establishes this saga as timeless.",

Receiving twelve Academy Award nominations, and again winning Best Picture (and this time Best Director forA companion piece in the truest sense of the term, The Godfather Part II garnered as much adulation as its predecessor, if not more. Receiving twelve Academy Award nominations, and again winning Best Picture (and this time Best Director for Coppola as well), the second installment has been rightfully hailed as the best sequel of all time.\r The Godfather Part II is a more ambitious production than the original since it attempts not only to tell a pair of completely disconnected stories, but to do so in parallel. The less time consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into power. The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the conclusion of The Godfather, and shows the means by which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba.\r Michael lives his life and runs his business by two of his father's creeds: \"A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man\" and \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\" There are times, however, when those precepts fail as guiding principles, such as when a betrayal occurs from within the family. Broken trust arising from so intimate a source can be devastating.\r Plot and counterplot develop, and Michael becomes the focal point of a web of betrayal and deceit, turned against by those he had sought to protect. Assassination attempts and government probes target Michael, but he fights back using every scintilla of ingenuity he possesses and sacrificing much of his humanity in the process.\r For a man constantly battling to keep his family together, a mournful irony of The Godfather Part II is that Michael's efforts succeed only in fragmenting it. If the end of the first film was numbing, this one is shattering. The flashback preceding the final scene presents a stark differentiation of how things once were from what they have become.\r The traditional elements of the Tragedy introduced in The Godfather reach their maturity in Part II. Much of the humanity remaining to Michael at the outset is leeched from him with each deception and setback. Late scenes with a resentful Fredo (John Cazale) and a bitter Kay (Diane Keaton) emphasize the price for Michael of continuing his father's dominion. His flaw is his imperceptiveness and, as is the case for any hero in a story of this nature, its effects are crippling.\r Primarily due to the scope of events, Part II is not as tightly-scripted as Part I. While most of the first film takes place in New York (with a few excursions elsewhere), here the settings vary: Sicily, Ellis Island, New York, Nevada, Cuba, Miami, Washington DC. In letting their characters escape the confines of the \"old neighborhood\", Coppola and Puzo lessen the intimacy of certain interpersonal conflicts.\r Visually, many of Michael's scenes have a more gloomy appearance this time around. Especially during the latter portions of the film, the don is shown in severely underexposed settings, appearing as a silhouette. His is a voice from the darkness - a photographic mirror of what's happening beneath the surface.\r As the beginning of Part II echoes the opening of The Godfather, so too does the end. Because of the manner in which circumstances are handled and considering the people involved, the impact here is more forceful. The tragic flaw has accomplished its poisonous, inevitable designs. Coppola punctuates both movies with a gut-twisting exclamation point.\r Combined, The Godfather and The Godfather Part II represent the apex of American movie-making and the ultimate gangster story. Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one. Beneath the surface veneer of an ethnic period piece, The Godfather is not so much about crime lords as it is about prices paid in the currency of the soul for decisions made and avoided. It is that quality which establishes this saga as timeless.",

It is this flawless blending that gives it weight to match its presence.  If there is a better story about how power corrupts I can't think of it.  We see the young don dealing with a plot on his life, and then setting out to destroy his enemies while becoming a monster in the process.  At the end he is left alone, pondering the good man that he almost became.  Parallel to this are superbly realized segments focusing on the young Vito Corleone coming to America as a kid and beginning to make his mark among the tenement buildings of New York's Little Italy.  DeNiro is fantastic and lays down a prequel to Brando's classic performance.  One flaw: young Vito murders the local mafia boss without much provocation - the Godfather was supposed to be deadly, but just.  There was a scene that got cut where Vito stumbles across him sexually abusing a boy.  Like the first Godfather it juxtaposes thuggish brutality with the Italian reverence for family and Catholic tradition.  A great film.",

It won six Oscars in 1974 (best film, best supporting actor, best director, best adapted screenplay, best art direction and best soundtrack).After the resounding success of \"The Godfather\", any sequel was condemned to fail but, on the contrary, this film has managed to maintain it's level high and the same popularity, which is a rarity when we talk about sequels. I cannot make big negative reviews except, perhaps, the very long duration of the film. Al Pacino had probably one of the greatest performances of his life as actor. Irreproachable, he incorporated Michael with an almost petrifying naturalness. The same can be said of Robert De Niro that, with his performance, opened the way for other important works of his career like \"Goodfellas.\" Robert Duvall also had here one his most outstanding works. Those who like action scenes may not like this movie. Its a quieter film, where the deaths are violent but made with almost surgical precision. The Mafia does not kill at random. Tense from start to finish, it has a powerful suspense that holds the audience, but the complexity of the script, full of twists, can confuse the most inattentive, so pay attention.",

However, dispite The Godfather: Part II being 25 minutes longer Personally, this gets my vote for 'The Greatest Film Ever Made'. I felt that the only flaw with the original Godfather was that it dragged out a bit towards the end. However, dispite The Godfather: Part II being 25 minutes longer then the original Godfather, this doesn't happen in The Godfather: Part II. In fact, if anything, I wanted this film to go on for longer. The main reason it doesn't drag out dispite it's lenght is because of the transitional two storylines. The main story dealing with Micheal Corleones reign as the Don of the powerful Corleone family. Micheal is clearly a changed man since he took over the family after the death of his father, Vito Corleone, three years earlier. Becoming more and more ruthless, his wife Kay has realised that Micheal has become a vicous, cold and calcuative criminal. Towards the end, she also realises that there is no way back for Micheal and that even though he has gained the world, he has ultimately lost his soul. The other storyline deals with Vito Corleones rise to power(who is protrayed in an Academy-Award winning performance by Robert De Niro). After his family are slaughtered by a local mob boss in Sicily, he flees to America to start a new life. There, he befriends a young man named Genco, who gets Vito a job as a baker with his father. He later becomes friends with two other thugs, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio, who introduce him to a life of crime. However, they are being squeezed by a local mob boss, Don Fanuci, who orders them to pay protection. Instead of paying however, Vito kills Fanuci, and Vito himself starts his own family. The Godfather: Part II is a stunning film with fantastic performances from Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvell, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, Lee Strasberg and Micheal V.

The first film was long, but this one is half an hour longer, yet a lot less happens in it.

It's not \"Master of Disguise\" or \"Deuce Bigalo 2\". When I see reviewers mark a film so poorly and then rank other films that are throwaway crap, it easily shows how stupid they are.
