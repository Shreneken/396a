            "content": "If you have ever come out on the short end of a sibling rivalry and/or felt seriously wronged by a parent(s), you will probably connect nicely with \"East of Eden\" (1955). Since the majority of viewers meet these criteria it is easy to see why the film finds a new audience with each generation. And it is easy to understand the tears that are often shed by both first-time and repeat viewers.Although set at the start of World War I, the generational issues portrayed really had came to a head by the mid-1950's. Which is why the film was so timely and contemporary when it was released. It was Elia Kazan's troubled relationship with his own father that first attracted him to Steinbeck's novel and caused him to focus the film on the portion of the story that addressed this issue. Originally I ranked it a distant third in the James Dean film pecking order but over the years it has somehow passed \"Giant\" and \"Rebel Without a Cause\" IMHO, and I now find it to be clearly his best and more enduring work. It is a real actors/director's film, with just six significant characters and with especially good performances from Dean and from Julie Harris. Both were a bit old for their parts but Dean's boyish manner allowed him to sell the character and Harris (who had convincingly played a twelve year old just a few years earlier in \"Member of the Wedding\") looks the proper age in every scene except one (an outdoor scene shot in the bright sun). She struggles sometimes with reining in her sophistication but that could just be the subjective perception of this viewer. Here are some random points to appreciate in this great film:Don't misinterpret Cal's (Dean) motivation, he is not doing things to win his father's love but because he loves his father (communicated by the early scene where he watches his father working in the kitchen). The former motivation would be simplistic; the latter opens up a host of interesting and ironic interpretations as you realize the seemingly bad son Cal actually understands his father and admires his goodness more than \"good\" son Aron (Richard Davalos).Aron is not really the innocent figure he appears to be, he does not like Cal and throughout the film betrays him.Abra (Harris) is caught between the two brothers, moving steadily from Aron to Cal as the film progresses. Aron represents everything she understands that she should be and Cal represents everything she has been denying herself. The story is largely seen from her point of view, and her growth parallels her (and the audiences) slow realization that Cal is not bad but misunderstood. The two are slowly falling in love but do not kiss until she gets up in the ferris wheel, a place where (symbolically) she is no longer standing on solid practical ground.It is really a coming of age story for both of them, with Abra slowly embracing new areas of human experience and Cal moving from adolescence to manhood; thanks largely to her timely interventions. Watch for subtle details that Kazan has included, like Cal's inability to make extended eye contact with his father, brother, and mother; something that he has no problem doing with Abra. And Cal's unsteady progress as he moves forward momentarily and then retreats by looking away.Note Kazan's use of a raked camera angle for the scenes inside the Trask home, unfortunately this device is a little too extreme and calls attention to itself. Also used in \"The Third Man\", it was done here to reinforce the off-kilter nature of this family's dynamic. It goes away after the scene in which Cal finally confronts his lifelong jealousy of his brother and accuses his father of rejecting him because he is so much like his mother, telling Adam (Raymond Massey) that he cannot forgive himself for having married Kate. This is the point at which Cal moves forward into permanent manhood, prior to this he had stepped forward briefly and then retreated back into childhood.Watch for the method-acting device of an actor playing with an object as a means to introduce naturalism into the scene (Abra first flirts with Cal with a flower, Jo Van Fleet makes a show of taking out and lighting a cigarette, Cal repeatedly dips his finger into a wine glass). \"East of Eden\" would be nothing but an overwrought melodrama without a host of little things like this that humanize the story.Watch for the awkward tension in all the scenes between Cal and Adam, Kazan cultivated the off-screen friction between Dean and Massey; reasoning that it would translate into more realistic on-screen sequences between the two actors. Watch for the stunning sequence late in the film when Cal slowly moves out from under the tree branches (his menace reinforced nicely by the score).Finally note the contrast between the restrained closing scene (which is also the climax) and the melodramatic style of the almost everything that has preceded it in the film. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",

            "content": "Wow, what an impressive screen debut for a 24-year-old. That was the famous James Dean, here in his first of three starring roles before death took him at a tragically young age. Just as impressive, however, is the overall performance of the rest of the cast, including lesser-known Richard Davalos, who also was making his movie debut.The most impressive person connected to this movie, however, was director Elia Kazan who not only excelled directing this film but - in the same year - directed \"On The Waterfront.\" Now, that's not a bad year of work!\"East Of Eden\" is billed as a modern-day story of \"Cain and Abel,\" between good and bad brothers with one of them feeling rejected by his father. The small Biblical account of the two brothers only mentions an offering they both gave God and then saying the brother whose offering wasn't accepted went out in a fit of jealousy and killed the other.True, the \"offering\" by \"Cal\" (Dean) and its rejection by his dad \"Adam\" (Raymond Massey) leads to a climactic scene near the end of the film, but - this is just an assumption - most people viewed this simply as a story between \"good\" and \"evil\" pertaining to Dean and Davalos' characters.I didn't see either of those guys as either the \"good\" or \"bad\" brothers. In fact, this film story is unusual in that every main character's personality begins in one direction and, as the film progresses, ends in almost the opposite. Nobody is as they first seem.\"Cale Trask\" is shown early on to be a totally rebellious and immature loser who commits a few stupid acts of vandalism and has a desire to be a loner. As the film goes on, we see a softhearted guy who needs and desires love and companionship like everyone else. The fact he only had one parent, and that one didn't seem to love him, has messed his mind up a great deal.Meanwhile, his older brother \"Aron\" (Davalos) is pictured as the kind, dependable, levelheaded guy who has a nice sweetheart who he plans to marry very soon. \"Aron\" has always made his dad proud which makes Cale jealous and bitter (hence, the Cain/Abel analogy.) In the last third of the film, however, Aron's personality reveals some dark, selfish traits and he isn't so \"good\" anymore.Julie Harris plays \"Abra,\" who begins as a sweet, likable and trustworthy person but in the end proves insincere in her \"ready to marry\" and \"I'm in love with Aron\" remarks as her feelings develop for the younger brother. She does a nice job at the end, however, helping Cale reconcile with his ailing dad.The fourth major player, the father of the two boys, is portrayed - at least by Cale - as man who has played favorites with his sons and is more of a businessman than a loving father. However, we see later that he is not a bad guy at all. He is happy to praise his younger son when merited, is quick to forgive but, like a lot of fathers in \"the old days,\" I believe, had a hard time outwardly expressing love for his children despite, in his heart wanting the best for them.The fifth major character in the film, \"Kate,\" has the least amount of lines but is the most powerful figure in the movie. She's the mother who abandoned her kids when they were babies and left her husband because she \"didn't want to be tied down to a ranch.\" Wow, Thank God our mothers didn't have that selfish attitude! She's pictured as a very hard, bitter woman who has made a success of herself and to hell with everyone else. However, once again, as the story unfolds, we see an opposite side. Cale, checking rumors she was in the area, sought her out and discovered she, indeed, was his mom. (Nobody in the Trask family knew she lived nearby, with the dad telling the kids she was dead rather than risk hurting their feelings.). Anyway, later she surprises us by softening up and loaning Cal $5,000 for a business venture to help him and help bail out his dad. That amount of money is equal to at least $100,000 today, so it's a generous, kind person who would say \"okay\" to that monetary request. The more she speaks, the softer she sounds, even if she wouldn't want to admit it.The only character I wish had a bigger role was \"Anne,\" played by Lois Smith, who was beautiful and had an intriguing role that I thought would amount to more. I'm glad to see that she is still acting on a regular basis today.Overall, it's a solid drama with complex characters who make you reflect about them long after you view this. I don't know why it took so long for me to finally see this movie, but I was impressed. (May I recommend the two-disc, special-edition DVD?). This movie is wonderfully directed, acted and photographed. I've only seen it once (last night) and I am not in love with the film (yet), but I am surprised it only garnered one Academy Award. I think it deserved more.",

            "content": "Ever felt lost?--have trouble finding your place in the world?--feel jealous of, or ignored by, a family member? If you answered yes to any of these questions, beware--the resonance you may feel toward the characters of this film may be so intense, the emotional pull of its story so overwhelming, that at its end you will find yourself exhausted, spent, trembling in its cathartic wake. I find it so every time I see it. As an examination of the terrible undercurrents in family relationships, of adolescent angst and loneliness, of the universal need for love and the awful consequences of its being withheld, it is nearly peerless. Movies that toyed with similar themes, like \"The Graduate\" or \"Rebel Without a Cause,\" though great films, do not come close to packing the emotional wallop this film delivers.To a large part, the intensity of the affective response generated by watching \"East of Eden\" must be attributed to the strength of the performances. No false notes here. Raymond Massey, a truly superb actor who has largely, and undeservedly, been forgotten, gives one of his best performance as the father with a secret, a man with the best intentions in the world, who has nonetheless unwittingly crippled his son Cal with his sometimes harsh criticisms and his favoritism of his brother Aron. Julie Harris is simply wonderful as Abra, a young woman who gradually becomes disenchanted with the \"perfect\" brother, Aron, finding herself becoming more and more interested in the vaguely frightening, yet vulnerable Cal. Her \"speech\" near the end of the film to Cal's father is heartrending. Everyone else is fine, from the always dependable Burl Ives to Albert Decker, and Jo van Fleet deserves special mention as the supposedly dead mother. The vehicle which propels the film, however, is James Dean who not only gives the best performance in his all too short career, but one of the best in cinematic history. It is truly amazing to watch him work here. The viewer becomes like putty in his hands, bending and rending our emotions at will. It's a performance not to be missed.The movie has received criticism because it does not follow the book, and leaves out at least the first two thirds of the novel. \"East of Eden\" is one of my favorite books, yet I have no trouble accepting this film on its own merits--which are considerable. A movie CANNOT be a book, though there have been several directors who seem blithely unaware of this giving us plodding movies straight-jacketed by their literary source. One cannot judge this movie solely by comparing it to the book, and with each deviation from the source, give it a demerit. I believe this movie is every bit as great as the book--but it is NOT the book. And John Steinbeck himself loved this movie, reportedly saying that the movie was a greater achievement than his book had been. That's a recommendation good enough for me, and should be enough for the lovers of the book. You CAN love both. I do.",

            "content": "Although some of his other books receive more acclaim and readership (\"The Grapes of Wrath,\" \"Of Mice and Men,\" \"The Winter of Our Discontent\"), John Steinbeck said that \"East of Eden\" was the novel that he lived to write. Indeed, the moralism of his writing reached broader and deeper in Eden than in any of his other works. The story here is set mainly in Steinbeck's beloved Salinas Valley and Monterey County.Warner Brothers did a commendable job in bringing the story to life on the silver screen. It condensed a 600-page novel into a two\u2013hour film, yet kept all of the main elements of the drama. The title for the story comes from the Bible. Genesis 4:16 reads, \"Cain then left the Lord's presence and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.\" The plot of the story is a modern Cain and Abel tale, and it is repeated within succeeding generations. In the Bible, Cain brought \"some of the fruits of the soil\" to offer the Lord. Abel brought \"the best of the firstlings,\" or \"some of the firstlings and their fat portions.\" The latter were more pleasing to God. So, Cain did so-so, average, but Abel went out of his way to give the best to the Lord. God didn't love Cain any less -- he was just most pleased with Abel's offering. Yet Cain succumbed to pride, greed, envy, anger and lust. Most know the story of \"East of Eden\" or will find other reviews that discuss the plot. So, my remarks here are brief and cover some things not mentioned. Seeing this film again after many years, on a DVD, I had the advantage of extras that included some deleted scenes. I think one inclusion would have made the film perfect \u2013 the scene of Cal and Aron in their room after they had argued outside and Cal said that Aron was \"the one he wanted\" referring to his father's favoritism, as he saw it. Without that sequence, we see Cal suddenly perking up, pitching in and being Mr. good-guy helping his father. But, there's no real explanation or background to let us know why he would change. I don't know why they deleted that scene \u2013 it made the perfect fit and segue with Aron and Cal talking and Aron explaining in a way that Cal could understand. I don't think that would have made the movie too long in itself. James Dean had the largest role, as Cal, and was the male lead. And, yes, he was a new young and hot star of the time. All of the acting is excellent, including Dean's. But, I think the very best performances in this movie were by Julie Harris as Abra, Jo Van Fleet as Kate, and Raymond Massey as Adam. Richard Davalos, as Aron, wasn't far behind; and Van Fleet's performance was most deserving of the Oscar she won. James Dean made one more film after this \u2013 \"Giant,\" which came out in October 1956. He wasn't alive to see it, because he was killed in a highway accident on Sept. 30, 1955. He had just finished filming for \"Giant.\" That was just five months after \"East of Eden\" hit theaters. It's interesting to note that the site of Dean's accident was a few miles east of Paso Robles, California. That's at the southern end of the Salinas Valley of Steinbeck's \"East of Eden.\"Those interested in Steinbeck should enjoy a visit to the National Steinbeck Center. It's a marvelous museum in downtown Salinas, CA.",

            "content": "Elia Kazan deserved his recent honorary Oscar, no matter what political mistakes he may have made.  He deserved it because he is one of the supreme artists of the cinema.  His ability to draw superb performances from his actors, is coupled with an astonishing ability to depict these emotional states visually, through the use of camera angles, lighting and symbols. \"East of Eden\" must be seen in the widescreen format to truly appreciate its visual style.  It is arresting, sometimes beautiful and always powerful.Then there are the performances.  James Dean's heartbreaking realization of Cal, consumed by jealousy; Jo Van Fleet's magnificent portrayal of his mother; Richard Davalos (why didn't we see more of him on the screen after this film?) innocent, virginal, doomed; Raymond Massey who has never been better in a multi-layered performance; Burl Ives' commanding police chief - and, as usual in a Kazan film, even the smallest part is played to perfection (who'll forget the girl in the brothel or the nurse at the end?). After seeing the film a few times I really appreciate the performance of Julie Harris too.  I once thought her a little too mature for the role - but now I see how her reactions to the events really enhance the emotional impact of those events.  Kazan allows her to be in frame during some of the most crucial encounters between Cal and his father - and her face tells a million stories.  This is a true \"supporting\" performance - her performance helping Dean realize Cal.  Brava Julie!I'm a lot older now than when I first saw this film - but I still relate so strongly to the communication breakdown and the need for love between father and son.  The improvement of my own relationship with my father makes me see the film differently but with no less emotion.  Like all masterpieces this film does not date, we just see it differently as we age.  This is undoubtedly one of my top five films.  How about a theatrical revival?  I have never seen it in a cinema.  Remember see it in widescreen - not pan and scan.",

            "content": "James Dean died in September 1955, leaving behind him mystery, legacy\u0085 and eternal youth. Indeed, we'd never know what was eating that spirit torn between the tumultuous torments of young age and the realm of coming adulthood, but we know though that the tragically abrupt end to his lightning way to success turned, Dean into an instant icon. He'd be to youth what Marilyn Monroe was to glamour, John Wayne to Western and Hitchcock to thrills.His first film, \"East of Eden\", moves in the same circle than \"Rebel Without a Cause\" but in the polar side. If Jim Stark in \"Rebel\" faced the emasculation of his father and drove his own self like a racing car that would ultimately crash into the wall of reality, Cal Trask's father doesn't quite lack authority but perhaps something more life-impacting: love. Cal Trask is like the counterpart of Jim Stark, the rebellion is the tool for the former, the end for the latter, and both are directed toward the father\u0085 or the authority figure. And are you surprised that the two names' anagrams are exactly the same? It's never about Stark or Trask, but about James Dean.Dean inhabited his roles because they inhabited his life already. Dean had lost his mother at the age of nine and had no connection whatsoever with his father who worked in Los Angeles while he grew up in Indiana. In an especially poignant moment, facing the disapproval of his father, and the rejection of his gift, Cal tries to embrace him but his hands can barely reach his father's neck. It's physically painful to watch, but it gives us enough time to measure the desperation in Cal, facing the incapability to reach his father Adam, a farm-owner who didn't only plant lettuce in his grounds but also the seeds of his younger son's jealousy. He's played by the towering Raymond Massey.Adam is a stiff man, who loves both God and his son Aron (Richard Cavados) but can't duplicate that feeling toward Cal. It is left open to interpretation whether Cal grew these awkward mannerisms and emotional secrecy from the lack of paternal love or whether Adam seemed to favor Aron because of his odd behavior. But there are two certitudes; Adam could only love Cal if he was like Aron. Interestingly, Massey didn't get along with Dean who kept on teasing him and improvising his lines, the clash between the old-school and the new generation drove an interesting feud that Kazan expertly exploited for the film. Cal couldn't be like Aron even if he tried, just like Dean.But the awkwardness of Dean finally pays off in the terrifyingly poignant third act, in \"Rebel\" Dean incarnated a son who killed the father (symbolically) not to disappoint himself, in \"Eden\", it's the very fear of disappointment that drove Cal for most of the film, and many so-called rebellious kids where fearing disappointment like plague and only became rebels by rebelling from their own ties, once they realized the efforts would be fruitless. There is some Freudian parricide so to speak in \"East of Eden\", but the original 1952 novel, by John Steinbeck, is also a retelling of the story of Abel and Cain, it's also a brother's story with a rivalry caused by women. Starting with the most significant one: he Cal and Aron's mother, who fled from Adam's virtuous grip in Salinas and went to the 'east of Eden', in Monterey, a fishing port where she lead a successful brothel. She's played by Jo Van Fleet.Obviously, Cal inherited that 'dark side' from Kate, but when she finally tells her story, we start to see goodness in her, or at least, attenuating circumstances, and through a mirror effect, in Cal too. And the well-meaning Adam becomes a Biblical tyrant who tried to mold everyone under his own vision of family, to the point of lying to his son Aron and telling her that she went to heaven. The other female player is Aron's fianc\u00e9e Abra (Julie Harris). She's a respectful and optimist girl who had her deal of troubles in the past, enough to be able to see goodness in Cal when he tries to please his gather and jealousy in Aron's when he suspects some ill behavior from his brother. Abra could have cemented the family, but there are just too many conflicts to expect a happy ending.Basically, envy, wrath, jealousy run in the family, and create many hellish situations paved by the best intentions, even the only money Cal can earn for his father will be deemed as dirty and unholy and will provoke the breakdown we all expected. Indeed, watching \"East of Eden\" is like knowing a ticking bomb will soon explode and the anticipation of a family meltdown is magnificently conveyed by the nervous, awkward but electrifying performance of James Dean. Elia Kazan contributed to cinema in many ways, but besides Brando who changed the face of acting, Dean was his best gift to the world. Dean was a newcomer, an unknown face, but when Kazan saw him and had a few exchanges, he knew Dean had Cal in him, he knew his life experience created that odd concoction of delicacy, shyness and rebellion.Many critics found his acting weird, difficult to enjoy or too mimicking his then-idol Brando. But there's a lightness of being in Dean I can't find in the steaming passion of Brando, Dean still tries to fit in his environment, conveying an ahead-of-its-time brilliant embodiment of vulnerability, something new but that holds up very well today, and that Academy members were clairvoyant enough to notice, and give Dean the first posthumous nomination of Oscar history.Unfortunately, \"East of Eden\" was the only film he could see released, by the time the two others came, he was history, and a legend.",

Not so.In \"East of Eden\" he delivers an intense performance as, unsurprisingly, an enigma; an individual too sensitive for life in his own world. It sounds from this as if it could well be similar territory to \"Rebel Without a Cause\", and given the events it's also perhaps not too far away from the real person - but nevertheless it's a striking portrayal that shows unmistakable 'fire' and talent.James Dean is not one of those people who've come to be mythologised due to outside circumstances entirely beyond their control; for the consummate skill in his craft and the posthumous Oscar recognition brings something just as weighty to the table. About as far removed from the Orlando Bloom poster boy of his generation as it's possible to be, my expectations were completely trumped. There was real depth present, too.All else is at least good, but it's the memory of a sobbing Cal all at once being transformed into a creature of hidden menace that I will take away with me.

            "content": "I recently purchased this film, having never seen it before, and feeling somewhat peeved at the fact that it is never shown on TCM.  Immediately, I recognized it as one of the best films ever made.  The adaptation from the very dense and wonderful Steinbeck novel obviously required much of the relationship between Adam and Charles to be deleted, however I felt the film did not suffer from this at all.James Dean is a completely different animal than the other actors of his time, and from start to finish in this film, he is spellbinding.  The emotional intensity and reality he brings to the film is so convincing it is almost painful to watch at times, especially when he goes to see his mother for the first time and he desperately tries to speak to her as he is being wrenched away.  The tone of his voice, his subtle gestures, his utter desperation for love is amazing and completely his own.  I once read that Dean did not consider East of Eden to be his best film, but I disagree with him there.  I have never seen a film (or an actor) that even came close to matching this one, particularly when viewed from its position in time and the nature of cinema in the 1950s.  James Dean put himself 'out there' emotionally in such a raw way that the power of that brave acting yet holds the ability to touch the audience with every viewing.  I think the film makes a hugely important statement about the human condition that is still valid a half a century later.",

            "content": "There's something that's almost majestic about Elia Kazan's \"East of Eden\". It casts a spell about the audience; the very definition of \"gripping\". At the same time, some characters suffer because of the film's focus on Cal (James Dean), to some extent at the expense of the other characters, primarily his father Adam (Ray Massey) and brother Aron (Richard Davalos), and the primary family relationship which the story deals with in allegorical Biblical terms.Dean's Cal is a study in the self-doubt and confusion of youth that stands the test of time and even transcends the categories of \"cool\" and \"rebel\" that to some extent limit the appeal of his character in Nick Ray's \"Rebel Without a Cause\". One interesting thing about the structure of the story is that to begin with Cal is an unpredictable and potentially dangerous presence. There's a note of fear in the reaction of his loved ones when he spontaneously begins to hurl giant blocks of ice out of his father's barn\u0085 the action actually seems random to them but what we see as the audience, thanks to Kazan's inter-cutting between Abra and Aron's Victorian lovemaking and Cal's reactions to their words gives us clues to the psychology of the character. Kazan builds upon this type of device for the rest of the film, until we reach a point in the middle of the film (particularly when Aron seems to become unhinged at the possibility of going to war) where it is hard to decide which of the two brothers is more sympathetic or real to us, and finally by the end of the film the audience's sympathies and understanding have completely shifted from the \"normal\" son Aron to the \"crazy\" Cal. What makes all this reach a higher level is the fact that their father Adam still has not made the transition that Cal has made, so there's a shift in the audience's reaction to Adam's behavior and philosophies as well. We see quite a bit of his hypocrisy, but the film's focus and Cal's own sympathies never sway completely to the kind of naked derision that Van Fleet's Kate displays toward Adam with regards to his moral righteousness. Thus we as the audience can empathize with nearly every character in the film, although unfortunately a minor flaw could be pointed out in that Aron's character becomes somewhat less nuanced as the film progresses and as his dramatic function begins to subsume the more subtle aspects of his character that could have been explored. Davalos gives an impressive performance in the early parts of the film but as his character's role is diminished his performance seems to become more frenetic, as if he felt that he needed to make up for the lack of quantity in terms of screen time by playing to the back rows. Probably it fits into Kazan's more general plan of shifting the audience's sympathies from Aron to Cal, but I felt that the uneven quality of Davalos' performance was one of the film's only flaws.Julie Harris' Abra is perhaps the most believable and stirring performance in the film \u0096 a pretty hefty accomplishment considering she was going up against heavyweights like the young Dean and elder Massey. Her character moves her affections from Aron to Cal at precisely the same moments that the audience should (if Kazan did his job well, which I think he did), but far more so than that, she also eventually represents the emotional bridge between the father and son. There are moments of great tenderness in her portrayal and also moments where she shows great strength and maturity \u0096 her character is naive, particularly sexually, but she's brave enough to go after what she wants even if she's not completely sure what it is. By the film's emotionally draining climax, she has gone from being a girl to being a woman just as surely or perhaps more so than Cal has gone from being a boy to a man. You can learn everything you need to know about Cal's and Adam's relationship just by watching her reaction to what they say and do.I think the film's pivotal moment is the \"gift giving\" scene, clearly modeled on the passages in Genesis relating to the sacrifices of Cain and Abel. Adam refuses Cal's gift of money because he sees it as war profit, whereas he embraces Aron's gift \u0096 an announcement of impending marriage to Abra. The scene is exceptionally powerful because our knowledge includes many facts that Adam seems unaware of, perhaps even willfully ignorant of. He tells Cal that only Aron's gift is \"honest and true\", but the facts as we know them are that Abra does not love Aron, and that Cal's gift truly represents a great sacrifice and a great step forward towards independence. It wasn't easy for Cal to ask Kate for the money to start his farm, and in the extraordinarily photographed scene (special mention for the quality of this film should go to DP Ted McCord) with Cal at the bean field we see that he has truly put the best parts of his heart and soul into the effort. Cal goes off the deep end, but by this point in the film we understand his character and his history \u0096 particularly the difficulty of living under the crushing burden of his father's expectations \u0096 that we tend to blame Adam more for the fallout than Cal. For a moment it feels that we may be on the cusp of a serious tragedy, but Abra's understanding and love for Cal provide a bridge between the two men that allows for a powerful and satisfying conclusion devoid of empty sorrow.",

Within months of the debut he'd be dead--and never see the success he'd attain in \"Giant\" or \"Rebel Without a Cause\". Dean is THE star of this film--a troubled young man who just assumes he's 'bad'. The reason for it, he discovers, might be because his dead mother is NOT dead but alive--alive and working in a brothel! This is a huge contrast to his father and 'good' brother and pious father. The father (Raymond Massey) doesn't understand Dean and there is a huge gulf between them. Some of it clearly is because the father is filled with self-righteousness--a self-righteousness that makes it hard to connect with mere mortals. Oddly, although he's seen as the bad boy, Dean tries again and again to do right and make his father proud--in many ways he really is the good son because he tries so very hard to gain his father's approval. How can all this get sorted out and what about the relationship between the two amazingly different brothers? Tune in to this excellent film--which is, believe it or not, a highly unusual reworking of the Biblical story of Cain and Abel--and Steinbeck seems to strongly favor the under-dog, Cain!

            "content": "Director Elia Kazan's film of John Steinbeck's novel, adapted by screenwriter Paul Osborn, is based on just a portion of that book yet has more plot than it knows what to do with. The picture is heated, occasionally heavy-handed or melodramatic, but features a great cast, gorgeous locations, superb color cinematography from Ted McCord, majestic scoring by Leonard Rosenman--so why isn't it a masterpiece? It is encumbered by a script with too much ground to cover; the story threads and characters are enough for two more pictures. In 1917 Northern California, a genial single father and lettuce farmer--just discovering the merits of refrigeration--juggles his attention and affections between his two sons, one a straight arrow with a steady girl and the other a hellraising hothead. The bad son is determined to find out what's become of his mother, reputed dead but really making a decent living as a madam in nearby Monterey. His clean-cut brother, who harbors deep-seated jealousies, is concerned about the impending war with Germany and his own non-involvement (read: cowardice). At times overstated, and with a showy side that reveals a certain self-consciousness, \"East of Eden\" could surely do without the Biblical parallels and implications; however, it does give its talented performers exceptionally meaty roles to play. James Dean cuts a dandy presence on the screen; though he sometimes comes off as a junior version of Brando, Dean nevertheless owns the film while conveying a range of hyper-sensitive moods quite compellingly. Richard Davalos, playing Abel to Dean's Cain, perhaps isn't quite in the same league as his co-star, but he's well-cast and looks astonishingly like Dean. Julie Harris, as the nice, decent girl who is attracted to both brothers, does the hand-wringing bit convincingly enough, and her bedside speech near the finale is genuinely moving. Jo Van Fleet won a Supporting Oscar as the boys' intimidating mother, Raymond Massey does solid work as their father, and Burl Ives is the cool-headed local law. Some of the editing is sloppy (especially in the early scenes) and, indeed, the picture seems to begin in the middle of this tale, with bold undercurrents we sense but are not privy to. It's a good film, not a great one, and keeps to the right side of soap opera thanks to forceful interaction, a beautiful production design, and the sweep of grand storytelling. *** from ****",

            "content": "East Of Eden is one of those movies I saw as a teenager where I felt a great kinship with its protagonist. Directed by Elia Kazan in blazing color, featuring James Dean in his first major, as well as Julie Harris and Raymond Massey, it's a film that just doesn't make it with me any more. Adapted from a Steinbeck novel, Eden is a modern retelling of the Cain and Abel story, which is the least of its problems. What makes the picture so difficult to watch now is also what made it so compelling before: James Dean. He's awful. Not just awful but hideously awful. How responsible and intelligent people ever could for an instant entertain the notion that this self-absorbed, swaggering exhibitionistic egomaniac was a good let alone great actor is beyond me. As to the kids, well, they're kids; they'll identify with anything rebellious, as I did. But grownups ought to know better. Dean comes across like a bad Saturday Night Live imitation of himself; he's so hammy, continually forcing the attention on himself, that he throws what might otherwise have been a decent movie way out of kilter. What's worse, Kazan, normally a director with a good sense of dramatic pacing, seems to have taken cues from his lead actor, because it looks to me like James Dean directed the damn thing as well as acted in it. The movie is overblown from the start, and the characters often seem to be in ongoing group therapy sessions rather than people interacting in real life, time and space. Every few minutes, it seems, there has to be a climax. Not a dramatic climax, built up to by having characters with real problems confronting one another, but big cinematic climaxes, with odd camera angles and blaring music, always way over the top. There seem to be subtexts abounding in this film, as if it had a private meaning for each member of the cast and crew. There's a soft, earth-motherish Julie Harris perspective; a stern, moralistic Raymond Massey one; a folsky, warm and understanding but no-nonsense Burl Ives view of things; and of course, always intruding on everyone else, the predictably deranged and obnoxious James Dean take on life. Even Leonard Rosenman's musical score seems weirdly connected to the feelings it accompanies, as if even the composer was working inside the heads of the actors. Theres's something sick and self-pitying about this film; it's the ultimate fifties trip. Though it's set around the time of the First World War, it feels like a beatnick's lament for the Eisenhower years.",

Unfortunately, I found the performances of Richard Davalos & Raymond Massey too bland to stand out, especially in comparison to the other cast members.Elia Kazan's direction was good enough to land a Best Director Oscar nomination but I don't think that the film looks quite as good as other films of his. The score by Leonard Rosenman is stirring and is showcased in an overture at the beginning of the film.I would certainly recommend this film to anyone wanting to know what all the fuss is about James Dean.

I've started this movie several times, but never have been able to get to the end although it was obvious where it was going to end up. It disgusts me at almost every level.I've also never understood the attraction of James Dean. He only seems to play this character - the scion of an overly wealthy family who, seeing poverty all around him - finds no reaction except whining and bleating about his lofty position in society. Well, more to the point, he whines constantly about how his mommy or daddy or both don't love him enough.In this loser flick, there is a scene where Dean finds his soul mate - or so I suppose it'll turn out. She is giggling about having thrown away a $3,000 ring her dad, a widower, gave to his new bride. Then she says she forgave him for remarrying. Dean and she find this episode hilarious. Note that this is set during WWI where that $3,000 is enough to support three farm worker families for a year. Such is the movie that it only looks at life from these ignorant bitchy teens' point of view that this violent wasting is overlooked or used as a plot device to weld these characters to each other.Throughout the entire movie, Dean speaks in a weasely nasal whine and slinks around half folded up which I suppose is spoiled 50's American body language for being beaten down by immense wealth. The movie is constantly sympathetic toward this miserable brat excusing him running roughshod over anybody and anything to feed his own narrow needs.For example, when he decides to make a device to harvest more efficiently, he steals a vital part from some hard working poor people. This either puts them temporarily out of business or out of business until they can replace it - at enormous cost to them. He could have bought it with his pin money but instead he steals it from poor people. When caught, all the sympathy of the movie is on his side. Personally, I would have loved to see the poor victims of his theft beat him senseless.In fact, thinking about this entire movie, the thing which is missing is that Dean isn't beaten and expelled from the town. Everybody would have been better off and the movie would have been enormously more satisfying.",

            "content": "I haven't read John Steinbeck's novel \"East of Eden,\" but I'm familiar with enough of the author's work to know that he wasn't a \"glass half- full\" kind of man. Steinbeck's characters appear to persist despite their misery, devoid of hope and comfort, and persevering out of sheer bloody-mindedness. This potentially poses a problem, because Hollywood has traditionally taken the stance that it is optimism, not pessimism, that sells tickets. This clash of sensibilities is seen readily enough in 'The Grapes of Wrath (1940),' in which John Ford's assurance in the hardiness of American families sits at odds with Steinbeck's stark brand of realism. Nevertheless, Elia Kazan was an ideal candidate to adapt the 1952 novel \"East of Eden,\" having already dealt with unflinching dramatic themes of family and societal conflict in the films 'A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)' and 'On the Waterfront (1954).' The pair had collaborated previously, with Steinbeck writing the screenplay for Kazan's Mexican Revolution biopic 'Viva Zapata! (1952).'Whereas 'A Streetcar Named Desire' had been a completely stage-bound film, owing to origins on Broadway, 'East of Eden (1955)' allowed Kazan to spread his cinematic wings, so to speak. Steinbeck had intended his novel, in part, as a tribute to the Salinas Valley in Northern California, and so location is everything. Cinematographer Ted McCord captures the setting in lush WarnerColor, the fertile green fields consciously opposed to the bleak inner conflict raging inside the heart of the film's protagonist. Despite being visually impressive, it is \u2013 as in all Kazan pictures \u2013 the director's genius for working with actors that really shines through. James Dean, in his major picture debut (and the first of only three lead roles), delivers one of the most heartbreakingly tragic performances I've ever seen. His Cal, the Biblical Cain to Richard Davalos' Abel, has endured a life without love, every misguided bid for his father's (Raymond Massey) approval met with indifference or remonstration, as though only to cement his self-belief that he is inherently \"bad.\" In adapting \"East of Eden,\" another director might have aimed for sheer scope, winding up with something not unlike 'Gone with the Wind (1939)' or 'Duel in the Sun (1946).' Instead, Kazan plays his strengths, and it's a telling sign that the film's most powerful moments unfold, not in the outside environments that McCord captures so well, but between four walls \u2013 inside homes, sheds, and brothels. Dean's character skulks mousily in the corners, fearful about making eye contact, as his articulate, proper brother Aron makes unconsciously-condescending remarks, perpetuating stereotypes that have been drummed into both since childhood. Only Aron's sweetheart Abra (Julie Harris) understands Cal's torment at the hands of his cold, naive family members, but by then it may already be too late to save him. At under two hours, 'East of Eden' perhaps doesn't explore its characters and their motivations as fully as it might have \u2013 for example, Aron's metaphorical \"slaying\" at his brother's hand isn't give enough exposition \u2013 but nonetheless stands as a beautiful and astonishingly powerful piece of storytelling.",

            "content": "O.k. I know, I know....books and films are two different art forms and little can be gained by comparing the telling of the same story in one vs. the other. I'm a firm advocate of that myself. However, let me just say that you cannot watch this film as a substitute of the Steinbeck novel (though a film should *never* be used as a stand in for literature in my opinion). Kazan et al. very liberally adapt Steinbeck's story to the big screen and make a very impressive film; however, it's not the same story Steinbeck himself was telling.That aside, \"East of Eden\" is a good (not quite great, but close) film from a very inconsistent period of American film making (i.e. the mid-50's.) Cinemascope and other widescreen processes were new, and many directors were content just to train their cameras on a pretty landscape and think that was enough to make their compositions interesting. However, Elia Kazan, completely at home in the stark b&w worlds of \"On the Waterfront\" and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" obviously knew what to do with his widescreen compositions, and, as a result, \"East of Eden\" is far more dynamic than many films from the same time period. For example, in an early scene, Cal (James Dean) walks along a stand of trees beside his brother and his brother's soon-to-be fianc\u00e9. While they're talking, Cal walks deeper into the frame and follows the other two while hidden from us and them by the trees. This of course serves the purpose of communicating Cal's isolation, but it also seems like a perfectly natural thing for Cal's character to do and so doesn't feel obvious or heavy handed, and it's visually interesting, and so breaks up the frame. Kazan adds touches like that throughout the entire film. Even if they don't always work (the skewed angles toward the end are somewhat corny), they're appreciated for their attempts to create a unique visual style.James Dean just wasn't a very good actor, but he was an interesting screen presence. He was always sulking around and looking uncomfortable in his own skin, which is probably why teenagers at the time related to him so much, and why he seems so right for the role of Cal. The women in this film deliver the best performances. Julie Harris does much with a somewhat thankless role through her naturalistic acting, and Jo Van Fleet is simply terrific in a role that amounts to one significant scene. I'm not sure she deserved an Oscar for her (maybe) ten minutes of screen time, but she does manage to make Kate into a memorable character in the blink of an eye. Indeed, the film's greatest disservice to the novel is in reducing Kate's character to nothing more than a plot device. Anyone who's read the book remembers what a vivid character Steinbeck creates of her, and it's a shame the film couldn't take more advantage of that.What the movie comes down to thematically is an investigation into the \"good\" vs. \"bad\" impulses that exist in everyone, and whether or not we are forced into one of these two polar opposites by fate or have the ability to decide for ourselves which one we'll choose. It's an absorbing film and one of the must sees from one of the most interesting decades for the art form.Grade: A",

Cal (Cain) really works hard and puts in his time. While he becomes a bit profligate and free spirited, I could never understand why his father hated him so much. The relationship with his mother is also pretty strange; she's just over the hill, a little ways away. What's her real story? I also had trouble with the Julie Harris character at times. Her delivery is really stagy. It doesn't sound natural. Yes, I know she is a great stage actress. This would even be OK if this were a play, but it is an adaptation of a novel.

This one casts him as Cal Trask, an outcast teenager in 1917 Salinas vying with his brother Aron (Richard Davalos) for his father Adam's (Raymond Massey) love. A previous reviewer identified it as a modern (well, early 1900s) version of Cain and Abel.There are two things in the movie that really catch my eye. One is the onset of World War I. Aside from the fact that the United States enters the war and people start attacking the German person in Salinas, we see how things in the town start changing once Cal learns the reality about something that he had long accepted as true. Overall, it's clear that nothing will ever be the same in this small, seemingly idealistic town.Another aspect is Cal himself. Cast out from his family, he has a special penchant for making trouble - or at least unsettling people. You might say that Cal is a precursor to Dean's \"Rebel without a Cause\" character.But the main point is that this is a true classic. With top-notch acting, magnificent cinematography, and an incredible score, it's one movie that you can't afford to miss. Also starring Julie Harris, Burl Ives and Jo Van Fleet.Oh, and just one more thing. The scene where Cal meets with Will seems like it might be implying something about homosexuality.

            "content": "The first film of the James Dean trilogy that established him as the once and forever spokesperson of male youth in angst is East of Eden. It's a novel by John Steinbeck telling of the California of Steinbeck's youth in the years just before World War I. It's the story of two brothers brought up by a self righteous father, one of whom is the apple of his eye and the other a complete screwup who can't get anything right. Sounds a lot like Cain and Abel, doesn't it? In Genesis it really doesn't go into why Abel was so favored by God as opposed to Cain. The only thing it says is about their occupations and presumably tending sheep is a better thing to do on the social scale than working with iron. God seems kind of arbitrary there as is the father Raymond Massey who's not named 'Adam' Trask for nothing.James Dean is the bad son named Caleb or Cal for short and Dick Davalos is the good son named Aaron. Davalos even aspires to the ministry, a calling no doubt Massey might have enjoyed. He's raised the two without a mother and he's told them she's dead.But Dean finds out different, she's not only alive, but is the prosperous madam of a bordello in nearby Monterey. Dean looks her up and saves his news for Davalos at a time when he's vulnerable. Like God seeming to arbitrarily and capriciously preferring Abel to Cain, Massey just favors this one son versus the other. Dean knows this on some level and it eats him alive. Julie Harris has a good role in the film as the fianc\u00e9 of Davalos who gets more and more drawn to Dean as the film progresses. I very much liked Burl Ives who has the role of sheriff and who really functions as the audience's eyes and ears in East of Eden. It's his perspective from where the film is drawn. He has Massey down just about right, as a good man and a good friend, in many ways just too good and not real into the ways of the world.In Genesis God ordered Adam and Eve from paradise, but in East of Eden it's Adam who kicks Eve out. The mother is played by Jo Van Fleet who won a Best Supporting Actress Award that year. The confrontation scene with Dean and Davalos is unforgettable. James Dean was nominated for Best Actor in fact his was the first posthumous nomination given in any of the acting categories. He lost to Ernest Borgnine for Marty. Incredibly enough his last two films were both released after his death on September 29, 1955. It made the tragedy of a promising young star's death into 20th century legend.I'm not sure why Dick Davalos did not receive equal acclaim for his part as James Dean did. As the chip off the old Massey self righteous block it's far from a one dimensional portrayal. Davalos feels it almost his mission in life to reflect father in every way possible.The Steinbeck novel was much cut down, there's half the book which explains how the Trask family got to where it is that's completely missing and some more into the future to explain what happens to all of them. Still there's more than enough here and the salient parts of the story and the characters are not missed.",

Burl Ives makes his few small scenes count and Raymond Massey is strong as the misguided and righteous father. The real standout in support is Jo Van Fleet in her Oscar winning role as the cruel Kate, she crafts a fully realized person in just a few short scenes. James Dean was fine in all three of his big screen films but this is his best performance.

            "content": "\"East of Eden\" from 1955 is based on the John Steinbeck novel of the same name, beautifully realized on the screen by Elia Kazan, with James Dean as the perfect Cal.It is the modern story of Cain and Abel, with the brothers Cal and Aron in California around the time of World War I. The film covers the last third of the book, and it ends a little differently.The story in both book and film centers around choice; in the book, the subject comes up with a discussion of the correct translation of the Hebrew word \"timshel\" which means \"may.\" God blesses Cain with free will, leaving the choice to him (\"Thou mayest rule over him\")This is not only a heart-wrenching story and script, but the acting is across the board superb.Kazan was struck by how much Dean was like Cal and actually observed his uneasy relationship with his father, so he gave him free rein with the role.He is magnificent as a young man jealous of his brother (Richard Davalos) and wanting his father's (Raymond Massey) love desperately, seeking to be understood. The only one who does is his brother's girlfriend, Abra (Julie Harris). Harris, one of the great Broadway actresses of her time, is lovely as the empathic young woman, who finds herself torn as she realizes she is in love with Cal and not Aaron. Richard Davalos, the handsome \"good\" boy Aron, does a marvelous job, and he has great chemistry with Dean. Their interactions are intense.Elia Kazan was always sorry he hired Raymond Massey, feeling he did not have the range the director wanted, but as the stern, principled, religious father, he is excellent. He absolutely hated James Dean, who deliberately provoked him -- Dean was big into the Method -- and complained that one had to \"stand around and wait for him to act.\" Kazan used the dislike to the character's advantage too.This was Jo Van Fleet's film debut, though she had done television and had won a Tony award for \"A Trip to Bountiful.\" For her role as a bordello madam in East of Eden, she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Kazan used her again in Wild River, another brilliant performance. And the cast is great right down to the smaller roles, played by Lois Smith, Burl Ives, and Albert Dekker. Of the cast, only Smith and Davalos are still alive as of this writing. Someone reviewing it on this board said your feelings about the film change with age, as one loses one's parents, etc. I have to agree. It grows richer.East of Eden the book was a seminal for me, and I feel as deeply about the film. A true masterpiece.",

The Salinas teenager's attempt to finally meet his mother, who was said to have died after he was born, turned into a disaster with him being thrown out, because he was too young to drink, of his mothers place of business.It's when we get to meet both Cal's father Adam Trask, Raymond Massey, and twin brother Aaron, Richard Davalos, we see why he's so full of rage and contradictions. Being treated by his father as the black sheep of the family Cal had developed over the years a disturbing self-hatred of not only himself but the world at large. It's when he finally got to see his mother Kate, Jo Van Fleet, and realized that his father kept the fact of her being alive a secret from him, as well as his brother Aaron, Cal's obsession of him taking after her became crystal clear. Like himself Kate was denied Cal's father, and her husbands, love for she was too independent and strong willed, like her son Cal, for Adam to control with his over the top Bible thumping sermons and false humility.It's when Cal tried to win his father's love by giving him a birthday present of $5,000.00 that he lost in a failed vegetable refrigeration venture that the proverbial sh*t finally hit the fan. His father refusing to take the money because Cal made it by manipulation the commodity market, in beans, in him expecting the US to enter the war, WWI, in Europe was the last straw for Cal. Giving Cal a BS sermon of not wanting to get rich off other people's suffering, in being killed and wounded on the Western Front, was really the hight of hypocrisy on the sanctimonious Adam Trusk's part. Adam was in fact a member of the local Salinas draft board where he willingly sent young men, excluding his two sons Cal & Aaron, to the front lines to do just what he told Cal he was totally against! Killing or being killed on the battlefields of France and Belgium! Not only that Adams felt absolutely no guilt at all in getting a paycheck, from the US War Department, in doing his job! Yet at the same time he put his son Cal down for profiting because off the war in his bean commodity trading!While all this was going on Cal, being the handsome devil that he is, had the sweet and caring Abra, Julie Harris, who's his brother's girlfriend fall madly in love with him that complicated matters, between the two brothers, even farther! Feeling dejected and abandoned by everyone, with the exception of Abra, that he loved and cared for Cal loses it and takes it out both on his father Adam and his smirking and always on the side good & righteousness brother Aaron. It's then that Cal, who already knew what the score was, takes Aaron down to the whorehouse & saloon in Monterey and shows him that his mother Kate is not only alive but not the angel in heaven that he thought, and what his father told him, that she was! The terrible shock that Aaron was subjected to completely flipped him out and caused him, a life long pacifist, to enlist in the US military. Stark raving mad Aaron put his head through a plate glass window, on the troop train taking him to the nearest US army base, in front of both his shocked and startled father Adam and brother Cal. As for Old Man Trask his holier then thou act totally unraveled, at the pathetic sight of his #1 son Aaron, where he suffered a near fatal stroke, or brain hemorrhage, that left him paralyzed for the reminder-as short as it was going to be-life!In the end Cal did get the love from his father that was denied to him all his life but at a terrible price. With Aaron no longer around, and probably either dead or in an insane asylum, Old Man Trusk had no choice but to have his now only son Cal look after him for the little time he still had left on this earth!James Dean's unbelievable and electrifying performance in the movie as the moody and unpredictable Cal Trask made him one of Hollywood's brightest star overnight. Dean's road to stardom, and a very promising film career, didn't last long with it leading to that fateful and last Friday in September 1955 on the intersection of US Route 46 and state Route 41. It was there in the early autumn twilight on that lonely stretch of California highway where James Dean ended up getting killed in a fatal car crash while driving his beloved sliver Porsche Spyder: The $7,000.00, in 1955 dollars, sports car that he bought with the money he earned staring in the film \"East of Eden\".",

The boy is in constant conflict with their own religious father, who prefers the another son.I'm thrilled with the picture. Nature is the real beauty in this film. The problematic people in this atmosphere seem more credible. This is a powerful drama with different moods and clear psychoanalysis. It is fascinating that the director establishes a better relationship with the landscape and a weaker relationship with the protagonists.Nobody's perfect. A trite but true phrase. The only question is, who will find meaning in their own imperfections. The film can recognize good and evil. This attitude affects the clarity of emotions. Fortunately, Biblical allusion is not excessive. The brothers, in a way, symbolize duality in man himself to grotesque proportions. The struggle for acceptance in the family and society, which has tragic end !? This is not only preposterous, but is dotted with a kind of illusion.James Dean as Caleb Trask is unrepeatable, but the performance is overstated. Emotional character does not show a clear emotion. He is a hero and a villain in this film. The son who fought for an ounce of his father's love. The son, who is trying to buy his father's love. The protagonist who has a frank and somewhat noble purpose in life. James Dean is a strange combination between Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift. Julie Harris as Abra Bacon is a young and inexperienced lady, who is forced to choose between the perfect son (the good guy) and imperfect son (the bad guy). Of course, she is not good enough for the perfect son, but she matures in time to save imperfect. Very good performance, I have to admit.Raymond Massey as Adam Trask in the role of the \"perfect\" and the strictly religious father. I can understand his seriousness, sense of justice, and even fanatical devotion, but persistent refusing attitude against his son I will never understand. I tried to find a reason at some redemption, but again I have not found a deeper meaning. Richard Davalos as Aron Trask was the perfect son. I felt resentment and envy in his character. Of course, after the knowledge of the life of his mother. That's awesome. The protagonist who believes in the eternal triumph of good over evil. Characterization is very bad in this case. Jo Van Fleet as Cathy Ames is the mother described as a monster without a shred of love. The evil that is necessary for the story.This movie is only a part of the novel and I made conclusions based on that.",

            "content": "Based on a John Steinbeck novel, Elia Kazan's \"East of Eden\" stars James Dean as Cal, the son of entrepreneur Adam Trask. Cal feuds with his younger brother and father, both of whom perceive Cal to be \"bad\". Also deemed \"bad\" is Cal's mother, the owner of a local brothel.As Kazan has truncated Steinbeck's novel, each character's actions and motivations become slightly cartoonish. Adam himself is portrayed as a religious fundamentalist, so scarred by his now absent wife that he deems everything unsavoury to be a \"mark of wickedness\". Psychologically abused by his judgemental father, Cal embarks on an unhealthy quest to both find his mother and earn daddy's favour.\"East of Eden\" is filled with artificial, exaggerated oppositions, trite melodrama and strained allusions to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. On the flip-side, it's beautifully shot, boasts amazing wide-screen photography and contains a number of interesting passages. Elevating things further is Dean's performance. Dean would act in only three films before dying at the age of 24 (\"Giant\", \"East of Eden\", \"Rebel Without a Cause\"). In each of these films, he played sensitive, troubled young men. These characters are outsiders, idealists, confused, ashamed and filled with a burning desire to belong. More than this, their on-screen suffering seemed to echo Dean's own off-screen troubles.Dean's performance in \"East of Eden\" has been called \"groundbreaking\", but it wasn't really. Brando and Montgomery Clift were already making waves as Method Acting Mega Stars, and Paul Newman and others would soon do so as well. What Dean did well was popularise a certain turn-of-the-century teenage archetype; all adolescent ache and emotional turbulence. And as Dean was immortalised as an adolescent and never allowed to grow up, his characters only seemed more doomed. As the years went by, his three performances would accumulate almost mythological proportions. This sentimental necrophilia would blind fans to Dean's flaws \u2013 his obvious attempts to mimic Brando, his overly mopey scenery-chewing etc \u2013 but in a way is also wholly deserved. \"East of Eden\" boasts gorgeous colour cinematography by Ted McCord, a lush score by Leonard Rosenman, and fine performances by Julie Harris and Jo Van Fleet.7.5/10 \u2013 See \"Marjorie Morningstar\", \"Some Came Running\" and \"Rebel Without a Cause\".",

I try not to fall for the \"hype\" of many of the classics (i.e. Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, East of Eden) until I've seen them for myself. Not that my opinion changes their status, but I think a lot of movies have a reputation and too many people are afraid to go against the grain of popular belief.Anyways, this movie was on TCM this week and I finally got a chance to watch it. I've never read the book, so imagine my surprise when through the reviews and messageboard here, that this movie was only the last portion of the book. That probably explains why nothing in it made me sympathize with the characters. I thought the Cain/Abel theme might be intriguing, but frankly, this was a very boring and overdone movie. I have never understood the hype of James Dean (RIP). What I've seen of him has been hammish. Hammish actors unless it's completely intentional makes me cringe. Anyway, many people have addressed the storyline already, so I will only give my impressions. Maybe it's b/c I was born 30 years after the fact, but James Dean does not come off as a teenager. He comes off as an immature, whiny, self-absorbed young adult. I enjoyed him more in Giant (one of my favorites ever). I kept wanting to tell him to grow up, even at the end.Now that I've seen it, I will probably never watch it again. The melodrama effect just didn't work for me. I prefer Brando and Newman as well.I just reserved the book at my library so I can see what was missing.",

            "content": "Quite apart from being Elia Kazan's best movie and James Dean's best movie, one can argue that *East of Eden* may very well be Old Hollywood's best movie. It stands as one of the rare examples of the seemingly infinite resources of the old studio system being put to intelligent, sensible, artistic uses, and it's a compelling blend, or dividing-line, of (or between) traditional story-telling and acting styles with the more modern, \"realistic\", Actors-Studio approach (a contrast best exemplified by the presence of Dean and the old-fashioned Raymond Massey, endlessly quarreling on- and off-screen). The film has finally been released on DVD by Warner Bros., with correct, anamorphic aspect ratio and a boat-load of extras that include instructive outtakes and screen-tests along with some pretty intelligent commentary by Richard Schickel. It's an excellent release, actually worth the 7 or 8 years' wait.The main advantage, however, of the new DVD is that we can appreciate Kazan's intelligent tackling of the problems posed by the massive CinemaScope frame. Kazan is mostly known as an \"actor's director\", prone to chamber-like compositions and sweaty close-ups, so it's all the more surprising that he handles the epic vistas of John Steinbeck's California with such confidence. The interior shots are even more impressive: Kazan skews the camera during certain tense, emotional scenes, giving the frame a queasy, slatternly look; he utilizes deep-focus almost constantly, stuffing the screen with innumerable details . . . and yet he also isn't afraid to use the wide-frame in a counter-intuitive, minimalist way, e.g. that long, dark corridor leading to Jo Van Fleet's bedroom -- the entire screen is dark except for a sliver of light in the center of the frame inhabited by the silhouetted actors. One of my favorite compositions is during the scene when Massey is forcing Dean to read from the Bible at the kitchen table: they sit at opposite ends of the table, inhabiting space at the extreme edges of the screen, an insuperable gulf dividing them. Kazan's visual motifs are always in service to the emotional and thematic demands of the story.As for the adaptation itself, Kazan focuses on the last portion of Steinbeck's sprawling book -- the only reasonable option available, really. The director takes Steinbeck's rather obvious and gaudy theme, the Cain-and-Abel story, at face-value, relying on the actors to carry it all across. Luckily for him and us, they do. Goaded by Dean, Raymond Massey delivers the best performance of his career as the stern, Biblical patriarch Adam. Goaded by Dean, Richard Davalos delivers perhaps the only noteworthy performance of his career as the goody-two-shoes brother Aron. Goaded and seduced by Dean, Julie Harris succumbs to his unique qualities, which, since the Fifties, have proved to be catnip to young women everywhere: the vulnerability; the wild recklessness; the feminine softness; the promise of exciting violence; the brooding nihilism; the twinkling-eyed sense of humor. She can't decide whether to be his mother or his lover -- either way, Cain-like Cal wins.Indeed, James Dean wins. It seems grandiose to suggest that between his work here and in *Rebel without a Cause* the actor invented not just the modern portrayal of adolescence but modern adolescence itself. Sometimes, however, the grandiose also happens to be true. Watching Dean's performance in *East of Eden*, one senses the establishing introduction of what was to become an enduring pattern: the messy inner life of the American teenager. This would be achievement enough to ensure this movie's place in the pantheon of all-time greats . . . and in this context, the movie's many other virtues are just gravy.10 stars out of 10.",

            "content": "Only the last half or perhaps the last third of Steinbeck's classic novel was used in the making of this feature film, but it turns out to be enough. Massey plays the stern, but gentle, father of two sons (Davalos and Dean) whose mother was such a monster that he has raised them to believe she's dead. Dean, however, has managed to find out that not only is she alive, but she lives in a neighboring town as a rather infamous madam! His already dysfunctional relationship with his father is further strained when he realizes that Massey has lied about this. The fact that Davalos is held up as a paragon of virtue and has an appealing sweetheart (Harris) only adds to Dean's neuroses and insecurity. However, he decides to win over his father once and for all by making back a substantial amount of money that was lost in an ill-executed business venture. When that also doesn't turn out the way he planned, he falls apart before his father and lashes out at his brother, with disastrous results. Reams have been printed about the meteoric rise of Dean and his devastating demise after just three major film roles. It's hard to believe that anyone can live up to the hype after the iconic stature his face and career have been given over the decades. However, in this, his virtual film debut, he is stunning. Odd, unsettling, gentle, fierce, impish, vulnerable, volatile and tender are just a few of the words that describe him in this film. His revolutionary approach to the script may have upset the more traditional performers in the film (namely Massey), but they are better themselves because of it. His visceral and authentic portrayal jumps off the screen today and must have been amazing to behold in 1955. Massey is also very strong and well-suited to his role. The two create dramatic fireworks together (some might even say waterworks if they buy into the sentimentality of the material.) Harris, who gets top-billing though the story really isn't hers, per se, is excellent as well. Even though she's the tiniest bit too old for her role, she invests it with so much heart and talent, it's hard to top. Unlike Massey, she responded well to Dean's Method shenanigans and even gave him a bit of his own medicine in a scene involving tapping him in the face with a fresh cut wildflower. Ives, soon to give the world several terrific performances in films like \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" and \"The Big Country\" lends solid support as a sort of mentor of Dean's. Van Fleet, an Oscar-winner as Dean's mother, creates an air of mystery about her and is believable in her tough role. (This part would later yield Jane Seymour one of her very best roles ever in the 1981 TV mini-series version.) Davalos is attractive and strong as the brother who is perceived to be full of sweetness and light, but contains a darker side himself. Inexplicably, he, of almost anyone associated with the film, seems to have benefited the least, with very few important parts in his future. Other supporting roles are turned in by Smith, as a fearful, low-esteemed bar girl and Dekker as Dean's entrepreneurial partner. Dekker (who had one of Hollywood's all-time bizarre deaths, being found hanging naked with vulgarities written all over his body) has a surprisingly bare shower scene in which he tells Dean not to get too close too him because he's hot enough already! The film is chock full of atmospheric and clever directorial touches including blocking off parts of the screen to reveal only what is necessary and staging one scene so that only the actors' legs can be seen beneath a weeping willow tree. It's a beautiful, well-crafted story with pertinent relationship examinations that still hold up today. Alienation of youth is something that transcends the decades, thus allowing new generations to experience the feelings that Dean's character felt. This is one time the subject lives up to the hype.",

Each time I see this movie I see it from a new perspective. I learned from the DVD and from reading Elia Kazan's comments that the character Cal (played by Dean) is really Steinbeck in many ways in his youth and Kazan also identified with him. I learned that there was real friction between Dean and the man who played his father, Raymond Massey and that Dean deliberately provoked Massey to get angry with him to bring out the moment in the film of the father's feelings towards his son. I also marvel each time i see this movie at the outstanding performance of Jo Van Fleet. She deserved her best supporting actress academy award. This movie resonates on many levels as do most of Kazan's films. It is modern retelling of the garden of eden story and it is the story of the troubled youth of the fifties fighting against the conservatism of the Eisenhower years. It is a story of the confusion and conflicts in a family with a war approaching and it's a story about a woman (Van Fleet's character) who doesn't like being bottled up in a controlled religious setting. Many things to enjoy here and one wonders where the artists of Kazans stature are in this day and age. I only wish that all of Kazan's films were on DVD, such as Baby Doll and Wild River. I wonder if anyone but me notices that on the extra DVD where there is an interview with John Steinbeck that he shifts and contorts his mouth in a manner very like Dean in the movie.

The major scenes are major because of the histrionics, not the conception, an intricate plot, nuance or insight.Kazan's body of work is hopelessly full of gimmicks which, 50 years on, makes him seem more of a showman than a great director. All of his movies are plastered with high-value signifiers, some owing to Hollywood (location photography, Warner Color, wide screen, production values) and some from Kazan (notorious performances, a built-in controversy, epic length, a production tailored his next golden boy, self-importance). These are the things that ruined drama in the 50s. The best thing I can say about him is that he learned a little more about film by the time he got to 'Splendor in the Grass' which is guilty of the same sanctimony and production values (in place of originality) but it has half an hour here and there that hasn't been ruined by overproduction, editing, self-conscious camera angles, overscoring & ham acting.I can name innumerable 90 minute movie with modest production values that are both more thoughtful and more affecting than this. Massey is as bad and stiff here as he was everywhere.I'm amazed that if the creator of a movie says it's a drama, that a movie is received as important and debated for 50 years. We don't debate drama from 1939. We shouldn't shower movies like this with importance they don't actually have. Richard Shickel's commmentary is lethargic and disinterested.",

            "content": "An amazing film which I rank as my single all-time favorite, 'East Of Eden' contains James Dean's best screen performance. He is heart-wrenching as Cal Trask, the wayward, misunderstood son vying for his father's love with his favored twin brother.This is an adaptation of Steinbeck's much-lauded novel. It is hard to say whether it is an improvement or blot on it's original subject matter, because the adaptation is so loose. Only really the last 80 or so pages of Steinbeck's epic novel remain in the film, but it is the last 80 pages that most readers are interested in-the father-son, brother-brother conflict.Steinbeck lifted part of his saga from the biblical Cain and Abel story. Cain in 'East Of Eden' becomes Cal Trask, the son who just can't do anything to please his stern, Puritan father, 'Adam' Trask. Abel becomes Aron (played by Richard Davalos), the son who is perfect in his father's eyes. The story is set in the Salinas Valley of California following the outbreak of World War 1, but the real focus in the film is not on the political climate of the time (which is alluded to and addressed sparingly). Instead, the tension between Cal and his father and Cal's competition with Aron for his father's love form the heart of 'East Of Eden'.From our first glimpse of Dean he exudes the rebel image that audiences primarily associate with him. He is following the woman who he has found out to be his 'dead' mother, Cathy. She is the mistress of a whorehouse in Monterey, and her disappearance from Cal's life at such an early age is a major factor contributing to his tortured emotional state. Dean cannot connect with his father and feels like an outsider in the family. He finds some salvation in a promising business prospect, in which he hopes to please his father by earning back the money Adam has lost on a venture in the lettuce business. Aron's girl Abra (Julie Harris, in an excellent performance)feels a connection with the unruly, reaching Cal that she just can't explain. They are drawn to each other through mutual feelings of rejection and inadequacy, and Abra's good nature could be the thing that helps Cal overcome his difficult relationship with his father and uncertain sense of self.Dean is a powerhouse in his debut leading role. Dean's major strength was his ability to emote to the camera, and he does it so well here. Watching Cal's torment is watching an extension of Dean's own conflicted self. It is said he didn't act Cal Trask, he WAS Cal Trask, and I find this difficult to disagree with. Kazan chose him not because of an overly impressive technique, but because his rawness and anger so perfectly suited the role. One of the best male performances ever committed to screen.Julie Harris is also excellent as Abra. One of the complaints about Harris in the role I've often heard is how old she looks compared to Dean (28 to 23), and that she is too plain to be a leading lady. In my opinion, Harris looks fine next to Dean and her girl-next-door quality equips the role of Abra very well. Abra is a mother figure, caring but no glamorous. I feel that Julie Harris is just what Steinbeck intended in the role. Her love scenes with Dean are poignant and tenderly beautiful, they have terrific chemistry.Fantastic support is provided by Raymond Massey, Jo Van Fleet, Burl Ives and to a lesser extent, Davalos. Massey, with his Classical acting style, was constantly at odds with Method actor Dean throughout filming. Kazan encouraged this animosity, as it he felt it added to the picture. It certainly worked, as we can feel the mutual anger and hurt the two direct at each other. Jo Van Fleet (she won the supporting actress Oscar for her role) plays Cathy, the mother of the twins and Adam's long-lost wife. She is suitably hard, yet they made her much nicer in the film (Read the book and you'll see what a monster she really is). Davalos is adequate in his role, but Dean's force and presence tower over him in every scene they share.I'm not going to give away too much, as 'East Of Eden' is such a powerful film that it deserves to be viewed objectively, but I must say this film provides some of the most emotionally shattering scenes ever put to film. Cal's desperate plea for his father's love at a birthday party for Adam towards the end of the film is a monument to Dean's ability as an actor, and the ending seldom fails to leave me in tears.10/10.",

He is played by the then unknown James Dean and it's a great performance, though when you watch Dean's work here and in \"Rebel without a Cause\" and compare it with his more stilted performance in \"Giant\" you may wonder where the character begins and Dean's persona ends. It's certainly overwrought and Kazan makes great use of the wide-screen to formulate Cal's torment on the grandest possible scale. Coupled with Leonard Rosenman's symphonic score you might be forgiven for thinking this is a bit too grandly operatic but you are held as if in a vice regardless. This is one Kazan movie that repays repeated viewings.As if to counterpoint Dean's anguished method acting there are wonderfully subdued performances from Raymond Massey as his father, Julie Harris as Abra, the girl who grows to love him and Jo Van Fleet as Kate, the mother who abandoned him. This was Van Fleet's screen debut and she rightly won an Oscar for her performance.",

One can sense the worth of the film immediately in the scene where James Dean stealthily follows his 'mother' Jo Van Fleet down a dusy street.  One can actually see the heat rising from the street, and the cinematography makes one feel lost in the hot temperature.  From that moment on, EAST OF EDEN, though only a portion of the book, stands as one of those rare films in which everything comes together with an emotional explosion that never lets up, building to a climax of greatness.  James Dean gives one of the screen's finest performances, and his scenes with Raymond Massey detonate with the power of emotions unchecked and real.  Julie Harris is equally remarkable, as is Richard Davalos as Dean's brother who helps to lead the story directly into a parallel with the Cain-Abel conflict.  Jo Van Fleet deserves her Oscar and every other honor, and Lois Smith breaks your heart in her small role as a trapped young girl in VanFleet's 'house'. Rosenman's scoring is likewise stunning and always 'right'.  EAST OF EDEN stands with CITIZEN KANE, 2001, THE THIRD MAN, and very few others, as a milestone in helping us to applaud filmmaking as an art form.",

            "content": "When the majority of people think back on the career of James Dean they tend to think of Rebel Without A Cause as Dean's masterpiece and for good reason. Dean's debut, East of Eden on the other hand is an extremely poor adaptation of a novel of the same name that was written by John Steinbeck. This is the film that put James Dean on the map and was the starting point of his rise as a cultural icon. While some may call this film a milestone, it comes off as a huge misstep for director Elia Kazan.The film opens up at around \u00be of the way through the actual book and still manages to be a jumbled and uneven mess. Major characters from the book are cut out and in the process create giant plot holes. New characters are added such as Abra who changes the relationship between a lot of characters and adds different tones and themes to the film that Steinbeck originally never intended. Another problem the film suffers from is it's extremely uneven pacing, there is too much time wasted on things that never play into the actual arch of the film. Kazan seems like he tries to distract his audience rather than engage them.Elia Kazan who has shown through his previous films that he is clearly a capable director and this is the fact that makes this film so disappointing. Kazan never seems truly grasp the underlying tones of Steinbeck's book and this translates to the screen. Instead of treating his material with care and insight he instead seems to constantly exploit Dean's \"to cool for school\" attitude to manipulate the audience into empathizing with a character because of his looks and not his motives. Kazan never exposes the core essence of his characters he lets characters tell you what their characters are thinking instead of letting them show what they are feeling, a major weakness from any director. The films biggest weakness is that it never devotes enough time to character development. Characters constantly make decision's that seem out of place and unnatural. For instance when Aron becomes insane and leaves for war his fianc\u00e9 Abra is totally indifferent to the entire situation. Yet her heart breaks for Cal when he is faced with the fact that he may have to live his life without the forgiveness of his father, even though he is the cause of Aron's leaving. It seems the more and more Cal destroys the lives of the people around him the more they take him in with open arms.Aside from poor character development the film fails to give an adequate amount of back- story for certain characters. The dynamics of the relationship between Adam and his two sons is never really explored beyond face value. It is never explained how exactly Cal finds out that his mother is alive nor does the film explain the motives of the relationship between Cal and the person he starts his bean business with, who appears on screen a total of 3 times and than forgotten. The film while generally disappointing and uninspired does have its moments from time to time. Jo Van Fleet who gives the best performance in the film won the award for best supporting actress at the 1956 Academy Awards. Van Fleet's film debut proved that she could hold her own even among larger that life actors such as James Dean. Another strong point of the film can be attributed to the film's art department who do a stellar job at recreating the Salinas Valley circa the early 1900's. Cinematographer Ted McCord is the real heart of this film. McCord takes chances and they pay off. His use of lighting is more moody than most studio films of the 50's and he maintains a sense of movement even when the actor's blocking remains mostly static. McCord is responsible for developing characters that many of the unimpressive actor's in this film could not accomplish through acting. During one scene between Cal and his father McCord highlights their distorted relationship by using innovative camera tilts that gives the scene a real sense of drama that the acting lacked. The biggest tragedy resulting from this film is that Ted McCord didn't even get nominated for an Academy Award.After all these years East of Eden seems aged and uninspired. James Dean proved that he was easy to watch on camera but didn't prove that he was an accomplished actor. Unfairly critically acclaimed and winner of one deserved Academy Award East of Eden really only ever accomplishes two things. It proves that people love \"happy\" endings even if they aren't really \"happy\" and that too many people are suckers for a pretty face. It is insane to think that Steinbeck \"loved\" this film upon seeing it.",

            "content": "Years after Steinbeck wrote the novel so many love, and which I read after seeing the movie, he wrote a short book about his writing of \"East of Eden\". He confessed that the first 3/4 of the novel was a wandering in the desert, as he had an idea of what he was trying to say about good and evil, but it did not really come to him till he was almost finished.  He said he realized that good and evil were choices, but he also came to realize that this choice is often a gift .. and he made clear that, while he is not a religious person, he did see \"the light\" in view of the New Testament version of God (loving and forgiving) versus the Old Testament version, which tends to be more judgemental.  At that point, he finally knew how to end his long, wavering novel: With the very story of Cal and Aron, sons of Adam Trask, and a reverse version of the Cain and Abel story, a New Testament version, if you will.  Therefore, for everyone who loves the book, that's great.  But keep in mind that the book's author preferred the movie's emphasis over the complete novel's, and in fact, helped write the screenplay and attended the opening of the film, after which he heaped praise upon it as capturing the essence of what he was attempting to say throughout his novel.  The movie is a masterpiece.",

But I did not know what this meant. Then I saw \"East of Eden\". The moment he came on screen, staking out his \"business woman\" mother (Cate, the owner of a brothel, played by Jo VanFleet) in 1917 Monterey, I saw pain that I could identify with, even though I came from a completely different kind of family.  The director, Elia Kazan, fascinated me with the ways that he occasionally tilted the camera during very tense moments, and this was particularly effective, because the picture was in Cinemascope, which was, at that time, that unusually wide screen.  The pain of Cal Trask in trying to earn -- and finally buy -- his father's love, was enough to make me cry. It still is.  I am looking forward to the day when they put this video on widescreen, the way it was intended.  When I see it panned and scanned, I wince at the really powerful scenes that are ruined because you cannot see what is going on.  I know that many feel that James Dean gave his best performance in \"Rebel Without A Cause\", but I maintain that \"East of Eden\" is his finest work.  I have seen this movie, in the theaters and on video, well over 20 times, and the power is always there.  I always tear up during the final scene, when you cannot hear what Adam Trask is saying to his son, Cal (Dean), but the son's face tells all.  It is one of the most memorable scenes.  I also love the one-on-one meeting of Cal and Cate, the \"garden of Eden\" backyard scene where Cal seduces his brother Aron into seeing his mother as revenge, and of course, the key scene when Adam will not take the money that Cal worked so hard to give him.  This is one of the most powerful human dramas ever on film, possibly only second to \"Streetcar Named Desire\" (also a Kazan film).  My father was about Cal's age in 1917, and his father was very righteous, so I saw the kind of life (reaction to WWI) my father might have lived, had he not been faced with the choice that Cal had: Do I buy my father's love? or Do I make it impossible for my father to love me?",

            "content": "James Dean made only three films before his untimely death in 1955. EAST OF EDEN is the only one I hadn't seen and the second of the three to be shown on Reel 13. I was particularly curious about EAST OF EDEN because it paired Dean with one of his Actors' Studio mentors \u0096 director Elia Kazan. Kazan introduced the more naturalistic \"method\" acting style to Hollywood with films like A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and ON THE WATERFRONT. The impact of the collaboration is most apparent in that Dean, for the only time in his brief career, seems to be surrounded by actors with a similar background and training. In the review of REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, I noted how it often seemed that Dean was acting in his own movie, but here, he is amongst peers in Julie Harris, Burl Ives, Lois Smith and Jo Van Fleet, who won an Oscar for her supporting performance (I am usually against giving Oscars to people for less than ten minutes of screen time, but I might have to make an exception here \u0096 she was brilliant).Oddly enough, with all the familiar and talented thespians around him, Dean's presence is less effective than it was in his other work. Don't get me wrong \u0096 he displays several moments of greatness (great body language throughout, outstanding choices in the Ferris wheel scene), but as blasphemous as it might be to say, there were a few moments where I felt he went too far. He is constantly whining to such an extreme degree, that it diffuses the moments that really call for it. Now, this isn't overacting in the traditional sense. As a matter of fact, I feel similarly about this performance as I did about the recent performance by Daniel Day-Lewis in THERE WILL BE BLOOD. It's more scenery chewing than overacting. Both actors are believable when they hit those extreme emotions, but I wonder if the choice to go that far is always appropriate. While it's impressive that they can get there, they might be actually be harming the overall narrative. The more often they cry or scream, the less impact it will have as the film goes on. This is problematic because, more often than not, the end of a film requires the broader emotions more than the beginning. For example, there is a scene toward the end of EAST OF EDEN where Dean's character presents his father with a gift that he worked his ass off for, but the righteous father manages to find the negativity in it. Dean cries and convulses in full breakdown mode, almost as if he didn't have control of his motor skills. This had the potential to be very powerful \u0096 if we hadn't seen it four times earlier. To be fair, this was Dean's first film and he clearly went on to refine his craft in his next efforts.Elia Kazan also seemed a little off his game. This film, which was possibly his most ambitious in terms of scope and budget seems more like an experiment to him than anything else. I got the sense that he was almost playing with ideas and concepts. He employs these very interesting Dutch angles throughout, but very often, they don't seem to be motivated. There is an early Q&A scene between Dean and Raymond Massey. As the scene goes on, the angle becomes more off-axis, but the scene occurs too early to utilize a technique that extreme. (There is a scene later on the film when Dean is on a swing where Kazan justifies the awkward angle by using the forward movement of the swing to essentially \"push\" the camera off-axis. This works much better). Other experiments were more successful. First, this might have been the first time he shot in color and the results are astounding. The cinematography is beautiful and the colors are extraordinarily rich. Second, he is a master of staging and not in the theatrical sense. This is very much blocking for the camera frame. The best example is the scene that takes place immediately after the scene where Dean presents the gift. Dean pouts in the backyard under a huge tree. Its leaves hang so low that they obscure the entire top half of Dean. Julie Harris runs under the tree to console him so she is also hidden. (This idea of obscuring characters/moments from the camera occurs often in the Kazan oeuvre). From their legs and torso, you can tell they stand close, but is he crying on her shoulder? Are they making out? Then, Dean's brother comes out and orders Harris (his girlfriend) out from the tree. She runs out and into the foreground. The brother is in the middleground with his back to the camera and Dean is in the background, still obscured by the tree. The brother then begins to admonish Dean's character, but it's Harris' face we see \u0096 as if the brother could be referring to either one of them. It's a beautiful, simple and truly cinematic framing idea that manages to convey a multitude of ideas with one swift stroke.As you may have interpreted, I have mixed feelings about EAST OF EDEN. While the artistic achievements of the film are exciting, the film ultimately fails to pack an emotional punch, possibly because the narrative is mired in the complexities and the allegories of the Steinbeck novel it's based on. Familial relations, foreign politics, xenophobia, profiteering, infidelity, class distinctions, the nature of evil and of course, the albatross hanging over the whole thing \u0096 Biblical allegory \u0096 are all covered within the 110 minutes of EAST OF EDEN. While I think it's great that Kazan tried to layer the film with all that meaning, I wonder if he didn't push it too far. With all those deep issues crammed into one package, it's hard to care about any of them.",

James Dean, in his first major role in a major picture, sweeps you into his world as the wild, mysterious and moody Cal Trask, a young man who is hopelessly trying to gain his father's love and affection despite the fact he only seems to care for his brother, Aron. In terms of style, Dean may seem a bit melodramatic and even to the point of hysteria in some scenes. Nevertheless, he is able to get completely under the skin of this torn and complex character so richly provided by John Steinbeck, whose novel was the basis for this film. It is rather incredible to watch Dean literally throw himself into the role, keeping you on your toes wondering what he could possibly do next.As for the supporting cast, it is a good one with Julie Harris absolutely shimmering as Arba, the girl of Cal and Aron's affections, as well as Raymond Massey playing a most unlikable father figure. Jo Van Fleet also gives a rather unique performance that got her and Oscar and will definitely stick with you. At the head of all this talent and stardom is Elia Kazan, the great American director fresh off an Oscar win for On the Waterfront. Here, he attacks Steinbeck's controversial material and creates a moving and startling portrayal of people in a period that was just beginning to creep into modern and the turmoil and sadness that can break a dysfunctional family even further down.It really is a shame Dean was subjected to such an early death. His talent was monstrous and his potential endless.

What we have here is one of the holy trinity for Dean worshipers, the others being Rebel without a Cause and Giant.  Well, I remember 45+ years ago when James Dean was killed outside of Paso Robles.  I know that stretch of road well having spent a lot of time going between Bakersfield and San Luis Obispo, but I also remember seeing this film the year before.  I was less interested in Dean's being in it because he was relatively unknown at the time, having only one line in a horrible Martin and Lewis comedy (\"That man's a professional\")(ugh).  What really drew me into the theater was the coming to the screen of Steinbeck's long California novel, East of Eden. Steinbeck had written the book several years before, based on the struggle between two brothers in their quest for approval from a distant father.  I was greatly disappointed in the movie because of the radical departures from the original book but taken with the chemistry between Dean and Julie Harris.  A most underrated actress, she brings the element of Eve to the dyad of the two brothers.  The favored brother, Aron (Steinbeck was hardly subtle with the names, Caleb and Aron, sons of Adam) is played by Richard Davalos (who?), whom most of us only recognize from bit parts in Kelly's Heroes and a few others.  Veteran character and stage actor Raymond Massey does his usual excellent protrayal as does folk singer and fine actor, Burl Ives.  But, Jo Van Fleet dang near steals the show.  In effect, I was taken by the film even though I'd read the book and was expecting a great deal more of Steinbeck and less of Kazan. (Yeah, I know.  Shoulda known better) So impressed was I that I went to see the film again and have seen it at least a dozen times since.  The story is an old one and based on the book of Genesis, but it's really even older than that.  Sibling rivalry is an ancient source of myth and is reflected by various archetypes.  That is not what makes this film great.  It is Dean, Van Fleet and Julie Harris and the darkness that Kazan imbues into this story.  It is the quest for truth and the agony of discovery that makes this film work.  There's no justice here. Only the perpetual drama of human emotions.  Dean had a magic moment.  His next film, Rebel became a classic and vaulted him into the league of legend. His premature death elevated him even loftier into the world of myth.  We can only wonder what would have happened, if he'd have lived.  Would he have become a silly reminder of his iconic past, ala Brando?  We'll never know. All we have are these three films...",

This movie (along with two others) would kind of undermine that point and really give a reputation to James Dean. There is still a lot of mystery around him. And although he did other stuff too (mainly TV work/shows, which I haven't watched), the 3 movies are the ones most remember him for.This one is quite incredible. He plays not the most likeable character from the start. It is quite the opposite. But we do grow with him and learn to know him and his issues (especially with his dad, with love and his brother and more). So while this may feel strange and slow to a certain audiences, others will lap it up. Elias Kazan has left quite an incredible work of art behind. Powerful movies - with messages that still resonate today (you know family, growing up, feeling missplaced in this society - but overall with a heart of gold)",

            "content": "Of all three films featured in Warner's new James Dean box set, Elia Kazan's \"East Of Eden\" (1955) is probably the most anticipated, and for good reason. For in its brilliant pacing, its strong characterizations and its intensity and honesty, it remains one of a handful of 50s films that consistently holds up under even the most hardened scrutiny of today's cynical film critic. Long precluded from general release, because of a rights issue, this film based on John Steinbeck's classic literary masterwork of paradise lost, takes place in Salinas Valley, in and around World War I. James Dean is ideally cast as Cal Trask, a brash young man of conviction who feels he is being forced to compete for fatherly nepotism against his brother Aron (Richard Davalos). The boy's father, lettuce farmer, Adam (Raymond Massey) to be sure, favors Aron. Hence, around every corner, in every venture or endeavor that Cal undertakes, he is frustrated and ultimately defeated. Eventually the two brothers grow in conflict over Abra (Julie Harris) a fine young flower of a girl who at first takes a shine to Aron but slowly begins to appreciate the finer character in Cal. This Cain and Abel-ish tale slowly unravels to its tragic end, but in such a swell of emotion and longing, that the viewer is quite suddenly astonished to recognize the long absence in our own character driven dramas that current cinema culture seems to have completely forgotten about. In their cameos as kept women of a brothel Anne and Kate \u0096 the latter being Cal's mother - Jo Van Fleet and Lois Smith absolutely tear one's heart out with their subtle and poignant performances. Kazan, who was soon to be labeled a communist by HUAC \u0096 then exonerated for naming names, but blacklisted by his own kind in Hollywood, very clearly has a handle on what makes Steinbeck's novel tick. He fills the vast expanses of Cinemascope with subtle nuances that make the fish-eye process seem intimate and sleek, and he imbues the overriding narrative with a particularly touching sense of lost love and looming tragedy that works so well, one almost forgets this is a movie. Of all three films included in the James Dean box set, this is the one that looks the worst on DVD. Having said that, the results are not all together terrible. Though the palette of color is rather faded in comparison to the other two films reviewed (Rebel Without A Cause, and , Giant) alone it is quite adequate for a film of this vintage. Flesh tones are slightly pasty. Blacks are generally more deep brown or gray than black. Whites are rarely clean. There is a considerable amount of film grain during scene transitions, as is in keeping with early Cinemascope productions. The anamorphically enhanced DVD is otherwise par for the course. The audio is 5.1 and exhibits a dated, but accurate characteristic. Extras include a biography and an intense making of documentary, as well as audio commentary and theatrical trailer. Overall, nicely put together from the good people over at Warner and so right to have this film back where it belongs amongst the all time great works of art in American cinema.",

Julie Harris...Brilliant! Raymond Massey...Brilliant! Jo Van Fleet... Very underrated. I even liked Albert Dekker!But James Dean...... I really don't get it. To me, he was 'incredibly' overrated. A 'method' actor, Dean seems to have had different 'methods' than Brando, Karl Malden, Dustin Hoffman, and many others. Whenever he's on the screen, I feel like he's shouting, 'Look, Ma... I'm 'Acting'!' This guy was so over the top in everything he did! I know all the old guys at the studios at the time were trying to be 'hip' and 'with it', showing they knew what 'teen angst' was all about. They were waaaay off the mark. You want to see 'real' teen angst from that period?.... watch Sal Mineo in anything he did. In 'Rebel Without A Cause', all Sal had to do was play about 8 angst-levels down from Dean, and he was a 'real kid'. I watched about 15 minutes of 'East of Eden' with a group of twenty-somethings, and their reaction to the movie was, Who's this cornball 'Dean'??? Dean's acting was dated in '1955'.... in 2011, he's a cartoon. He would have been pretty good in silent movies.The only other Kazan movie I can't watch is his 'other' movie of the same genre, 'Splendor in The Grass', 'another' film that everyone else thinks is brilliant, but to me is off the graph.Everything else Kazan did, I can't get enough of!",

            "content": "OK, the book is a masterpiece, very layered and beautifully and intelligently written with complex characters and plenty of emotional wallop. It is a very wordy and sometimes sprawling book as well as a long one, so when it comes to be adapted things will be missed out. The film may not the greatest of adaptations, it's not as complex, Kate and Aron are far more interesting in the book(Aron could be seen as the driving force and Kate is not a plot device) and there's the omission of Lee(the one that could be seen as the character who links everything together). Despite all that though, as a film on its own- which is a much fairer way to judge because book and film are two different mediums, there are plenty of films that are not good adaptations but are great films- East of Eden is still a great film and a powerful one too. With the only flaw for me being the occasionally heavy handed direction with an over-reliance of camera tilts, sure they are deliberate choices to show the character contrasts and how distorted the relationship with Cal and his father has become but there were parts where the technique technique wasn't needed like at the dinner table. Timothy Carey's voice not sounding like Timothy Carey is a touch jarring, but not enough to be a flaw. Kazan's direction is mostly fine though and East of Eden is a wonderfully-made film, sumptuous in colour and brilliantly shot(excepting a few of the tilted camera shots), especially in the poppy field which hasn't aged a jot and actually looks as though it was shot outdoors. Some of it is clever too like with Dean standing in the doorway, the shadow that you see very symbolic of how twisted and vengeful Cal is by this point. Leonard Rosenman's score is very lush-sounding with a very sophisticated vibe, enhancing the mood in every scene beautifully. East of Eden is very intelligently written if wordy like in the book and the story is still compelling and powerful, the ending and Cal giving his father the money and his father rejecting it are heart-breaking scenes. A lot of the details from the book may not be there but the spirit and the meaning of it are. The characters drive the film very well and are interesting, especially Cal who is a very tormented character who we do feel lots of empathy for. And the acting is great, Julie Harris may be too mature but her performance is still full of innocence and compassion, Burl Ives is a charming presence, Jo Van Fleet makes Kate very memorable and layered despite her quite short screen time, Raymond Massey is perfect as the at times controlling father and Richard Davalos' screen debut is a wonderful one, you hate him at first but in the climatic scene for instance you do feel empathy for him. But the best performance does come from James Dean who is superb and the emotional power of his performance really hit home with me. His role in Rebel Without a Cause may be more iconic(and for good reason) but his role as Cal is played with more depth I feel. Overall, as an adaptation East of Eden may not be great and will leave fans wanting but as a film it is truly excellent with a lot of powerful things. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Clearly, Dean was one of the defining actors of the youthful 1950's. Rebel without a Cause (1955) may have registered more strongly with the cool cats of the time. Nonetheless, in my little book, this is the film that represents the actor's enduring triumph. Here Cal's (Dean) yawning emotional needs are on raw display, the tics, grimaces, writhings. All are excruciatingly expressive. At times it's over the top, but few can doubt the sincerity. In fact, it appears to be the real Dean on screen, and not an actor. Then too, Dean was lucky. He got one of the best young actresses of that day or any day in Julie Harris. Her lack of glamor is a real plus. That way her rather plain looks don't get in the way of a growing emotional bond with a needy Cal (Dean). I count the beanfield and ferris wheel scenes as two of the best boy-girl on record. Catch how naturally they're drawn to each other, only to shrink away at the last moment. It's like they're fearful of some kind of forbidden attraction. Still, before emotions can straighten out, the confused Cal must straighten himself out. That means getting straight with his imperious father (Massey). Then too, Abra (Harris) needs to trust her emotions rather than lifeless convention with Aaron (Davalos). Now if Dad could just stop seeing his detested ex-wife in Cal, he might bend a little. After all, having principles is not enough. They should first be the right principles, and excluding a son because of one of them is not right. Thus, it's really Dad who needs to straighten out. Then Cal would have a chance.And who better to play the emotionally constricted patriarch than the commanding Ray Massey. His scenes with Dean represent not only a clash of personalities but also a clash of acting styles. I gather the two actors didn't much like each other, which is not surprising. Anyway, the supporting parts are also well done. I especially like the often overlooked Lois Smith as the fearful, fluttery servant girl. She's really Cal's emotional counterpart, even though in a small role. I've long sympathized with Dick Davalos in the thankless role of the prissy Aaron. That, plus being overshadowed by the most compelling young actor of the day, was surely a misfortune. As a side note, filming in the Salinas Valley was a real plus, lending a large canvas to the intense drama.Despite the sometimes sprawling screenplay, the movie remains an emotional powerhouse, thanks to Dean, Harris, and director Kazan. In fact, casting the untried Dean in the role of Cal remains one of moviedom's most memorable moments. While in terms of a meteoric body of work, the young actor checked out at about the right time.",

The impact of the novel was captured in Paul Osborn's screenplay. The film served as an introduction to a young actor, James Dean, whose short life, and tragic death, made him a legend. One can see the appeal he had in audiences and the way the camera loved his features.The action takes place at the beginning of the last century in Salinas, California, \"the salad bowl of America\". Adam Trask, a single father, raising two boys in his land, gambles on an experiment, keeping the lettuce he produces surrounded by ice, something that would revolutionize how the produce grown in the valley, which would keep fresh for the Eastern markets. Adam's efforts proves a flop. Caleb Trask, a rebel young man, wonders about his mother Kate. He had been led to believe she is living in nearby Monterrey. What Caleb is not prepared is for the business his mother is involved; she is the owner of a popular brothel in town. Caleb haunts her, but she is not at all convinced she made a bad decision when she left Adam, a religious man who kept Kate away in the country.Things get complicated when Caleb falls for his brother's Aaron's girlfriend, Abra. As WWI Is declared, young Caleb decides to borrow money from his mother to start planting beans, a crop much in demand. Things between the brothers come to a head as Aaron finds out about Abra and Caleb, after the revelation of the true identity of the boy's mother.James Dean dominates everything in the film. He showed he had what it took to be a star in Hollywood. Julie Harris makes an impact as the sweet Abra. Raymond Massey plays the father with conviction.

Based on a small part of John Steinbeck's novel, it's still self contained and flows neatly from its slightly opaque beginning to its tragic end.It represents director Elia Kazan at his best. He was responsible for a few of the finest films of the decade -- \"On the Waterfront\" among them.And what a cast. James Dean never made a better movie. He's supported by Julie Harris (who once claimed she wanted to be Hollywood's homeliest movie star) and others who show a skill here that they rarely displayed on screen. If not all of them deliver like Dean, at least nobody comes anywhere near being routine, not even Burl Ives, who could be a bore in the wrong part.What adds to the film's appeal is the location shooting. It convincingly evokes the rambunctious fishing village of Monterey, California, in 1917, and the placid, golden farmland of the Salinas Valley. It still looks that way, at least until recently.I've never been a major fan of James Dean. His lost puppy-dog looks don't do much for me, and his acting in his other two major productions I thought was stylized and often weak. Maybe it was because he was hampered by the schematic plots. In \"Rebel Without a Cause,\" I found myself thinking with irritation that a kid in his comfortable middle-class position might better stop worrying about how misunderstood he was. Struck a resonant chord in many teens of the day, I suppose, but the teens I knew had more than misunderstandings hovering over their heads.There's no such problem with his character here. Oh, he's misunderstood okay, but he also misunderstands everyone else, including himself. Everyone suffers from the disadvantage of being misinterpreted and they understandably react the way most of us would react. That's what I meant when I said there are no villains.Of course, no villains means no heroes either. None of us can be perfectly \"good\", anymore than we can be perfectly \"bad\". Even the town's flinty madam -- the peachy Jo Van Fleet -- is eventually moved by a visit from the son she's ignored since his birth. The most the characters can hope for is a resolution of some of their more troublesome crossed transactions. And some of them, like Dean's brother Cal, pay more for his good karma than anyone expected him to -- and it's Dean's doing.Made for grown ups and a little challenging. There's some quiet humor in it -- not much. The rest is a bewitching story of human character and its evolution.",

It's pretty much a kind of Cain and Abel tale where we, the viewer, are trying to understand in some way, where Cain is coming from, and that's just some of what East of Eden is about. James Dean makes his character, Cal, unpredictable and amazing in all aspects. Dean's performance is up there with Brando's best and diverse performances. To think what Dean may have done, he would have been around as an actor until he was an old man, but unfortunately, it didn't go that way. That's what makes Dean's death so great and at the same time so tragic, that all of the Film Historians and film buff's know that he may have been the greatest actor of all time, it's tough to say if he was better than Brando or other greats because he only did 3 solid movies and that was it. But I think it's safe to make an educated guess from what I did see from Dean, that he was a better actor than Brando, and Brando was amazing. Dean could have written his own ticket for the rest of his life in the film industry and the irony is, he did write his own ticket, just not in the way that he or we had hoped for. East of Eden is the movie that shows he's got the goods, all 3 of his movies show that in some kind of way. Furthermore, the character I feel for the most in East of Eden is the Older brother of Dean's character in the movie. It's cold what Cal does to his older brother, but really if you look at it, it's pretty messed up what happens to all of the characters in the movie.

Novelist and Pulitzer Prize winner John Steinbeck wrote the original story which told the tale of the Trask family. The great Raymond Massey plays the patriarch, Adam Trask, a strong willed individual who believes in a strong work ethic, quotes from the bible and tries to imbue his sons with its scriptural phrases. Richard Davalos plays Aron Trask, the favorite son who dreams of success, marring his girl and living up to his father's expectations. James Dean is Caleb Trask, a troubled son who believes in his destiny which is hampered by his father's emotional ambivalence. The story is slow and difficult to identify with as nearly every character is stereo-typical of a small town. Predictions of a shaky economic future, impending war and amassed cultural biases are the back drop to a mixture of insecurities, family secrets and deeply embedded resentments. The Trask family is a mirror image of the prejudicial citizens as the two brothers vie for their share of attention from a lack-luster father. The movie is slow to build and when it does reaches it's climax, a group of Psychiatrists would have committed the entire family.

He adds an element of mystery to his character, Cal Trask, by carefully choosing which emotions to reveal to the audience and which ones to keep hidden. Dean is an extremely physical actor, and some of his most imitated acting flourishes are his mannerisms and movements. Throughout the film, he slouches, fidgets, pulls on his ear, lies down in the dirt with his beans, and throws his head back to highlight his frustration. These attempts at naturalistic acting are among the best ever committed to celluloid. Dean is the movie. There's no question about that. But, there's some excellent support from Julie Harris, Raymond Massey (as his cold, remote father), and Jo Van Fleet as his long-lost mother. Elia Kazan took advantage of the fact that some of the actors, most notably Massey, did not get along with Dean, and was able to make the bitter exchanges and arguments between the characters all the more believable.",

The somewhat harrowing story of two brothers desperate for their father's love and support makes it a strikingly emotional experience, and can be considered, even today, as relative.  The very strong performances by Raymond Massey (who truly was one of Filmdom's best when given a chance) and Burl Ives added so very much to the passion and pathos of this movie.   Richard Davalos as the brother to Cal (Dean) played his role with a great deal of feeling, and makes one wonder why his career never really went further.  The Academy Award going to Jo Van Fleet did surprise me a bit, as it was really only a small appearance, but she was excellent in it.  It could never be classed as a happy film, but a true experience.  I though Julie Harris in a pivotal role underplayed it perfectly.",

            "review_title": "The Generation Gap",
            "content": "A lot of viewers watch this film probably because of the presence of James Dean; this was his first major role. Dean plays Cal Trask, the teenage main character: rebellious, confused, brooding, trying without much luck to please his stern father Adam (Raymond Massey). Cal and his brother Aron (Richard Davalos) are rivals for their father's respect. It's all supposed to be a modern \"take\" on the story of Cain and Abel. Indeed, the script has lots of references to the Bible. And Adam is annoyingly pious, self-righteous, and brazenly inept as a father, with his favoritism toward Aron.The more interesting motif, however, is the rift between Cal and his dad, two people who can't seem to communicate, emblematic of the 1950s generation gap, when kids were starting to break away from the previous generation. Adam represents tradition; Cal represents rebellion and change. Reinforcing this impression is a none-too-subtle hint of juvenile delinquency, again in the Cal character, and more especially in Dean's interpretation of Cal.The film's plot is meandering. The pace is slow. Shot in CinemaScope, the visuals have an irritating letterbox projection that fills only about half the screen. Tint trends ever so slightly greenish. That was probably deliberate to stress the pastoral setting, as the story takes place in a small town not far from the sea in California, circa 1917. Background music is nondescript and manipulative, characteristic of films from the 1950s.Acting is the best element. Dean does a pretty good job as Cal. Julie Harris gives a nice interpretation of Abra, Aron's love interest. And with her method acting skills, Jo Van Fleet gives arguably the best performance as the cold, shrewd business lady whom Cal takes an interest in, early in the plot.Though the acting makes the film worth watching, and the generation gap theme is interesting, I simply could not get interested in the period setting, with those old cars, Victorian clothes, horse wagons, and chitchat about lettuce farming. \"East Of Eden\" has the look and feel of a Norman Rockwell painting, with its fuzzy Americana idealism and pride.Period setting aside, the real story here is that of an outsider at odds with that goody-goody American traditionalism of the 1950s. Maybe that's what makes the film so popular, helped along by the presence of a promising young movie star who died before his time.",

            "review_title": "How can a brilliant novel be betrayed so much?",
            "content": "This film is a classic because of James Dean who is probably at his best here; It is a classic too because it usurps the title of a classic novel by John Steinbeck. It is unimaginable why Steinbeck accepted that film since it is a pure perversion of his novel. Steinbeck should have rejected his paternity and asked for important damages. Maybe that was to long before Stephen King's and the Lawnmower Man. Elia Kazan is here the main culprit and should be brought to court.The place is all wrong. It is exclusively Salinas and the bottom of the valley and not at all the ranch up the valley where nearly two thirds of the novel take place. Of course those two thirds are completely eradicated from the film. The brothels, or houses of ill fame are situated in a coastal city, Monterey, beyond a ridge of mountains which prevents the boys from plainly walking to Kate's. Caleb has to take a train to go there, which makes the last twist in the story, Caleb walking his brother Aron to the brothel to meet his mother is impossible because it is unimaginable that Aron, in the state of rejection of his brother he is at that moment, would in any way have accepted to take a freight train to Monterey.That's not the only un-understandable change on places and locales. The book concentrates on only one very short period of time in the novel and is obliged to move everything around. The car for instance is delivered in the book in the ranch up the valley when the boys are very young teens and not in Salinas. That of course changes everything. But the greatest changes are with the characters.The characters have no past which means they have no density. They are caricatures and sketches but they are not human. For example Kate, or Cathy if you prefer: her criminal past is not mentioned, the firing of a gun at Adam is then purely circumstantial and not the continuation of a criminal nature. Her killing the Madame of the whore house some time after the moment when she arrives there and after that madame has signed the will that gives the whore house to Kate, is of course erased and you cannot understand how without one single cent or even dime under her name, when she runs away from her husband and her sons, she can become the sole owner of the whore house, and what's more accepted by the sheriff. In the same way her planning to blackmail all the important people of the community who have visited her house at some time or other is of course taken away. The film even gives her some positive side since she lends the five thousand dollars Caleb needs to start his bean business with Will Hamilton and we don't even know what's the connection between the Trasks and the Hamiltons since it goes back to the first two thirds of the novel.Her final suicide and her final will giving everything to her son Aron, and only that one, at the moment when he is dying in France is of course taken away.The second intolerable change is the erasing of Lee, the Chinese servant of the family who was there before the birth of the boys and who raised them in the total absence and inconsistency of the father. Lee does not exist in the film. Then who takes care of the house? Who cooks? Who prepares coffee? And who lends the five thousand dollars? Lee is the acme of good in this pile of manure and he is the only one who, with Chinese wisdom, can turn a shovelful of manure into a plateful of gold. He is the one who makes Adam forgive Caleb for his horrible act that sent Aron to his death. The end turns mushy and spineless and nerveless and innocuous, unimportant, banal.The third change is Adam. Adam is a careless totally non-invested person who was made that by the running away and shooting of Cathy/Kate. He is the one who never quotes the Bible in the book. The only reading in the Bible he does is the turning point and central nervous system of the whole novel, and this reading that took place on the ranch up in the valley, and not at Adam's initiative, is of course taken out: the 16 first verses of the fourth chapter of Genesis (Abel and Cain) with the particularly central verse 7 and the long research and discussion of the meaning of that verse in the book. It is the conviction of Lee taken from Chinese wisdom that man is free to choose good or evil that brings Lee to go back to the Hebrew version of that verse 7 with four other learned Chinese in San Francisco and two rabbis and find out that all available translations quoted in the book are lies because they replace the freedom of choice of man given by God himself with a prediction from God or an order from God. Adam is not a Bible quoting bigot. Adam is not rejecting Caleb because he is doing bad things, but because he Adam has selected Aron as the only true one because he looks like the picture of Cathy he has kept in his mind. He loves Aron as if he were his runaway wife and he rejects Caleb because he does not look like her, in fact he looks like Charles, Adam's brother, another erasure in the film.The lettuce episode is reduced to nothing. This film with a tremendous young actor who could have done a career if he had not been frustrated to the point of dying in a speeding car is unluckily a complete betrayal of the novel and the phenomenal message Steinbeck was levelling at our blind and vengeful society.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",

            "content": "Even though Steinbeck supervised this screen adaptation, the screenplay takes great liberties with the book, excising about 75% of the plot. The results are often confusing, with some characters behavior and motivation left more than a little underdeveloped. Despite the great performances by Massey, Van Fleet, and especially Julie Harris, the attention is forever on James Dean.It's almost impossible to objectively separate Dean the actor from Dean the icon. However much he tries to create a unique and involving character of depth and subtlety, the viewer is constantly aware that they are really watching James Dean, poster child for teen-angst and 50's youthful rebellion. Though his real talent can be forever debated, not least due to the fact that we have so few performances on which to build an opinion, nobody can argue with the simple fact that he is fascinating to watch. Whenever he enters the frame, the viewer can't take their eyes off him. His performance is so detailed, so unexpected. Example \u0096 Cal is standing at the top of the ice chute. He lights a cigarette. When his father notices, he shouts up for Cal to put it out. Any other actor would have taken the cigarette from his mouth and thrown it to the ground. Dean, instead, leans forward, opens his mouth, and just lets the cigarette fall. It's moments such as these, and there are a thousand throughout the movie, that makes you aware that you are watching the birth of a new kind of acting, and it's never less than fascinating to see.The plot descends into the kind of melodrama and soap opera theatrics so beloved of post-war family sagas; the score, all lush and yearning strings, is too syrupy and intrusive; the production design makes very little effort to establish time and place (Aron Trask sports a greased back DA in 1917!); and Van Fleet's Kate is pitifully underdeveloped. And yet despite these flaws, the movie is extremely satisfying and well deserving of its classic status.",

Where it seems that he ends up seducing her and saying to himself: \"hey I was only acting!.

This enhanced my appreciation for the book by providing a setting that expanded on my limited imagination when reading the book. However, I think it is a mistake to judge this movie from the book. It is not the book. It should be judged for what it is and not for what it might have been.The story is that of conflicts within the Trask family: Adam, a stern moralistic father (Raymond Massey); Cal, a rebellious son (James Dean); Aron, the dutiful and favored son (Richard Davalos); and Kate, a woman from Adam's past (Jo Van Fleet). As Abra, Julie Harris provides a love interest for the Trask boys and Burl Ives is a standout as the diplomatic local sheriff who knows a lot of the town's secrets. The cast is near perfect, except that Dean and Harris seem a little old for their parts and Davalos does not quite hold is own with the other actors. If conflict is what drives good drama, then there is enough here to go around. Cal wants the approval his father but does not know how to get it, and he cannot always suppress his evil demons--he is at war with himself. Adam is at a loss as to how to control his unruly son, his strict discipline and Bible readings are not the answer. Abra starts out as Aron's girlfriend, but sees Cal as more interesting and a little dangerous and of course that sets off a great sibling rivalry between the brothers. As a shadowy figure from Adam's past Kate plays a crucial role. We watch with interest as these personalities bump against each other.I found the basic struggle between Cal and Adam to be quite believable. I think most everyone has encountered someone who dominates by force of will and strict moral authority. Such people usually command respect, but they can be intimidating. Mixing a person of Cal's temperament with a father like Adam is bound to produce some fireworks.I thought James Dean was ideal for the part of the sensitive, misunderstood, moody, and independent Cal who was torn between his pious father and his disreputable mother. The image Dean creates for Cal in this movie seems to apply to the image we have of Dean himself. I have wondered about the extent to which he manufactured that image. One can only speculate as to what kind of career Dean would have had. He was good at playing the vulnerable, sensitive, and tormented sort, but it is hard to picture him ever achieving a powerful performance to match Marlon Brando in \"On the Waterfront\" or Paul Newman in \"The Hustler.\" The score is intrusive in places, but the main theme is one that sticks in the mind. Whenever I think of this movie, I think of that music.",

The entire film reminded me of a Minghella work, due to it's rich and extremely layered characters. I'm way too beat to go into a lot of detail, but I must say that the film features some of the most diverse, unique and sensationally intricate characters ever brought to film. Each one is so different from one another, and completely unique to cinema even today, let alone in 1955. Just like Minghella's The English Patient, this film displays how war can severely affect those who aren't directly involved. The war brought out many different controversies in the film and ended up being a huge catalyst for the destruction of Cal and Aron's relationship, the climatic clash between Cal and his father, and the absolutely jaw-dropping finale.I really adore seeing films that show that aspect of war, since I find it much more interesting than seeing soldiers, and this film really perfects the display of hardships. The film also clearly has some biblical undertones (the title for one, the boy's names, but mainly in the Cain and Abel-esquire relationship between Cal and Aron) that I found very interesting. James Dean delivers one of the finest performances I've ever seen. I can now say, without any hesitation, that he was the greatest actor whom ever lived. This is just further display of what a travesty his untimely death was. His boyish charm and rugged good looks are a pleasure to watch, and it certainly doesn't help that he delivers nothing short of a tour de force.

It definately has both great characters and an intriguing conflict. The movie is about family, only unlike Rebel, it is about just one family. This family is filled with secrets and lies about its past. Dean sets out to disclose these secrets and it causes extreme and unexpected results. In this movie, just like Rebel, Dean gives a terrific performance, but I think this one is more about plot whereas that one was more about character. Both, however, are very strong in both areas.

He was perhaps the new Marlon Brando or so many other things, but his tragic car accident ended to his all to brief career. What we do have of him is 3 movies, my favorite being East of Eden. Elia Kazan found the unknown actor, like many others, as part of an acting school for method actors and decided to use him in the movie.East of Eden is a more modern reselling of the story of Cain and Abel. Cal must compete for his father's love with his brother Aron. His Dad, is a stern bible-thumping man who has a secret he keeps from his children. It's really that simple but done quite well. Too bad Elia left out half of the original novel recounting their father's pastElia Kazan is an actor director and the preformacnes show. I've talked about James Dean for a good while now, and for good reason. His performance is probably one of the finest I've seen from. His mannerism and expression become Cal Trask. He shines in every scene he's in. In interaction with Adam Trask, his father played by Raymond Massey is almost too perfect. The actors seriously hated each other so don't ink it's all in the script. Elia Kazan just fueled the flames and it helps the movie. Jo Van Fleet also does a chilling commendable job as the brother's mother. The weak link in the cast is Richard Davalos, who is acceptable but easily outshines by everyone else in the cast.Elia Kazan is the best director of the time in America and his films show. The use of CinemaScope shows e films scale, same with the music and overture. The use of odd angled shots shows the balance of the world and is revolutionary at the time. This film however has a few flaws. It drags a bit in the middle and beginning,besides the opening scene. I would've also loved if he included the whole novel into the movie too and would've helped the size of film Elia was trying to make.Overall great movie and should be watched by all people going into acting. 8/10",

What I found even more dismaying was that John Steinbeck apparently approved of Kazan's cinematographic adaptation. (Please, correct me if I am wrong.)If you were captivated by Lee's interpretation of the Cain and Abel story, and how it plays out in the story (the last word uttered by Adam Trask is Timshel: Thou mayest), then you'll certainly find this movie to be wanting; I don't think James Dean's performance can redeem this major flaw.",

It sounds from this as if it could well be similar territory to \"Rebel Without a Cause\", and given the events it's also perhaps not too far away from the real person - but nevertheless it's a striking portrayal that shows unmistakable 'fire' and talent.James Dean is not one of those people who've come to be mythologised due to outside circumstances entirely beyond their control; for the consummate skill in his craft and the posthumous Oscar recognition brings something just as weighty to the table. About as far removed from the Orlando Bloom poster boy of his generation as it's possible to be, my expectations were completely trumped. There was real depth present, too.All else is at least good, but it's the memory of a sobbing Cal all at once being transformed into a creature of hidden menace that I will take away with me. A riveting display from a fine actor, and undoubtedly a lasting testament to a lamentably short career. 9/10.",

I found the seeming profundity of Dean's skulking to not be as deep as it maybe was in 1955; subsequently, I just didn't bother to see this for a while. Now that I've laid eyes and ears and my heart on East of Eden, I get it, and I'm sorry (to who I don't know, myself I guess) that I waited so long - at least in some part.It's simply a more complex, fully emotionally well-rounded and tragic tale of a family becoming unglued as an entire town does circa WW1 (as the Americans are finally called upon to enter and the one German in town is given the 'f-you' treatment). Kazan has a good grasp on the larger-picture-of-things, but it's even more heartbreaking when it comes to this young guy, his brother, his father and mother, and how twisted everything becomes. When everything falls apart, it's ugly and shocking because of the layers of the spirit stripped bare.Even the tilted camera angles at the dinner table (and later) where Caleb and his dad talk mean so much for the psychological effect - and then later at the funhouse mirrors in the fair it's more obvious and yet its a briefly happier moment in time. Dean plays his inner turmoil for all he's got, and the story has the foundation for his method approach to strike. And Jo Ann Helms earned the hell out of that Oscar for her couple of scenes - when he comes to her for the money, my god - plus Raymond Masey in his big money scene, too.Slight liabilities, I'm not sure if I saw much spark between Dean and Julie Harris (who is quite good), and Davaros is a bit two dimensional compared to everyone else.",

True, I hadn't read the novel and probably wouldn't have like the film if I had. I'm basing this on the screenplay and adaptation alone. Glorioulsy filmed in CinemaScope with a lush score and interesting story of the love of one son to be loved by his cold father. It would have been nice to have had the characters a little more developed, especially AAron and Kate. Surprised that Kate would actually settle down as a madam in a town so close to where she left. She was bound to be found out. Wonder why she didn't go East as the father had said. Of course, there would be no story if she had. Anyway, aside from that quibble, EAST OF EDEN is quite a masterpiece in its own right. As for James Dean. Perfect for this role, however, he played this same role in his following two films. How much range Mr Dean had as an actor will never be known. Basically, from all I have read, he was just playing himself. Moody, broody, sad, morose and mixed-up...like his real life. Same for REBEL and GIANT. I know he was scheduled to film SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME and FASTED GUN ALIVE. Perhaps he would have given a different performance in those.",

The framing goes along with the scenery and shapes of rooms to create leading lines like in paintings or photographs to attract the viewers eyes more. One notable part of the cinematography was the use of dutch camera angles which got under my skin at the right moments by showing the scene as being slightly tilted to make the scenario seem more crazy; it acts as a good means to make the viewer feel more like the characters.The parts are all very well played, especially by James Dean. He looks creepy at first, but that is only to help introduce his character in a way that most characters see him as being. You slowly get the sense that there is a sensitive person inside of him who becomes his greatest enemy and ally.The characters are very well written and the character development makes the entire movie interesting. The slow deterioration of the brother is very easy to see, but isn't overdone by leaving the comforts of only being subtle in storytelling. You begin to feel sorry most of the main characters.The lighting is good. It feels a little too realistic at first with the sun being bright for a good majority of the first 15 minutes, but as the story develops. It constantly switches between dark and bright lighting to create a mood. It does this in a special way to only show lights and darks in certain parts of the screen to exaggerate feelings that are already in the viewer. There is one scene where James Deans's character does a shameful act and as he leaves, it switches to the next shot where you only see his shadow upside down and pans upward to show the person like the camera is telling the viewer that the person is dark and wicked.The story is very emotional which makes it interesting even if it may seem predictable in a couple of parts. It can be very hard to predict many of the events, especially those events that happen in the last 40 minutes. It's a good movie to watch for anyone who wants something to think about for a day.",

Steinbeck's East of Eden is a classic for a reason.This review is for him......and East of Eden IS why we remember him after all these years.Dean's visceral performance, so effortless, so natural, speaks of an innate talent for representing the human condition and all its varied schisms.Without missing a single beat, he gives us the agonizing youth desperate for love and approval that so many of us can identify with. And not for a single second does he lapse into that static performance so many actors today can't seem to escape.Through an amazing use of time, an ability to manipulate subtle body cues and facial expressions, and his ever present hum... he makes you feel as if no space exists between himself and the audience. He is present every single second, whether it's in the fidgety movements of a young man, or in the piercing glare that haunts us long after the film is done. Even as his back is turned, you know... no, you FEEL how he feels, you want as he wants, you exist because he exists.If other actors are present within the movie I can not say, my eyes are only for him. His words, his voice, they melt upon me like honey and I can't get enough. Is this what the Twilight girls feel for Robert Pattinson? Is there some spark of Dean in his performance? Maybe... maybe he will be the one to watch in the future. But for me, always for me, it will be Dean... and his precious few movies that have my heart aflutter, my palms slick with sweat, my mind racing with wonder.Dean's hunger, his passion, his reckless abandon, and his fluid sexuality... it exists beyond space and time and is forever available to us because of this spectacular film.

I wondered why everyone in town sees him in this light as he tries so hard to do right, but is pidgeonholed into the Cain role.  The fact that the film contained almost autobiographal elements from Dean's own life gives the film extra poignance.Raymond Massey is fine as Adam Trask.  An outwardly likeable and respected man, Adam Trask has a curious insensitive and self-righteous streek in personality.  Adam is able to lecture Cal on his misdeeds, but sees nothing wrong in lying to his son about his mother.Julie Harris is touching as Abra, Cal's brother's fiancee.  A sweet local girl, she tries in vain to act as an emotional bandaid to the Trask family, but ends up being more the catalyst that tears them apart.The film was obviously a personal one for director Kazan(who had problems with his own father and was ostrasized for his HUAC testimony). You can feel the tension in his characters just beneath the surface.  Abra's forgiveness plea to Adam after Cal's atrocious act could well be taken from Kazan's own life.  The film's blazing colour and beautiful Leonard Rosenman score adds to the emotional charge.Keep plenty of kleenex handy for the birthday sequence through to the end of the film.",

The character hero-season breaks up the dialog with the audience the values that society seeks to stabilize and perpetuate. Good and evil switch sides all the time, making the viewer question the hegemonic values. An interpretation that seeks a kind of unconscious identification with the viewer's skepticism. For this reason, it is certainly a film that helps us understand the cinema as made today.

            "content": "Maybe I shouldn't have read the book immediately before diving into this big-screen adaptation. Even still, I'm quite sure I wouldn't have cared for it. Elia Kazan's altered, stripped-down take on John Steinbeck's classic tome discards several crucial characters, corrupts a few more, pointlessly changes themes and completely misses the point of its source material.Lee and Samuel, the novel's two most enduring, intriguing moral anchors, are completely excluded from the cinematic take, and in their absence the remaining cast seems to move without a firm direction, lashing out and contradicting themselves. It's shocking, how few genuinely likable characters remain in the finished film. Cal, deeply conflicted but relatable in the novel, is repurposed into a brooding, reckless, self-pitying brat in a barely-contained turn by James Dean. Aron, his naive, virtuous twin brother, becomes a sanctimonious, temperamental jerk whose sudden collapse musters little sympathy. Their father, who always meant well, despite his struggles with a bitter past, is now a two-dimensional hypocrite without depth. It's not the first time I've seen a movie divert so wildly from its roots, but it's a particularly bad example of doing so without just cause.The production does deserve credit for experimentation, although even those fruits are a mixed bag. Stutters and stumbles are left in the dialog, which lends an unusual sense of spontaneity and honesty, but also accentuates Dean as a very awkward, rough-edged actor, not quite ready for the spotlight that's been shone upon him. Frequently ambitious camera angles scratch a creative itch, but distract from the important plot developments proceeding within. The entire film is like this, brimming like a potful of ideas, half-cooked and then served as a chewy, unrewarding finished product.In essence, it's a bit of a phantom, bearing the ghost of a great premise but lacking in substance and heart. Threads are weakly pursued and then abandoned. Resolutions, if and when we get them, pack very little emotional punch. I expected much more. What an underachievement.",

It is simply amazing, no matter how times I see it, how perfectly he fit that role. The loss of his real mother at age 9, not living with his father as a teenager growing up in Indiana, would leave any young adult yearning to find out about his real parents. In the case of this film, it's the mother again who left him at a young age. In her interviews in the James Dean Documentary , Julie Harris admits that she really loved him. The scene on the ferris wheel I think captures some of that. One feels real passion between Dean and Harris,not just 2 actors. And the contempt and dislike Raymond Massey had for Dean shows in the scenes when Adam displays his anger toward Cal. I've read a lot of actors such as Rock Hudson did not like Dean because of his ability to steal scenes with ad-libs, etc. But the truth about James Dean is that he was a terrific talent with unlimited potential. and this film more than the other 2 he made really proves it.",

This is not to say, however, that Julie Harris' (Abra) acting wasn't equal in quality to her on screen partner, she was fabulous as well! This film is a (much shorter) version of Steinback's perplex yet fascinating classic. The film represents a more modern version of the biblical Cain and Able story. Through Dean's excellent performance as Cain and unmistakable body language (especially with his eyes) it is almost effortless for the audience to feel anything but what Dean feels. Abel, played by Cal's brother Aron (Richard Davalos) is clearly favored by their father, casting a rebellious light on Cal's character. In the beginning, as Cal follow's his mother (Jo Van Vleet) down, what seems like, a steaming street. The cinematography in this film allows it's viewer to feel completely 'there' with the character. In this particular scene, the camera allows it's viewers to feel just how hot that street could be. The music accompanied with this movie is always appropriate from scene to scene. I truly enjoy this film and was very happy when I saw that it was a movie that our class would be watching! I rate it an 8 out of 10! Excuse my in formalness here but...YEY FOR JAMES DEAN!",

She left out so much of the plot and character development, if I hadn't read the book I would not understand what was going on.Let's start with the way the characters were interpreted. Cal seems like he has a bolt loose rather than him being evil which I found hard to digest. Aron is played very well and appears to be innocent like he should be up until the end where he goes crazy and smashes the window with his head which never happened in the book by the way. My favorite character in the book who I believe to be the most in depth and complex, Lee, wasn't even in there! In the novel Kate always looked young and beautiful and had a large scar on her forehead which was key to the allegorical parallelism in the book, however in the movie she had no scar and was very wrinkled.Perhaps the biggest disappointment in this movie is in the last scene where Adam is dying and he doesn't say the word \"Timshel\". The entire book leads up to this moment and is the overall message Steinbeck tries to convey and it's not in the movie. The good thing about this movie though, are the dramatic fight scenes were performed in such a way that it sounds like a joke so you can't help but laugh. I really don't like how the director interpreted the novel, maybe if I didn't read East Of Eden before hand, I might have actually liked the movie. so my advice is; if you've read the novel, don't watch the movie, it will most definitely ruin your day.",

            "content": "\"And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.\" (Genesis 4:16)East of Eden is, for the most part, the biblical story of Cain and Abel, retold for the 20th Century. James Dean plays Cal Trask, a young, rebellious kid who resents his distant, uptight father( Raymond Massey). He's always kept Cal at arms length and disapproved of his every move. Aron (Richard Davalos), on the other hand is the prefect, if a bit vapid, son. Cal learns that his Mother, whom his father has told them was long dead is in fact the Madame of a nearby town. It's also implied that she's a junkie. When Cal pursues some kind of a connection with her, or a relationship of some kind, much disruption and drama ensues.Photographed in Cinemascope by Ted McCord (The Sound Of Music, The Sand Pebbles), the film is, I think, an amazing thing to watch. Elia Kazan used extensive locations in and around Monterey and Salinas. The Cinemascope frame is used to amazing advantage, with beautiful central coast landscapes captured stunningly. There is an early scene where Dean rides on top of a railroad car at 55 mph. This is no process shot. They actually put Dean up there and let the train speed along, with a camera mounted on the top of the boxcar. I thought that was an amazing shot, and wildly daring. Dean was an unknown at this time, as was Julie Harris. Still, it was an amazing risk to take. Just one of many interesting shots in this film.Also used brilliantly is the wide screen potential in interior, intimate scenes. Shot composition is so dynamic. They just don't seem to take the care these days to light and compose images like they did when the medium was still relatively fresh. We've really lost something, I'm afraid. It seems to me that the art of the motion picture is taken for granted or, in the worst cases, never even considered. James Dean was truly amazing, He really was. The veneration and hype of Dean's persona and legend is justified, in my opinion. He had a quality about him that was totally, utterly fresh and new. He approached acting from the weirdest place. Part method, part psychotic, but totally offbeat. Utterly offbeat.If you've never actually seen James Dean act, you'll be really surprised. You'll also understand why he astounded the staid, unsophisticated audiences of 1955. My god, but he must've been a total bolt from the blue. Then he was just dead. Gone. Wiped out. This film was just a few weeks in release, the audience was just turning on to this discovery. \"Rebel Without a Cause\" was in post production, and Dean was finishing shooting \"Giant\" when he was instantly killed in a high speed crash on a lonely highway in central California. He was on his way in his Porsche Spyder to a race in Paso Robles when he was creamed.He'd been famous for about 6 weeks only.6 weeks.Elia Kazan thinks James Dean was too eccentric to have lasted long. He believes his fame would've been transitory. Perhaps Kazan is right. We'll never know. I think he would have endured, and branched out as a writer. He would've lasted somehow. He never had the chance to grow.",

            "content": "This Warner Brothers production probably was James Dean's greatest feat. In this character study, he comes across excellently as the bitter brother Cal (Caleb) Trask who is, for all practical purposes, unloved and rejected. When he is supposed to be hostile, he is very much this way toward his brother Aron, played superbly by Richard Davalos. Raymond Massey, definitely an outstanding actor, as the father Adam Trask was one you wanted to hate because of his bitterness and hard-cored hate toward the youngest son Cal, while at the same time he definitely wanted everyone to know that he loved Aron. It's only fair and more accurate to say that the movie is based on only a part of John Steinbeck's outstanding novel. It doesn't deal with Adam Trask as a baby and young boy, and later the man who was abandoned by his wife Cathy. In turn, it doesn't deal with Cathy as the promiscuous person who was this way even as a girl. Still, it is an outstanding production. Again, the story addressed the matter of hypocrisy, since Adam and Aron were allegedly the Christians in the family. They were, again, however, hypocrites since they didn't really love Cal. In the story, in their early days of marriage Cathy Trask left Adam because he was, in a sense, claiming to be so good. Though Jo Van Fleet did not act in any \"outstanding\" movie, she was very capable in this movie as the madam which Cathy Trask became. She should be given credit for this, despite the role of the base person she portrayed. It can be, as has been, considered a modern-day parody of the story of Cain and Abel. In one scene, after a gift Cal gave his father Adam was rejected, which spurned Cal to kill his brother, after the \"killing\" (which was actually a nervous breakdown on Aron's part after Cal one day \"introduced\" Aron to their mother) when Adam asks Cal where Aron was, Cal answers by saying he didn't know and then says in a smart-aleck manner that he was not his brother's keeper. (Of course, the \"modern day\" was 1917 in northern California.) Again, it was an excellent character study, and a superb role for Dean which only he could have patentedly played. And too, it was a great masterpiece for the producer Elia Kazan. The pristine beauty of northern California was impressive. Because of the beautiful scenery, the excellent acting, and the probing story, this great production is considered something of a classic.",

James Dean (Oscar-nominated) is out of this world however here and he alone is the only real reason to give the production a try. He stars as the bad seed brother who is fascinated by his long-believed dead brothel-running mother (Oscar winner Jo Van Fleet) who he finds out about and stays constantly at odds with his straight-laced father (Raymond Massey). Richard Davalos seems out of place as the good sibling, while his girlfriend (an annoying Julie Harris) is almost totally wasted and unwanted. The biggest problems here are the filmmakers' inability to match the original novel's depth/complexity and uneven characters across the board. Dean and Van Fleet carry the whole project by themselves and really Van Fleet is rarely around when you stop to think about it. Dean's influence raises the entire flimsy movie, much like he did with the equally underachieving \"Rebel Without a Cause\". 4 stars out of 5.",

            "review_title": "While James Dean performs spectacularly in his role as Cal, East of Eden diverges too much from the original novel for my taste.",
            "content": "John Steinbeck's novel, East of Eden, has been hailed as a literary masterpiece, even earning a Nobel Prize in literature. Filmmaker Elia Kazan directed the film adaptation of East of Eden. The film stars James Dean as Caleb Trask, Richard Davalos as Aron Trask, Raymond Massey as Adam Trask, and Julie Harris as Abra. The film was also hailed as great, and was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, of which it won one for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. I, however, disagree with The Academy's opinion of the movie. While James Dean portrayed Cal Trask very well, the movie changed the theme of the book and left out two very significant characters.Caleb Trask, or Cal as he's referred to in the book, is a very emotionally complex character. He is the representation of Cain in the youngest generation of the Trask family. But unlike Adam's brother Charles, Cal actually wants to be good and fights the his inner darkness for the entirety of his story arc. Therefore, to portray Cal accurately an actor must be able to show the inner turmoil of emotions that Cal feels whenever he feels himself slipping over to the dark side. Jimmy Dean captures this mentality amazingly. In several scenes you can actually see him squirm and struggle with his emotions over Aron, Abra, and his father. In one particularly heart wrenching scene, after Adam rejects Cal's gift, Dean, improvising outside of the script, slowly crawls over to Massey and embraces him in a bear hug, crying and sobbing loudly. Adam then pushes Cal away, only increasing the audience's sympathy for Cal. In my opinion, this scene was the highlight of Dean's acting in the entire movie, and except for a few glaring examples, Dean is able to portray this same level of dedication to his character for most of the movie. It's no wonder he was nominated for an Academy Award for this role. However, Dean's acting can't save this movie.The novel dealt with many themes, foremost among them the theme of Timshel, or free will. There are several conversations about Timshel throughout the book, usually between Lee, Samuel, or Adam, and in the ending scene of the book, when Cal is begging his father for forgiveness, Adam's last word is Timshel. Thus, the biblical allusion to the story of Cain and Abel is completed, and the theme of free will is brought to the forefront. In the movie, the same scene is treated radically different. Instead of saying Timshel, Adam tells Cal to get rid of the nurse and asks Cal to take care of him himself. The message of the movie is redemption, and the last scene lets the audience know that Cal has finally redeemed himself to his father and finally won his acceptance and love. This theme of redemption is a polar opposite to the theme of the book. The novel's grandest message is that everyone has to choose to be good or bad, and you aren't born bad or predestined to be good. Using the Cain and Abel parable, Steinbeck even goes so far as to say that God won't guarantee that Cain, and therefore humanity, will overcome sin, but that it's up to Cain to choose to overcome sin himself. This theme of free will cannot coexist with the theme of redemption or seeking love and acceptance, because seeking redemption puts your fate in someone's else's hands, not your own. Cain sought redemption from God, and God told him that it was up to him to make the right choices. The movie radically changed the moral of the story, which alienated most people who read the book, including myself.Lastly, the movie adaptation skipped the majority of the book. Now, it's well known that a movie can't capture every detail in a book, and I even enjoy it when movies take some artistic liberties with their source material. However, when the movie leaves out two of the most significant characters in the book, I think it loses something in the process. Specifically, the movie left out Samuel Hamilton and Lee. For the most part, Steinbeck uses Samuel, an Irish immigrant, and Lee, a Chinese servant for the Trask family, to explore American racism and to discuss the philosophical ideas raised in the book. Additionally, Samuel and Lee are often integral parts of the story. They are the two people who pull Adam out of his stupor after Cathy leaves him, and Samuel is the one who thinks of Aron and Cal's names. After Samuel dies, Lee becomes the moral, intellectual, and philosophical backbone of the entire Trask family and the book as a whole. It's Lee who actually discovers Timshel, after studying the original Hebrew of the Bible, and brings it to the attention of Samuel, Adam, and, later, Cal. Without Samuel and Lee, East of Eden falls apart as a story. To prevent this, the movie fused Abra and Lee's characters into one hybrid character, but in doing so lost most of the philosophy of Lee and a good deal of Abra's character development as well.While the movie version of East of Eden has some strong points, it ultimately pales in comparison to the book. The movie tries to change too much and loses the intellectual and philosophical ideas that won the book its Nobel Prize. While I didn't expect the movie to show all parts of the book, I cannot support such a drastic rewrite of a classic novel. East of Eden was the single loosest movie adaptation of a book I've seen since The Lightning Thief, and I can't help but come away disappointed after watching this movie.",

What I find so interesting in the movie is the change of attitude of Cal's brother, Aron. In the beginning of the film (when Cal is not a threat), Aron accepts his brother; i.e., his statement, \"I love him.\" On the other hand when Cal moves toward acceptance and threatens the other brother's position--that's when Aron's hatred, resentment (and probably his real self) emerges.

Harris is clearly on the stage, Raymond Massey lacks any resonance, although Jo Van Fleet impresses with the only convincing performance.James Dean does leave his mark.

His mannered, stumbling style would be put to better use in his next two films, but here it's almost embarrassing. Davelos holds his own and maintains his dignity; few of the rest of the cast do.I did think the cinematography (Ted McCord) both interesting and beautiful.

It's more well known than East of Eden, but after watching both films, I can honestly say that Dean's performance in Eden is a more powerful performance. From the first moment Dean appears on screen, it's impossible to take your eyes off of him. Dean gives an amazing, layered performance as Cal Trask, a son looking for answers about the supposed death of his mother and longing for the approval of his father. In East of Eden, Dean is the original \"Emo\". He's brooding, angry, sad and haunting; sometimes all in the same scene. East of Eden is basically a tale of good versus evil. Cal being the evil and his brother Aron being the good. The parallels to the Bible's Caine and Abel are obviously apparent. Sibling rivalry in film is endlessly entertaining for me. Both of my parents have a sibling of the same sex. They often tell me (and my twin sister) about some of the struggles of growing up with a sibling of the same gender. East of Eden is also a beautifully shot film. There are a few scenes where the camera is tilted and off kilter. It helps to add a sense of discomfort and disorientation. My favorite scene is the one where Dean is on a swing and is having a conversation with his father. Dean only replies to his father while in the foreground. Also, the gentle swaying of the camera adds to the building tension. Probably my favorite shot from the film is where Cal has just left his brother with his mother, and stands out in the hallway. He casts a demented shadow on the floor that grows larger as he begins walking. Just good stuff. Without giving too much away, the most memorable scene is when Cal tries to give his father the money. The scene is so sad and chilling. Anybody who has ever been denied appreciation for an accomplishment from a parent, will probably be brought to tears. In the end, I think East of Eden has kind of gotten overshadowed by Rebel Without a Cause. Kind of like how Cal gets overshadowed by his brother. A pure must see classic indeed.",

I found the end result vaguely unsatisfactory. Mainly I think because as presented via the screenplay, I found the story somewhat thin. Many potentially interesting situations were hinted at and never followed through; Aaron's reluctance to support the jingoism of the USA's involvement in WW1 - why was this? Pacifism? Cowardice? The bravery of being a dissenting voice in a sea of hysteria? A parallel with the Biblical Abel's refusal to make animal sacrifices as Cain did? The Mexican girl with whom Cal appeared to have some sort of relationship was marginalised into almost total insignificance. The film also cried out for a more Mahleresque musical score from someone of the calibre of Alex North or Kenyon Hopkins to emphasise and intensify the strong emotions which from time to time had to surface. Technical credits were all first rate. Acting uniformly superb (it is worth noting that it was Julie Harris' name that was at the top of the credits), and yet it didn't give me goosebumps.

I worked for years in a night-club where they all came to see the show of drag-queens - a setting where some would not like to be recognized. Why did they come? Because we made sure they were not hassled nor recognized, unless they wanted to be. Screeches of recognition and cameras flashing - not for personal collections, as in the old days - but FOR SALE to make a buck have ruined the whole scene. Can you blame them they now appear with body-guards and are unfriendly toward the public ? That fabulous lady who is not bothered about how much her fans know about her, came with gangs of photos to pass-out - who could that be but Cher ? She announced in a very friendly way to the audience that she had come - in blue-jeans - to have a good time and didn't want to be bothered. How real is that ? As the MC of the club, I always could get the vibes from the celebs - some wanted to be a part of the show and made no bones about getting up on the stage for pictures. Some just wanted to be quiet and enjoy the whole scene - they were in a world-famous club.....that was then..........now is now, when everyone wants \"to touch\", \"Oh, God! it's James Dean!\", who loved the public and could be seen shooting-the-breeze with bikers on The Sunset Strip, or just about everywhere. He always had a smile for cameras, because he WAS narcissistic and realized he WAS that boy next door - only prettier - and fame came with availability. Brad Davis, Brad Pitt - before he began to hang with famous ladies - was the same way. One \"user\" wrote that Rock Hudson didn't like Dean because he stole every scene. How could he not? Hudson was just that \"leading-man\" type without much acting ability; we all know how he died. I saw him in a market a week before that tragic event - you would have never known whom he was. I respected his privacy - but, I DID ask the check-out clerk if she had recognized him: no. I didn't say any more.I re-read \"East of Eden last week, and realized Steinbeck's beautifully written novel had too many characters unnecessary for this story, and doubt if it would change my opinion of this priceless movie we are allowed to view for a few bucks. I watched it again tonight (10/5/06), and reveled in its glory. If Kazan had to keep the tension high on the set, to get the best performances from his stars, then that's the way Hollywood works. Raymond Massey could have been pained that he had been a star for so long, he was astounded that a young man with no roles under his belt could become a mega-star overnight. Isn't much difference in your work-place. His role was perfect - that's the way \"dads\" were in those days: the authority-figure. How unusual it was he was able to shower love on a son who was a weakling, in this film.Julie Harris got top-billing because she WAS top-billing at that time. Deny she deserved her Oscar and fame for her acting-skill and you aren't telling the truth. She was the element that allowed the other actors to perform - she showed them a mirror of themselves. Jo Van Fleet, no matter how her character had been chopped, was the epitome of a woman who had lost her beauty - \"her hands were like ivory\" - but had no remorse for how she made her money. No doubt, she knew whom Cal was the first time she saw him on the street. They loved one another, but were too strong to admit it. How anyone could miss Albrecht's Germanness and the animosity it inflamed is a mystery to me - how brave he was to stand-up for it, and how typical for Cal to fight-back for the under-dog. He knew the way to destroy his conceited brother was to \"I wanna show you something\".Burl Ives was heaven - the local sheriff who knew the whole scandal and was the controller to keep the antagonists apart. Who ever thought a guitar-strumming singer could play such a powerful role? Davalos was adequate, which should tell you why he didn't achieve much fame.If Steinbeck liked the movie more than his novel, that should tell you he saw the light - Paul Osborn culled a fabulous movie from his work, as great as it was. Those folk who insist that movies be a carbon-copy of a book don't know the workings of making films that will be seen, not shelved. Making movies is misery....how they get from the sets to the film to the theater is an all-time mystery, and not nice to watch......I would bet that even Shirley Temple kicked some chins.\"East of Eden\" a masterpiece on everyone's part? - indeed, a hundred times over. I feel honored to possess an ordinary VHS-copy; I've already seen it in widescreen. If you don't agree this film shows a clear picture of competition and misery within a family, then you've missed the experience, and are so fortunate. The end of this movie should clearly show you that life can be painful, but also can make us stronger if we lick it.\"Thank you\" to every person who played any part of brining this gem to the public. If it's not your cup of tea, that's your loss. It is timeless and will always shine for me.",

The early years when Adam Trask met and married Kathy/Kate add nothing to the story of Cal and Aron, in fact it takes away from it. Kazan got it right in this 1955 film by making the viewer discover Kate as Cal discovers her, following that mysterious woman down the road. We lose our innocence along with young Cal as he comes to the terrible realization that his mother is evil and his father is a liar. What I love about this film is that there are no melodramatic tearful embraces between mother and son. Instead Cal has to hold back his affections for his hardened mother and his cold father. When the dam finally breaks inside Cal and the emotion comes pouring out of him it is heartbreaking and difficult to watch. James Dean is magnificent in his performance as Cal. Julie Harris was wonderful as Abra, the girl who tries to love and understand him. Raymond Massey and Jo Van Fleet were perfectly cast as the parents. This was one of the rare occasions when the movie far surpasses the book it was based on. People should stop comparing the two and take Steinbeck's word for it.",

            "content": "The family saga is a literary genre which can be difficult to transfer to the cinema. It tends to work better on the small screen; \"The Forsyte Saga\" \"I, Claudius\" and \"Poldark\" are among the landmark series of British television history, but I cannot think of any feature films based upon their source novels. George Stevens's \"Giant\" has its admirers, but to me it stands as an object lesson in the perils of trying to adapt family sagas for the screen, especially if they involve characters who age several decades during the story. Try as I might, I could not accept the beautiful twenty-something Liz Taylor as a grey-haired grandmother or James Dean, that enduring symbol of youthful rebellion, as a middle-aged businessman.John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\" is also a family saga, covering the intertwined fortunes of the Trask and Hamilton families during the period between the Civil War and World War I. The makers of this film, however, decided (in my view wisely) to base it only on the final part of the novel. The story is set in 1917, in the California towns of Monterey and Salinas (Steinbeck's own home town). Adam Trask, a farmer, lives in the Salinas valley with his sons Cal and Aron, both young men in their late teens or early twenties. Adam's wife Kate left him shortly after their sons were born, but he has falsely told them that she is dead. The two boys are very different in character. Aron is, like his father, deeply religious with a strong sense of duty and morality, whereas Cal is wayward and rebellious. They dislike one another, and their mutual dislike is based not just upon differences in character but also upon Cal's resentment of Adam's quite open preference for Aron and upon the fact that both are in love with the same woman, Abra. Abra is officially Aron's fianc\u00e9e, but finds herself increasingly attracted to Cal.Cal may be wild, but he is not necessarily a bad person, and desperately wants to earn his father's love. He borrows money to speculate on the bean market, gambling that if America enters the First World War demand for beans, and therefore the price, will increase. He does so in order to make good the losses which Adam has recently incurred in an unwise business venture, but Adam, who opposes this sort of profiteering, angrily refuses to accept the profits which Cal makes from his scheme. Feeling rejected, Cal angrily reveals the truth which he has recently discovered about Kate, that she is still alive and is the madam of a brothel in Monterey. Neither Aron (who still believes his mother is dead) nor Adam (who believes his ex-wife is living somewhere in the East) is mentally equipped to deal with this revelation, which provokes the crisis of the film. Or, as Blake put it in \"Auguries of Innocence\", \"A truth that's told with bad intent Beats all the lies you can invent\".As the title suggests, the film, like the original novel, contains many allusions to the Genesis creation story. Adam's name is clearly significant, and Cal and Aron have the same initials as Cain and Abel. Cal's rejection by his father parallels the Biblical story in which Abel's sacrifice is accepted by God while Cain's is rejected.\"East of Eden\" was James Dean's first major screen role. Of the three films in which he played the lead, I have never been a great admirer of \"Giant\", whereas I would rate \"Rebel without a Cause\", another story of a rebellious youngster seeking his own identity, as one of the greatest films of the fifties. \"East of Eden\" is not quite in that class, but it is still far better than the overlong, sprawling \"Giant\". It was the only film to bring Dean a \"Best Actor\" nomination, and I would have said it was well deserved if I did not believe that his performance in \"Rebel...\" deserved one even more, and indeed deserved the Oscar itself. (The Academy went with Ernest Borgnine, star of that thoroughly overrated little movie \"Marty\"). At the time some criticised Dean for modelling himself too much on Marlon Brando, but to my mind there is a clear difference between Dean's performance here and Brando's more deliberate portrayal of a rebellious young man in \"The Wild One\" made two years earlier. (Dean's Brando complex was more obvious in \"Giant\").Dean combines well with Richard Davalos, an actor I had not come across before, as Aron. They bring out the differences between the brothers- Dean all passion and anger, Davalos more conciliatory- yet also manage to suggest the similarities between them, two buds from one stem. It helps that Davalos bore a certain physical resemblance to Dean. Of the other actors, the 30-year-old Julie Harris seems too old as the supposedly teenage Abra, but Raymond Massey is good as Adam. Like Cal he is not a bad man- indeed, he can be regarded as a virtuous one- but his stern, unbending virtue makes it difficult for him to show his wayward son any affection.The film may not be a saga, but Elia Kazan gives it the sort of sweep that would be appropriate to an epic. This is not my favourite Kazan film- that would be \"On the Waterfront\" from the previous year- but I would rate it a close second. It is a powerfully affecting family drama which ranks as one of the best films of 1955. One can only wonder why neither this film nor \"Rebel Without a Cause\" received a \"Best Picture\" nomination. 9/10.",

Cal is frustrated at every turn, from his reaction to the war, to how to get ahead in business and in life, to how to relate to estranged mother. The film is loosely based on the second half of the novel East of Eden by author John Steinbeck.The story is obviously a modern take on the Cain and Abel biblical account and I quite enjoyed it. I found the film interesting, well paced and very emotional towards the end. The direction was pretty good as well. I specially enjoyed the way Abra and Cal's relationship was developed and handled. As in most \"old\" films, some things are a bit hard to relate but the core themes are very much timeless.Raymond Massey and Julie Harris who played Abra and Adam Trask respectively, were both great but, the film belongs to James Dean. He was exceptional in the role of Cal and stole the show. He had a lot of charisma and good presence. It's worth noting that his role is very similar to the role he played in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" which leads me to think that he has an \"affinity\" with that kind of persona, the young angry outcast.Overall, it's a very nice watch with a stellar performance by the icon, James Dean.7.5/10",

I disliked how she would constantly flirt with Cal, when she was dating his very brother. I thought she was a dislike-able character, and I could not figure out in the movie why everybody loved her so much. I thought her acting seemed fake, with forced emotion, just my opinion.I loved the ending when Cal and his father have the big powerful moment of exchanging respect and love to one another. This scene showed very talented acting by the father. He had to appear as if just having a stroke, and he did so very well.

The camera gravitates toward her, and she owns her character, Abra. Harris' talent dwarfs Dean's. She emotes with her eyes whereas Dean must bang on all the pots and pans to express himself.As to other issues, the sound track annoys to no end (as does the one in \"On The Waterfront\"). Kazan lacked subtly in this regard, often allowing the volume and musical selection to overwhelm the scene.

Adam Trask (Raymond Massey) is bringing up two sons alone--Cal (James Dean) and Aaron (Richard Davalos). He tells them their mother (Jo Van Fleet) is dead but actually she left him and is now a madam in a neighboring town. Adam doesn't like Cal but loves Aaron and his girlfriend Abra (Julie Harris). Cal tries to get his father's love in any way he can but things escalate and get worse and end tragically.In some ways this is just great. Some of the direction by Elia Kazan is annoying (he continuously frames sequences at tilted angles which throws you out of the movie) but all in all it works. The acting is superb. Massey is good and Van Fleet is very good--she won a Best Supporting Actress award for this. She's good but not THAT good! Burl Ives is also excellent in a supporting role. However the three young leads carry this movie. Davalos is just great in his role--especially at the end when he meets mother. Harris (top billed) is just wonderful. She perfectly captures her characters innocence. Dean is just simply superb. When he's on screen you can't stop watching him. He captures his characters hatred and yearning to get his fathers love. The scene where he breaks down at his fathers party at the end is just heart-breaking. My problems with this is the story jumps around. At one point Cal seems to have a girlfriend--but we're never introduced to her or find out who she is. Also Cal seems to be punished at the end. For what? Trying to win the love of an uncaring father? For showing his brother the truth about their mother? I never bought the end for one second. That prevents me from giving this a 10--but it does deserve a 9. Worth seeing.",

As much as it pains me to say this, I have to concur.I hate to say it because I really like this movie, even with James Dean in it.  Maybe it helps in my case that I never identified with Dean as Cal Trask (who seemed much more level-headed in the book).  Dean's Cal was just too goofy, too histrionic, too hysterical and too silly.  Why Dean was considered a great actor has always kind of eluded me.  He always reminded me of those drama club kids in high school who seemed to consider themselves great actors (and were frequently told so by the school play directors who were happy just to have warm bodies to flesh out the cast), but were in fact strident, whining hams who belted out their lines and cranked every simulated emotion up to \"11\"\".  Yeah, to me that was always James Dean.  But I'm no expert, so I could well be missing something there.Anyway, I did like the movie.  It was beautifully shot, the scenery was fantastic, and I really liked Raymond Massey as Adam Trask.  This probably says more about me than I'd like to acknowledge, but it was Adam with whom I identified.I also had a bit of a crush on Julie Harris.

I believe EAST OF EDEN is a more interesting movie than YEAR ONE. The latter film treats the Cain and Abel story as slapstick comedy, with Cain (David Cross) bashing in the poor skull of Abel (Paul Rudd) over and over with a large rock each time his brother revives, all the while delivering a monologue to a pair of cavemen observers that he bears no ill will toward Abel, and couldn't possibly hurt him intentionally. Contrast this with EAST OF EDEN, where Caleb \"Cal\" Trask (James Dean) and brother Aron (Richard Davalos) are only STANDING IN for the Bible brothers metaphorically, through their first initials and their dad's name, Adam (Raymond Massey). The period sets seem much more realistic in EDEN than in YEAR ONE, and EDEN's acting is much better. Though there is a shower scene in EDEN featuring Cal's business partner, Will Hamilton (Albert Dekker), there are no barfing, farting, and peeing-in-your-own-face scenes, as is the case with YEAR ONE. It is truly unfortunate James Dean followed his metaphorical EDEN self into the land of Nod (death) shortly after EDEN's theatrical release.",

His inadequate acting also makes it difficult to sympathize with the character. Harris, Massey, and Fleet fare better. Kazan's direction is not only heavy handed but also rather bizarre.

            "content": "Although James Dean made only three films before his untimely death, you'll find a total of thirty acting credits on his bio page here on IMDb. Virtually all of them were television show guest spots of varying degree, mostly credited but with some going uncredited. Having seen a few of those shows, along with all three of Dean's theatrical films, I'm left to wonder if he would have eventually overcome the typecasting that went into virtually all of his roles. In the handful of TV portrayals I've seen, he often played an ex-con type of individual, and talk about typecasting, his character's name was 'Joey' in three of them! I guess I consider myself a James Dean fan to an extent, as his portrayals contain a resonance of sort for anyone attempting to find their way in the world amid a myriad of obstacles. Dean is considered one of the original adherents of method acting, and it's more than evident in \"East of Eden\", the story of a troubled young man who tries to win the love of his farther but is seemingly thwarted at every turn. Even when Cal Trask (Dean) recoups an amount of money that his father lost in a business venture, the old man (Raymond Massey) spurns the effort, believing it was ill gotten by taking advantage of a situation that others didn't have the resources to capitalize on as well.As compelling as the story is, there are a couple of things that work against the picture to bring it's credibility down a bit for me. For one thing, when Cal brought brother Aron (Richard Davalos) to Monterey to meet their mother Kate (Jo Van Fleet), it was hastily brought about to comply with Cal's promise that it wouldn't take long at all for Cal to reveal something important. Yet the opening screen narrative stated that Salinas and Monterrey are fifteen miles apart with the Santa Lucia mountains in between. Even that short of a journey would have taken considerable time in the early 1900's. That same circumstance on the flip side however, works strongly against the idea that Kate would have been anonymous to Adam Trask and his sons for a period of the twenty or so years that they grew up in Salinas. How would that have been possible, as there would have to have been acquaintances of both Adam and Kate who would have mentioned seeing them in passing, even if the couple had separated under stressful conditions. That idea bothered me throughout the story, as did the apparent ease that Cal was able to span the distance between Salinas and Monterrey so easily without any means of transportation. As far as Dean's acting goes, I do feel that he conveys all the anguish of a troubled youth in this picture and in \"Rebel Without a Cause\", but it seems that he carries that angst just a bit too far in some scenes; done today some might consider his style a bit over the top. Though this form of method acting was considered effective and novel coming from practitioners like Dean, Brando and Montgomery Clift in the Fifties, some of their pictures tend to get heavy handed with the audience, as the message in this film suggests. Even so, I find that one of my favorite pictures is Brando's \"On The Waterfront\", another picture helmed by director Elia Kazan who effectively paced Dean throughout this story.",

All these have been built well into the movie and Dean's character is the one that reflects the most. I would rate it higher than other Kazan's movies.

Basically, set in the time before and during the First World War, 1917, in the central California coastal towns of Monterey and Salinas, Cal Trask (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dean) is the son of modestly successful farmer Adam Trask (Raymond Massey); his father favours his brother Aron (Richard Davalos) more than him and he is bitter and moody because of this. Both Adam and Aron were made to believe that mother/wife Kate (Oscar winning, and BAFTA nominated Jo Van Fleet) had died, but in fact she is alive and well and running a successful brothel, only Cal visits her knowing this, and he also makes plans to earn back the money that his father lost in unsuccessful business ventures and gain his respect, his mother lends some money to help him do this. We also see Cal gaining the affections of Aron's girlfriend Abra (Julie Harris), he is reluctant for a while knowing that she is already seeing his brother, but he gives into his feelings and they share some close moments, and together they plan a surprise birthday party for his father where he will give him the money he has made. It is at the party though that Aron announces he and Abra are to be engaged, Adam is happy but she and Cal are uneasy, and the situation gets worse when Cal gives his father the money he has earned honestly, but he refuses to take it thinking it was earned in some wartime scheme, Cal sees this as another emotional rejection. In a moment of anger Cal goes against the wishes of his mother and takes his brother Aron to see that she is still living, and Adam demanding to know where Aron is gets told about her as well, in drunkenness Cal's brother enlists in the army, Sam the Sheriff (Burl Ives) tells Adam this and he rushes to stop the train, but he is too late. With the incredible strain Adam is paralysed and unable to communicate when he suffers a stroke, Abra is left in a room with him, and he begs her to show some true affection to Cal before it is too late, and Cal finally gets words of acceptance from his father, with the two lovers close by the bedside. Also starring Albert Dekker as Will Hamilton, Lois Smith as Anne, Harold Gordon as Gustav Albrecht, Timothy Carey as Joe, Mario Siletti as Piscora, Lonny Chapman as Roy and Nick Dennis as Rantani. Dean gives a good performance as the frustrated teenager who longs for his father's attention and a meaning in life, Van Fleet with her time on screen gives a deserved award winning performance as the secretive, protective and emotionally suffering mother, and the other supporting cast members do well also, the story I admit was a little short of plot and tiny parts difficult to grasp, but I did like the romantic element, and you can see why Dean has become an icon in the short film career he had, a watchable psychological drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. James Dean was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, he was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons.

Two of his best films...\"Splendor\" and this one...deal sensitively and passionately with this theme. In all three scenes of sexual frustration alternate with those of parental conflict to create a swirling merry go round (or, more appropriately in this case, a ferris wheel) of physical and emotional violence as Deany, Bud, Cal, and Abra, all try to navigate the tortuous paths that connect youth to adulthood with minimal stumbles, bruises and falls. This particular journey is made memorable through Paul Osborne's fine adaptation of Steinbeck's sprawling novel, wisely deciding to concentrate on the last third, the one most pertinent to the Cain/Abel theme, Ted Mc Cord's lovely cinematography that manages to convince the viewer that 1955 Mendocino is 1917 Monterey, a luminous performance from Julie Harris whose speech to the stroke ridden Mr. Trask on love and forgiveness has to be one of the poetic highlights of both her and Kazan's career, a powerful study in stubborn pride and self righteousness by Raymond Massey, a study in hate filled independence by Jo Van Fleet, and above all, Kazan's direction; perfectly paced and while perhaps a bit self consciously arty at times (I'm thinking of those slanted angles in the father/son scenes) never veers into the self indulgent or pretentious. For me it all comes together in the magnificent ferris wheel scene one of the great expressions of the tangled knot of physical/emotional love put on screen in the 50s,, an era noted for pushing that envelope. A well nigh perfect film then with one big ol caveat...the star. What can I say? You either love James Dean or you don't. And I don't. Where Van Fleet and Harris manage to transcend the Actors Studio Dean, with his mumbly, twitchy, methody style, makes me think of Lee Strasburg almost as much as he does Cal Trask. And you never want to be doing that, not even in a so so film, which this is not. Give it an A minus. PS...Burl Ives' folksy, strong sheriff is fun to watch but he's in the wrong movie (like he wandered in from \"In The Heat Of The Night\" or \"No Country For Old Men\").",

            "content": "The story is set in 1917, during World War I, in the central California coastal towns of Monterey and Salinas. Caleb (James Dean) and Aron (Richard Davalos) are the young adult sons of a modestly successful farmer and wartime draft board chairman named Adam Trask (Raymond Massey). Adam is a deeply religious man. Cal is moody and embittered by his belief that his father loves only Aron.This film is said to be \"loosely based\" on the novel of the same name, and that's a fair assessment. I'm not sure how else you can turn a 700-page book into a movie under two hours (even shorter if you remove the overture). In fact, the entire first few chapters of the book have disappeared, with the implications of intrafamily adultery.The best I can say for this film is that it showcases James Dean and gives a glimpse of his potential. He did die too young (though, of course, this only served to immortalize him). Julie Harris does alright in her girl next door role, and the casting of the prostitute mother seemed to be done alright -- though, again, her best scenes are in the chapters not filmed for this movie.Not as memorable as Kazan's \"On the Waterfront\", with the only really noticeable improvement is the vibrant technicolor. Though, to be honest, I think the black and white of \"Waterfront\" worked better than the saturation of color shown in \"Eden\"... so I cannot in good conscience rank this as on the same level.",

            "content": "East Of Eden (1955) :\nBrief Review -Not that Socially Relevant Elia Kazan i admire. East Of Eden is quite a forgettable Kazan Affair but a memorable one for James Dean. Elia Kazan's best movies includes socially staggering products like 'Boomrang' (1947), 'Gentleman's Agreement' (1946), 'Pinky' (1949), 'On The Waterfront' (1954) and 'A Face In The Crowd' (1957). I admire these 5 movies of Kazan more than 'A Streetcar Named Desire' (1951) which isn't much like my favorite. So i expected the same socially relevant film or at least something great in other subjects but 'East Of Eden' is pretty average considering his standard. This film is loosely based on the fourth and final part of the 1952 novel of the same name by John Steinbeck and may be that's why i looked incomplete to me. Two brothers in 1910s California struggle to maintain their strict, Bible-toting father's favor as an old secret about their long-absent mother comes to light. Well, i don't know how to describe the actual faults here especially when i had started watching it with high expectations because of Kazan's name. I wouldn't have minded much if the same film was made by some other ordinary director and then i might have skipped it too. Jokes apart but it makes some sense. The film doesn't really have any big conflict or should i say USP factor in the storyline. A strained and cold relationship between a father and his son isn't that big thing to make an entire film on it, right? Or maybe if it was, then at least try and cover it perfectly. There is so much hideous mess with the supporting characters. That mother's character, Cal's brother or the girl who falls in love with both the brothers. I didn't see a single concrete, sensibile and generous character here and therefore i couldn't connect to it. Overall, it's watchable only because of the performances. I was expecting a better show from Elia Kazan though.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",

            "content": "The story is about two brothers, one of whom is a favorite of a single father, and the other a problematic rebel without a cause (pun intended). Believing that their mother is dead, Aron grows up in the image of his pious and self-righteous father, while Cal is a typical rebellious teenager who tries to win his father's love and attention in all the wrong ways, sinking deeper into despair and anger.When Cal discovers that their mother is alive, who she is, what she is, and why she left the family, he sets off on the road to Hell that's paved with good intentions, which makes him even more estranged from the family and results in a tragic outcome. However, in a typically Hollywood manner, the end is disguised as a happy ending.\"East of Eden\" is a partial adaptation of the eponymous novel by John Steinbeck. Paul Osborn was nominated for an Oscar for this screenplay, but although the story is pretty well written, I wouldn't rate it that high.Cal was supposed to be played by Marlon Brando, who dropped out because he was too old for the role, so it went to seven years younger James Dean, who, ironically, doesn't look any younger, and I couldn't identify him with a teenager. In addition to this visual barrier, Dean's overacting was extremely irritating to me, and this film only confirmed the opinion, gained after \"Rebel Without a Cause\", that his and his film's reputation were caused more by his untimely death than by objective quality. From my perspective, comparing Dean to Brando is blasphemy.Raymond Massey and Richard Davalos, in the roles of father Adam and brother Aron, gave good performances, but they did not leave a special impression, mostly because they did not have much space to show what they got. Jo Van Fleet won an Oscar and her only nomination in a three-decade-long career for her debut role on the big screen, inspired by the biblical Eve. And there is Julie Harris, in the role of Abra, a girl next door, torn between the brother she was promised and the other she secretly loves. To me, Abra is the only likable character in the film who is easy to sympathize with.This cult Kazan's drama is considered a masterpiece and belongs to general culture, but apart from interesting biblical references and allusions in the construction of characters and their names, I have not been able to find anything worthy of attention here and experienced it as just another in a sea of melodramas of its time.6/10.",

            "content": "If you watch the 1981 miniseries first, you'll know why the 1955 film is \"loosely\" based off John Steinbeck's novel. Given the constraints of the Hays Code, it's no wonder certain elements of the story had to be cut out and saved for thirty years. In essence, this version focuses on the relationship between two young brothers and their disapproving father. James Dean, who had made a name for himself making television movies in the first half of the decade, made a splash in his first theatrical lead. He's the brooding, moody, emotional son with deep hurt feelings that his father, Raymond Massey, shows blatant favoritism to his brother, Richard Davalos. Time after time, Dean tries to earn his father's love, but it's a lost cause. Who can forget the heartbreaking scene when Massey rebuffs not only his son's hard-earned money but his physical embrace? You all know the famous story behind that scene, and if you want to see it recreated, check out James Franco in the fantastic TNT biopic James Dean.In each of his rebellious teen roles, you can easily see Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, or Paul Newman in his place, so it's no surprise that each of those three actors were considered for East of Eden. Dean eventually won out because he was the youngest, and his explosive emotional energy made its mark on the big screen. Nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars and awarded a posthumous Golden Globe, James Dean's performance will stand out in everyone's memory as one of the greatest that lost an Oscar. I've always regarded 1955 as the greatest tragedy in Oscar history. At least James Dean was in good company: he, Frank Sinatra, and James Cagney all lost to Ernest Borgnine.I know this movie is a classic, but it's not one that's fun to watch over and over again. It's a John Steinbeck story; it's enormously sad and depressing! I like listening to Leonard Rosenman's beautiful, tragic music better than actually sitting down and watching the movie.",

All combined it is a very unrealistic, inaccurate and fairly distorted version of the Steinbeck classic. The novel is full of landmark set pieces that landmark the plot, the movies has strangely ignored them and tries and fails to create it's own plot catalysts.The truth is, this film is a vehicle built for James Dean who plays Cal Trask - a teenager with profound angst - which co-incidentally fitted Dean's image at the time. The book on the other hand is a true masterpiece, telling the epic tale of Adam Trask (played by Daniel Massey)and how his fractured relationships destroyed him piece by piece.If the book is a Taj Mahal of literature, then the film is a garden shed of movies.Read the book if you want a thought provoking and truly rich experience.

Put it this way, I'd have sided with Ed Begley Sr. and Nick Nolte when the Academy was dishing out his lifetime achievement award not long before he died. I certainly wouldn't want to have counted him as a friend, that's for sure.However, I can't deny his directorial talent as evidenced by the several heavyweight but distinguished movies he made over that same period. This is obviously one of his most celebrated features, an adaptation of part of John Steinbeck's major tome famous as much as anything else for giving James Dean his first lead role in pictures. It has to be said that the young man grabbed his opportunity with both hands, delivering a memorable performance as Cal, the unloved son who grows up truculent and rebellious, but always craving the love of his pious father Adam, played by Raymond Massey, who instead pours his affection on his do-gooder younger son Aron, played by Richard Davalos. Poor Cal it seems can't do right for doing wrong especially in dad's eyes, but doesn't give up trying to appease his old man, no matter how much he's given the cold shoulder. As for love or companionship, while the local womenfolk follow him around for his good-looks and bad-boy persona, Cal is instead drawn to the thoughtful and serious girlfriend, the oddly-named Abra, (Julie Harris) of his brother, which you sense isn't going to end too well either.But anyway, Cal knows a secret. In the shadows and living in the next town as a prosperous and even respectable madame is his and Aron's mother Kate, Jo Van Fleet, erased from the family history by the god-fearing Adam but unsurprisingly known to Cal, who it's not hard to imagine dropping by her house of ill-repute in his formative years. When Cal tries one last time to get himself into daddy's good books by making good his pa's business losses due to a failed refrigeration idea by smartly anticipating a war-driven demand for beans, he sets himself up for his biggest fall, the ramifications of which will be significant for all the major players.The plot of course is heavy with Biblical allegory and its attendant themes of brotherly rivalry (especially for the same girl), competition for favoured-son status of a religious father and the sinner mother who is expelled from so-called paradise. Kazan stages the action with aplomb, well-conveying the atmosphere of little-town America during the First World War when the action is set, speaking of which there's an interesting sub-plot of xenophobia against a formerly well-respected citizen of German descent, a possible allusion to the recent reds-under-the-bed witch-hunt.Dean certainly puts his all into his part but because all he wants in life is one nod of parental approval, he nevertheless projects an air of vulnerability to stop his character coming across as obnoxious. Julie Harris may in real-life been much older than the young girl part she plays but she well conveys her conflicting loyalties between the dull, dutiful Aron and charismatic but edgy Cal. Best of the remaining supporting cast I felt were Burl Ives as the tolerant police chief and Oscar-winning Van Fleet as the sidelined mother.Serious and heavy-laden as it is, it's undeniably a strong story, capably told and played, with the added bonus of witnessing a genuine break-out performance by a sadly doomed young actor.",

I understand where the root of all \"bad boy\" images come from... or why Cain killed his brother.  They are the unwanted child, the untouched child, the shameful, disappointing trouble-maker.  The unconditional love at the end of the movie strongly reflect a Christian thematic too.  It sends a great message that lacks a lot in today's cinema. I felt Dean's performance was extraordinarily heart-felt, but it is limited to certain scenes.  As I watch James last performance, I realize he was just tapping into his ability as an actor.

The direction which was made by Elia Kazan, it was simple but he succeeded on creating a movie using the full potential of his main actors something that is very difficult. Lastly, I have to say that \"East of Eden\" is an interesting movie that presents and combines very well people relationships, religion and social differences, and that's why I recommend everyone to watch it.",

Is it respect for a director, superb editing and technical proficiency? Or, as sometimes happens, does the drumbeat of others' opinions disable personal points of view, and we we like a movie because we're told to like it?Is it because of all the above?Personally, I want to love or hate something because I feel independently capable of making up my own mind - intelligent and informed.I have gone through life loving John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\". I love it for a multitude of reasons. I love it first of all, because thepungency of his two most important novels (\"Eden\" & \"Grapes of Wrath\") turn me into jelly. \"East of Eden\" was the first book I ever read as an adult that was relevant to me, whose characters were like my own family: I was Aaron; an older brother of mine was Cal. Even though the sentiment/bias was toward Cal, it was Aaron that was morally pure. My brother, who was eventually diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and committed suicide at 26, was a brother out of hell. Cal's cruelty toward Aaron described my brother absolutely.I loved the story also because my mother died when I was six, and so to have a character who'd grown up believing that his mother was dead only to find her alive and well...for me, was a dream come true.To those who cast aspersions upon James Dean and do so not with malice but in an objective belief that he was professionally limited - more power to their sense of independence. I was 13 when I found a tattered and discarded movie magazine. Being a vociferous reader, I luxuriated in every paragraph of its content. The featured article was about young James Dean's death exactly one month earlier. I didn't know who he was. Yet I bled, emotionally, to read of a youth who'd died. My own eldest brother had died three years earlier at 19. I had a kindredship with death. Dean's own mother had died when he was nine. I developed such a strong sense of identity with young Dean that I read everything I could lay my hands on. A few months later, I went to see \"Giant\". James Dean was like an old friend, to me. The way he hung his head when he spoke, the crucified image he projected when he hooked his arms over his rifle in one scene, his need to be liked by Elizabeth Taylor, the flat planes of his Scandinavian face--all projected such sincerity that he was like a brother, a reflection of someone dear that I could idolize vicariously.James Dean was handsome, Aaron was almost angelic in presentation, Abra was sweet and intelligent - and Jo Van Fleet figuratively speaking became nitro glycerine on the screen. She was a procurer of human flesh and she was a heroine addict. She was amoral. She was no one's mother. Yet, for a few moments she portrayed a humanity toward Cal. But Cal was evil. The woman was nothing more to him than a tool to destroy his brother. My feeling was that he turned on her out of revenge for having discarded him 17 years earlier.Few need to be told that \"East of Eden\" is Greek tragedy in scope. That explains its potency. I reserve it as close to great literature as a writer can achieve.",

            "content": "Close to the brink of America's involvement in the II World War the Trask family living in a small community in Salinas Valley attempts to revolutionize transport of fresh food with the use of ice wagons. Deeply religious and well-meaning Adam Trask (Raymond Massey) brought up his two sons by himself, having told them that their mother died long ago. Aron (Richard Davalos) is the perfect child, helpful, considerate and much akin to his father. His opposite is Cal (James Dean), treated very much as an 'evil seed', a troublemaker and almost an outcast within this small family of three. Change enters into the life of the Trasks, when Cal unwittingly uncovers that his mother is in fact still alive and operates a bordello in the neighbouring town.Elia Kazan's \"East of Eden\", based on the brilliant novel by John Steinbeck, enters the XXI Century in a digitally improved version with vibrant colors and outstanding shots stemming from a weird phase in American film history. Nonetheless the ultimate pitfall stems from the impossibility to modernize the acting or storytelling enacting present in this revered oldie.One of only a handful of films featuring the legendary James Dean, \"East of Eden\" was bound to develop an undying fanbase, hellbent on admiring the picture despite the problematic ageing of the movie itself. Dean himself comes across as a tremendous actor, a true volcanoe of talent, screen presence and charm, but even more apparent is that his is an uncut rough diamond yet to be fully utilized in a masterpiece. Nonetheless the acting methods employed by Kazan now seem horribly out of touch, while Julie Harris (playing Aron's fianc\u00e9e) comes of wooden with a forcibly fake overacting. The contrast to the naturally rebellious Dean just enhances the weaknesses of the remaining cast.The backbone of the movie is a family friendly rewrite of Steinbeck's novel with such ridiculous underpinnings as the absurd attempt to avoid explicitly talking about bordellos, instead referring to them as 'those houses'. Albeit justifiable given the religious upbringing of the Trask family, it does dilute certain key oppositions presented in the novel. 50+ years on the lightly treading presentation reeks with taking the easy 'Hollywood' road, so despite strong symbolic undertones the movie does seem awash of real depth, instead just offering a light dramatic punch for easy viewing. Given the high tempo narrative to which the newer generations are being accustomed to \"East of Eden\" does seem to unnecessarily drag, especially in between scenes not featuring James Dean. Well placed on the shoulders of an excellent story and James Dean rough, but forceful performance, \"East of Eden\" does stand the test of time to a limited extent, now coming off overly melodramatic, self-consciously cautious and slightly heavyhanded with it treatment of the story's potential. Surprisingly in a movie focused on recovering the past the characters have none with little time really offered to discovering dark family secrets, instead tough subjects are glossed over with empty statements. That said the expectance to entail the multitude of threads in Steinbeck's novel may just have been beyond filming. Nonetheless \"East of Eden\" so diluted by the script seems overly hollow and fails to attack the real gist of the book.",

These themes were brought out wonderfully in this film with aspects like a skewed camera angle whenever Cal confronts his father, and elegant framing of subjects which incorporates emotion and deeper meaning into the shots. Dean's performance is also one of the highest merit, transforming Cal from a rebellious teen desperate for his fathers affection, into an emotionally satisfied and healed man. I found the role reversal between Cal and Aron very powerful, with Aron running away from the truth which he couldn't handle and Cal stepping up as the stronger son. The final scene is by far the most moving, featuring super effective editing and the greatest moment of the film, when Cal screams for the nurse to \"GET OUT!\"",

He even goes as far as to literally BUY his father's affection. While his emotions are boiling over, he falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. How will this inter-family drama shake out? One of Dean's 3-4 films, he does show an impressive range of emotion and acting depth. The film slowly paints the picture of the family dynamics and then saves the heavy moments toward the end. It was a fine film; an actor's film. There is also a connection to the Biblical Cain and Able. Just marching through Dean's all too short filmography.",

Also, on the DVD of the movie, as the \"exra feature\" they repeated endlessly a rock and roll song about the fellow James Dean, and it began \"He was so young and innocent.\" There is is again! As for innocent, we read at the time (and don't get mad at me, it's just a part of history) that the fellow had been called up for service in Korea and got out of it by claiming an exemption on account of being a homosexual (gay person was not a term in use then).

James Dean sends out a message to Hollywood in this breakthrough role as a confused, misunderstood young man.

One can actually see the heat rising from the street, and the cinematography makes one feel lost in the hot temperature. From that moment on, EAST OF EDEN, though only a portion of the book, stands as one of those rare films in which everything comes together with an emotional explosion that never lets up, building to a climax of greatness. James Dean gives one of the screen's finest performances, and his scenes with Raymond Massey detonate with the power of emotions unchecked and real. Julie Harris is equally remarkable, as is Richard Davalos as Dean's brother who helps to lead the story directly into a parallel with the Cain-Abel conflict. Jo Van Fleet deserves her Oscar and every other honor, and Lois Smith breaks your heart in her small role as a trapped young girl in VanFleet's 'house'.

It tells of the relationship between a father and his twin sons, inspired by the Biblical story of Cain and Abel.Caleb \"Cal\" Trask (James Dean) and Aron Trask (Richard Davalos) are the twin sons of Adam Trask (Raymond Massey). Other key figures are the twins' absent mother, Cathy Trask/Kate Ames (Jo Van Fleet), Sheriff Sam (Burl Ives), and Abra Bacon (Julie Harris), Aron's girlfriend.Cal and Aron are about 18 or so. Cal is impulsive but hard-working and considers himself bad because he can never win his father's praise. Aron is a good student and the apple of his father's eye. Adam is very conservative and religious, though he does serve on the local draft board. Adam tries a business venture that fails. Cal tries to earn money to replace what his father has lost, using money borrowed from the mother he only recently discovered. There is also a budding relationship between Cal and Abra that Aron senses and resents, leading to conflict between the twins. It ends with tragedy and efforts at redemption.This is a rather low-key script that may be best-known as James Dean's first major role. Some of the interactions seem forced and the characters somewhat stereotyped, but it's a classic storyline that is reasonably well done. For its era, it was a big production.

This is my first film I've seen with James Dean, and I think this was the first disappointment. I've always been confused about the significance of \"method acting\", because every time I see it, it's too obvious. I see exactly what they're doing, and it's really not convincing. It's more melodramatic and campy regardless, and it really showed with Dean in this picture. The over the top acting took me out of the picture, and I felt that I never really got back in. I felt like everyone was a stranger to me, and that we never got to know them.Also, the story had many points of interest, that went no where, or was wrapped up too quickly to be satisfying. For instance, I liked the dynamic of the beans market, and Cal trying to get this investment going, but, it sort of just... happened. Also there's a scene where the other brother is clearly against the war, and thinks it's immoral, but there's no real reason or explanation as to why. I guess it's just supposed to be accepted since he's a good kid? But then later he's upset, and decides to just join the military anyways, so he just gets upset, and is okay with killing now? This movie suffered from both sides of the story. I felt it was too short for the story that could have been better fleshed out, but too long for the one it told. It felt constantly dragged out, which could have been resolved with a longer runtime. Overall the story isn't as interesting as I'd hoped, and the acting from Dean was too obvious and campy.

The cinematic beauty of the NorCal coast and the historical recreation of the turn of the century are merely backdrops for a minimalized stark enaction of the story as Greek tragedy thus enabling the director to avoid the daunting task of suggesting any real depth in the characters' motivations beyond the Judaeo-Greecian archetype. In an overwrought 50s generational angsty kind of way it was enjoyable.What I can't understand is why the Asian-American film community never picketed the film for the complete omission of the Lee character, to me the most memorable part of the book. It was also a little difficult accepting the dumbed down characters in this new stylized format after being moved by their realistic interactions in the novel. I could not find myself liking any of the characters in this larger than life dramatic context, but then I can't picture myself knocking back a few ouzos with Oedipus at Colonos Bar and Grill. Overall, an interesting effort by a director I've always admired.",

            "content": "East of Eden (1955) is one of those films that are famous only for who is in it and who originally wrote it. If this wasn't one of the few roles James Dean had before his unfortunate death, I'm not sure I'd have watched it. Even if it's based on a Steinbeck book, I think I'd prefer The Grapes of Wrath (1940) or Of Mice and Men (1939) to this. Still, there is some artistic merit to this film, even if it didn't cover the entirety of the source material. It just goes to show how a movie can have staying power just from the people tied to it.Notably, I did enjoy pieces of the cinematography in East of Eden. In particular, when James Dean's character is on the porch swing, that scene was shot in such a way that I haven't seen done before or since. And while Dean's performance certainly starts whiny and annoying, it was enjoyable to see him pull out his acting chops by the end of the film, even if they weren't used for long. It's still not his best performance over his short career, but it's still worth mentioning nonetheless.As for the plot, nothing stands out to me other than its \"love triangle\" aspect. It was really the only interpersonal conflict present in the film, with the other critical elements merely being the characters' poor decisions-and the consequences of them. A lot of the plot seemed like drama for drama's sake, and I felt it didn't have anything substantial to say like some of Steinbeck's other works. Perhaps this was due to the book being cut down significantly to fit in the movie, but it just felt like half of the story wasn't even there.An OK film with one of the few James Dean performances in it, I give East of Eden 3.5 stars out of 5.",

Dean does monopolize the film and dominate every scene he's in, but not because of any overwhelming talent rather from a thrusting his character on the viewer from his overwrought performance. Jo Van Fleet is solid as Dean's estranged mother but her backstory is yet another of those unexplained stories - she's there in the area, so close by yet we're never really told how did she end up where she did? While interesting, the characters seem to be living in their own, independent worlds which can make the film lack cohesion.

Dean's physicality is unmatched and I think this is one of the most inspiring and inspired performances out there, everything about Cal, even though it's hidden under a shielded exterior, is known by the end of the movie. He is not one-note, not one character feels that way here, and the way the arc is presented feels natural. This is why I think movies like this, and in general, need slower scenes in order for the characters to become fully realized by the time the credits roll.

The movie did a wonderful job of keeping good and evil equal and opposite throughout the movie. Cal and Aron were the best examples of this. Early in the movie, Cal was portrayed as evil while Aron represented all that was good. Late in the movie, the role was switched as Aron became the bad child when he left his father, however Cal took on the role of good and was there for his father.A major gap in the movie was the absence of Lee, Adam's servant. Lee had gotten Adam over his depression, as well as always tried to convince Cal that there was good in everyone. Lee was seen as the median in the book between Adam and his son, Cal. The tension between the two was evident, but without Lee, the resolution of Cal to be with his father was much less significant.As previously stated, this entire novel was based around the idea of good opposing evil. The main point in the novel was that each person had the ability to make their own decisions and choose right from wrong. Lee was the first to reveal this idea to the Trask family. The fact that the most important philosophy in the novel was left out completely defeats the entire purpose for making a movie without it. This was the ultimate factor as to why this movie was a big disappointment and completely destroyed the novel's only purpose.Although this movie was relatively interesting, it turned away from the book too much to be enjoyable to anyone who has read the novel. Although you could follow the movie along pretty smoothly, without Lee and the main idea of Timshel, the movie lacked the clarity the book had and that was the ultimate downfall of the movie.",

            "review_title": "Points for acting, cinematography; screenplay, pacing, Kate all wrong",
            "content": "The film \"East of Eden\" is so far removed from the Steinbeck novel \"East of Eden\" that it is very difficult to compare the two pieces of work. I highly recommend reading the book before or after seeing the film (screenplay by Paul Osborn; directed by Elia Kazan).The story takes place in Salinas, California at the turn of the century. Small-town life is suffocating, austere, and imbued with moral uprightness; we soon find out that Caleb Trask (played by James Dean) has no time nor desire for the religious rantings of his father, Adam (Raymond Massey). Instead of being embraced by his father for the spirit and qualities that he has, he is rejected in favor of his decent, play-by-the-rules brother, Aron (Richard Davolos). In keeping with Old Testament scripture describing Cain and Abel, Steinbeck's character names are allegorical--\"Adam, Aron and Abra\" personify good, \"Caleb\" personifies (supposedly) bad, and \"Catherine Ames,\"(a.k.a. \"Kate), I believe, is a personification of evil masquerading as good. However, in reality, these qualities are not as crystal-clear as their namesakes would believe them to be, and those who lay claim to them may be the ones most in need of self-reflection and understanding of mankind. I found it unusual that the film would begin with Caleb Trask's search and discovery of his mother, which happens much later in Steinbeck's novel and is part of the climax of the story. The film actually ignores the rich history of Adam Trask--his making of his fortune; the tragedy that befalls him when he befriends and marries Catherine; and his despondency and inability to raise two boys after she shoots him and abandons the family. It skips over the history of Catherine, a deceptive murderer (she sets fire to her parent's house, after locking them in, as well as poisoning the owner of a property she wants), a kept woman, and prostitute, all manipulation and greed, a woman with no redeeming qualities but cloaked in outward beauty and fashion.Because of this decision by the screenwriter and Kazan, the pacing of the film ends up dragging somewhat. We are not given the opportunity to discover what makes all of the characters tick. It focuses more on the \"love triangle\" between Abra, virginal, alive, and sexually repressed; Aron, perfect and pure; and Caleb, undefined, drifting, and sexually-charged. The character of \"Sam the Sheriff\" (Burl Ives) is left to fill in the blanks, as well as Kate (Jo Van Fleet). However, Kate turns out to be more redeeming and less perverse and cold than Steinbeck ever made her out to be in his writing. In the film she welcomes Cal's visit with her on the road, compliments him and acts in a way (almost loving) that a mother would normally be towards her son. Perhaps the film would never had made it past the censors if it had actually presented her as Steinbeck initially described her.Notable performances: Although this writer feels that Jo Van Fleet should have played the character of Kate much colder, particularly noted is when Kate believes Caleb has come to visit for social reasons, is visibly happy by his visit, then becomes crestfallen , and finally becomes hardened again, all in one scene (after he blurts out \"I need $5000.\") Van Fleet won the Oscar for best supporting actress. Julie Harris: Remarkable performance as the representation of unconditional love: virginal, sexual, intuitive Abra. She is stunning in Kazan's gorgeous scene in the farm field with Cal, surrounded by daisies and flirting with Cal without restraint. James Dean: Plays the honest, drifting, wise-beyond-his-years Caleb, effortlessly morphs from angry teen to introspective adult during the film.Burl Ives: Sam the Sheriff; Ives presents the character with much more \"knowledge of good and evil\" that is frankly disturbing. Raymond Massey: Excellent. So naive about his son's talents; his \"vacant\" left eye and stare was so typical of what a stroke victim would look like (was this a special effect?)Directing/Cinematography: Superb use of wide angle, tilted camera (representing the \"twisted\" view of Adam and his insistence on disciplining his \"evil\" son) and use of \"fog\" lens as Kate is walking (similar to Hitchcock's foreboding shots) and as Cal is traveling between Salinas and Monterrey. The beautiful color of Cinemascope is reason enough to view the film.",

They brought in a few events and characters from the book to help flesh out the relationships, but for the most part it resembled the book in so few ways I wish they just made the movie and called it something else. The reason that I did give it a 7 was because of James Dean. What an engaging performance. There are so few films of his and this is the only one of his I have seen and I have to say that I am extremely impressed. Just based on this one movie I have never seen anyone else attempt to act like this except maybe Brando in On the Waterfront. I have scene hints of it in Joseph Gordon Levitt in Brick, but there are very few instances where an actor just throws himself into the role with such physicality. The rest of the cast did not blow me away, but Julie Harris was pretty engaging. I respect Kazan for not attempting to put too much of the book in the movie and he actually did a pretty good job of only putting what was needed. The main problem is that this is one of my favorite books and I know all of the characters so well. Dean's Cal was the only character that lived up to expectations and he completely blew me away. I know this type of acting is dead, but I do enjoying seeing it done well. Not a great movie, but I enjoyed it. I think I was engaged with the movie so much because I was interested in seeing how Kazan (and the screenwriter) would approach the material and specific scenes. One thing I do want to mention that I liked was the scene when Cal tells Aaron about their mother. It is wonderfully directed scene and is actually a very long shot with some intense acting from everyone. It was well lit and the camera moved perfectly. The framing of the shot where all you can is Aaron's back and hear Cal talking was really nice I loved how the scene was executed overall.",

They live with their father Adam (Raymond Massey) and seem to be constantly vying for his attention--and unfortunately, Aron seems to get most of it, despite Cal's attempts. When Cal finds his mother, that the brothers were led to believe was dead, and learns the truth about her, he begins to understand better why this might be. The sibling rivalry and parental relationships go back and forth for quite some time until it all reaches an unfortunate end.This is a pretty good old movie. However, it is an old movie, which means that by today's standards it's kind of silly. The score is pretentious and often cheesy, as is some of the direction, which puts a bit of a damper on the film, but it's made up for. There are many, many good scenes and even some humor. And, of course, there's James Dean.I believe that James Dean was an excellent actor, and he was great in EAST OF EDEN, but maybe less so than usual. I consider this to be the weaker of his films. His performance seems to be a little bit forced at times. However, he still manages to come through strong as the tough, anti-social, but inwardly sweet Cal, and is funny as well as heart-wrenching. Seeing him try again and again for his father's attention but coming up short every time, and all of it destroying him, was enough to make me want to cry. He was excellent.The rest of the cast is good, namely Julie Harris as Aron's girlfriend Abra, Richard Davalos as Aron, and Raymond Massey as their father Adam. There are a couple of minor parts that were played terribly, however--namely Timothy Carey as Joe. However, they were played in the fashion that was popular at the time, so that can be forgiven as well.I know that this movie was based on John Steinbeck's novel, but you can't expect it to be just like the book. Those who degrade this film simply based on that should acknowledge the movie for what it is, not what it's based on or could be. The only other flaw I can really point out is the ending, which I found to be a bit corny. However, EAST OF EDEN is a good old movie, with solid performances and great story-telling, though it's not James Dean's best and it's not quite the classic it's regarded as. 7.5/10.",

I don't mink such liberties in old westerns, but not in a criss cross among the major characters. No, I have not read the book. I plan on it very soon. Yes, Dean could light a character on fire, a fire breathing dragon built of his own experiences, but it takes more than that. OK, OK, I will try again o watch he whole thing. Giant was very good. And Dean was very good in Giant. I have been watching many 1950s black & whites, Gods Little Acre, Experiment In Terror, All Fall Down, and other film noir. Reading the excellent autobiography of Faye Dunaway who writes well about the profession of learning to be an actor, bringing a character to life, creating a good movie, developing character and interplay. Brando in The Wild Buch was more coherent, although more brutish. Streetcar Named Desire was a classic, On the Waterfront too. For what it is worth, I also could not watch Pulp Fiction. Reservoir Dogs was good entertainment, but too bloody. Deliverance was better in many many respects.",

Despite the critiques toward the movie about the book, I do believe the director worked well with the masterpiece of a book he was given to write a movie about.

Aside from the moving performances the film is also beautiful to watch for the gorgeous scenery of Northern California.One other thing, a couple of reviewers criticized the choice of Julie Harris as the love interest of the two brothers, deeming her not pretty enough. I could not disagree more. I personally loved her and thought she was gorgeous. I've read she was good friends with Dean in real life which certainly translates well to the screen as they share some beautiful moments together in the film. The one complaint I would make is the bizarre camera movements in certain parts of the film, as I found them so exaggerated they actually took me out of the scene and made me conscience that i was just watching a movie, something which is at odds with the riveting performances which really pull you in.",

For most of the film he is struggling with finding out the truth of his mother's identity and searching for affection from his fatherand the audience is taken along on this ride with him. One of the most heart wrenching scenes is when Dean is speaking with his father, played by raymond Massey and Massey rejects him, at that moment Dean just throws himself into his father's arms and weeps. I was just as surprised as Dean's father in the film, in fact the look on his face really made the scene. Other than the acting the large sweeping shots of the farmland and the coast line during the film truly take your breath away. Those shots really show the viewer the scope of the land. The music in the film was also entertaining it seemed to fit the moods of every character, whether they were happy or upset, there always seemed to be some sort of musical precursor to a breakdown or a fight.

They really don't give to much information a way at a time, they sort of drop little pieces on you then it all comes together perfectly I really enjoyed that aspect. The strong acting from Dean really made his character so mysterious and captivating. Cals brother plays the perfect good guy almost the complete opposite then Cal which they make very obvious when they always show Cal messing with people, perfect example was when they were at the parade. The movie also has you question your own values do you think it was right Cal ended up winning over his father and Aron is pretty much just forgot about? Did Cal do the right thing by bringing his brother to see there mother? Being very close to the end of the Hayes code this movie came very close to crossing the line its pretty obvious there mom is running some type of illegal house most likely involving prostitutes yet they never come out and say it. The whole part who Cal stole Arons girl and how his mom left there family at the time would be very unheard of and consider socially wrong. This movie also bring ups question tons about war is it right, should you profit off it, who should get drafted... The cinematography was excellent, the effect when Cal was on swing talking to his dad and the camera looked like it was on some sort of swing as well very unique never had seen it before and really enjoyed it.

The movie leaves out the first three parts of the novel (though this is forgivable, given the pacing issues that could arise in movie form), leaves out the character Lee, who introduces the concept of \"timshel\", and, as a result, ultimately ignores the moral message of the novel. The idea of \"timshel\", which is Hebrew for \"thou mayest\", is used by John Steinbeck to assert his message of free will as opposed to predestination; because the movie abandons this concept, all that is left is a story about the love triangle happening between Cal, Aron, and Abra. To one who hasn't read the novel, this plot line may be sufficient, but to one who has, the focus on this love triangle (which did not even occur in the novel; Abra and Cal did not show romantic interest in each other until after Aron had left to go to war) may bring disappointment.However, the portrayals of the characters that were not cut out were mostly accurate to the novel (Jo Van Fleet's performance as Kate was probably the closest to the original character), and the acting was not particularly bad, though there were scenes, such as the fight between Cal and Aron, where the acting was bad to the point of making the serious scene hilarious.I might recommend this if you're looking for a bad or cheesy movie to make fun of with your friends (the Cal and Aron fight is particularly amusing for this purpose).

If so, please refer to Gilda Radner.East of Eden is an allegory for the story of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck used the names Aron and Caleb. In the novel, the main character is Caleb, and he's ALL about earning his father's love, which the father lavishes on Aron.Side Story: the father has a Chinese servant, and they have a mutual respect and a relationship far beyond what you'd expect for a servant and his employer. There's a lot about Bible scholarship, and the meaning of the word Hebrew word 'timshel', if I remember the word correctly. I do remember that it means \"thou mayest\" in the story, at least. It was translated in the Bible as \"thou shalt\" - as in the 10 commandments.So, I took that as God being an opportunity, that one can choose to act ethically and so come into the presence of God. NOT, \"act by my rules or be forever damned.\" And, I think I remember that correctly as the intent of that part of the book. My, wouldn't *that* translation have changed history! It's been almost exactly 40 years since I read that book, and I still remember it as quite some story. I literally can't remember other books I read last year.About Eli Kazaan:I saw an indisputable fact given on the X-Files that opened my eyes; in the space of something like 30 years - 1917 to 1947, communism \"took over\" a very significant portion of the land mass of the Earth. The Russian Revolution, the Russian occupation of Eastern Europe, and Mao prevailing in China, later spread to North Korea, Tibet, Viet Nam, Laos, Cambodia. AND, they had the bomb. Do you think, maybe, that people back then had more reason to fear communism than we can now understand? We really are, most of us, SO quick to condemn what we make very little effort to understand.

            "content": "I watched this movie because, as a native of Marion, Indiana, (the birthplace of James Dean) I felt it my duty to see one of his movies. I picked \"East of Eden\" solely because I had watched it quite some time ago... during school, I think.The movie was pretty much as I remembered it, a wonderful story about two brothers (twins), one of which struggles to be equal to the other in his father's eyes. Cal, the shiftier of the two is struggling with his own morality. Aron is naturally loved by everyone, including his father. The dilemma is a modern re-telling of the Cain and Abel story. The movie lets us know pretty early that Cal is searching for his mother who, as we later find out, left their father shortly after the twins were born. The father is basically unloving (especially towards Cal, though his relationship with both of his children is basically cold) and therefore unlovable. The movie portrays Kate, the runaway mother, as a much more likable character. While I try my best to stay off the James Dean Bandwagon on the basis that most everyone else from Indiana loves him... I liked him a lot as Cal. The only real problem I had with the movie was the romance between Aron and Abra. They seemed to be pretending to be in love, and it was almost as if they were TOO smitten with each other. Ditto for Aron's feelings of Cal. At one point he pronounces: \"I love him\" to Abra... as though he really, really loves him. I don't know much about cinema, but in real life, no one ever really, really loves their brother. He threatens to be too likable. Still... I found the parts of Abra, Cal, Kate, and Adam to work nicely. (Aron's role gets better once he becomes bitter somewhere towards the end.) The movie ends with Cal and his father inevitably finding each other's love. I find the movie works very well if it is not compared to something else. Unfortunately...I read the book shortly after watching \"Eden\" the second time. Within a week, I found that several MAJOR characters (not to mention a whole family, lots of minor details, and a couple of plot developments) were left out of the film version. Basically, the movie neglects the first 300+ pages of the book. Fortunately, the relationship between Abra and Aron is explained better, thus making the movie a bit more believable. Due to the loss of the aforementioned characters, certain lines had to be transcribed over to other people in the movie. Still, despite my preference for the book, the only unforgivable act in the translation from page to screen, in my mind, is in its handling of Kate. The movie leaves some shadow of a doubt about her character, which I don't see in the book. From WATCHING \"Eden\", one might suspect that she could have decent motives. In reality, she is nothing but bad, bad, bad! Also, the movie is very nice, whereas the book can be extremely disturbing at times. Particularly the parts where you find out just how bad Kate is.To sum up... I like the movie a lot. Reading the book has been somewhat of an eye opener, but instead of condemning the movie, I think I will just pretend that I know something that the movie didn't feel like revealing. I feel as though the actors did the same thing, because their roles fit the book better than the film they are performing in. So, watch the movie first, otherwise your love for the book will probably overshadow it's power. Afterward, take some time to read the book and watch the movie again... Use your imagination, and it's all there.I would also like to mention that I read a couple of the other reviews on this site. Two of them in particular commented on the fact that the movie was well scripted from the book. Which makes me wonder if they picked up a novelation of the film version of East of Eden, and not the original book itself.",

The whole thing played out like a very long soap opera where you can pick out which actor is the newbie who has yet to learn how to give a performance. The most exciting part was at Dad's birthday party \" what gift would Aaron give to one-up Cal? Would Dad appreciate Cal's gift and what would his reaction be? Will Abra share her true feelings? When will they cut the cake?!If you want to see a really good version, view the 1981 mini-series' \"East of Eden\". I think watching the mini-series caused me to dislike the movie version. All these years later, the 1981 version is still impactful. I can still remember Jane Seymour's performance.",

            "content": "This is the story of a father, Adam Trask and his two sons, Cal and Aron. Adam is a rancher in Salinas California where he lives with his sons who are almost done with school. He is a well bread religious man, who bases his choices, emotions and the very methods he used to raise his sons, on that which is written in the bible. Aron is just like his father. Good with his studies, has a girl he wants to marry, believes in everything his father does and is just as religious. Cal on the other end, is a rebellious kid who, however alone and confused, is able to see beyond the layer of rules in the bible who give his father a sense of comfort and stability, really understanding what the world is like and what it takes to live in it. In his first role, James dean proves himself right off the bat as a great actor, bringing to life the legend that later in Rebel without a Cause made him the idiom of the american rebellious generation. Not to mention the fantastic directing brought out by Elia Kazan, who truly captured the confusion and discomfort of the characters with a clever use of diagonal shots. East of Eden is truly remarkable in how it showed various characters and situations, especially considering the time in which it was made, where such characters still weren't that open of a discussion. That being said, the movie doesn't hit the mark completely in the last act, for it set itself up with a very drastic and pungent endig which would have made the previous acts even more compelling, but instead it turns towards a more hopeful endig, which isn't a flaw by any chance, but lessens the impact of the previous acts.",

The film in its entirety felt much like a roller coaster, having many interesting/exciting parts but lacking any real direction or focus. In relation to the novel, the film barely managed to show a connection, which was only achieved by loosely portraying major events and the characters themselves. The cast themselves, despite their valiant effort, either underacted or overacted, taking whatever moral or lesson the story might have possibly been connected to, and beating it even more, until it was barely recognizably, if existent at all. Throughout the film, the number of loose ends and spontaneous changes of depth in meaning was overwhelming, to the point of sight nausea. Significant scenes holding any philosophical value were also few and far between. To be fair, the film, when observed independent of its literary counterpart (if that relationship can even be established!) did maintain some level of intrigue, managing to keep me fairly interested and somewhat entertained. The actors also managed to retain some portion of the intensity and urgency ever so abundant in the novel, as well as maintain the personality of their personae.To conclude, the film missed the standard set by the novel so intricately written by Stienbeck. The bulk of my disappointment, which was immense to say the least, was the utter failure of the film to accurately portray the novel it was named after. Though decent as a film itself, it is sure to disappoint those who have rad the novel and enjoyed it in its entirety.",

I felt that Elia left out many important scenes, characters, and plots that would have tied the movie closer to the book. Two reasons for this low rating is the shift in the story, and the poor portrayal of the characters by their respective actors.Although Elia does get the point of the story across in an efficient way, he doesn't connect it as Steinbeck did. Steinbeck included many bits and pieces of background information way before the main story commences in Elia's depiction, and allowed for a foundation to understand where everything is derived from. The omission of those events could cause a viewer who hasn't read the novel to be confused at times and curious as to what was going on.Also, the actors in the movie did not show who the characters were in an efficient way. One example being Aron's coldness to Cal near the beginning of the movie, whereas in the novel, Aron really never turned on Cal until the night of the party. Another example could be how Abel fell in love with Cal before Aron left to the military, creating an added conflict between the brothers that did not occur in the novel, and thus separating further from the novel.Overall, I think the movie could have related more to the movie, giving a more stick-to-the-plan feel for the readers, and leaving the viewers who did not read the novel with a clear understanding of Steinbeck's point.-T",

Lee.  Timschel.  No one who's read the book will ever agree that the story can exist without these three things and still soar the way it does.",

The cast in East of Eden is first class. The actors take the script (as poor as it was) and brought it to life. Scenes of emotion were quite well conveyed, actors wailing and celebrating as the script required of them. For the most part the characters are portrayed authentically and true to the book. The Actors themselves did everything that was humanly possible to make this film a success. However, while the actors were striving to create something watchable It would seem the director was not. While it did seem that he went to the book for the movies overall design, he did not to the book for details. He left out some of the most important characters and themes. He completely omitted the entirety of the message of the book, Timshel the thought that man has a choice, in favor of something along the lines of a basic allusion to Cain and Abel. The movie did not feature Lee, who in my opinion was one of the best and most telling characters in the book. Also not featured among those portrayed was Samuel Hamilton, a key player in Steinbeck's original message. Aside from lacking characters the movie was completely void of the primary message Steinbeck relayed to his audience, Timshel. Lastly, the movie was crippled by an absolutely terrible script. The dialogue was consistently strange if not totally incoherent, not to mention one instance where the character seemed to spout pure and unfettered gibberish. Not word was uttered about Timshel or even the conflict of good and evil. The script for this movie was cluttered with irrelevant statements that left the audience either laughing or wondering why it was included in the first place. All in all the movie East Of Eden was crippled by its lack of correlation to the book and its poorly written script, despite having an outstanding cast.",

The first major flaw with the movie is the starting point, which takes place more than halfway through the book. This leaves audience members who have yet to read the book clueless to the Trask family history. Also, there is no mention of Lee in the movie. This serves to take away from the novel, since Lee was the first character to bring about the main theme of Timshell surrounding the novel. Without Lee, there is no Timshell, and without TImshell, there is no East of Eden. There are other flaws in the movie, such as the scene where Cal asks Kate for the loan, or when they only harassed the German man instead of burning down his shop. These and several other minor flaws, along with the major flaws previously mentioned, serve only to take away from the author's intended purpose of the novel.

Dean is generally solid in the lead role, but sometimes plays out his anguish a little too enthusiastically \u2013 ditto for the rest of the cast.  Another issue of the era, not unique to just this film, is the swelling music score, overpowering to the point of distraction.

OK, the story wouldn't end the way it did but we know that in the real world a draft board member whose two sons are still civilians would be either an object of derision or strung up from the nearest lamppost.

In this film they're competing for their father's affections during the height of World War 1, and the scales are very much tipped in one direction. The film might have its pacing issues, but it's the raw emotionality of the performances that make it such compelling viewing. Dean went full method in the very short amount of time he had in his movie career, and here it manifests itself in a person with such limited control over his feelings and impulses that he literally contorts with anguish. The style was frequently frowned upon back in the 50s for being too close to what Brando was doing, but you can see Dean giving it everything he has, and his behaviour brings out the best in the supporting cast. It has a few interesting subplots, such as the rise in anti-German sentiment and Cal's quest to find out about his past, but the story about father and son is where the film is mostly focused.

I don't know if the book ends the same as the film. Scenarios with the mother and brother, I feel, did not come to a satisfying conclusion. Jo Van Fleet was good though I would not call it an Oscar-winning performance. James Dean was very good throughout the movie and well-deserving of an Oscar nomination.

Elia Kazan's altered, stripped-down take on John Steinbeck's classic tome discards several crucial characters, corrupts a few more, pointlessly changes themes and completely misses the point of its source material.\n\nLee and Samuel, the novel's two most enduring, intriguing moral anchors, are completely excluded from the cinematic take, and in their absence the remaining cast seems to move without a firm direction, lashing out and contradicting themselves. It's shocking, how few genuinely likable characters remain in the finished film. Cal, deeply conflicted but relatable in the novel, is repurposed into a brooding, reckless, self-pitying brat in a barely-contained turn by James Dean. Aron, his naive, virtuous twin brother, becomes a sanctimonious, temperamental jerk whose sudden collapse musters little sympathy. Their father, who always meant well, despite his struggles with a bitter past, is now a two-dimensional hypocrite without depth. It's not the first time I've seen a movie divert so wildly from its roots, but it's a particularly bad example of doing so without just cause.\n\nThe production does deserve credit for experimentation, although even those fruits are a mixed bag. Stutters and stumbles are left in the dialog, which lends an unusual sense of spontaneity and honesty, but also accentuates Dean as a very awkward, rough-edged actor, not quite ready for the spotlight that's been shone upon him. Frequently ambitious camera angles scratch a creative itch, but distract from the important plot developments proceeding within. The entire film is like this, brimming like a potful of ideas, half-cooked and then served as a chewy, unrewarding finished product.\n\nIn essence, it's a bit of a phantom, bearing the ghost of a great premise but lacking in substance and heart. Threads are weakly pursued and then abandoned. Resolutions, if and when we get them, pack very little emotional punch. I expected much more. What an underachievement.",

You are immediately drawn in by Dean's magnetism. His awe inspiring good looks matched with his longing gazes create this mysterious loner persona. He is always being told he is a bad guy, but you get to watch Dean's character demonstrate his decency. It's a highly complex role that Dean nails with a nuance and sincerity most grown actors could not have pulled off.\n\nDirector Elia Kazan continues to reinvent the wheel with innovative direction and creative cinematography. You will see faces framed in the smallest viewpoints with constantly new perspectives to challenge your own notions of what these characters are thinking. For example, there is a beautiful shot with James Dean walking out from under a tree that moves into his silhouette that only a master director like Kazan could have managed.\n\nFurthermore, Kazan even swings the camera while James Dean goes back and forth on a swing, then switches the angle of the camera to display the power balance shifting. East of Eden is filled with these symbolic moments depicted by visual metaphor. Kazan is at his best here. East of Eden is as good as A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata!, or On the Waterfront. Kazan was clearly a genius director.\n\nJohn Steinbeck's writing is as beautiful and earnest as any classic drama script. Paul Osborn adapts the screenplay with a relatable quality through Dean's performance and character. East of Eden is as much a testimonial of the 1910's as it is a family drama or a forbidden romance story. This is top tier writing at its most refined.\n\nCheck out East of Eden for an American classic in drama, romance, and acting.

Plus there\u2019s something going on in the first few scenes where they recorded a lot of dialogue after the fact and inserted it later, which made the conversations seem clunky and awkward. But the movie took a turn and became something I never expected. As Cal starts to do things to try and earn his father\u2019s respect and love, I was on board with the story. James Dean plays the emotional swings of the story so well, because you want Cal to be a tough and strong character at first, but then show a lot of heart when things finally come to a head. I totally sympathized with him in this performance, and now I see why he is so revered despite the short career. It helps that I watched this film at just the right time for each big moment to hit me hard in the gut. I cried multiple times in the last act of East of Eden and that always makes me care about a story more, because I know it was meaningful and effective. There were still problems with the production, because I noticed the bad ADR in a few other scenes. Also I couldn\u2019t track the motivations of Abra, particularly when she first makes the turn and starts being nice to Cal. Yet I don\u2019t think those flaws are the things that will stick with me. Instead I will never forget the birthday party scene or the final scene and how they tore me up emotionally. This is a movie I will gladly recommend to others, and it makes me want to read the book as well.",

            "content": "Watch James Dean in any one of his three films and you'll observe that he always seems to be a young man in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Not in the sense that his characters are unyieldingly conflict-ridden - though they are - but in the sense that Dean himself seems to exist on a different planet than the greater sum of his peers.  He seems too contemporary, too ageless, as if it were destined from the start that he'd never live long enough to be personified as anything else besides a symbol of teenage rebellion.  Looking at a colored photograph of the actor at his prime and an outsider might not realize that in front of them is a star of sixty years ago, not a suave, cool fixture of the modern age.\n\tIt's astonishing how unscathed Dean's legend has remained sixty-one years after his 1955 death.  One comprises their filmography of only a trio of movies and they become largely forgotten, a cultishly fondled over sign of the times.  But Dean's then (and still) excitingly fresh personal appeal, endorsed by films and performances that harnessed his capabilities miraculously well, allows for his persona to go far beyond what the big screen usually allows.  Like Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, or even John Wayne, he seems to be additionally playing James Dean, not just a character sketched out by a persnickety screenwriter.\n \t1955's \"East of Eden,\" his feature debut and the only movie released during his lifetime, contains his best and most pensive performance.  He's so much an \"other\" (when comparing his acting style to his studio system controlled peer group) that a bizarre charge overcomes us when watching him; we cling onto every move he makes, as if trying to avoid losing grasp of the fleeting longevity of his stardom.  It's a characterization not made impressive out of stagey, fiery monologues, per usual in the melodrama preferring Hollywood of the time, but out of idiosyncratic zeal.  Heavy on improvisation and dependent on contortionistic body movement as an emotional release, Dean's performance was unprecedented in 1955 and remains to be extraordinary.\n\t\"East of Eden\" itself is a loose adaptation of the second half of John Steinbeck's novel, which unapologetically modernized the biblical story of Cain and Abel.  The film, set in coastal California in the late 1910s, follows the lives of Cal and Aron Trask (Dean and Richard Davalos), the sons of a humble vegetable farmer (Raymond Massey).  Aron is a charming extrovert, dating the susceptible Abra (Julie Harris) and uninhibitedly preferred by his old man.  He's ripe for a sensible future, which marks for great contrast from his brother.\n\tCal, by comparison, is a gawky introvert whose self-confidence has been maimed by his father's unhidden disfavor of him.  He acts erratically and isn't able to socialize with normality - he's never known what it's like to be loved.  His mother's death, said to have occurred just a few years after his birth, hasn't helped his unstable identity, either.  Cal longs to be like his father, who is a smart businessman, and he perhaps wishes to be more like Aron, who is self-possessed and better able to express himself.\n\tBut the film finds him at a major turning point in his life.  Nearing adulthood, Cal is starting to move past contently living in the shadows; he craves something more.  Much of his newfound desire to break out of his shell has to do with his discovering that his mother (Jo Van Fleet) isn't dead - she's actually the owner of the town brothel - and that love really can exist; he finds it with Abra, who's beginning to doubt her long-standing relationship with Aron.  But patriarchal approval is the one thing that stands in the way of Cal's potential, and success will elude him until he receives it.\n\tWhereas \"Rebel Without a Cause\" has dated since its initial release, now playing as a rather safe (but still compelling) coming-of-age shocker, \"East of Eden\" prevails as a meditative family drama, visually inventive and naturalistically acted.  It captures what made Dean so special beautifully, allowing for his own ticks and sensitivities to break through the celluloid, and it surrounds him with an ensemble just as distinctively disparate.  Harris, though ten years too old for the part, brings accessible girl-next-door allure to the part, so convincingly at a psychological tug-of-war that our empathy swallows us.  Van Fleet is incendiary as Cal and Aron's wicked mother, and Burr is superbly condescending as a father unable to realize the damage his emotional put-downs are having on his youngest.\n\tBut \"East of Eden\" is Dean's movie, and never does he let us forget it.  His character's acute delicacy makes him all the more of a gripping protagonist - we're desperate to get inside his head, akin to the way Harris's Abra attempts to free him from his self-hate - and the emotional bruises that come along with his imbalances hurt us just as much as they hurt him.  \n\tWe can only ponder what would have become of Dean's career had he been able to be more than a three hit wonder.  Would he have continued redefining himself, like Newman, or would he have become a victim of his own insecurities, like Brando? Ambiguity reigns, and the viewing of \"East of Eden\" is partially so thrilling because we consume so much of him.  We have so little.  But the film is also a magnificent drama, in spite of Dean's being in it.  Sure is fortunate to have him, though - couldn't imagine anyone else in his shoes, just like I can't picture a different icon of 1950s teenage disaffection besides him.",

Kazan's adaptation is smaller in scope, and this is out of necessity, but what is left is so devoid of context that the characters' motivations are trivialized and they come off as hysterical. Morally, we're brought back to the simplicity of the biblical allegory, the very simplicity that Steinbeck was questioning on the most fundamental level. \n\nThe film is trite and melodramatic, a complete step backward from the novel.

Secondly, the laughter continues with the ferris wheel scene. Abra tells Cal that she is in love with Aron and that her and Aron are going to get married, but 30 seconds later she kisses Cal. This part demonstrates the unpredictability in the comedy of the film. Lastly, in the ensuing argument that follows the ferris wheel scene, ends with one of the greatest use of english. The words spoken by Cal can only be translated by a fictional character known as the Tasmanian Devil. This phrase is the part of the movie that turns it into a comedy because it turns a dead serious scene into the funniest part of the movie.\n    Overall, I highly recommend this movie to all who are looking for a good laugh.",

Some of the crucial scenes from the book were incorporated such as when Cal tries to make his father proud by giving him 5000 dollars. Also, when it came to Cathy, well she was just as psychotic and deceitful as John Steinbeck wanted her to be.\n     Regardless, the acting in the movie was very poor.

While Dean plays a convincing Cal, the rest of his co-stars lack aptitude.

The tale goes at a relatively fast pace, making it hard for the viewer to make essential connections within the narrative.

In terms of entertainment it was decent, but if you were looking for a perfect transition from novel to movie you'd have to look elsewhere. For starters, the acting in this film was sub-par and for the entire movie there was a disconnection between actor and audience in the sense that it was difficult to understand what the actors wanted you to feel. The tone wasn't conveyed properly and therefore comprehension of the story was minimal. To go along with below average portrayal of the characters, the storyline missed important details of the novel that were needed for some of the major themes and ideas. Granted the book has too much to put into one movie, they still should've included more about Timshel, a key theme throughout the book.The only thing that made the movie watchable was the fight scene, but this is only because of how  immature the acting seemed with their unrecognizable muffled shouts.\n    Although East of Eden is a classic in its own right it is a movie that falsely portrays  ideas given in the novel and has a moderate entertainment level due to the lack of execution on the actors behalf.",

The movie did a wonderful job of keeping good and evil equal and opposite throughout the movie. Cal and Aron were the best examples of this. Early in the movie, Cal was portrayed as evil while Aron represented all that was good. Late in the movie, the role was switched as Aron became the bad child when he left his father, however Cal took on the role of good and was there for his father.\n\tA major gap in the movie was the absence of Lee, Adam?s servant. Lee had gotten Adam over his depression, as well as always tried to convince Cal that there was good in everyone. Lee was seen as the median in the book between Adam and his son, Cal. The tension between the two was evident, but without Lee, the resolution of Cal to be with his father was much less significant.\n\tAs previously stated, this entire novel was based around the idea of good opposing evil. The main point in the novel was that each person had the ability to make their own decisions and choose right from wrong. Lee was the first to reveal this idea to the Trask family. The fact that the most important philosophy in the novel was left out completely defeats the entire purpose for making a movie without it. This was the ultimate factor as to why this movie was a big disappointment and completely destroyed the novel?s only purpose.\n\tAlthough this movie was relatively interesting, it turned away from the book too much to be enjoyable to anyone who has read the novel. Although you could follow the movie along pretty smoothly, without Lee and the main idea of Timshel, the movie lacked the clarity the book had and that was the ultimate downfall of the movie.",

            "content": "Elia Kazan's adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel was generally pretty well written in regards to the original text. However, the movie failed to capture the intense struggles of free will and good and evil that were omnipresent throughout Steinbeck's novel. Kazan's choice of starting the movie two-thirds of the way into the story completely cuts out important background information on Adam and Cathy. Kazan also cuts out the Samuel Hamilton and Lee, two major characters who provided great significance to the overall plot of the novel. One of the most critical points in the novel is when Adam, Lee, and Samuel discuss the story of Cain and Abel and their realization of man's ability to choose. The result of its exclusion from the movie leaves the audience with a broken perspective about the true motive of the novel and its overall themes.\n\n    James Dean's performance of Cal similarly had its ups and downs. Where Cal in the book struggled between good and evil, James Dean represented wonderfully. However, Dean portrayed Cal as extremely depressed and mopey all the time, which overall limited his character and his ability to connect with the audience. Cal's relationship with Aron was not as strained as it was made in the movie, and the viewers couldn't have possibly been able to understand the true friendship that had existed between the brothers. \n    Overall, Kazan failed to truly captivate the audience with the same effect and strength as Steinbeck had done in his novel, even though Kazan made very obvious attempts to remain with the storyline. Through all these errors, the movie failed in living up to the standards set by Steinbeck's great work and his philosophies.",

This movie is yet another example of the horrifying loss of intelligence between what's on paper and what shows up on the big screen. Less than half of Steinbeck's original story has survived the brutal chopping block called Hollywood. It is a true tragedy that a story once filled with noble themes such as Good versus Evil and a person's free will to choose between them has be reduced to a story of two brothers fighting over the love of their father and a girl. The beautiful parallels that Steinbeck wrote between Cyrus and Adam's fatherhood, Charles and Cal's roles as unloved, and the contrast between the Hamilton and the Trask families are gone.  In fact many of these characters never came to life at all. Samuel Hamilton and Lee, the two main fatherly figures of the story, were completely written out, despite the major emphasis on fatherly love portrayed in the movie. Even the characters that are included in the movie are lacking, especially Kate, who's true evil nature is never explained. The only redeeming point in this entire movie that I can see is Abra, the girl in love. Her switch between loving Aron to loving Cal is much more seamless in the movie than in the book. However, the way the boys interact with each other over her is poorly acted out, especially the fight scene. Over this entire movie didn't reach my expectations at all. I expected a retelling of the story of Cain and Abel with a twist. I did not expect a story of love conquers all. Save that for the fairytales.",

I couldn't get the full experiance in the film as i did in the book, but I will say that the acting for Abra was my favorite. The opening seemed too adrupt for there to be any detail, and i felt lost throughout the movie even having known the previous plot. Leaving out such a crucial character like Lee seemed like a major setback as well, and removed \"Timshel\" from ever happening at the ending, which was a major factor into the ending of the novel. The brief and few apperances of Cathy was dissapointing as well, but her actor did well in making up for such a short screen time. Also, the cinimatography was quite stunning, but I'm not too big of a fan on the \"burn't cheese pizza\" lettering they used for opening and closing credits. I'm sure Kazan tried his best to create a realistic interpretation of the book, and i know that you shouldn't ever compare a book to a movie adaptation.

Here however, (impressively given that it was his film debut!) he shows there was more to him than being able to play the good looking outsider who's 'complicated'. His performance utterly shows us the man had real acting chops, beyond looking young and old at the same time. To be such a master of your craft so young is truly impressive. Everyone else is very good as well, and the story and direction work well but really this is Dean's film. He just runs away with it and leaves everyone else in the dust.",

The bar scene where you see the two brothers positioned one behind the other after the mob fight was especially great.  There was a comic book/cartoonish quality to that scene that I thought was really interesting.  The last scene was touching.  Beyond this, the movie was a really poor representation of the book. Abra's character was especially completely miscast.  While she is supposed to have a 'mature' personality, her maturity is not as one dimensional as it was represented. Her demeanour in the film was so over the top earnest and wholesome that I found her to be an incredibly irritating character that lacked depth.  She is a much more complex character in the book and this did not show through in the movie at all.  Cathy Ames (the mother) should have been much more devilish in character.  She never justifies why she is the way she is so blatantly in the book as she does in the film.  Cathy is a far more interesting character than simply a cut throat business woman as she is portrayed in the film.  Cal and Aaron's relationship was treated very superficially.  Their connection is characterized by both love and hate, yet the movie did not do a fair job of depicting this ambivalence. In contrast to the movie, the theme of jealousy in the book is a lot more subtle and underlying yet just as destructive.  The movie was unable to capture the seething quality of the emotion.  Cal never blatantly says he is jealous, he just is and its something he torturously struggles with.  Also, Cal and Abra never get together romantically until after Aaron goes to war.  The only borderline non-platonic encounter that he and Abra have prior to this time, is when Cal whispers something dirty in her ear when they are children.  One of the biggest problems with the movie is that they left out one of the central characters --Lee-- the Chinese care taker and friend of the family.  Lee is such a pivotal character in the book that I was shocked that he was included in the film.  Overall, I could not get myself to like the movie too much.  Perhaps my opinion of the film would have been different had I not read the book.",

Okay, I can think of some people who would say that we can just forget about that and just leave with our fond memories of Elia Kazan, of which, there are plenty, if you can remember them in the first place. A good bit of Kazan's work hasn't really stuck in everyone's memory banks all that deeply, yet the people who do remember his work can tell you that this film was certainly something to behold, being a classic masterpiece. To those people, I say shut up you annoying nostalgiacs, because while this film is good, it's not that good, being an Eden held back by a few corrupting snakes.\r\n\r\nThe film hits its slower spots, though rarely, if ever to a terribly dull degree, and what slow spots the film does hit are few and far between. However, were slowness more prevalent, it would most likely still be among the least of this film's worries, because the biggest blow to this film is that it is structurally all over the place. Now, the story isn't a total mess, with most everything scattered everwhere in the most unkept and uneven of fashions, yet the film is still quite uncomfortable in a lot of key places in its progression. Certain turns in storyline or focus are jarring and sudden, lacking enough time for you to fully lock into the situation, thus leaving the film a tad disengaging here and there, while other certain sudden shifts - particularly when it comes to characters - render the film a tad hard to follow. Still, it all comes down to long lines of non-oomph, with the film not really falling all that limp, though not really taking off that far when it does finally pick up. For all extents and purposes, this should be just another average film that rests among the workmanlike pile of films that have earned notoriety, mainly because of the stars who head. However, this film is better than that, perhaps falling a bit too limp at points, though not to where it completely falls out of being genuinely good, being made so by quite a few aspects that are mostly subtle, yet make quite a difference.\r\n\r\nOkay, now, maybe Ted D. McCord's cinematography doesn't necessarily make quite a difference, as it is only occasionally outstanding, yet when it does stand out, it's pretty impressive. Early on in the film, a scene in which James Dean's Cal Trask character is made to read excerpt from the Bible is riddled with very cleverly staged and lit camera shots that really capture the hint of bleakness in the air that reflects our characters and really sets up the themes of the film, in which you can find quite a few other fancy and effective shots of this nature. Still, again, these fine shots are too sporadic to stick a landing as a key strength to telling this story, so in order for this film to really be good, it's just got to be a good story. Well, sure enough, while the story structure is very messy, the overall product presented is generally compelling, with intriguing themes and concepts that help keep it afloat, yet not without the help of some upstanding performances. Sure, Julie Harris is pretty bad, when not simply mediocre, yet most everyone else is engagingly charismatic, though there are some standouts, such as Jo Van Fleet, whose surprisingly fairly subtle and thoughtful portrayal of an untrusting and very business-oriented woman facing the risk of changing tremendously when considerably grand events and discoveries begin to fall into her life makes her among your more compelling aspects to the film. As for James Dean, with all of my joking around about how he's become such a big icon, even with his paper-slim filmography, he got those Oscar nominations and all of this notoriety for a reason, as he was the original great actor to lose young, something made clear very early on in the film as he very charismatically, yet ever so believably manages to nail the ticks and eccentricities of such a disturbed and clearly unhealthy person like the Cal Trask character in a fashion that definately leaves you aware that our lead is not all there, yet still has enough competence in him to hold layers. Well, sure enough, while the writing leaves those layers to jar in on occasion, Dean never lets up on making the complexities within his character very organic, presenting a person who is well-intentioned and reasonably competent, even with his problems, looking for self-value and respect as a good man, thus making for a very restrained, yet very engrossing lead performance that stands as further testament to just what we miss about the late, great Mr. Dean.\r\n\r\nOverall, outside of a few slow spots, the real blow to the film is its structural messiness, from jarring story shifts to sudden character changes, that leave the film a bit hard to follow and often rather disengaging, while long periods of limited oomph leave the film to run the risk of descending to simply average, yet it manages to its own, secured by occasions of clever cinematography and consistency in story compellingness, really brought to life by generally strong performances, the strongest of which being delivered by the late, great James Dean, whose layered, subtle and enthralling lead performance helps in ultimately making \"East of Eden\" a mostly intriguing study on morality and value.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

As in the bible story, most of Adam's love is reserved for Cal's brother Aron, while Cal, desperate for his fathers attention and approval, somehow only seems to be able to curry his disappointment. \nLeonardo DiCaprio has said that before filming a movie, he watches (or used to anyway) East of Eden again and again, studying Dean's performance. I personally feel this is the lesser of Dean's three starring roles, which isn't to say it's a bad one. Dean is an incredibly naturalistic actor, known for his improvisational style and realistic delivering of dialogue. He reminds me very much of young Marlon Brando. It's perhaps no big surprise that Brando's game changing performance in 1954's On the Waterfront seems to inform the performances that Dean gave a year later. \nThe movie itself is well told and actually quite a bit darker than you would think for 1955. It's full of the kind of teen angst and anti-authoritarian overtones that would fill Dean's next, most iconic film, Rebel Without A Cause.",

To achieve some possible affection by his father, Cal decides to borrow money from his recently discovered mother in order to grow beans to offset losses from a failed business venture that his father had through a refrigeration failure of vegetables on a train. If there are parts of the novel left out, the remainder used for the movie is compelling enough to get through.

It's basically a Cain and Abel type of story, and agriculture plays an important role even. It's not a strict adaptation of that story, but it is the best reference point to use to describe things.\n\nThings are rather dramatic, though they dip into melodrama at times.
