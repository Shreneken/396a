            "content": "While films like Parmanu, Padmavati, Padman, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety , 102 Not Out, Hichki or even Blackmail were treat to eyes in the first half of 2018 giving hope that Bollywood movies have matured but then there comes a crap like Race 3 that will spoil your mood and you will wonder that if the makers are taking the audience for granted. Race 3 tells the story of a dispute between a family when Shamsher Singh (Anil Kapoor) decides to give half of his wealth to the adopted son, Sikander Singh (Salman Khan) and the rest of it between his own kids, Suraj (Saqeeb Saleem) and Sanjana (Daisy Shah). Directed by Remo D'Souza, who has made a decent film ABCD and pathetic ones like A Flying Jatt and ABCD 2, Race 3 is one hell of a journey which you wish to forget once you leave the theater. Right from the opening scene of the film to the climax, forget about logic, even the story is full of potholes. There is some breath of air when Anil Kapoor tells about his plan but again the film goes back to the loop hole and sadly does not recover. The first film Race (2008) was brilliant with solid twist and turns followed by an average Race 2 (2016). Race 3 is a nightmare which you should get over immediately with as it will haunt you, the more you think about it. None of songs are good (surprisingly music is composed by brilliant duo Salim - Sulaiman). Action scenes , though few scenes were fine, but again gone overboard. Race 3 is high on production values and less on content. Dialogues are horrible and funny especially - Our business is our business , none of your business. Even the Bhojpuri language used in between the scenes is irritating. Coming to the performances, none of the actors have done justice to their role. I do not understand why Salman Khan is repeating himself, even though he is in Bollywood industry for more than 25 years. The actor, who was superb in films like Dabanng and Sultan, should start experimenting with roles. Anil Kapoor is fine but could have been better. Bobby Deol makes a decent comeback but sadly not enough to leave any impact. Lesser spoken about Saqeeb Salim, Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez, the better. Overall, Race 3 is an insult to Bollywood. Avoid it any cost.",

And now, when 10s decade is At it's last phase, I feel, Salman Decided to work in a movie which would be an action family movie, so THE LENGENDARY Race 3. Movie takes the elements of both Races (1 & 2) and HSSH and shows it in the most pathetic and cringeworthy possible.Elements:Race: Step-siblings, faking death etcRace 2: Heist, shades of antagonistHSSH: Joint family, problems between the siblingsYou can say while carving the movie Race, the remaining wastage which was assembled together to make race 2 and the wastage of race 2 was assembled and wastage of HSSH was added to make race 3.PATHETIC, BORING, MINDLESS, PREDICTABLE AND CRINGWORTHY. These are just few words to honour the movie. Movie had some very pathetic performances, pathetic dialogues, pathetic songs with pathetic lyrics (Heeriye is a good number though) & pathetic storyline. The movie was too slow to be called entertaining, I didn't understand half of the story, no not because it had a very complex and out of the world story, just like that of Nolan's movies, but because I had a good sleep during the movie. Plus songs were so frequent and long that you can't help but sleep, so if you have trouble in sleeping or are insomniac. Please go for Race 3. It was an all and all Salman Khan movie, so I don't need to say how mindless it would be (But movies like tere naam, Saajan and Bajrangi Bhaijaan were way awesome). Twists were too damn predictable, Race series is known for amazing thrills and out of the world twists, but this one had none, yeah the last twist was good, but not amazing as that was also kind of predictable. The dialogues, the songs, the lyrics, the acting, the action scenes... everything about this movie was criminally cringeworthy. The best thing about the movie was Bobby Deol and Anil Kapoor. Saif Ali Khan is missed badly and so is Abbas-Mastan. I request Ramesh Taurani, that if he is in a mood to make Race 4, please continue the Race 2 story and bring back Saif. Let Bobby be there, we have no problem.I've only one suggestion for you guys. There is a plethora of good movies, Avengers Infinity wars is still running in the theatres. Jurassic World is running. And if nothing, than please save your cash for Sanju, rather than watching this masterpiece of mud. In my honest opinion, movies like Ek tha tiger, PRDP, Khiladi 786 and even loha and Gunda are like citizen Kane, Titanic, Godfather and the Shawshank redemption in front of this movieCompletely avoidable",

Salman Khan is known for his stardom, fanbase, court cases except acting. Even his flops Jai Ho and Tubelight have crossed 1.1 billion mark at the box office. Race 3 is a movie which has been trolled the most than any other film of Salman or any other actor. Remo D'Souza was a very bad choice for big budget, multi starrer, action franchise. He is better off with dance related movies, A Flying Jatt was perfect lesson for him. Salman's involvement in Race Franchise, Questionable. Without giving any spoilers, and keeping the fact in mind that Race 3 is big budget movie sold to Distributors at very high price is really half baked, slow, illogical, bumpy and jerky roller coaster ride with hight production values. Good Cinematography, but Ayananka Bose had done better work before. Poor VFX, Prime Focus is good VFX company (see Bang Bang). Budget provided for VFX seems marginal. Performance are average. Music is letdown. Dialogues are wasted. Runtime is 159min too long. Too many songs. Even Abbas Mustan couldn't have pulled off this task (read weak script). They should have kept Saif Ali Khan (loyal to Race Franchise).",

            "content": "Race 3, an in-name-only third installment of a wildly successful franchise, has me thinking: Who let the filmmakers attach the name to this steaming pile of crap? It's not quite sure what it wants to be. Like a cross between a heavy-handed soap opera, a heist movie, an over-the-top musical extravaganza and a mindless Michael Bay blockbuster, complete with illogical explosions. By the end of the first extended action sequence, I wanted to tap out but I knew I wasn't getting a refund due to the use of MoviePass so I was in it for the long haul.Clocking in at 160 minutes (standard for an Indian film), we are treated to about a minute of thanks credits before being quickly thrown into the squabbles of this wealthy dysfunctional family, the Singhs. The film gives us a narrative, describing each living member of the family with great detail, as if these characters already existed. It's like watching someone narrate Dallas.Since almost everyone in the film has more negative qualities than positive, this makes it hard to find someone to relate to. There is one who stands out, Sikander (Salman Khan, who also produces), as a sort of black sheep. Decent performances are given but they're all hindered by the writing, which adds something new on so often one can lose track. I see it as a bizarre parallel to my own work.I don't have much experience in Indian cinema. Only a few have crossed my path (Dr. Cabbie, Padmaavat and Aiyaary) but this one makes me question the future of my seeking out more. I know there are way better ones out there, and I'll find those.Visually, the film has a rather blatant abuse of slow motion effects. Even to the smallest of details. This may be due to my lack of viewing but there was a lot of jumping between Hindi and English, and subtitles for both sides. As well as a number of inconsistencies in the translation (some words come out spelled differently, words being capitalized strangely).Don't get me wrong. I love musicals (I saw The Greatest Showman five times and I embrace all kinds of different selections) but here, the over-the-top flashy theatrical musical numbers felt so out of place and very overlong.I'll have to seek out some Indian films with repute, and perhaps not go gung ho next time. If there is a Race 4 after this (rumor has it, there will be), I'm afraid I may have to steer clear. 0.5/5.",

His first action and Super hero flick **A Flying Jatt** was flop at box-office. This time he got golden opportunity as he has to direct one well established franchise and there is Super Star **Salman Khan** in lead role.\n**Performance:**\nThis action thriller belong to Salman Only. Other actor has done just justice with their role. Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez have done brilliant action sequence than dialogue delivery. **Bobby Deol** has good supporting role. Anil Kapoor was less utilized. Saqib's role was not written well. Freddy has small role like Cameo.\n**Script:**\nThere was no script at all, only action sequence without any logic and plot. Sometime Action thriller turn into family drama like Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. So many flaws in the story telling.\n**Action:**\nAction Sequences and Chase sequences were really breath taking. Fight between Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez was good one.\n**Cinematography:**\nThis one is another good thing about Race 3 apart from Action sequences. **Ayananka Bose** has done a terrific camera work.\n**Music:**\nRace 3 has worst music of last 10 years of Salman Khan. There are lots of experiment done on music as there are many singers and lyricist for each song. Even Salman Khan has written 2 songs where Lulia has sing those songs as well. \n**Box-office:**\nIt is expected to earn 30-35 crores on opening day. As word of mouth is negative so it will take 3-4 days to complete 100 crores Box-office collection. It will be really tough to cross 200 crores mark in Indian Box office.\n**Last Words:**\nPrevention is better than cure.",

But, better.CONS:\nStory - When you have 14-16 different plot mutually-exclusive plot points, some of which never meet out till the end, you are left guessing, why on Earth were these introduced in the first place.\nAction Sequences - Way too many. In fact, around 90% of them were not required.\nMusic - Barring the Allah Duhai track, the music in this movie is a huge letdown.\nActing - The versatile Anil Kapoor stands out. Rest of the acting by the starcast is rather forgettable.\nEditing - Okay, but some jumps were there at certain junctures, where one scene abruptly ended, and the next started.\nCostumes - Although it looks good for a Fashion show, when you view the entire star cast together, it looks rather boring. Frankly, who wears a sweater and an overcoat at the same time, in a desert???\nStunts & 3D - Again, too many stunts, cars blowing around, and on 3D you would see all the broken car parts, and 100% of the dust will only come on your face. And don't forget the bare chests of Salman Khan and Bobby Deol. Please! I'm straight! Why would I want those oiled chests to merge with my face on 3D!\nLocations - Absolutely unnecessary location jumps. There's no correlation with the locations especially for Cambodia.\nDance and Choreography - A Remo D'Souza movie with such quality of dance numbers? That's awful. Barring the pole dance by Jacqueline, I couldn't find any correlationof Remo's work.\nI would probably give a 1 star to the 2D version, and minus 3 stars for the 3D.

In fact, why Bobby Deol accepted this role has exactly the same reason as to why Amitabh enacted Gabbar as Babban in RGV ki Aag. Soldier made Bobby, and Sholay made Amitabh a brand. They both couldn't let go of this golden opportunity to play the villains in their respective remakes. Blinded by emotions, they didn't see that this animal is not Soldier or Sholay, but some other rabid animal.2. It's not only Bobby Deol who was bad- It's Salman too, whose writing is bad. Remember Veer? He wrote it, and here he's the lyricist.3. Saif, having the royal upbringing behaves in a cheap way. In contrast, Salman, who comes from the family of bards, bar dancers, and poets, tries to behave royally.

I say honestly that I was enjoying last fight scene of Salman Khan with not feeling any tension like a child playing a game. Anil kapoor looking very tired and no spark of acting. Who makes such bloody directors ? What is use of acting institutions in India ? To making such foolish movies ? One and another. When those directors will learn from Hollywood ? In such story they would make a interesting movie. The bad side of this that people also making hit such hopeless movie.",

All the other characters are one note except Anil Kapoor who seems to enjoy killing people on screen and having a gala time. As it turns out the most meme worthy moment of the film is not Daisy Shah going \" Our business is our business none of your business\" it's actually Saqib Saleem adding 'bro' at the end of every sentence. Being one of the young adults out there let me say it for the record that WE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

Sure, there have been a few stinkers here and there but nothing like \"Race 3\" because this film has the distinction of being the only Indian film now on the infamous Bottom 100 list on IMDB. With a pathetically low score of only 2.1, it really is a film that few people have loved! Will I be yet another person who thinks this is an absolutely terrible film??\nYes. I thought the film was terrible as well and for two big reasons. First, the entire story is about a family of monsters. Don't get the wrong idea, they aren't literally monsters but rich folks who are arms merchants who will sell to ANYONE and who are all lethal killing machines. The father built up the company and apparently trained his twin son and daughter to be self-absorbed murder machines as well as his adopted son. During the course of the movie, they murder dozens and dozens--with an ease that would scare away the Terminator and they look as if they just walked off the cover of 'Vogue\" or \"GQ\"!! They are simply evil scum...and the movie seems to romanticize them and it's also really hard to care about anyone in the film. Second, the film is over-stylized to the point that it was ridiculous. The fights were downright silly--with too much slo-mo, mid-air spins, bullets having no effect on any of them and all while wearing the most stylish fashions. It seemed silly...really silly...especially when one of them literally jumped from thousands of feet to join in the fight while wearing a bat-like suit and then crashing into the warehouse. He and his sibs then wiped out a veritable army of well armed soldiers...and none of them broke a sweat nor got injured!! I really wish instead they had spent less time and money in making these ridiculous fight scenes and simply filmed them as if the leads were humans and not gods!! It was simply ludicrous...and seemed almost like watching the Kardashians starring in a super-over stylized Bond film!! Laughable to say the least.I lay all the blame for me hating this movie on the director and producers. They never showed ANY restraint and should have dialed back on the crazy super-human aspects of the movie as well as the constant blaring music and super-wealthy locations and costumes. None of them seemed to wonder if they were creating a film that was less an entertaining drama and more an unintentional but unlikable comedy. Oh, and I didn't even mention the song and dance numbers. They ARE common in Indian pictures...but the amount of auto-tuning they did make for some weird techno-sounding singing....though the dancing itself was pretty typical for Bollywood.Rarely have I seen this much money spent to create a film this dumb.",

It's plot is virtually non-existent considering the incessant attempts to just thwart the reader's each and every prediction on what happens next. Remo D'Souza has gone out of control here.

Right from the opening scene of the film to the climax, forget about logic, even the story is full of potholes. There is some breath of air when Anil Kapoor tells about his plan but again the film goes back to the loop hole and sadly does not recover. The first film Race (2008) was brilliant with solid twist and turns followed by an average Race 2 (2016). Race 3 is a nightmare which you should get over immediately with as it will haunt you, the more you think about it.None of songs are good (surprisingly music is composed by brilliant duo Salim - Sulaiman). Action scenes , though few scenes were fine, but again gone overboard. Race 3 is high on production values and less on content. Dialogues are horrible and funny especially - Our business is our business , none of your business. Even the Bhojpuri language used in between the scenes is irritating.Coming to the performances, none of the actors have done justice to their role. I do not understand why Salman Khan is repeating himself, even though he is in Bollywood industry for more than 25 years. The actor, who was superb in films like Dabanng and Sultan, should start experimenting with roles. Anil Kapoor is fine but could have been better. Bobby Deol makes a decent comeback but sadly not enough to leave any impact. Lesser spoken about Saqeeb Salim, Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez, the better.Overall, Race 3 is an insult to Bollywood. Avoid it any cost.",

When the movie was announced I was pretty sad that Saif Ali Khan was not reprising his role. However the film was marketed as a stand alone film that has nothing to do with the movies in the franchise. The movie has no connection to the race universe and therefore is not a true sequel. In addition, the direction is very poor, the movie has no build up, no layering, no character development and having seem the previous films of the director I can only concluded that he should quit direction as it is not his cup of tea.",

I am not a hater of Salman Khan, I am a hater of horrible movies. Tiger Zinda Hai was pretty good, but this one proved to be horrible. For making a sensible and watchable movie we need a proper storyline (I doubt, whether Race 3 had any) a set of actors who can act (I need a microscope to find one out there) and songs which we could hum for a couple of days (Let's not talk anymore about the songs, because I cannot find a single thing to appreciate about them, I mean, none of them are worth hearing twice).How can we forget the \"meme - worthy\" dialogues and the \"beautiful\" lyrics written by the megastar Salman Khan?!\"Our business is our business, none of your business\".\n\"Ik baar baby selfish hoke apne liye jiyo na.\"Now let's talk about the previous two movies of the Race series: -Race was absolutely brilliant, let's say it proves \"Old is Gold\". Race 2 was my favourite. Race is Saif Ali Khan's and it will only be his. Race without Saif, Dabangg without Salman and Dhoom without Hrithik is meaningless. Believe me, save your money. Please don't waste it on Race 3. Instead, watch Sanju on 29th June. Practically, there is nothing good about this movie except the beautiful cars shown flying. Salman here is a cluless stuntsman. Now, he should realise that stardom does not make a movie, a proper storyline and fine acting makes one.I would rate this movie 1 out of 10.Ratings of the songs: -(1) Heeriye: 1.5 out of 5\n(2) Selfish: 0.5 out of 5\n(3) Allah Duhaai Hai: 2.5 out of 5\n(4) Party Chale On: 0.5 out of 5Overall: Horrible (1 out of 5)Rating: -Direction: 0.5/5\nDialogues: 0.5/5\nScreenplay: 0.5/ 5\nMusic: 1.0 / 5\nAction: 2.0 / 5\nVisual appeal: 1.5 / 5Overall: Disaster (1.0 out of 5)Box office prediction: - (Lifetime) 200 to 220 crores in India because I know that even after saying this much, insensible Salman fans will go and watch this movie and make this crap a blockbuster.That's my review for Race 3.",

Basically a launch party, trying to introduce new faces(or more accurately, feces) in Bollywood under the banner of Salman Khan. It seriously makes me question the mentality of public, who went out in droves to watch this pile of crap.Action scenes are complete disgrace to the brand of action movies. Trying to copy some of the best scenes from other movies, and failing in each of them with flying colors. No one knows how to properly make green screen CGI. I mean even small youtubers are making movie quality CGI with way less resources.All in all, if you are feeling a bit depressed, go watch this movie, you'll fell better knowing you can act better and write better stories.

It was like they are changing their minds rather than making sure they know who's side they are on. The action was the only thing that saved the movie but some it is was cheesy and the first wing suit stunt looked faker than a PS1 game.It was good to see Bobby Deol back which is what I liked about it and you can tell that he was well prepared for the role after a long come back. The songs were not only bad but was a huge misfit for this kind of movie, probably for any Bollywood movie as they were mostly romantic songs and this is supposed to be an action thriller. The songs were a total waste and appeared every 10 minutes. If there is anything that I learned from this movie is that if anyone betrays you then you should sing a song to them, I talking about the Allah Duhai Hai song.Overall this is nothing more than a time-pass movie if your not a Salman Khan fan.",

            "content": "A successful franchise,huge star cast, holiday release and SALMAN KHAN. \"Race 3\" has all the ingredients to make a perfect blockbuster masala entertainer and hopes to be Salman Khan's 4th entrant into the coveted 300 cr club. So does the 3rd film in the \"Race\" series match up to its predessors and the hype generated?. Lets find out.Story: First of all, there is no story to review so this section should have been left blank. There is literally no plot, the characters are flat and one dimensional, there is no conflict, while watching the film I was wondering whether the person who wrote the film has any knowledge of basic storytelling or any sense of creativity. The dialouges are cring-worthy and it seems they were written by a 4th grader. The plot twists which are a trademark of the Race franchise are predictable and plain stupid.Even the most loyal of Salman Khan fans will find it hard to digest this joke of a screenplay which is lost in this 130 crore disaster of a film.Direction,Editing,Production: I think Remo D Souza should just stick to being a choreographer as Direction is clearly not his cup of tea. His take of the Race series is a huge downgrade from that of Abbas-Mustan who gave the Race series its own trademark feel. The intelligent story telling of Abbas Mustan is clearly missing.You know a disaster is bound to happen when you give a below average director, a weak script and thats exactly what happened. The production design and Cinematography is top notch and slick which gives the film a stylish look.Acting: Even an AI Robot can offer more expressions and better dialouge delivery than Salman Khan in this film. Salman Khan's casting is a complete misfit and you will definitely miss the suave Ranveer Singh played by Saif Ali Khan. Salman Khan comes out as a sore thumb and its pretty evident that he just sleep walked through the film. Unfortunately, Bobby Deol has made a forgettable comeback and he has again proved that he simply cant act. Daisy Shah and Jacquline Fernandes have simply been cast to up the glamour quotient of the film. Even a talented actor like Saqib Saleem is wasted. Only Anil Kapoor's performance is the sole saving grace of the film and he has done a commendable job given the pathetic script he was given to act for.Music: This has to be one of the most ridiculous soundtracks of all time. Each and every song is just plain bad with even worse lyrics. The Allah Duhai hai theme song is the only hummable track in this disaster of an album. Underline: No style and No substance. The film has clearly lost the race against its predessors and even a stupid Race 2 looks like Inception in front of this film.The only race this film wins is for \"worst movie of the year\" and its just June.",

The film stars Anil Kapoor, Salman Khan, and Bobby Deol in the prominent roles. It is the third installment of Race film series.As per the story is considered the film has no connection to its previous installments. It is the standalone film which revolves around a 'Singh' family that deals in worldwide arms dealings and crimes. Shamsher Singh (Anil Kapoor), the head of the family, a ruthless boss, runs this business with his twin children Sanjana (Daisy Shah) and Suraj (Saqib Saleem), and his nephew Sikander (Salman Khan). Being older among these siblings, Sikander always gets all the work delegated to him and gets all the appreciation from Shamsher, which eventually makes Sanjana and Suraj feel envious and jealous against Sikander. Bobby Deol plays the role of Yash, a loyal and dangerous henchman of a 'Singh' family. And Jacqueline Fernandez plays the role of Jessica, a woman with secrets, and Sikander's love interest. What follows next in the film is a game of love, deception, greed, and revenge.First of all, the absence of Saif Ali Khan from the film totally takes away the feel of previous Race films. The film is the unwanted and unnecessary installment in the Race film series. The film is filled with a nonsensical storyline, a lot of plot holes, totally useless songs, some over the top action sequences, shirtless Salman Khan, and yes, shirtless Bobby Deol as well. Jacqueline and Daisy are just the eye candies in the film. There is nothing notable in the film, except the climax of the film and Anil Kapoor's performance. The film is a polished hyper-realistic dumb film. It's just like overpriced petrol where filmmakers are literally looting audience.Verdict : Does not even worth a single watch. Watch it at your own risk.",

To expect anything of a masterpiece level won't really be a fault since he has been delivering some greatly written action films too (TIGER ZINDA HAI, BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN etc), but this film is without a second thought, merely an entertainer. And entertainment, is a basic thing a film should provide to its audiences.The first half of RACE 3 goes downhill after an explosive action sequence. The infusion of unwanted romantic subplots and songs simply hinders. This thing is clearly a commercial compromise. Several backstories not needed are present. This was witnessed even in this year's much hyped, thinking man's action thriller, AIYAARY. RACE 3 suffers from the same issues: poor editing and pacing. The entire episode involving Salman and Jacqueline seems forced and even cringeworthy. As characters keep breaking into songs throughout the film, the viewers are reminded that this film's directed by Remo D'Souza. This is an action movie and wasn't meant to be a dance show at the same time!Salman Khan is impressive but it's hard to say that he carries the film on his shoulders, entirely. Other characters too get to breathe, and that was a bit different for a Salman Khan movie. His entry was received with claps and whistles, and he once again impressed big time with his action and dance moves. Jacqueline too did her part well, but only in the second half. Same for Daisy Shah. Saqib Saleem played his part well. Anil Kapoor too did a fair job, but seemed to overact after a point of time; his Bhojpuri dialogues felt overdone. Bobby Deol played his part coldly, but luckily that's how his character was always meant to be. Sharat Saxena too is impressive in an underutilized yet interesting role.The music is a letdown. Except for Heeriye, all the other songs are not just unimpressive but also added randomly. The film picked up well around the interval with a good twist but as it was going further well in the second half, one song: randomly thrown in, hindered the flow. But the film has plus points. It has plenty of action to impress any action fan. The second half showcases some of the best action sequences ever, especially the flying sequences (in both the halves) and the explosive climax action block. Watching it in 3D was a pure pleasure. All action scenes looked brilliant in 3D, and I could see viewers going excited with smallest particles of glass and dust coming on screen. I liked that too. Seriously, how often do you get to see Indian action films in 3D? (except for some superhero movies)RACE 3, without a second thought, is a good action entertainer which in a way tests its viewers' loyalty, by letting them down in the mid of the first half and then surprising them with nonstop action and twists in the second half. Just go for it if you too are an action lover. By the time it will end, the action will leave you both satisfied and entertained.",

But then the promotions of the film started that reduced my interest in the film. After watching the film yesterday, I can say that I have watched the worst film anyone could make.Plot: Things suddenly begin to change for the Singh family when Jessica Gomes enters their lives.Story and direction: I remember in 2008 when the first instalment came out and me being quite excited when no one talked about the film. The film surprised everyone and subsequently a sequel came out in 2013 which was not as good as its predecessor. But still the film worked for its convincing plot and setting. Let me get one thing straight. This film had the makings of a blockbuster. The set pieces of the film looked quite awesome and set the screens to be blazing on film. But alas, that's where the excitement stops. The plot is so weak and paper thin that it couldn't invest me for a second. There were so many things that the makers packed into this film that it felt irritating after some time. Watching the film, I felt that given a director's job I could have done a better job. Remo D'Souza just spoils the whole film. He just tries every formula in the book without giving his own input that would make the film standout in comparison to others. Many scenes felt so impossible that I wondered how the writer thought of putting it in the script (if there was one). The dialogues were already trolled even before the film released but I can say there are plenty more. Not as a Salman Khan fan, I was disappointed more as an action film fan. The stunts looked so amateurish (considering a Hollywood action director was hired). There was a lot of green screen and stunts dumbed down for the Indian audiences. Even I could know the difference between the actors and their stunt doubles. Slow motion has been used a lot which negated the possible effect the scene should have. Performances: Anil Kapoor was top notch and maybe the possible reason why this film was still bearable. Salman Khan was his usual. We know Jacqueline's acting skills and as to why she is taken in films. Bobby Deol basically does nothing in the film. Daisy Shah was horrible. Saqib Saleem and Rajesh Sharma were wasted. Sharat Saxena did good with what was given. Music: Salman Khan, who is known for providing chartbusters, fails miserably in this department. None of the songs felt natural or good. It felt like they were compensating for the lack of story. If I had to pick out the worst song it would be the Salman Khan written and performed song 'I Found Love'. Salman Khan should stop writing songs after this experience and stop taking Iulia Vantur to sing songs. The BGM works in places but I have heard better.Worst Scene: It would be any scene where Anil Kapoor and any other character converse in Bhojpuri. It felt very forced and funny. The dialogues were full of trash.Verdict: Salman Khan should have thought even before investing a huge amount in a film like this. If that wasn't enough, he hired Remo as the director (we all know what happened with FLYING JATT). The makers have announced a sequel to this film. Hopefully they understand what they are doing. RACE 3 was more a comedy film than an action thriller. It is the worst film this franchise has to offer.I am going with a 2/10.",

Sure, there have been a few stinkers here and there but nothing like \"Race 3\" because this film has the distinction of being the only Indian film now on the infamous Bottom 100 list on IMDB. With a pathetically low score of only 2.1, it really is a film that few people have loved! Will I be yet another person who thinks this is an absolutely terrible film??Yes. I thought the film was terrible as well and for two big reasons. First, the entire story is about a family of monsters. Don't get the wrong idea, they aren't literally monsters but rich folks who are arms merchants who will sell to ANYONE and who are all lethal killing machines. The father built up the company and apparently trained his twin son and daughter to be self-absorbed murder machines as well as his adopted son. During the course of the movie, they murder dozens and dozens--with an ease that would scare away the Terminator and they look as if they just walked off the cover of 'Vogue\" or \"GQ\"!! They are simply evil scum...and the movie seems to romanticize them and it's also really hard to care about anyone in the film. Second, the film is over-stylized to the point that it was ridiculous. The fights were downright silly--with too much slo-mo, mid-air spins, bullets having no effect on any of them and all while wearing the most stylish fashions. It seemed silly...really silly...especially when one of them literally jumped from thousands of feet to join in the fight while wearing a bat-like suit and then crashing into the warehouse. He and his sibs then wiped out a veritable army of well armed soldiers...and none of them broke a sweat nor got injured!! I really wish instead they had spent less time and money in making these ridiculous fight scenes and simply filmed them as if the leads were humans and not gods!! It was simply ludicrous...and seemed almost like watching the Kardashians starring in a super-over stylized Bond film!! Laughable to say the least.I lay all the blame for me hating this movie on the director and producers. They never showed ANY restraint and should have dialed back on the crazy super-human aspects of the movie as well as the constant blaring music and super-wealthy locations and costumes. None of them seemed to wonder if they were creating a film that was less an entertaining drama and more an unintentional but unlikable comedy. Oh, and I didn't even mention the song and dance numbers. They ARE common in Indian pictures...but the amount of auto-tuning they did make for some weird techno-sounding singing....though the dancing itself was pretty typical for Bollywood.Rarely have I seen this much money spent to create a film this dumb.3 out of 7 found this helpful.",

I think earlier he used to try (at leats), now he doesn't even bother. An actor is supposed to be the character but here, his persona outshines and overshadows the character or even the story. Saqib Salim who is a decent actor made to say the word \"bro\" after each and every dialogue so much so that it becomes cringeworthy. Bobby Deol is average, Daisy, Jacquline are... like they are in their other movies - all glam no skill. Anil Kapoor is the only one who can hold his own.The plot is contrived (which was true for earlier Race movies too) but this movie doesn't even put any effort. Be it pulling off a supposedly dangerous heist which is wrapped up in a song sequence with the actors just walking in slow motion to look cool. At least some effort should have been shown- some action scene, some nail-biting suspense but we get nothing. All the maker focussed on was getting Salman, getting the other actors to walk in slo-mo to look cool and blowing up expensive cars. The songs... I don't even know where to begin. I was shocked that a big-budget movie couldn't even afford a decent lyricist till I saw that Salman has penned a couple of the songs himself. Just do a quick google search of Selfish and I found love - 2 \"gems\". Even the title track has been mashed and made bad.I thought Race 1 was okay, Race 2 was going downhill but still bearable but Race 3 just touches the bottom of it. Non-existent story-lines, bad acting, \"star\" kids etc is what Bollywood has been reduced to now.",

Characters involved - Rich, old illegal arms dealer (Anil Kapoor), his step son (Salman Khan), his twins (Daisy Shah and Saqib Saleem), the family's Man Friday (Bobby Deol) and the eye candy (Jacqueline Fernandez).Illegal arms dealer has been wrongly driven out of his country and his sole aim is to return to his native village with a clean chit and to do this he needs to indulge in more criminal activity such as stealing a 'hard disk' that has illegally recorded sleazy videos of politicians and then blackmailing these politicians. To help him with this task, he has his children who are all trained fighters and have each others' backs on the field. But all is not well at home. The twins want the step son out of the way as their father favours him over them. Step son has brief affair with eye candy and then they break up only to have her return back to his life after few days/months/years (we don't know). Man Friday oscillates in his loyalty towards step son and twins.Will illegal arms dealer return to his village? Will arm candy and step son have a 'happily ever after'? Whom does Man Friday finally stand up for? Who will survive- the twins or the step son? Oh Salman, you've ruined this movie and turned into a big-budget Dabangg!\nThe film begins with each character being introduced by a voice over and that is when things begin to go downhill. When you have someone do a voice over in the film, that person ought to have a great voice and not sound like a railway announcement.The USP of the Race series has always been the action packed scenes, the larger than life stunt sequences and the twists in the plot. Race 3 has all of this but fails to impress due to poor acting, even worse direction, abysmal script and unrealistic scenes. I am fine with one person taking down an entire truckload of trained militia by himself but how in God's name does Salman manage to jump off a high rise building in a wingsuit, manoeuvre through buildings across town (while still flying) and land into the warehouse where his siblings are fighting? I have never been a big fan of Salman's movies but this one really annoyed me as I went to the theatre with high expectations. Salman looks like a stocky potato and lacks the panache that Saif Ali Khan had in the previous movies. I feel terrible saying this but Daisy Shah is really annoying. Despite her cool stunt moves and her brilliant aerial dance, she has failed at trying to pass off as an uber cool, 25 year old scheming daredevil. Jacqueline is just being umm.... Jacqueline in the movie. (Chittiyan kalaiyan veh)However, feminists rejoice. For a change, this film has action scenes with women in them, that do not involve name calling and hair pulling. *eye roll*Would you believe this, I have nothing bad to say about Bobby Deol!(Oh, I forgot to mention the other twin. Yeah, he has some scenes too.)Anil Kapoor was definitely the saving grace and the good news is that the way the film ended, it would appear that Anil Kapoor shall make a comeback and thankfully not Salman Khan!I sometimes still croon the songs from Race 1. The songs in this movie are unremarkable and the lyrics are so lame (tried thinking of a more professional word than lame, but lame describes it the best) especially the song \"Selfish\" and what do you know! The lyrics to the song have been penned by Salman! Did I mention the script? LAME. \nRemo, please stick to being a choreographer. \nP.S: Remo D'Souza is the director of the movie.",

            "content": "I normally have very good judgement when it comes to movies and am very selective when it comes to cinema viewings but I was with someone who wanted to see this movie. After seeing this movie I am seriously considering terminating the friendship!.I thought the original Race was quite decent so I had a brief idea on what to expect (IE lots of twists and turns) but this movie went really overboard with twists that it was hard to keep up with the plot. That said I will try to explain the plot and twists as coherently as I can. \nThe plot as it is revolves around a criminal organization which consists of boss Anil Kapoor, dead brother's son Salman Khan, right hand man Bobby Deol, faithful worker Sharad Saxena and Anil's twin children Saqib Salaam and Daisy Irani. They hatch a plan to blackmail politicians by laying their hands on some information in a hard disk that exposes them in a compromising position which they would pay any money for Anil Kapoor not to leak to the media. The disk is in in a locker in Cambodia. That is the barebones of the flimsy plot, to elongate the movies length to make for the flimsy premise there is deception and double crossing all over. Jacqueline Fernandez meeting Salman Khan and then leaving them, then Bobby Deol introduces as his fianc\u00e9e, when confronted reveals that she was hired by the twins to steal money. When truth comes out Salman, Jacqueline and Bobby decide to join hands to expose the crafty two. \nThen when retrieving the hard disk in Cambodia Salman taken hostage by Cambodia's army on the orders of Bobby Deol, who is in fact dating Daisy and is in cahoots with them.Salman Khan manages to escape with the help of Jacqueline and avenges his betrayal at the hands of Bobby and the twins. After that his car is blown up by Anil Kapoor. He is informed what his uncle planned to do by Sharad Saxena. Then in the finale comes the biggest twist of all. When the gang meet the politicians, the wrong disk is played and in the disk Salman's dying mother's video which reveals that Anil himself was responsible for killing his brother and had been slowly poisoning his bhabhi after taking her in after murdering his brother. His brother was against the idea of Anil selling drugs and hence Anil disposed of him.Anil's demands for the politicians is that some of their land is to be reserved for his drugs empire. Not only that Salman's mother reveals that the twins are not really Anil's kids but hers and her husbands, making Salman and the twins siblings and Anil's offspring is none other than his right hand man Bobby Deol!. Now onto who switched the disks, it was none other than Salman Khan who had come to know that his uncle has murdered his parents and had been waiting for the right moment to expose his uncles wrongdoings. Like me you must have been confused reading it but that is the entire plot of the movie complete with twists and turns. There was some stuff about some sort of will if I recall but by the end my head was so screwed over by the absurdity of the movie I blanked it out. Trust me I have saved you from watching this tranwreck by revealing the twists.There are many laughable moments, like the scenes with Salman Khan flying (yes flying!). The songs too are a disappointment, with the exception of \"Allah Duhai\" which was taken from the original.The performances too are disappointing. Jacqueline and Daisy are meant to add sex appeal to the proceedings but fail miserably, particularly Daisy whose blank expressions really irked me. The only saving grace is the wonderful Anil Kapoor, who is still the ultimate badass after more than thirty years in the industry. I would go as far as saying Race 3 is one of the worst Bollywood movies I have seen and by far the worst movie I have had the displeasure of seeing on the big screen.At the end hey hinted at a potential fourth addition to the series, which just proves that the makers really have no sympathy for the audience, they just want to milk every bit of money out of them.",

It's after quite some time that Bobby will be seen on the big screen post his physical transformation. The 'Yamla Pagla Deewana' actor has been also vocal about how Salman has contributed to a vast change in his personality that the audience will get to witness with 'Race 3'.Speaking about Anil Kapoor's character he will be seen playing the role of a business tycoon, Shamsher in 'Race 3'. Apparently, Anil Kapoor has performed all the daredevil action stunts in the film by himself.\nApart from this, the fans are also in all praise for Anil Kapoor's look in the movie. The 61-year-old actor is seen in a stylish avatar in the film. But do you know who designed this stylish look of Anil Kapoor in the film? Well, it wasn't Salman Khan or Remo D'Souza who were responsible, but Anil Kapoor's daughter Rhea has designed his look in the film.\nRace 3 also stars Daisy Shah, Saqib Saleem, Bobby Deol and Jacqueline Fernandez. The film will hit theatres on June 15.\nSalman Khan-starrer 'Race 3' is one of the most anticipated films of 2018. Ever since the inception of the action-packed thriller, the bond between Salman Khan and Bobby Deol has been quite evident. The two have of late been all praise about each other.\nSalman has definitely pushed the limits of Bobby Deol when it comes to his professional front. Even the 'Poster Boys' actor has gone on record to accredited a major motivation and catalyst of change in him to none other than the 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' actor.\nRemo D'souza is all set to give the audience an action-packed thriller this Eid. However, it hasn't been a cakewalk for the choreographer-director to pull off a Salman Khan -entertainer in a span of just six months.\nSalman Khan's upcoming film 'Race 3' is one of the most anticipated films of this year. The makers have shot significant portions of the film in Kashmir.\n'Race 3' has the audiences' pulse with its high octane stunts and intriguing story line. Daisy Shah, who essays the role of Sanjana, will reportedly be in a new avatar doing some adrenaline pumping action sequences. Daisy's daredevilry will apparently be one to watch out for in the movie. \nSpeaking about the same, director\nRemo D'Souza said . \" The hase work which Daisy has put in clearly visible in the film. Audinces are going to see a very different verison of Daisy Shah and they are going to love her.\nAs per reports, a segment of 'Allah Duhai Hai' was also shot at the scenic land of Kashmir. The 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' actor today took to his social media account to express his gratitude of being able to shoot at Kashmir.\nThe actor wrote, \"Thank you #Jammu & #Kashmir tourism for all the support and the wonderful experience for #Race3 .\nPreviously, Salman had shot in Jammu and Kashmir for 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. \nDirected by Remo D'Souza the action flick also stars Jacqueline Fernandez, Bobby Deol, Saqib Saleem, Anil Kapoor and Daisy Shah. 'Race 3' is all set for an Eid release on June 15, 2018.",

Jacqueline makes the film hotter with her dances and actions. The highlights of the film I would say is the never seen actions which are picturized at grand scale. Salman is top notch, Anil Kapoor is pitch perfect in the film and most importantly, #Remo D'Souza surprises you with his sharpe direction. Because I liked it very much and enjoyed it a lot, I give it 10/10. Go and watch it even if you are not a traditional Bollywood movie goer or Salman Khan. It will entertain you a lot and you will have a great day a great weekend discussing every bit of the film.Race3 will be a blockbuster film. My business rating for the weekend in India is 125 crores becoming the highest grossing weekend and 330 to 350 crore lifetime in India and $25-30Million in overseas. I watched it in 3D and it was another experience altogether. It is a clean family film with no embarrassing moment. Excellent movie RACE 3.",

It is distributed by Tips films, Salman Khan Films, and Yash Raj Films. This film is considered to be a reboot to the race franchise. Although it has a sparsely related plot to the previous film. This film stars Anil Kapoor and Jacqueline Fernandez who have previously performed in this franchise and Salman Khan Bobby Deol, Saqib Saleem, and Daisy Shah as the new entrants in the franchise. This is the presently last and the worst part in my view in the whole franchise and I primarily think that the failure of this film is due to Salman Khan because he interferes in every sphere of filmmaking whether it be the direction or it is a screenplay. The story has become a thing of past in Salman Khan films and as I say that story is the core of any movie and so I give this film a very negative rating. This film lags in the storyline as well as in the presentation too. individual performances of actors are fine and the music is also average. I don't advise my readers to watch this movie as it could lead to severe headaches.",

Although Race 2 was a little behind the original Race in film making, it stills stands out minus the fashion show.This Race 3 has the elements and potential but is made for all the wrong reasons namely Salman Khans showcase. He is an entertaining actor no doubt and I like his movies but this was a wrong move that killed the Race franchise. Race is all about the thrilling ride and the shocking twist of betrayal, however Race 3 falls flat in this department, its reveal and twist isnt shocking and everything was just messed up. The ideas were there but it couldnt be woven in its screenplay, the director seem not to know where he going with this movie. It gets too messy and the events during the film does not tie up fully at the end.The rest of the cast are just there to add more confusion and bad acting. Anil Kapoor is decent and Salman is just average, seen better films of his. Jacqueline is just there for sake of having a beautiful actress in the film with no meaty parts, Daisy is average and Saqeeb is irritating. A good actor like Bobby Deol is wasted. Music was below par compared to other 2 films but still enjoyable. For a big budget film better looking locations should have been used. Nevertheless it is still a movie that has good action scenes and maybe enjoy if you ignore all the flaws and potholes in the story and the below average script and actors.",

Audiences got confused whether they are watching race 3 or prem ratan dhan payo. Race 3 lacks of that race series feel . Though race 3 talks about so much of family. It fails to connect with family. Saif Ali Khan should be in place of Salman Khan. As Salman is not suitable for suspense thriller . As suspense thriller shows sometime protagonists as antagonist. So Saif Ali Khan should have been in place of Salman Khan. Bobby deol and saqib saleem role can be interchanged . I mean Bobby deol as anil Kapoor's son . I mean who wanna see this . And he doesn't look like his son . Overall acting are good of all actors .salman Khan did justice to the role.Jacqueline Fernandez also did justice to the role and people who say she can't act should see this movie .3 songs are good Heeriye,Allah duhai hai,I found love. background score was amazing loved it .direction was also good .

            "content": "Race 3 Movie Review by #SaltedPopcornIt's a general phenomena that Salman Khan fans love Salman Khan movies even when he literally craps in his movies. But Race 3 is a movie which, even Salman Khan fans would not be able to endure.Race franchise has suffered a lot after its first part. Race 2 was a bit worse than Race and Race 3 is an utter nonsense movie with king of Nonsense himself Salman Khan. Thanks to Salman Khan And Remo D Soua for spoiling and devastating this franchise completely.\nRace 3 is story of a family headed by Anil Kapoor and is involved in manufacturing of Arms. Salman, Daisy Shah, Saqeeb Salim and Bobby Deol are part of this family. Though all of them try to act smarter than each other, in reality, every one's character is even more stupid than others.Race 3 is a no script, no acting, no common sense movie. Which character is with whom and what does every character want, it's beyond understanding till end of the movie.Director Remo D Souza should know that he has disastrous direction skills. He is better being a judge is some kids Dance show rather than giving headaches to people by making F.A.L.T.U movies like ABCD, ABCD 2 and many other failed immature films.Race 3 is an amateur attempt to put some glamour and action into a boring script. It's overridden by overacting. In every 10 minutes, songs keep breaking the script (whatsoever is there). This Race lasts so long that people start leaving theater on the first chance they get.Overall, this movie should be strictly avoided not only in theaters but at home also. It's not a race of being smarter, it's a race of being stupid. More than Race, it's Disgrace.Spend your time either at home or watch Jurassic Park again. There, Dinosaurs have acted better than this bunch of actors.Saif, I dint know you could also be missed so much in some movie. Race was outrightly yours and must be yours.Stars- 1.5/5",

            "content": "Race 3 can only be described as 'uggh'. The movie limped and wallowed from the very beginning and never really got off. It was an attempt at a masala movie with some poorly executed acting, direction and storyline. The storyline infact was altogether missing.Race has been a solid franchise delivering 2 thrilling fast paced action movies, backed by slick editing and well crafted action and dance sequence. This movie is unlike the others at best a disgrace to the franchise. The action sequences are a bore, cliched, trite scenes. The star cast seems wasted and the impressive balance between the hero and goons which was the underpinning of the Race series, completely missing. Veteran actors with salt grey hair are being paired with absolute novices, making it seem fake and dubious. \n \nThe dialogues and song sequences are absolutely shallow, a lazy concoction of english and hindi with little thought or consideration to meaning. But more than anything the movie sinks because of poor and inattentive direction.\nRemo lives up to his talent of vomitting shoddy, half baked, cliched movies to audiences. Fast paced action sequences are immediately followed by absolutely slow listless songs, making it seem like bumpy edits with no continuation. Storyline was probably trashed long before the shoot and impulsive, knee-jerk shoots were knit together to create a semblance of a storyline. But the true artistic talent is revealed in corporate sponsorships with Marriot, Dell and many other tobacco companies finding mention and feature. Overall, its sad to see A Grade actors concurring to work in such a movie. It is doled to audiences, in a brazen manner, ridiculing and deriding their intellect. Suggestive that audience only merit such movies and will wallow it up in favor of big star cast.",

Remo D'Souza did a very very bad job making this film. This film didn't even had a good story but in fact it was incredibly bad. At least Flying Jatt was a little bit better than this one but the direction stays the same for these films. Salman Khan's acting was so bad that you will not believe that he'll do this type of acting. Jacqueline was totally not needed in this movie and so is the other actors and actresses like Bobby Deol, Daisy Shah and Saqib Saleem. The only good thing about this movie was Anil Kapoor as how his character was more focused than anyone elses. Let's talk about the action in this movie. The action was very bad because it won't look as realistic as how Race 2's action sequences was. But then again it was also pointless. Also I think that this is one of the worst films of Salman Khan. And I also don't get why he would do these types of films.Anyways I would give this movie a 4/10 because I think that this movie showed that it is going to be bad from the trailer and the then movie itself was very bad compared to the trailer.",

You'll also have your forever-35 y.o. Salman, who is 50+ in real life but will probably never ever grow up and get old on screen. Salman will poorly perform in dancing episodes, as usual. Maybe even worse than usual. You will have that awkward moment when a woman puts on jumpsuit for skydiving while driving a truck, and then skydives right from the truck. You will be impressed by Bobby Deol's 6-pack.You'll get lost in plot twists within plot twists. Seriously, Mr. Nolan is silently jealously crying with his 'Inception' - 'Race 3' outraces it easily. Everything changes every 10 minutes or so - loyalties, family relationships, loves and hates. Before the end Salman will do his thing again. He will rip his t-shirt from his well-oiled body with just 2 fingers. I mean, have you ever tried to rip a perfectly good t-shirt with one hand? I bet you failed. Salman does that every time successfully. In the very end Salman will explain everything to those who didn't understand what just happened. You will definitely need that explanation.As I said, this movie is so bad it is even good. Because the level of badness is so high, it is piece of the Art of Bad Movies.",

Peace can be made even among fatal enemies if we want to do it with Positive thinking and positive heart. Thats why in Climax of movie he made peace with the enemy. Thats why we call Salman Khan Being Human ( A man with Golden heart). His movies can be watched by little one, elders, youngsters. It does not contain vulgarity.

Because the movie was boring with very dull acting. Didn't expect this Salman Khan. Although I am not a big fan of him, I enjoyed some of his old movies like hum aapke hain Kuan , sultan and so on.

Every single time your looking at the screen your surprised to see because every scene exceeds your expectations. The entry to the climax keeps u holding on to your chair. And their is nooo way to predict the climax. No one could even think the climax would be that good. The race is known for twists and turns which race 3 provides through out the movie and does it sooo good that your just amazed. The action is off the top. Each action scene is shot with perfection and has beaten Tiger Zinda Hai by a huge margin. Not one car is missing in this movie. You get to see everycsr you could think of. They literally destroyed everything they bought. Let's forget everything and focus on Salman Khan. He is the soul of the movie. He makes the movie so much better that you won't take your eyes off of him. His action sequences and his dialogue deliveries give you goosebumps. Most importantly when he takes of his shirt you will want to fall to the ground. The whole cast has done an amazing job. Bobby dell has made and amazing comeback and I can assure this movie will boost his career to the top once again. Anil Kapoor is at his best. He makes the movie feel so much more races because he's the only familiar face from all the races. Jacqueline looks as good as ever. Her action sequences are just mind blowing. Daisy shah on the other hand does a decent job but isn't showcased much. Saqib Saleem looks like a joke in the movie and looks too weak infront of salman and bobby. The music is really good but it doenst best race2 songs. Lat Lag Gaye has to be the best song from all the races. With race 3 they tried heeriye which was and awesome song and probably the best song of the movie but didn't feel better than Lat Lag Gaye. Apart from that we know that the other races have had some vulgarity but Salman Khan has done an excellent job taking out as much as he could. This movies makes for a family watch and it's as fun as it could get. It's for all ages and it will surely take away ur breathe in ever scene",

            "content": "Okay, what the f(bleep)ck? This movie is just a really really bad rip off of the first two movies.Starting with the fact that they sort of made a bad version of the remake for the introduction of the main antagonist from the second Race, even that was better. eg: (I like John Abraham, I just don't like his acting but it was better than this one) if you look at Armaan Malik's introduction in Race 2, you'll notice that Anil Kapoor's intro basically had the same gist: they're both scary and mean af. Like, we get it: it's a bad Armaan Malik. Huge fan of Anil Kapoor tho, huge fan.Then we move onto the worst intro and worst character of all: Sikander. I'm sorry, but no exceptions for Salman. I don't like him at all, and he's overacted this to another level. I watched this one time, and I can see someone much better play this: like ADAM DEVINE. That guy works more in comedy, but could've played the role of Sikander much much much better! Everything was bad about this character, the acting, the personality, everything! Also, wtf is his age meant to be?!Another thing I didn't like was wtf was that love thing between Yash and Sanjana? Like, why? It was completely useless and unnecessary because he ended up being the antoganist later. The love stories were a rip off of Ranveer Singh and Sonia Martin, then Armaan Malik and Omisha. (True Race fans remember these great love stories)And that last fight scene, good up until the moment where they both removed their shirts, why? I'm a girl, and thought that was cheesy af. Yeah, it not bad in bizzaro world!!Now with every movie, when it comes to me, there are exceptions sometimes.I'll start with Daisy and Saqib: they're worth more than this movie, and have more potential than people think. Only one question was walking through my head: how did Daisy manage to make me hate her character, but love her acting and not hate her as an actress? The acting was that great. Super powerful. Then we move onto Saqib: his character (Suraj) was meant to be super chilled out and he played it super chilled out, like wow!!Bobby Deol: I haven't watched any Bobby Deol movies, but I felt like because of him I was able to actually watch this movie and power through it. Sure, I still missed the Race 2 gang, but it wasn't bad with Bobby.Finally, the masterpiece: Jacqueline Fernandez! There's nothing else to say, she had no flaws and was the true main lead of this story. Cheers to Jacqueline for the successful role of Jessica! Although the mistake the writers made was I feel like they didn't develop her character enough, and that made me upset because her character was like an underdog, and it was excellent!PS: the songs also were great. Heeriye was a really good song, hands down to Jacqueline for her savage pole moves. Party Chale On, wow!! Astounding fashion, and dance moves, and Bobby Deol drunk: funny! I Found Love and Selfish: fabulous! They're like quite nostalgic songs, and Daisy Shah on the silks I got very excited! And finally, the running song in all Race movies: Allah Dubai Hai. I liked the song, it had a good beat, and great music video, the only thing I didn't like were the chorus lyrics. They literally translate to, \"Oh God, I have a complaint. My life is in danger again, now there will be destruction in your love.\" Even Saif Ali Khan must've hated that, you're blaming the lord for your life being in danger, meaning you'll go straight to hell.

The acting is so awkward including sallu bhai and this is being said by a die hard fan of salman khan. There are two integral characters in the film which were portrayed by Oscar deserving actors namely Daisy shah and I dont even know the name of that guy who potrayed the characters so bad it almost makes Laugh out Loud every time they start trying to act. Music is right up there on the horrific scale and the lyrics are such a pain to the brain, they literally make no sense. What surprised me more was the choreography. One of the topmost choreographers of the country is directing the film and the innovation or freshness you expect in the choreography is non existent. The direction was anyways even worse than the horrible choreography. The production values are ok and bad when you compare to the budget they had in hand.

Like previous films this film also has many twist and turns but in my opinion screenwriting of previous films were slightly better.\nFirst half is slow coz Salman, Bobby , Anil , Sakib , Daisy all is in lead character so its bound to be slow, coz they had to build those characters and all the lead done good job. There are some unnecessary fight scenes too. \nStory is bit incomplete but it has a story. Those who are saying that there is no story are SRK fan or Salman haters who wants this film to flop but this film will be a hit, coz it almost has everything to be a entertainer. \nSo go and watch this film in theatre.",

This movie was particularly anticipated and did not meet the expectations of the audience at all. Like every film this one had its flaws as well but what truly degraded the movie and its presentation as a whole was it's direction in my opinion. Remo D Souza who had previously directed the ABCD franchise was not a good option for this action thriller. Had it been Abbas Mustan it would've been a much engaging and crisp film with the same script and screenplay. 2 songs Heeriye and the Allah duhai hai revamped version were excellent rest was total crap and could have been edited out. Party chale on was good though. Acting was bizarre and out of place by everyone besides Salman, Anil and Jacqueline. Salman and Anil kapoor carried the film throughout on their shoulders. Costumes and locations were exquisite. Some dialogues and direction again was extremely poor. This film had potential but the repulsive execution is its weakness. Action was new, stylish and extremely watchable. Opportunity gone wasted. My rating is based on the fact if you just take this as a standalone film and not part of the race franchise. Race 3 while being a big miss, earned est 303 Cr at the box office which is just a reinforcement of the fact that Salman Khan is the Biggest Megastar Of India in this decade. Lets see how far he goes.",

Even if you are not a #SalmanKhan fan, the film gives you an exciting story, marvelous cinematography and great performances in Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol and Freddy Daruwala. Jacqueline makes the film hotter with her dances and actions. The highlights of the film I would say is the never seen actions which are picturized at grand scale. Salman is top notch, Anil Kapoor is pitch perfect in the film and most importantly, #Remo D'Souza surprises you with his sharpe direction. Because I liked it very much and enjoyed it a lot, I give it 10/10. Go and watch it even if you are not a traditional Bollywood movie goer or Salman Khan. It will entertain you a lot and you will have a great day a great weekend discussing every bit of the film.Race3 will be a blockbuster film. My business rating for the weekend in India is 125 crores becoming the highest grossing weekend and 330 to 350 crore lifetime in India and $25-30Million in overseas.

And I have only begun, the storyline of this film cannot be described in words without any exaggeration. First, Salman Khan is not human in this film, he is still carrying those powers from 'God Tussi Great Ho' (for the love of God please don't see that film either.) he is defying Physics and death here. Then comes Anil Kapoor and Co. I am not lying when I say this, the rest of the characters were so boring you could only laugh at the CGI and stunts while not paying any attention to anyone except 'Bhai'. Overall, I say this movie is cruel and unusual and no one deserves this kind of punishment.",

It is distributed by Tips films, Salman Khan Films, and Yash Raj Films. This film is considered to be a reboot to the race franchise. Although it has a sparsely related plot to the previous film. This film stars Anil Kapoor and Jacqueline Fernandez who have previously performed in this franchise and Salman Khan Bobby Deol, Saqib Saleem, and Daisy Shah as the new entrants in the franchise. This is the presently last and the worst part in my view in the whole franchise and I primarily think that the failure of this film is due to Salman Khan because he interferes in every sphere of filmmaking whether it be the direction or it is a screenplay. The story has become a thing of past in Salman Khan films and as I say that story is the core of any movie and so I give this film a very negative rating. This film lags in the storyline as well as in the presentation too. individual performances of actors are fine and the music is also average. I don't advise my readers to watch this movie as it could lead to severe headaches.",

This movie is easily the worst in the franchise and one of the worst examples of Indian cinema. The action scenes in the movie are entertainingly ludicrous but there are only two worth mentioning and they even aren't that good, since the story at no point gave me any reason to care. A vast majority of this movie is a total snoozefest. I didn't like any of the characters nor did care about the overly convoluted and silly storylines. I was so painfully bored by this movie that I am amazed I even managed to get through its nearly three-hour runtime. The acting is also pretty bad in the movie, but part of the fault has to be given to the laughably bad dialogue. This movie has a couple of decently made action scenes and a good looking cast but absolutely nothing else. Go and rewatch the first \"Race\" movie instead of wasting your time sitting through this thing. This just might be the worst movie I have seen in 2018.",

Bobby deol was decent but story was rubbish with almost no surprises. In the very beginning you know all twists of the movie as every thing was copied from earlier parts. First two parts with saif ali khan also had luxury of having strong antagonist  like cunning Akshay khanna and tough John Abraham. Here it seemed Salman himself chose the rest of the cast only to make himself look far better from beginning and so that no one should ever root for the villain. When someone takes audience for granted as he has some crazy fans  the results are  tiger zinda hai and Race 3 like movies.
