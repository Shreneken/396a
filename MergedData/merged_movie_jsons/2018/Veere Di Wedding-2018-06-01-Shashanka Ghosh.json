The point of hole movie is to sell trash in the name of women empowerment. If you goto acting, the time you start watching you'll think it as overacting or would say what nonsense. Story is lame. I can't say one good thing about the movie other than its women movie having fun time in life. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, never ever.If you look at the imdb rating you would see morons giving 10 star looks like imdb is now affected with some fake accounts.At end movie doesn't deserve more than 2 star.",

            "content": "My gripe with the movie is not because it has women spewing abuses. But that it's a bad movie in all sense of the word. The film is not on women empowerment, doesn't deal with women heroes. Fair enough. This has been made abundantly clear by the cast and crew and that is fine. Not every movie needs to be a serious women-centric movie. Some can be fun. And Veere is not even fun, not even close. It's plain bad. Kareena looks real detached from the role, Swara is fine in acting department, Shikha is the best among them all along with Summeet Vyas. But Sonam Kapoor! Why why why is she an actress? She is unbearable in her dialogue delivery. Plain horrible especially in the scene where she is berating the arranged marriage guy. Half baked acting combined with bad and underdeveloped script and an overdose of abuses to look cool doesn't equal a good movie.PS: Anyone else seeing the sudden influx of 10/10 reviews from 2nd and 3rd June? Most of these accounts were created just couple of days back and have reviewed only this movie. Smells fishy. Is this some sneaky move by production house? Wouldn't put it past them.",

It's okay if you think it's empowering. Their choice is their personal opinion, None of your business.\nBut but but... Wait. Did they change the definition of empowerment. Is women empowerment limited to things what guys can do.? \nThe movie misguides the girls, they will fall for the trap.. \nThat was about the message that movie wants to convey.\nLet's come to acting part, after Nil Battey Sannata, had very high hopes from Swara, Got disappointed badly. But there is a positive to that also. When you go and watch you will find only Swara doing the bit of acting. Everyone knows the skills of the other 2 superrich starkids in the movie. So don't waste your money on this. Even if you still want to go.. I would rather suggest wait for the DVD to come out. I am very sure they will come out soon.\nStill desperate for the movie, yeah you can go for it, it's a below average, one time hard watch.\nBuy a lot of popcorn, nachos etc.. you'll need them.",

But according to bollywood, empowerment is to sell a rubbish movie by creating controversies. I am not being prude, the most talked about jerking off scene was one of the worst act I have seen in a movie since Kamal R Khan's last movie. Go to por\u00f1hu8 & look for verified amateurs doing the same thing so much better even on low budget. Swara Bhaskar was unnecessarily loud, like someone had put \"mirchi ka tadka\" on her privates. Throughout the movie she acted as if a kaamwali bai(no offence to them) had won a jackpot. Even though she was supposed to be somewhat rich, it felt like she has been using ration & bpl cards to make payments instead of visa & masterdards. The whole movie is about FAILED women who blame everyone but themselves for their failures. In India there are examples of many underprivileged women who have done quite well & are inspiration to others but this movie is not about any of them.This movie is empowering to those who are a failure in their real life, only they can relate to the characters of this movie.",

The reason your movie deserves 1 star rating is because of the fake \" women empowering \" you all talked about. Better show a movie which would change the mindset of our male dominant society . Nobody is gonna watch this with their families after knowing about the kind of scenes you have in this movie .and mostly its the older generation who are more into this male dominant thing . So ,sorry your movie didn't make any difference .",

The trailer of Veere Di Wedding looked promising, but when you will leave the theater, you will confused if you have seen a movie or a web based girl drama full of candyfloss, glamour and pep talk. Veere Di Wedding talks about life of four friends - Their relationship, career, love, issues and above all friendship. Directed by Shashank Ghosh, who earlier made a dismal Khoobsurat, Veere Di Wedding is a story full of potholes where you hope things will turn out smooth but unfortunately is mowed down by a weak script and poor direction. In past, Bollywood has given brilliant films on friendship -Dil Chahta Hai, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara or even Rock On but this would have been probably the weakest of all. I did not find any songs that was tuneful which was expected in movie like this. The only silver lining was the performance by the four protagonist - Kareena Kapoor, Sonam Kapoor, Shikha Talsania and Swara Bhaskar, who was the best among them. Overall, it is a colossal disappointment. Avoid at any circumstances. Horrible 1/5Ketan Gupta",

And fortunately i didn't pay for my ticket so I'm thankful for that. 'cause it's just waste of time, brain. You could lose few brain cell after watching this crap.\nActing- kareena kapoor, since she's in this industry for more than 10 years, she knows her way out. But this isn't her best performance, actually not even good. She need to spend more time with taimur so can paid media can let her in the news through him that because after watching this, I don't think that her career is going to step up.\nSonam kapoor, there's no word to describe this penguin. Just born with silver spoon in her mouth doesn't mean you know how to act, you can not act Sonam kapoor.\nMs bhaskar, she's good actress but after her contravarcial tweets about present political conditions, i think this will hit her.\nNow about that fourth girl, shikha, in wake up sid she was good, and this crap, she's decent.\nScreenplay- it's not that screenplay is bad, but it really really bad. I wanted to leave the theatre between interval, but my cousins didn't let me.\nMusic is as usual, bhangda, wedding music. And it's going to played in weddings for next 2-3 months.\nIn my opinion, watch old classics, or sleep for 2 hours in your bed, cause in theatre your gonna do the same anyway.",

One of them sleeps with a random guy called 'Bhandari', she doesnt even know his first name. Excellent performances by #swarabhaskar n #shikatalsania. Hope to see them more often. Kareena n Sonam r okay. The film also teaches parents an important lesson, let kids make their own mistakes. Women should definitely watch it, with or without their men. Rating 3.5/5.",

With all the excitement around the release of this feature, the movie does not even come close to the hype generated by it. What contributes to this mess is that there is not a single stand out performance that could have carried the movie somewhere.It starts off with the four friends discussing their plans after finishing their school played by four highly overacting teens. The movie then jumps 10 years later, where Rishab(Sumeet Vyas) proposes marriage to Kalindi Puri(Kareena Kapoor) who has no plans of marriage but yet reluctantly agrees. Then follows the 'Siyapa' around the big fat Punjabi wedding intertwining with the real life problems of the Veeres.The movie has no real sense of direction with everything coming to an expected happy ending eventually. The characters seem mingled up and a couple of them could have been interchanged. The performances are average while Swara Bhaskar's(the most talented of them all) is a complete waste. 'Veere Di Wedding' is a struggle eventually giving up rather than defying the challenge.",

            "content": "Veere Di Wedding, an all-girl ensemble comedy, by Shashanka Ghosh, had all the potential for being another wonderful film on friendship like that of Dil Chahta Hai, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, but it turns out to be a disappointing take on friendship, life, love, relationships etc. It could have been really a beautiful film, if the focus was on how females bond with one another as well as with the male fraternity, their relationship issues, challenges in lives, their sense of insecurities and of course the girlie-chill-out moments. But Shashanka focused on marriage of one of the protagonists, and touched upon others' marital / single status. The world is changing, girls' lives are no longer revolving around just marriage, there is more to their lives, I wish, these moments were also captured. Even the girls' friendships are showcased at a very shallow level; the depth of female bonding is absolutely missing. Shashanka did try to showcase marital conflicts, gay relationships, parents / elders' conflicts with children, breaking of relationships due to ego hassles, losing trust in relationships due to witnessing failed relationship of parents or in and around. But none of these were handled with depth. The characters certainly seem real with them being dysfunctional, not so perfect; but shallowness in the screenplay did not do justice to the characters. Occasionally it did appear that the film is picking up, but it did not sustain for long. Even the conflicts introduced in the film were not given much attention. Veere Di Wedding misses a great opportunity to be a masala entertainer and a blockbuster.The four protagonists' lives, all four have distinct characters and their own struggles: Kalindi (Kareena Kapoor) is being proposed by Rishabh (Sumeet Vyas) and Kalindi accepting the same after much of reluctance. She is unable to believe in the institution of marriage in spite of saying yes to Rishabh. Shikha (Meera Sood), mother of a child, is still struggling to accept the changes in life, when a baby is born and also struggling to come to terms with the fact that her marriage was not accepted by her family. Avni (Sonal Kapoor), a divorce lawyer, who desperately wants to get married, but finds it overbearing to deal with her mother (Neena Gupta) who keeps on pestering her to look into Bharat Matrimony profiles and to get married. And Sakshi (Swara Bhaskar), who had a lavish wedding but now heading towards divorce. Sakshi finds it difficult to handle the gossipmonger aunties and also discuss with her parents, although non-interfering, regarding failure of her marriage. All four of them get together when Kalindi (fondly known as Kalu) declares her marriage with Rishabh. What happens thereafter, how they stand for one another, how they question one another's belief system, how they hang out together etc. take the story ahead.Certain moments, where the girls hang out together, Kareena's emotional challenges, Meera's carefree performances, Swara's uninhibited orgasmic dialogues and 'i-don't-give-a damn' attitude, and Sonal's desire to get hitched to the right guy are indeed the high points of the film. But the main challenge is that everything apart from this is handled superficially and in a predictable manner. The film had a good line up of supporting casts viz. Neena Gupta, Anjum Rajabali, Manoj Pahwa, Vivek Mushran, Ayesha Raza, Alka Kaushal, Ekavali Khanna, Sukesh Arora, Vishwas Kinni. They were all good with their performances be it Neena's role of a constantly nagging mother, Anjum's character with ego, Vivek's protective behaviour, Manoj's show-off character, Ekavali's bursting out into laughter etc. But these characters are written in a stereotype manner and the sub plots seem forcefully built up.Veere Di Wedding, had the potential to be an unconventional film. The characters certainly seem real with them being dysfunctional, not so perfect; but shallowness in the screenplay did not do justice to the characters. Occasionally it did appear that the film is picking up, but it did not sustain for long. Even the conflicts introduced in the film were not given much attention. Probably the intention was right, that is to come up with a film, where girls have a life which is absolutely liberating for them, but the plot gets contrived, built up and messed up. It misses a great opportunity to be a masala entertainer and a blockbuster.",

            "content": "'Veere di Wedding' is your typical friendship themed movie complete with raunchy dialogues, bold situations, flawed characters, and underlying heart. The only difference is that it's about 4 women. And that's a big difference and a welcome change. Eyebrows were raised when the trailer was released. People (read: men) scoffed at the idea of women behaving in such an atypical manner. I just hoped for a good movie to silence the critics and boy, I should say girl, did they hit the nail on the head.Thank God it wasn't censored! That was the first thought that went through my mind when the veeres started swearing like it was going out of fashion. Nothing is off limits in this movie; the makers aim to shock and scandalize...but you know what, nothing that happens in the movie is actually outrageous or obscene. It's just that we've never seen it shown so openly on screen before. There's a particular scene in the 2nd half that literally had the theatre gasping because we couldn't believe the audacity of the filmmakers. A nervous and appreciative chuckle followed the gasp when we realized that this is for real. I hate to state the obvious but women, like men, swear, drink, talk about sex and almost everything else under the sun. So why the hypocrisy? I'm not going to pull at that thread but I will give major kudos to Rhea Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor for backing this project and not shying away from, like I said, the obvious.Kalindi (Kareena Kapoor Khan), Avni (Sonam K Ahuja), Sakshi (Swara Bhasker), and Meera (Shikha Talsania) are childhood friends who despite the years and distance have remained close. When Kalindi cringingly accepts her boyfriend's proposal the friends come back together to celebrate their veer. Everyone's dealing with something or another but that doesn't stop them from sporting designer outfits, driving around in a Bentley, and going off to Phuket on a whim. I mean it's a Kapoor led film, did you expect anything less? If you don't cry and have a mental breakdown in heels with your hair done up are you really a Kapoor? I think not. Frankly, the characters' problems are superficial, the extravagance is well, extravagant, and the blatant product placement is absurd. But that's the fun of it all. Director Shashanka Ghosh of Khoobsurat fame knows how to keep it light and entertaining. His cast is having a rollicking time and the audience along with it.Kareena is a born star and she knows how to use it. She headlines the cast with tremendous oomph and might I add looks incredible doing it. The new Ahuja and former Kapoor does what she always does. Sonam's outfits are on point and her acting, while not worthy of her former surname, works fine here. Swara has the challenging role in the bunch which she enacts it with confidence and Shikha delivers her crackling lines with humor keeping the audience in splits. A genuine camaraderie between the veeres helps balance the film nicely.There is a clear target audience for this movie. Where else will you get to know what charam sukh is? Everything is mounted glamorously giving the actors a chance to be stars instead of characters. And the music is some of the best I've heard in recent times. This veere's wedding is a blast! Have I said enough ya hor das kiniya tareefan chahidi tenu.\nstuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com",

No, because life and sharing life has nothing to do with gender sentiments. It is about equality in sharing everything.

            "content": "In a modern world full of chaos, Shashanka Ghosh's four protagonists try to find harmony in their relationships, both familial and external. Highlighting their journey through deft realism and contrived drama is what she manages in her comedy drama Veere Di Wedding, after being on a four-year hiatus to mourn the failure of the 2014 debacle Khoobsurat. In a hackneyed story that has been sampled in countless art forms before, Kareena Kapoor plays Kalindi, a young, chic woman who is about to get married to her boyfriend (Sumeet Vyas) of 2-3 years JUST because he proposed to her with a diamond ring. Introspecting her decision through the days before her nuptials along with her equally chic three friends who are confused but more (sexually) frustrated than her, Kalindi fights her familial issues and inner doubts that are mostly triggered by the blanket controlling of her beau's family in everything that she does, including the wardrobe. Director Ghosh should be lauded for crafting an indomitable chick-flick in Bollywood despite the trite nature of the story and the unnecessary hyperbole. For instance, the controversial masturbation scene involving Bhaskar's character is the most unoriginal thing in the film, which makes me doubt both Ghosh's and the writers' (Nidhi Mehra and Mehul Suri) intentions behind making this. There are many more scenes that come across as exaggerated, which although are hilarious, could have been soaked with realism to make the film not look like an exercise in man-hating and namesake destruction of the patriarchy. (Wonder what's the deal here, after the recent Lipstick Under My Burkha (2017) by Alankrita Shrivastava that also depended on exaggeration and far-right feminism!?) Nonetheless, there are a lot of great things to appreciate here: from Kalindi's gay uncles to the incredible performances of Bhaskar, Sonam Kapoor, and Shikha Talsania to the portrayal of men (Vyas's and Vishwas Kini's (fantastic performance) characters) to the free dialogues that bring out the best in the film. It's a well-made film even if we disregard the conspicuous and therefore poor placement of ads in the film for HSBS, Uber, and Gulmohar Lane. Plus, if you notice, all the books (in the bookshelves) in the film look irritatingly unnatural. I'm a 100% sure that these books were borrowed in bulk from a nearby sale (those 300 rupees per KG book sale shops that have cropped up these days) and stashed in the shelves because never have I seen the books of Bill Bryson, Wilbur Smith, and Danielle Steel in a single room; it just cannot and should not happen. What an amateur work by whoever designed the production set. Enough with the digression; Veere Di Wedding is overall a good effort for a comedy chick-flick and surely paves the road for more such films. Regarding it as crass just because you don't get the point that Ghosh tries to make makes you a hypocrite. TN.",

Its highly impressed by Sex and the City. Kareena certainly not at all looking from the same age group as being played. She seem pretty tired and without any energy in the movie.\nSo if you want to see extra display of cleavages you are in for something beside that a pretty boring movie.",

This movie is not the picture that many share in India but certainly a change the existing state of affairs.\nNot certainly the cast and direction are superb. Swara with her new look is fascinating, Sonam with her innocence and Kareena with her independent thought all are enough to win hearts. Many myths and notions are broken through this movie. \nThis shows the way film industry is taking turns to experiment with portraying the rapid changes in society. Good one overall.",

My only complaint is that the climax could have been a little better shedding some light what happened after the wedding.

But she's shamelessly defended and hailed as a brave lady.Moreover the voice-over by one of the mothers is cringeworthy. This film preaches dependence and glorifies peer-pressure. It teaches women to constantly justify themselves or their choices to their friends. It teaches burdening others with your problems, when nobody can better understand your issues other than yourself. It indoctrinates a culture of dependence.They also shamelessly glorify the Indian tendency to spend exorbitantly on weddings, even when you cannot afford to do so. That's the sick culture this movie preaches.Don't be fooled by the outwardly feminist coating. It's just a sham to lure modern audience into this highly regressive propaganda. It's shown as a high-minded \"chick flick\", a hip take on female bonding: but it shows no respect towards women.It just deteriorates into a cheap pastiche of idiotic lives.True empowerment doesn't come from blindly following others. True empowerment comes from freedom of choice.",

It was a portraiture of a group of girls from well-healed families, who are just frank and want to enjoy life. \nOn a serious note, it peeles off layers of our society to show what exists but is not visible, or talked about. \nYes its very bold from conservative Indian audience perspcetive.",

I feel sorry for Neena Gupta,a vetran & talented actress had to be part of this garbage. This isnt women empowerment, its just showing Indian women in bad light and giving men more reasons to abuse them and say 'No wonder she got raped!' Poor script, dialogues and horrible male actors... Its 0/10 and i feel sorry for the critics in India who gave them 3/5 for this movie... the only thing they excelled in was the marketing skills they used to promote this movie, that skill deserves 10/10... they definitely knew how to get people in theatres to waste their hard earned money..",

            "content": "Veere Di Wedding (Veere - Friends in English) is a female-led adult comedy-drama film directed by Shashanka Ghosh.The film follows four happy-go-lucky childhood friends Kalindi (Kareena Kapoor), Avni (Sonam Kapoor), Sakshi (Swara Bhaskar), and Meera (Shikha Talsania); who are now grown-up and engaged in their own lives. Until one day, when Kalindi decides to get married to her long-term boyfriend Rishabh (Sumeet Vyas). Now, Avni, Sakshi, and Meera must reunite to participate in the celebrations of Kalindi's big marriage. Rest of the film follows the fun ride of ups and downs through which all these friends must go to find best in them.The film, at its core, talks about the importance of having friends and families in life, and the little moments of joy and fights which they share with each other. The film also discusses the significance of appreciating good things while accepting the flaws and moving on. Besides, the film is also filled with swear words, slapstick moments, and some hilarious one-liners, and it hold back on nothing. The film is hilarious in a first half, and in the second half, it goes for some deeper character arcs. The aspect of friends and family dynamics had already been explored in some really good films, so nothing new to serve in this one, but characters are refreshing and alive, plus the flavor of adult comedy.Verdict : It's definitely not the best film but a good one time watch.",

Bollywood rarely produces movies where women are the target audience so most of the time people are stuck watching lewd 'item numbers' and beautiful, helpless airhead women with no purpose other than being the love interest in a man's story where she is only expected to be sexy portrayed in the the movies. This movie gave female actors character and important roles. Also, India is a super conservative country and the fact that they at least brought out some of the least discussed issues out in the open is a big deal. Change does not happen overnight. Now that these issues have been brought under the lime light, other movies can begin to address them and finally step by step lead to equality.",

Successfully showed we are not perfect, it's okay to make mistakes and we learn from it. And it's okay for women in today's world who are taking in so many responsibilities and roles to seek their sexual pleasures and happiness in life without any fear or ridicule. Put the double standards of both men and women in it's place. The movie and characters are based on 'Sex and the City'. \nWhat I disliked however was the use of extensive foul language. That I guess is Hindi cinema overdoing things and creating steoretypes. Using foul language does not mean you are liberated, intelligent, independent person - be it man or woman. All vulgar language displays is lack of elegance, classiness. It shows only craziness and a cheap upbringing. So I wish Bollywood stops portraying this message that only hurts liberated women and distracts you from the real theme and meaning of the movie.",

            "content": "As a woman born and raised in the western world I expected to be entertained by this chick flick, particularly as Ive enjoyed Hollywood offering in this genre like Clueless and Legally Blonde.I completely acknowledge that the Indian film industries do not have a lot to offer in the way of female centric films and even fewer examples of what would be termed as click flicks. This film fails to deliver as a traditional chick flick or even as a comedy. People unaccustomed to American cinema may find that the film works in terms of its \"shock value\" including curse words and \"liberalised values\" such as smoking / drinking. Firstly smoking and drinking excessively are no longer cool the world over. I wonder why Hindi films in particular are fixated on smoking for example. Not only is smoking known to be extremely harmful but fewer western people are actually smoking these days (especially in England it's seen as pretty uncool and antisocial to smoke) - people saying the characters have \"western values\" are certainly ill-informed as these are not western values at all and certainly not values you'd want to ape. Secondly the film simply isn't entertaining. Agreed that some of the clothes look good and maybe the rich lifestyle paints a picture of aspiration for some Indians, but that isn't enough to redeem a film.\nMore work could've been done to establish the chemistry between the leads which I think wasn't convincing enough. It was loud, brash and for something wanting to be different, extremely stereotypical!\nI expected to have fun and was unfortunately let down.",

Be Rooted: However much one may be sophisticated, donning the luxuries and living in the upper spectrum of the society, one must always be desi in thy taste. Like digging into our desi brands Amul Ice-Creams, Bikaji Bhujias, and uttering only sadak-chaap gaalis. \n2. Live Life king-Size: Splurge in the designers outfits, make impromptu international-travel plans, take bikaji along, dip into the infinity-pool, slosh away your worries with friends.For everything else there is HSBC credit card. Apply for it.\n3. Don't Worry, Be Happy: Every character in the movie seemed troubled except the one and only one Carefree- Underdog-Chichora, 'Bhandari', who has all the fun throughout. Give-a-Damn, Care-a-damn!\n4. Keep making mistakes: Even if it causes lifetime addiction.\n5. Vocabulary Improvisation: Did you know words like 'Veeres', 'Wast Delhi', ' Charmsukkh' and many such frivolous ones before?.. Must learn coz knowledge is power!",

Just a story of four women who face life as it comes. Let's celebrate friendship and be there with each other when we need them the most. It also teaches you to celebrate imperfections and refrain from labelling anyone.Music blends so well into the movie. Each song has something to say, there is something for everybody. The sangeet song #PappiLeLoon being my top favorite! Lots of EDM, Rock and Funky Dance numbers to keep you grooving.There is not a SINGLE dull moment in #VeereDiWedding! Tight screenplay, hilarious dialogues, unfolding of drama, casual flow of narrative, performance by each and every side cast, all these pluses make the film almost a perfect watch.Every action of these four amazing girls, be at the wedding or the vacation, will be RELATABLE AF with the girls. You will know when you see it. These are happy, self-independent, financially secure urban, stylish women trying to sort out personal situations & be friends with life as it is.There is no scope of vulgarity (except if you consider cussing as vulgar, which was shockingly allowed in UAE cinemas too for a change). We do cuss in our everyday lives and it was shown as it is in the movie as well, I see nothing wrong there.Veere Di Wedding wasn't trying to prove to be anything in the first place that it deserved the negativity it did on Social Media. Don't like it, don't watch it, let others do!My Favourite characters: 1) Sonam Kapoor - I never thought I did say this but she is extremely cute and adorable when her character is very very confused and cute (very unlike herself), smooth yet strong and holds her base right in whatever she is asked to do. 2) Undoubtedly Kareena Kapoor had to have the maximum screen time. The SUPERSTAR is back with a Bang! A very mature, smart and restrained performance. Kudos!STAY AWAY from the movie if you are one of those who get easily triggered by just seeing HAPPY women on the screen! For the rest of us who love Bollywood & love to keep personal ideologies separate from the films we watch, have an amazing time at the theatreLet's all be PRO-CHOICE & let everyone survive in the eco-system. It is OK to have flaws & it is OK to be what you want. \nI may just watch Veere Di Wedding again with my other girl-gang and I am totally vouching for a sequel alreadyRating: 4/5\nBOOK YOUR TICKETS NOW!",

They say that the movie doesn't really empower girls, there's too many advertisements and etc. Here is my take on Veere Di Wedding.It wasn't a competition when the women were smoking or masturbating, like 'guys smoke and masturbate so we will do it too'. No. It's because these things have been a taboo for too long in Indian society. More and more girls know now that it isn't shameful to share the same habits and desires as men. That it's completely normal. This film was telling females that it's alright to do all these things, showing that in reality, women also like to smoke and drink, they like to masturbate and they also like being single. In most Bollywood films (not all) this side of females is perceived as too vulgar and unconventional to be shown in films. Of course not all Bollywood films misrepresent women. We should be celebrating the fact that we have a film where the heroin doesn't need a hero to rescue her. This is our version of 3 Idiots. Let us have this. It doesn't have a life-or-death scene, a saving of life, or golden moments of mad creativity. But we do have friends who fight amongst one another, get together again, help each other out in their worst days, and we do have relationship and family problems. \nThe complexity of human emotions and relationships is not fully illuminated, if all sides have not been portrayed in equal light...",

VDW gets the core of breezy group friendships right and doesn't delve much into life stories as its depth lies elsewhere. The awesome foursome glide in tandem taking us on a rib-tickling, racy and memorable adventure instead.Freely living in their space without filter, we have seen these girls in real life but they have been missing from Hindi cinema. A young mother needs to party hard; a bride demands a drink to ease her stress; a single girl leads a kiss because she is horny; a woman screams expletives into the phone. No judgment. No justification, aid or loophole either. Wow. Like, really. Wow.When I go to watch Biwi No. 1, I don't expect Masoom level of nuance. Similarly when I go to watch Veere Di Wedding, I don't expect Lipstick Under My Burkha. Having said that VDW will connect with more women purely because within that genre they have socked convention out the park. They have basically managed to pull off a Rajkumar Hirani I would say. :)Not every venture featuring lead women actors needs to bear the burden of being chick flick or feminist. There is a commercial place between frivolous and serious which can still convey an important message by just being. This is that.Director Shashanka Ghosh and writers Nidhi Mehra and Mehul Suri do an outstanding job with the storytelling, script and dialogue and this is where true gold is. An ordinary story turns extraordinary with mundane scenes that knock Hindi cinematic boundaries subtly and beautifully, boldly touching upon and normalising aspects of female sexuality, motherhood, marriage, and single life. Commitment issues in a woman, check. She races into a toilet at the mere thought of marriage before saying yes, the audience I am watching it with goes into double splits. Perceptions of motherhood, check, check. She vomits a mad, drunk night into the toilet pot as her two-year-old cutely imitates \"uwooah\". More amused women in the cinema. Masturbation, check, check, check. She is gadget-happy, nothing comes between her and a good time. Giggles and laughs. A man who has different views of wife vs. girlfriend, check, check, check, check. She calls him out pronto, and finds a man who doesn't. The Nirmal and Bhandari characters elicit the right responses from women.The lives of Kalindi (Kareena Kapoor), Avni (Sonam Kapoor), Sakshi (Swara Bhasker) and Meera (Shikha Talsania) unfold in an OTT Delhi wedding setting which works like a charm. Especially with the banter and colourful vocabulary. The girls meet after 10 years for Kalindi's wedding. With dysfunctional families in the mix, life's complicated while they are caught amid the flamboyant and hilarious celebration prep. All that jazz does happen for real, complete with a couple mounted on a fake moon and a wedding scene with varying degrees of flashiness. So it gets both the Delhi wedding culture and sarcasm down pat.Kalindi fears marriage even as she accepts boyfriend Rishabh's (Sumeet Vyas) marriage proposal. Their relationship is captured well. Everything is right and yet external pressures weigh on them. Avni struggles with the lows of single life, a pushy mother completing the picture. A suitor tanks and a fling soars who she judges rather unfairly. Only she gets over it, unlike her male counterpart Nirmal. Sakshi is battling a separation from her husband, trying to steer her mind away from the final decision by having a good time partying. Happily married to American John (Edward Sonnenblick), Meera is having body image issues after the baby.The choreography is excellent, mapping the comical wedding dances and the friends' emotional journeys. Music is racy and blends well with the grandeur, despite varied composers. Shashwat Sachdev composes the loony Pappi Le Loon (Sunidhi Chauhan, super), crazy Bhangra Ta Sajda, peppy Bass Gira De Raja and the melancholic Aa Jao Na. White Noise creates the quirky Laaj Sharam and Vishal Mehra the lovely title song Veere and lively Dagmag Dagmag. Qaran's Tareefan is s..s..super sizzling.The editing by Shweta Venkat Matthew is meticulous, crisp and in tune with the entertaining and warm tone. Sudhakar Reddy Yakkanti's cinematography is immersive.Performances are above par, across the lead and supporting cast. Neena Gupta (Avni's mother) is graceful, Anjum Rajabali and Kavita Ghai (Kalindi's father and mother) are effective, Ayesha Raza and Manoj Pahwa (Rishabh's mother and father) are rollicking. Alka Kaushal is perfect as Santosh Aunty. Vivek Mushran (Cookie Chacha) and Sukesh Arora (Keshav) rock as an everyday gay couple (sans usual mannerisms).The few good men supporting the women are talented. Vishwas Kini makes Bhandari likeable and balanced despite the initial creepiness. Edward is earnest as the quintessential husband. Sumeet Vyas is A-excellent and holds his own splendidly opposite Kareena. They are quirkily flawless as a pair.KS3 are electric and magnificent as buddies. They nail the Delhi banter, camaraderie, body language, chemistry, insecurities, parallel long-distance lives and naughtily push each other's buttons.Kareena Kapoor is exquisitely understated, lending calm and charm to Kalindi. Her eyes do most of the talking. Sonam Kapoor makes Avni delightfully goofy, correct and heartfelt. Watch her regal stance when she interacts with the brazen Bhandari. Shikha Talsania's Meera is sweet as sugar and mad as a hatter as the need arises. Her mother dairy act is effortless and sparkling, she delivers some saucy lines with deadpan relish. Swara Bhasker's Sakshi is the knockout performance in technique and spirit. The masturbation scene will etch her name in history. She's the real bro, effortlessly wild and cool.Rhea Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor, heartfelt gratitude, words are not enough to convey my joy. Thank you for Veere Di Wedding and for not screwing it up. (Except, do go easy on the product placements next time and be confident your movie will earn its own money.)It is six on five for the VDW team. The one extra is for educating us urbanites on what an orgasm is called in Hindi. Khh baby khh. Send your thinking brain on a vacay to experience the joys of this Charam Sukhh.",

Curiosity drove me to the nearest multiplex where preparations were going on for the wedding of Kareena, aka Kalu in the movie, while her BFF, poor Swara Bhaskar is hanging on to a dreary marriage. By the way, if Kareena is Kalu, then I am the darkest shade of Black. I am a great fan of Swara Bhaskar; she effortlessly faked the often faked gasps, moans and the ecstasy.Having paid for the movie tickets with my HSBC credit card, I immediately felt connected watching Sonam Kapoor and her girlies using the same card; on multiple occasions. Watching them board Air India reminded me of my bland maiden flight to Mumbai in a lusterless Air India vimaan. Their presence glamorized the otherwise unstimulating government airline. Apart from Kareena, Swara, Sonam, Shikha and Sumit Vyasa the movie also featured Uber, Bikaji, Amul, Videocon, Air India, HSBC and a few other brands that the poor me couldn't identify.Veere Di Wedding is definitely not a chick flick. It's about woman empowerment; her pleasure lies in her own hands. Glorified.",

To be honest the film was just boring, I feel like they were trying to make a modern film like zindagi na milegi dobara, well they needed a better storyline and director. I don't think any of the cast were at fault really, but the group of 4 girls didn't have much chemistry as a friendship group.
