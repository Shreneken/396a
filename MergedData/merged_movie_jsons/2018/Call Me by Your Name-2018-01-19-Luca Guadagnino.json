            "content": "There were many scenes in this movie that stuck with me, most of which have probably been discussed to death (the dad, the peach, the sheer pleasure of sitting around reading, swimming, and doing whatever you want unsupervised).I think as an American, one of the things that stuck to my bones was how the parents reacted to their son's sexuality. I don't mean his homosexuality. I mean, sexuality as a whole. Despite most of the key characters being American, they all have a European sensibility that it very rare to see here in the US. One could argue that the movie itself could be making a social comment about open, honest European views of sex vs. moralizing, restrictive American views.First, the parents see their son is attracted to a man, so they do things to help facilitate that attraction by giving them the idea to travel alone together. They also let Elio and Oliver have their space in the house - they aren't monitoring Elio or \"checking up on him,\" which I found refreshing.Second, the parents are genuinely always there for Elio in helping him discuss sexual relationships. He is able to say to his parents out loud, \"I could never be that open,\" a vulnerable statement I have trouble imagining ever having expressed to my parents. They simply reassure him; they don't nag or moralize him about sex. Of course, there's the scene with the father discussing his own sexual past and desires, openly and without judgment that exemplifies this behavior.Third, the adults in the movie treat Elio respectfully with regards to his sexual encounters. For example, when Elio greets the older gay couple with Marzia and quickly gives her a kiss and loving pat, the adults simply maturely greet her and say hello. No one says \"Ohhhhhhh! You have a GIRRRLFRIENND!!!!!!!!!\" In the US, I find it typical that adults make teasing comments and condescending \"jokes\" about \"how cute it is to have a crush\" to teenagers. This moralizing can make teens internalize that they are doing something wrong, when they are actually doing something natural.To see adults treat Elio respectfully and collegially, like a mature young adult for whom sex is one of many natural, positive experiences, filled me with hope, jealousy, and a strong feeling about the kind of parent one should be when one has teenagers. It's not very common you walk out of a movie thinking, \"This movie has changed or informed the way I want to live my life\" but this one has for me.Last, I think we are in a particular time where we are really looking back on the 1980s with a specific nostalgia for a time when kids could just be kids, ride their bikes everywhere, have adventures, be home for dinner, then go out again and have more unsupervised adventures. Stranger Things, It, and this film all are really tapping into that nostalgia, albeit in slightly different ways.The music in this movie is what I can only describe as beautiful, Sufjan's songs in particular stand out as incredibly moving. Visions of Gideon is an absolute soul crusher. The music added to the atmosphere of the movie, which was so warm and peaceful. It was so refreshing to see a movie about two men in a relationship that didn't end with one of them dying or angry parents, nothing of the sort. Time is the villain here, and I think that makes it all the more tragic.",

            "content": "Saw 'Call Me By Your Name' as someone trying to see as many films from 2017 as possible, because same sex love has been portrayed beautifully more than once and because it was one of the best received films of the year with a lot of award attention as we speak.A distinction more than well deserved. 'Call Me By Your Name' is certainly one of my favourites of a pretty hit and miss 2017 (with some great films, bad films and films in between and near but not quite both extremes) and, like another gay love-themed film from 2017 'God's Own Country', one of the films of the year that really touched me. It is much more than just a \"gay movie\" and shouldn't be dismissed as just that, that on the most part it hasn't is a good thing. 'Call Me By Your Name' is most striking for its emotional impact. The erotic elements are tasteful and sensual, but it's the relationships that are even more beautifully done. The subject matter is handled with subtlety and surprising wit and the central relationship is tender and compassionate with a little tension. Just as, even more, impressive is the father and son relationship, which was sincere and touching, again with just as much burning intensity, and boasted the film's most powerful scene. The joy and pain of love and desire is portrayed in a way that really touched my soul and comes over as surprisingly relatable.The acting is another big strength, advantaged by that the characters are interesting and not stereotypical with conflicts that are genuine and not predictable. Timothee Chalamet is especially remarkable and has a great future ahead of him if he continues in this direction. Armie Hammer is hardly inferior in perhaps his best performance to date, a very sympathetic performance which helps make the central relationship as powerful as it is. Michael Stuhlbarg also should be highlighted, a very wise and sincere performance and he has never been this poignant.Luca Guadagnino directs beautifully, bringing the best out of his actors and the gorgeous scenery just as gorgeously shot. The sincerity, wisdom, compassion and wit of the source material is ideally captured in the script and as indicated the film looks great. The music has whimsy and understatement which suits the story perfectly, and while the pace is Merchant/Ivory-influenced-like deliberate it never felt dull to me due to being swept up in the emotion and being riveted by the writing and performances. In conclusion, a beautiful film with much more to it than what it can easily be dismissed as. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer give remarkable performances. There is a great chemistry between them. The charming landscapes, the good soundtrack and the delicate direction also contribute to this achievement. I like the way homosexuality is portrayed: being gay is normal; there is no drama queen and no pathos. This is a touching story that makes me want to fall in love.",

            "content": "Chiron, in Barry Jenkins' Oscar-winning film \"Moonlight,\" in addition to being gay and black, has to deal with drug abuse, bullying, and the lack of a supportive home environment. In contrast, in Luca Guadagnino's (\"A Bigger Splash\") achingly beautiful Call Me by Your Name, 17-year-old Elio's (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \"Love the Coopers\") life is safe, comfortable, and surrounded by love though, like Chiron, he must come to terms with his true identity. Written by three-time Oscar nominee James Ivory and adapted from the 2007 novel by Andre Aciman, Call Me by Your Name is set in the summer of 1983 where Oliver (Armie Hammer, \"Free Fire\") is an American research assistant studying with art history Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg, \"Steve Jobs\") at Perlman's gorgeous villa in Northern Italy.Oliver arrives at this idyllic setting with its gardens, peach trees, and lakes to greet the professor, his wife Annella (Amira Casar, \"Planetarium\") a lover of German poetry, and his teenage son Elio who speaks several languages and transcribes piano scores for the guitar. Shot by Thai cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom (\"Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives\") and buoyed by new songs from Sufjan Stevens, it is easy to feel yourself present in the languid summer afternoon, as Aciman expresses it, \"with the scent of rosemary, the heat, the birds, the cicadas, the sway of palm fronds, the silence that falls like a light linen shawl on an appallingly sunny day.\" With Oliver's arrival, Elio now has to shift his focus from pursuing his French girlfriend Marzia (Esther Garrel, \"Daydreams\") to show the American student around town and give him bike tours of the area. Soon, however, he becomes annoyed by the American's brusque manner and his abrupt \"later\" whenever he's leaving. When Elio, who is Jewish, sees Oliver wearing a Star of David on a chain around his neck, however, he finds a common bond, jokingly telling him that his mother considers their family to be \"Jews in discretion.\" Sharing the same bathroom, their friendship begins to expand when they engage in conversation and go swimming together. Although Oliver gives Elio a neck massage during a volley ball game, the boy seems unable or unwilling to process the feelings that it brings up in him.When Oliver causally tells Elio that he seems to know everything, the teenager confesses that he knows everything except \"what really matters.\" Even when physical intimacy is established, there is the sense that they hold back from fully expressing their feelings and even prefer not to talk about them. Chalamet, in his first leading role, is a revelation, delivering a deeply affecting performance that shows great promise. Hammer's performance is restrained, but also fully believable, making sure that the age difference does not get in the way of the honest and genuine relationship they have established. As they strengthen their friendship, like lovers, their identities blend into each other and they express it verbally by taking each other's name. Call Me by Your Name is not an \"us versus them\" movie. There are no antagonists in the film. It is a celebration of love in all its wonder and mystery.There is gay sex in the movie but, like \"Moonlight,\" it is about more than sex. As Guadagnino says, \"it is about compassion, trust, and wisdom.\" All three of these values are expressed in the conversation between Elio and his dad, an interchange that is moving and wise. Though the film is \"gay-themed,\" Guadagnino does not pigeonhole the characters into familiar categories and his refusal to deal in stereotypes or manufactured emotion gives the film the space to breathe and reach the place where tension can grow. Like \"Moonlight,\" Call Me by Your Name has a universal appeal and can touch anyone, gay or straight, who has ever felt the confused and conflicting longings of first love, or who knows from experience that, in the words of the song \"Plaisir d'amour,\" \"The joy of love is but a moment long. The pain of love endures the whole life long.\"",

It made me think and remember summers of my own life. It made remember sounds and smells. I was transported. The smartness, candor and gentleness of this unexpected love story goes beyond anything I've ever seen. Luca Guadagnino is rapidly becoming one my favorite directors working today. Armie Hammer completely demolished my preconceptions with a performance that is total perfection and I haven't mention Timothee Chalamet yet. No I need to dedicate the lasts paragraphs to him because his performance goes beyond perfection. I didn't know him at all. Now I' a fan. It reminded me of the first time I saw Daniel Day Lewis playing a gay punk in \"My Beautiful Launderette\" An explosion of beauty when you least expected. Thank you for that.",

He had a similar experience but a very different outcome and it made me think with a broken heart that if my friend had had a father like Elio's father he could have had a real chance at a happy, constructive life, instead of the agonizing pain that he went through. I hadn't though about him for years and Timothee brought him back to me with enormous power. What a beautiful, beautiful performance. Armie Hammer is a total revelation, the perfect foil for a first love. Michael Stuhlbarg introduces us to a character I had never seen on the screen before. He moved me no end, Then, of course, Luca Guadagnino. My hat to you sir. This is a film I will see many times.",

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name is the kind of movie that makes you sit through the credits with tears rolling down your face, staring blankly at the screen with a lump in your throat and tightness in your chest. Call Me By Your Name is not a tragic movie. It's not a sad movie. It's not a pretentious movie. It's a movie about love, and love, and love. A beautiful love that will leave you longing to find your own love and drown in it. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is an absolute force of nature. Elio will make you want to love, and hurt, and piece yourself back together with absolutely no regrets whatsoever. Elio will make you want to live your life to the fullest. Elio will make you want to break your own damn heart. It's so rare that a performance truly shows the depth of longing, and despair, and passion a character conveys through written words without the internal monologue. Timoth\u00e9e is truly a revelation and his last scene during the credits will have a lasting impact on everyone.Armie Hammer is absolutely brilliant in the way he humanizes Oliver who is somewhat glorified through Elio's lens in the first part of the book. In the movie, Oliver is endearing and human and sexy and caring. He cares for Elio, and his love for him is so tender and so touchingMichael Stuhlbarg's monologue delivered nearing the end of the film is a complete masterpiece, and without a doubt that monologue with be taught and quoted for many years to come. A raw and beautiful scene.Watch this movie. Watch it, and love it, and don't let it fall victim to over-hype. Watch this movie. Fall in love in two hours and twelve minutes, then question every single time you didn't allow yourself to feel just because you were afraid of getting hurt. Was avoiding a possible heartbreak that might have shattered you worth never getting a taste of the heavens? Was killing the potential pain and heartache worth it? Was it worth it?",

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name is one of those films which doesn't feel like a film but rather a journey of self discovery which we witness and feel as if it's happening at that exact moment.Call Me By Your Name is the story of two people, Elio and Oliver, who fall in love over the course of the summer.This movie brings one of the most beautiful relationships ever put to film. The way writer James Ivory and director Luca Guadagnino portrayed this story felt so real and in the moment. Not even for a second does it feel like you're watching actors playing these characters because of how well everyone played their roles and the excellent direction by Gaudagnino.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a force to be reckoned with. This man displayed such raw and tender emotion as Elio that it's impossible to think that Chalamet is acting. He is essentially our main focus since we see him learn more about himself and his sexuality as the film goes on. Elio is a character that you connect with and actually care about. He will make you feel a whole bunch of emotions as his character develops and grows.Let's not forget how terrific Elio's other half, Oliver, played by Armie Hammer was. The chemistry between these two seemed so genuine that you instantly root for both of them being together. The love and sweetness Oliver gives to Elio is something that can't be found or forgotten easily. There's something so sincere and authentic between these two that just makes tears stream down your face like a running tap. If there was one thing that I would've liked more, it would be learning more about the character of Oliver.This movie isn't your typical love story filled with obstacles and conflict. This is one that celebrates the ideology of LOVE and shows it in a touching and emotional way. By the end, there will be nothing else but sniffling and tears throughout the end credits. This film conveys one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful relationships the world has ever seen.",

            "review_title": "A Cinematic Classic",
            "content": "How can any review rightfully describe Call Me By Your Name? I had the immense privilege of seeing it at Sundance before 99.99% of the world, so now I am one of the select few in charge of p(r)eaching the gospel that is Call Me By Your Name. This film is simply a masterpiece, possibly the best romance film of all time, and one of the best films of all time as well.The plot is basic, but it is how the story is told through the actors, the imagery, and the music where the film shines. The son of an academic (Elio, played by Timothee Chalamet) falls in love, perhaps hopelessly, with a visiting student (Oliver, played by Armie Hammer) who is staying with his family \"somewhere in northern Italy.\" Almost all reviewers will describe it as a gay romance, some will say it's just about two people falling in love (and they will get criticized for trying to downplay the sexuality of the characters), but at its core it is about two people who fall in love with one another but have difficulty realizing that the other feels the same way. It is a universal film about love, sensuality, longing, and being true to oneself.While most romance films are unrealistic, melodramatic, or otherwise uninspired, Call Me By Your Name is anything but. The first hour is tension-filled with innuendo in the actions between the main characters and the other people in the story that realistically captures the delicate dance involved in flirting. The passion that develops is palpable, with some of the best love scenes to grace the cinema - complete with the awkwardness involved. The ending may be predictable, but how everything plays out is a masterclass of film-making. The final monologue between father and son towards the end will be the highlight for most people. Michael Stahlbarg gives a breathtaking performance as he calmly provides his son comfort, but most importantly, acceptance. However, the emotional peak of the film truly comes at its end, with a haunting final shot that will stay with me forever. Timothee Chalamet is a revelation and is destined to become one of modern cinema's finest actors. Armie Hammer finally has a role that allows him to shine. While many will be surprised at the casting on paper, it is a testament to the actors that you can truly feel the passion between their characters so much that the pairing feels like destiny. Call Me By Your Name is a moving film that stays with you, leaving a dark depression for days that arises not from what happens in the movie, but how it is shown. It is so beautiful, but heart-wrenching at the same time, that it reminds us how amazing life is despite that our desires are not always, if ever, truly fulfilled. The film teaches the viewer important life lessons that have already deeply impacted me as a person and how I intend to live my life. The central question it asks is best summarized through a question asked by a character in the film: \"Is it better to speak, or to die?\" After the film, one can only leave with one logical conclusion: To speak, because to die, is to die without ever knowing the answer. And for Elio, regardless of how the relationship ends up (see the film!), at least he knows the answer.",

I've read a few comments questioning why Elio would fall for the conceited and arrogant Oliver, who wouldn't fall for Armie Hammer, he truly does have film star looks, and true presence.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet came to my attention in Dune, and I am super excited to see more of him, I knew he was good, I see here that he's immensely talented, his acting is phenomenal, even learning to play the piano, and some Italian for that part, he is superb here.Hammer plays the part well, Oliver is of course conceited, but it's that aloofness, that unobtainability that makes him so attractive.It isn't hard to see how and why the awards rolled in for this film, a gay romance would never have gotten into a mainstream film such as this a decade ago.It's an impressive movie, 9/10.",

That's because it's one of the most subtly affecting and beautiful love stories that I've seen in years. A low-key pace and a sumptuous musical score build the film to a conclusion that is truly flawless.The story is of a young American graduate student who stays with a professor in his country house in Italy in the summer of 1983 and slowly develops an intimate relationship with the professor's precocious 17-year-old son. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer are both brilliant in this film as the two who find companionship in an unexpected place, and Michael Stuhlbarg is wonderful as the professor. The young man and the teenage boy do not interact much at first, mostly because the young man appears detached and unresponsive. But I would be loath to reveal too much after that. Let's just say it's a film that one should absorb slowly and let its quiet power take hold. It's a film that truly captures some wonderful truths about the human condition, about the emotional toll of relationships and about how much one's secrets shape one's dynamic with others.In terms of cinematography, there is much of the Italian countryside to marvel at. It makes that country seem like one of the most blissful and sublime places in the world to visit. History buffs and linguists will find some welcome material in the professor's dialogues with his graduate student to enjoy. As quiet and austere as the film may be at times, it contains a deeper passion that gradually gets tapped into and colors the mindset despite the taboo nature of the material. Never long or protracted, it will keep you guessing until the end and just leave a haunting feeling after it's over. Gladly recommended to anyone in search of true cinema.",

I'm just going to start by saying that this is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen in my whole life. There are so many factors that play a central role in my final judgment, and of course I'm gonna analyse and talk about them, but being an italian boy who grew up in southern Italy, there are a lot of references that make this movie a masterpiece.As in every movie ever made, detail plays an important role, if not the most important one. I'm not going to talk about every single of them but I want to share the feelings they made me feel and talk about their actual importance. From the languages spoken, the music, the fabulous landscapes, to the interns of the house, the floor, the very old forniture, the books.. all things that bring me back to my childhood and make me smell again the pleasant atmosphere of my grandparents' house. From this point of view, the cinematic representation was completely accurate, and I'm very sure this process was also helped by the director himself, and his italian memories.Let's spend some time talking about the actors' performances. Timoth\u00e9e delivered his best performance so far, no wonder why he was nominated at the Oscars. He really dove into the character, and I can say that if I watch the details of his facial expressions. The details made me feel even more connected to the character, who slowly evolved through the course of the movie.\nEveryone was phenomenal in this movie, from Armie Hammer to the fantastic Michael Stuhlbarg.This movie can rapidly become very very personal, and it touches your soul. It did it to me. There are some things and feelings that unfortunately can't be explained. It was an amazing experience. Definitely steals a place in my top 3. I think the movie is perfect.

            "content": "I finally saw this Oscar nominee (just one week before the award show!) and I was so disappointed - it was long, slow, and not very romantic. And I don't think a director should get any credit for making Italy look beautiful! Apparently in the book, Oliver is 24, but Armie Hammer is 31, and he looks it, and his age is rather distracting because the relationship borders on inappropriate already, but those extra years make the relationship even less appealing. The men take forever to connect and it's not like you're really rooting for them. Elio is a spoiled brat who spends most of his time glowering at everyone. He even expresses his desultory attitude to Oliver in an early conversation - he clearly has no idea how privileged he is, to lounge around Italy all summer, doing whatever he wants, unaccountable to his indulgent parents. As an audience member, I wasn't very invested in his getting his supposed heart's desire. Nor did the men have much chemistry. Oliver says late in the movie, \"I love the way you say things.\" I thought, what? How many conversations did they even have? Mostly they road bikes, and went swimming, and laid in the grass. Elio's father speech, which so many consider a highlight of the film, I found contrived - like what the writer imagined his father would say, or what he wished his father had said - about how pure his love with Oliver was. I have seen many films that I think portray that first love experience in a more compelling way for the audience (I would strongly recommend Beautiful Thing if you're a fan of this genre). I gave it 5 stars for boldness and great performances. The very best movie of the year? Um, no. I was expecting something much more charming and moving.",

            "content": "I loved \"A Bigger Splash\" (the previous film by Luca Guadagnino,) and was in awe by the trailer and stunning reviews for this film. Needless to say, my expectations were utterly shattered by this powerful, emotional, and gorgeous drama. It's one of the best films of the decade, and clearly the best film of the year so far.While this isn't the type of film with too many spoilers, I still don't want to give too much away. It's better to go into such a sublime film like this knowing less rather than more. What I will say is that the main plot concerns an adolescent man who is spending a summer in the 1980's with family in Lombardy, Italy. He begins having a relationship with an older man invited as a guest by the family played by Armie Hammer. The film's pacing is superb and lets the viewer genuinely meet these characters, who are bonded by both friendship and physical affection. This is clearly shown throughout the movie, as the chemistry between the two leads is excellent.But what makes \"Call Me By Your Name\" such a phenomenal film is its gripping sense of feeling. Viewers truly feel that they are away from where they are viewing the film, and truly feel like they have been transported to 1980's Italy. Guadagnino is a masterpiece at eliciting senses, and the audience's sense of senses are used to full effect to simulate the true feelings of being in Italy. From luscious depictions of peaches and apricots grown in the countryside, to the streets in gorgeous Italian towns and the steamy espresso, every sight and sound in the film feels truly authentic and impactful on the viewer. I have not seen such an effective use of reflecting on audiences' senses to create a more immersive viewing experience in a film in years. The film's score is exceptional as well. It feels authentically Italian and beautifully emotional, especially when paired with the film's script in many scenes. The writing feels both authentic and intelligent at all times, and the film doesn't even manage to let its guard down in a single scene by failing to grip the viewer with its beautiful script. A late-film monologue by Michael Stuhlbarg is a particular highlight.As one can see from reading this review, this film is truly unforgettable and a brilliant trip to Italy. Its immersion in its setting and characters remind us of the focal point of cinema: to expose the viewer to unique settings and opportunities and to transport them to these opportunities through the language of film. Recommended to the highest degree. 10/10",

The phenomenon that is Chalamet was yet unknown to me, and Hammer I'd only seen in a bad chickflick, so it would be an understatement to say I was pleasantly surprised by how they performed.\nThere's so much detail as well, from the inquisitive and knowing looks of a mother, to the picturesqueness of a ladder against the fruittree. Everything about this film draws you in. If I could dream up memories of a hot Italian summer in a rural hamlet, this would be it, I swear I could almost smell and taste this film. Luca Guadagnino made a masterpiece here and I highly doubt it will ever be surpassed in its category.",

The Adele Excharpolous \u00e0 la Blue is the Warmest Color of the year. His eyes are so expressive and every emotion and action is so deeply felt by this poor tortured soul that by the ending you cannot help but weep and feel at the absolute lowest you've ever been.Armie is portrayed to perfection, as well. His \"later\" and other phrases stand out so sharply in a world of prompt and prim dialect that it makes us feel engaged in a way that I've never felt by a movie. He was such an outsider and yet we were assimilating to his was as opposed to the way it should be. He, a guest, in Italy, for 6 weeks, leaves just as American as the day he arrived.Luca's obsession with men dancing and swimming pools and beautifully choreographed sex, is perfect for this story. I cannot think of a better match. Luca said in the Q&A afterward that he decided to change a few things from the book because not everything written in prose works on screen in a cinematic way, and if you've read the book, you will agree. He also said the author, who makes a small cameo in the film, thinks Luca's changes are better than the original form. So, that's affirming.Peach scene? Devastating. Sufjan's new songs? Devastating.This was a very sad movie but I loved every second. Let's hope Suspiria is even better. Luca G. might be the most exciting director working today. It was a privilege to watch this with him and the amazing cast and crew INCLUDING Sufjan. I hope Sony Pictures Classics doesn't mess up the distribution/awards campaign. This deserves praise.Also, 10/10 opening credits/font. Luca can do no wrong.",

I read the book when it came out; I am a gay man; I love films about love relationships between beautiful men; I love films with bits of European languages and lovely European settings; I am 'pro' art house films which are all about characters and take their time. But this didn't work. Firstly, it was really too long. But my main problem was that the relationship between Elio and Oliver just didn't ring true. OK, a few small things happened between them which could have been seen as sexual (e.g. the shoulder massage), but they were both busy doing things with women a lot. Nothing wrong with being bi! And Elio is meant to be young, finding himself etc. But one day, he suddenly says to Oliver that he needs to tell him something, and Oliver says he knows what it is - but there really hasn't been enough evidence of that building up. I do realise that reading an article about Hammer which said that he had a clause added to his contract restricting the amount of sex and nudity he would be expected to do - well that made me struggle to see sincerity in his acting. Chalumet on the other hand is a great discovery. The way he holds a close-up all through the closing titles, showing a range of emotions, is very impressive indeed. I can remember so clearly what it was like at 17 (OK yes, 50 years ago) to kind of enjoy feeling sad and then elated about love and sex, and Chalumet shows that brilliantly. But he is not enough to save this film, and nor is the man playing his father, who does such an excellent job of channelling Robin Williams.",

            "review_title": "Luca Guadagnino's tender film fills the senses",
            "content": "Luca Guadagnino is one of our most sensual filmmakers. CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, like his previous A BIGGER SPLASH and I AM LOVE are filled with scenes touching upon all the senses. Guadagnino gorgeously captures images of beautiful objects, locations, books and, of course, the pleasures of the flesh. His soundtracks are filled with the sounds of nature as well as overflowing with music (usually classical, but, with more modern nods to the Rolling Stones and the Psychedelic Furs). His characters luxuriate with the smells of food and they caress the world around them.It is within that world that screenwriter James Ivory (adapting Andr\u00e9 Aciman's novel) places our main characters seventeen year old Elio (Timothy Chalamet) and twenty-something Oliver (Armie Hammer). Every year, Elio's parents Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Anella (Amira Casar) invite a research assistant to their idyllic villa in Northern Italy. In 1983, that person is Oliver, an American who sweeps into town with his good looks and cool persona. Oliver simultaneously attracts the attention of the ladies in town - as well as Elio. Complicating matters is that Elio is also having a summer romance with a young Parisian Marzia (Esther Garrel).While on the surface, this may seem like a simple potboiler, Ivory, Guadagnino and the cast gracefully ease the audience into the tale. The film takes full advantage of the 132 minute run-time. Nothing is hurried. No shortcuts taken. The emotions are given time to build organically. It's like a lovely concerto that plays out to its own meter. The pacing may be too languid for those who demand a more forceful drama, but, CALL ME is a film to soak in. To luxuriate within. The subtext and the atmosphere not only inform the main story, they become part of it. By the time Elio and Oliver's infatuation is consummated, you have fully invested in them.CALL ME is deliberately set in the early 80s - just as AIDS was becoming a concern, and, of course, long before coming out was accepted. And, some may find the idyllic setting a bit too perfect. Hammer's performance is a bit too flat at the beginning, but, pays off as it progresses. Chalamat (also strong in the current LADY BIRD) brings off the extremely difficult task of externalizing what is largely and internalized character - simmering until it boils. Stuhlbarg is largely a background figure for much of the story-line, but, is sterling in one of the film's key scenes. Guardagnino's choices of music is impeccable (including pieces by Bach, Revel and Satie) and Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's 35mm film lensing captures every moment exquisitely.On the surface, a collaboration between a sensualist like Guadagnino and the reserved James Ivory (as in Merchant-Ivory) may seem a bit of a mismatch, but, it works beautifully. Together (with the cast & crew), they have created one of the year's most indelible films.",

            "content": "I guess watching this film is fairly different for people who have read the book by now, but for me, this film is highly disappointing and, occasionally even disturbing. First of all, the cast for Oliver character is deeply problematic. Not because Army Hammer is a bad actor. On contrary, I think he is all right in general. However, the role simply does not suit him. Oliver should be just a few years older than Elio, while Hammer looks like (at least) 15 year older than a younger actor, and on the screen there is a striking encounter of a grown up, bored older man seducing a half his age ( and still under age) boy. That is a disturbing dimension of the film that probably does not strike in the book, but it attracts too much attention in the film, and looks disturbing. Second, all the other characters in the film, apart from the main two, are so underdone, ridiculously superficial, with bad directing and bad acting, that it is very very difficult to imagine such a situation: everything is set up for two main characters to engage in the affair, nobody around them matters in any way, they can do whatever they want, and everybody is just a background to their situation. Well, that does not happen in real life ever. The most weird part is the act of Elio's parents, especially father. In general, both parents look like they enjoy bringing some pretty \"assistants\" to their house, practically inviting them for a holiday, with pretext that they need \"a help with research\", and then the whole family, friends and neighbors flirt with this assistant, waiting to see with whom he or she will be having an affair. That is how it looks on the basis of what is shown. During all this time with Elio's family, Oliver behaves as if he is on vacation, going around full of himself, showing his body, kind of flirting with Elio's parents, and everybody else, while his parents deeply approve everything he does or says, like he is a God, although he is supposed to be \"doing some work\", actually. The most ridiculous figure in it is Elio's father, who looks like a sad comedian who is dying to catch Oliver's smile, in spite of being a middle aged professor happily married with a beautiful wife. His wise words to Elio in the end confirm his own more then obvious homosexuality, and even his \"envy\" of his son affair with another man, which is really more then weird. Likewise, it sounds weird when the parents announce in the end that now they will be choosing a new \"assistant\"for the next summer who will be a woman, so we can clearly imagine an attractive older woman coming now to seduce Elio again, under the watch of his parents, of course. I am sorry, I am not really comfortable with all that, that all looks a bit sick, to tell the truthIn sum, film is more like a prayer to the lust and superficiality, adoration of pure form and vanity, than something deep. The boy is not coming of age in some authentic way, he is more being a good boy doing just what his parents expect from him, no matter how strange it is. There is no a real message in this film.",

            "content": "Luca Guadagnino made quite an impression on me as a filmmaker with A Bigger Splash, a film that combined an engaging narrative with some fantastic performances. With his latest film, Call Me by Your Name, Guadagnino certainly has the potential to repeat the trick and deliver more of the same.When Oliver (Armie Hammer), a graduate student, arrives to stay with the family of his professor in northern Italy, he meets Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), his professor's son. What follows is a summer full of music, food and romance that will forever change their lives.Rather impressively, Luca Guadagnino follows A Bigger Splash with just as an engaging film however, he shows a much softer hand when dealing with the sensual nature of a film such as Call Me by Your Name. It truly is a beautiful piece of cinema, Guadagnino's direction of the intimate coming-of-age narrative being a real triumph.There's some genuinely fantastic dialogue included in the screenplay written by Guadagnino, James Ivory and Walter Fasano. The subtlety of the comedy is great but it's the poignancy of the words when relationships come into play that will stay with the audience, particularly a moment shared between Elio and his father towards the end of the film. It's silently powerful stuff.Coming to the performances, Call Me by Your Name features two leads in Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer who share such a natural and fitting chemistry. It felt much like that shared between Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara in Carol, effortless and becoming much more impactful as a result. Chalamet in particular has a very bright future ahead of himself. There's also a fine performance from Michael Stuhlbarg as Elio's father to look out for, balancing the comedy and emotion expertly.I expect people to make comparisons between Call Me by Your Name and Moonlight given the nature of their subject matter however, I'd rather not see people try and play them off against one another because they both deserve such high praise. Being in the company of such a film is a major achievement for a film like Call Me by Your Name.",

            "content": "\"Call Me by Your Name\" is an hypnotically beautiful coming of age drama that surpasses the clich\u00e9 of the 'queer film' as overwrought naval-gazing depression fantasy full of sleazy sex, instead celebrating the intoxicating passion of youthful love with tender sensuality. Set in 1983, it details the sexual awakening of a precocious teenager named Elio, who is besotted with the arrival of a handsome older student, Oliver, who comes to stay at his family's pastoral Italian villa for the summer.As they both lounge listlessly in the sun-drenched Lombardian countryside, swimming and cycling to coffee shops, the first half of the film dances an artful choreography of stolen glances, innuendo and mixed signals as the pair try to work out where the other's feelings lie. When the two finally realize their desire for one another and become lovers, it is with the bittersweet understanding that they must part ways at summer's end, when Oliver returns to America. This is the only real source of tension in the story. Despite Oliver and Elio's discretion in their affair, there is no obvious homophobic backdrop or bullying influence around them. Indeed Elio's cultured, cosmopolitan parents are both very thoughtful and accepting people, even hinting to Elio quite early on that he can speak to them about anything. So how does a film with no major conflict keep us engaged and invested in the relationship? By making us fall in love with it. Luca Guadagnino's entrancing direction lowers the defenses with a languid pace and indulgent cinematography that soothes and seduces. The atmosphere is heady with the carefree exuberance of youth which we so long to experience again. This is the summer we wished we had. At times it seems almost absurdly idyllic; The cynic in me was ready to scoff at the hyper-sophistication of Elio's wealthy, scholarly, multi-lingual family who spend their time discussing politics, citing poetry and transcribing Bach. Elio's teenage friends seem to be comprised of a posse of French and Italian Lacoste models. You might think who could possibly relate to this? Nonetheless I was gradually swept away by the blissful escapism, almost feeling like I was there at times.The cast are all superb. Armie Hammer, while looking a bit older than his character's 24 years, is such a commanding presence as Oliver, with his statuesque good looks and resonant voice. He gives him that strong, confident worldly charm that is so instantly beguiling to young Elio. Michael Stuhlberg and Amira Casar as Elio's parents are benevolent, nurturing forces. But the true standout here is Timothee Chalamet. With his big soulful eyes he navigates all of the complexity of Elio's emergent feelings, imbuing him with a feline sensuality one minute and naive emotional fragility the next.The scenes of sex are not gratuitous, with the director choosing instead to focus on the erotic build up, the playful kissing and teasing, the tender touches. It all feels so honest and natural, two characters just completely being themselves and loving one another for it. I was completely enthralled by Oliver and Elio's relationship, and found myself sad to not have experienced one just like it. I also couldn't help but be sad as I contemplated the tender transience of youth, for which the peach is a symbol. By the time the heartbreaking final scene rolled out I was sobbing, full of nostalgia for my own teenage years, the time I wasted and chances not taken.Go see this film and allow yourself to feel.",

There were aspects that I disliked, but they were ultimately outweighed by the things that I found absolutely brilliant so I think the rating of 8 is well deserved, especially because movies that handle gay love respectfully are still way too rare.I think the overall \"carpe diem\" message of the film was wonderful. I loved and was moved to tears by the monologue by the father in which he tells his son what too many parents would not. I also thought the acting by the boy could not have been better. I have never seen a more impressive and realistic end titles scene than this. I also adore that this movie realistically shows that love is not only beautiful but also true at 17, regardless of age gap. Gay or straight does not really matter.Where the movie disappointed me is in the way the relationship was built up and how both characters betrayed their own feelings (which rang unreal to me). I understand the struggle of the man to hide his feelings, but very little of that showed. I was also hugely disappointed in the ease by which the man flirted with the girl. I personally find it hard to believe that someone would betray a current love that way. Similarly, I found it unbelievable that the boy would make out with a girl on the very day his dream might come true. And then the way that the man announces his marriage and having had an \"on and off\" relationship. That ultimately made me feel that the man's love wasn't as sincere as the rest of the story made it out to be. And thus that the relationship might have been manipulative after all.But then again, perhaps that was the objective... to show that life flashes by and that even this imperfect beauty is worth every moment and too often shut out. In the end, the movie left me feeling deeply sad. Perhaps especially because it touched home with me, having experienced an impossible love at the same age.",

To put as simply as I can, the film perfectly captures its setting and atmosphere in a way few films do. The biggest credit needs to be given to director Luca Guadagnino, who is able to capture the smallest of details. Technically, the film is a marvel and I struggle to think of one flaw. It's beautiful, sensual, luscious in its execution, with absolutely marvelous pacing. In terms of pure directorial achievements, it's definitely one of the best of the year. The performance of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is also a pretty perfect portrayal of the character in the novel, and a completely internal performance that is reminiscent of Rooney Mara's wonderful work in Carol. Armie Hammer is also quite strong in the role, although it's a tricky character to get completely right. The novel is told completely through Elio's eyes and so we only imagine and see Oliver from a distance. He's more of an enigmatic figure in the novel than a real, tangible person. So much of that is due to the writing and the way Elio sees him as, so in terms of difficulty, I can imagine how Hammer had quite a task on his hands. Due to the literal nature of film, it's a type of character that always had to lose some of its mystery to its translation from the page, and it's as good one as can be. I have so much I want to say about this but still can't find the right words, but the one thing I will say is that while the story here is pretty simple, the film really does capture, more than any other in recent memory, the feeling of that fleeting force of love and passion that can come to define one's life. It does so in a melancholic, beautiful way that makes it stand out from others of its kind. I can see why some people wouldn't take to it (and in fact the almost-unanimous positive reviews surprise me) because at the end of the day, the technical aspects work to create a film that can only be defined by a feeling that some people will experience watching the film and that others won't. All that sounds incredibly enigmatic, but it's a difficult feeling to pinpoint and considering the film, I think it's fitting.",

            "content": "Luca Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name is the third in a trilogy which includes A Bigger Splash, a decent potboiler of sorts also set in Italy and starring English speaking actors. The film is based on the 2007 novel of the same name by Andr\u00e9 Aciman. James Ivory (of Merchant/Ivory fame) wrote the screenplay.The story is set in the early 80s and is superficially reminiscent of Bergman's \"Through a Glass Darkly\"; both films deal with 17 year olds hunkered down with their families at summer retreats. That's basically where the comparison ends. Minus, Bergman's adolescent protagonist not only must resolve his relationship with a distant father, but also address the haunting and troubling split he feels between mind and body. On the other hand, Guadagnino's 17 year old, the Italian-American (and Jewish) Elio Perlman (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), a fledgling composer and music transcriptionist student, suffers from no Bergmanesque qualms of the psyche. Instead, it's all about issues revolving around his sexuality; specifically, his affection for Oliver (Armie Hammer), one of Elio's archaeologist father's (24 year old) research assistants, who shows up as an invited guest of Elio's parents for a six week stay at their very comfy villa in the North Italian countryside.A number of critics are so enamored with Oliver (i.e. Hammer) that they liken him to the Greco-Roman sculptures he's studying under the tutelage of Professor Perlman. There's a mildly interesting excursion that Oliver takes with the good Professor where an ancient statue is dredged up from the ocean and Oliver has some fun playing around with the statue's truncated arm. Much less interesting is seeing Elio enraptured as Oliver eats a soft-boiled egg with the yolk gushing out as this is supposed to be some kind of big sensual event. Ditto for Elio's attempt at self-gratification by slowly sucking on a peach. This is a film that is virtually devoid of conflict\u2014unless you consider Elio's inner confusion as to whether he really wants to get involved with the older guy as a mark of some kind of tension or (dare I use the word?\u2014suspense). In the end the suspense amounts to the consummation of the couple's physical relationship and how unerotic that moment is (Guadagnino cuts away to a tree, seen from the bedroom window!). Jordan Raup writing in \"The Film Stage\" somehow is impressed by the \"mutual yearning\" of Elio and Oliver. He cites the scene of their visit to the local town, with Elio informing Oliver that this is the site of one of the most deadly battles of World War I. Instead of a complex interplay between conflicting personalities, Raup settles for an idyllic image of a gay romance\u2014likening this inconsequential dalliance to the passion of soldiers involved in a life and death struggle: \"In an unbroken shot, they walk around opposite sides of the historic site, revealing as few words as possible about their heart's desires. In between this division there's the history of thousands of lives that have been lost, each with their own burning passions.\" What crap!Worse yet is how the critics ignore the fact that this is an underage boy being taken advantage by an adult. The age of consent might be lower in Italy, but it still seems highly inappropriate that a research assistant is trying to have sex with a juvenile right under the eyes of the boss's father. But Peter Dubruge writing in Variety seems to be alright with all this. He acknowledges that \"this seductive outsider correctly anticipates that anything physical that might happen between him and Elio will have a lasting impact on the young man's sexual identity.\" But Debruge seems to be impressed by how \"the pair brazenly peacock for one another, parading around shirtless and leaving the doors to their shared bathroom ajar \u2014 an improvised mating ritual echoed by a low insect buzz that fills the soundtrack.\" Debruge describes the relationship as a \"deliciously tentative courtship dance\"\u2014instead of what it's legally referred to in the United States today: statutory rape.In a sense, Guadagnino doesn't really have to offer up a narrative replete with both multi-dimensional characters and conflict. Instead, the \"courtship dance,\" the lugubrious exchange of intimate gestures, appears to be a reaction formation to gay bashing. The idyllic picture of intimacy between gay lovers is designed to reassure the public that gay people are not only capable of great intimacy, but are entitled to it. Despite Guadagnino's denial that Call Me By Your Name is not a \"gay\" picture, it fulfills its function as a propaganda (or agitprop if you will) for the gay pride movement.This is borne out by the Elio's permissive father who goes way out on a limb with a long-winded speech to his son, approving of his sexual experimentation with the older partner. The morality is questionable given the ages of the parties involved, but the bigger offense is an aesthetic one: where is the conflict? The father approves, the \"boys\" are \"hot\" for one another, and despite the wistful, melancholy ending marked by the end of Oliver's vacation (and subsequent call to Elio with the news that he's getting married), nothing much happens between the principals at all. Unless of course a beautiful Hallmark Greeting card is your idea of compelling, realized cinema!",

            "content": "'Call Me by Your Name' is a film about LOVE. Its also a film about being who you are. And Writer James Ivory & Director Luca Guadagnino bring us a tale on young romance & living life, with honesty & the emotional impact akin to a sledgehammer. And Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is the find of the year.'Call Me by Your Name' Synopsis: In Northern Italy in 1983, seventeen year-old Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), begins a relationship with visiting Oliver (Armie Hammer) , his father's research assistant, with whom he bonds over his emerging sexuality, their Jewish heritage, and the beguiling Italian landscape.We've seen love-stories before on Gay people, but not all leave the impact like 'Call Me by Your Name' does. This is an honest love-story about a boy and a man, who can't help but fall in love with each other, despite never coming to the world of their sexuality. And the way Director Luca Guadagnino has shot its leading lovers, is something to watch. There is genuine heartache in its characters & also undeniable love. This is a love-story, that's sad but also heartfelt at times. James Ivory's Screenplay is expertly written, offering a story on love & longing, without ever indulging into melodrama. Luca Guadagnino's Direction is simplistic, but extremely effective. Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's Cinematography captures the passion of its leading lovers, with gusto. Walter Fasano's Editing is mostly crisp. Art & Costume Design merit a special mention. Sufjan Stevens's Score is superb.Performance-Wise: Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is truly the find of the year. The youngster delivers a searingly beautiful performance of a young man who comes to realize his sexuality to a much older man. Chalamet brings nuance & innocence to the part & stands out from start to finish. He's truly one actor who deserves strong Oscar buzz for his excellent work here. Armie Hammer also does his best work here. He and Chalamet share a infectious on- screen chemistry, that appears real & affecting. The Wonderful Michael Stuhlbarg is masterful as Chalamet's dad, who understands his son beyond his silences. Watch him in the penultimate moments & you'll know his caliber as a performer. Amira Casar as Chalamet's mom, also is lovely. Esther Garrel as Chalamet's girl, with whom he experiences sexual episodes, is fantastic.On the whole, 'Call Me by Your Name' leaves a strong impression. Make time for it.",

Scripted by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME has all the rich texture and subtlety of a 'classic' Merchant-Ivory production. It's 1983 and 17-year-old Elio Perlman (Timothee Chalamet) is spending the summer at his parents' house in Northern Italy. A hunky American graduate (Arnie Hammer) arrives to help his professor father with archaeological research. Elio develops a crush on the charismatic Oliver who, reluctantly at first, reciprocates. A summer of intense passion is bound to have a short lease as Oliver has to go back to the States.The two leads give deeply felt performances and the spirit of the 1980s \u2013 musically and morally \u2013 is delicately evoked. Elio's dad (Michael Stuhlbarg, a near double for Robin Williams), supportive and non-judgmental, is the dad any gay teenager would yearn to have.Cinematography and the music score are superb. At two and a quarter hours the movie is a tad too long and slow to take off, but the intensity of this love story exceeds GOD'S OWN COUNTRY and is very much the equal of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The mood reminded me very much of Joseph Losey's THE GO-BETWEEN (1971). A movie not to be missed.",

THE WORST.Here's some highlights of the problems: 1) While this film takes place in Italy, Oliver (an American) is committing Statutory Rape by having sex with Elio. Why does no one in any of these reviews have a problem with this?? The kid is 17 years old. He's not an adult, he's not fully mature (obviously). It's like James Ivory (the writer) and Luca Guadagnino (the director) just had to make some soft core porn -- without the nudity. This is self-indulgent filmmaking at its best.2) Story / Plot: There is NONE. Forget it, don't bother looking. The kid develops a thing for Oliver, they have some sex, Oliver goes back to America, the kid pines. The End. Need a sleep aid? Put this snoozer on. Zzzzzz.3) Cinematography: Way, way too many shots that just go on forever, with nothing happening. For example, the scene where the kid plays with the peach? As soon as he digs a finger into the core, we know he's going to screw the peach. But we have to watch him mess with the peach and then eat a bit of it, and mess with it some more, for what, 4 minutes? And then he finally masturbates with it. Jesus. That scene could have been 1 - 2 minutes, NOT 5 minutes!4) Relationship: Sorry, I just didn't buy the relationship between Elio and Oliver. I blame the writing mostly for this. Ivory's script is a piece of sheet. Horribly written, and the directing is horrible too. The actors had no chance of saving this movie. Plus, the director did not direct the kid well. His performance was not strong -- despite the praise some are heaping on him.5) The parents: Nowhere in this movie was there any indication whatsoever that the father knew what was going on. Out of nowhere, at the very end, the father has \"words of wisdom\" for his son, and says \"What you had with him I've never come close to having.\" WTF? Seriously? How would he know? And how would he know this was better than the relationship he has had with his own wife? This is like the Deus Ex Machina that comes in at the end to wrap things up & put a ribbon on the story. Pulllleease. And of course, if the father knew this much older man was having sex with his 17 year old son... why would he condone this? I'll tell you why. Because James Ivory wrote it this way and Luca Guadagnino shot it this way, regardless of reality. They're being self-indulgent and who gives a damn about story logic?I reiterate: One of the worst movies of the year. Don't waste your time.",

            "content": "*****This review may contain spoilers!!!!*****I have just finished reading the book. It is deeply moving. I am still in a daze. Heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. The film adaptation is erotic, cinematic, well acted, and painfully beautiful, as Luca Guadagnino's other film, I Am Love (starring the luminous Tilda Swinton). What makes the theme universal? To my eyes, it has to do with the complex issue of love and loss. The film and the book deal with love/loss not in the simple sense of losing the person we love, but in the sense of deliberately losing the person we love so we can sustain loving and desiring the person. \"I can't love you unless I give you up\" could be the line (not from the book or film) that captures the relation between Elio and Oliver. Both Elio and Oliver maintain the minimal distance between them instead of fully committing to their desire 'til the end. Which makes their love the sad kind. As Elio said, \"Time makes us sentimental.\" The right time never arrives for Elio and Oliver. They relate to each other from the lenses of the past (\"pluperfect\" love, to borrow Elio's wording) and the future. It is never now. The thematic is appealing because it speaks to many of us who have loved and continue to love on the basis of the fundamental loss at the heart of desire. Is there a way out of this spiral? Is there another way of approaching love? These are questions the book and the movie leave the reader/viewer to answer. The ending is unhappy yet \"satisfying\", precisely because this satisfaction involves a mix of hope and agony. It keeps the movement of desire in motion, for both Elio and Oliver, and for the reader/viewer. PS: I can't help but reflect on this great film vis-\u00e0-vis Guadagnino's another great film, I Am Love, where the two protagonists literally leave their respective worlds behind to be in a world that they both share.",

He's a grad student assisting professor Perlman over the summer in the 80's. The girls are all taken with handsome Oliver including the young son Elio Perlman (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet). Elio is enticed by Oliver as his friend Marzia also gets closer to him.It's a film about a young gay boy's emotional first love. There are things that do pull me out of the movie. The first problem I had was that I assumed Marzia to be Elio's sister. It's connected to another problem. Marzia should be a bigger character. She's the pawn in their love chess game. She should start much more as a girlfriend leading to a more heated conflict. There may be a deliberate move by the movie to take the dramatic conflict out of this gay love story. It becomes more of an emotional drama for better and for worst. The other problem is that Oliver does not appeal to me. He's the preppy guy from an 80's teen dramedy. It's not the most endearing. Sometimes, that character can gain depth by going darker but that would be creepy in this case. It also threatens to be that older guy seducing a young boy. Don't get me wrong. There are some very touching emotional takes. The father's talk after Oliver's departure is very sincere and the last scene with Elio's tearful closeup is very emotional. I am taken with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and his youthful charms. I'm less taken with Armie Hammer. He continues to perplex me as an actor.",

            "content": "Not to single out this particular premise, but films revolving around gay couples have been terrific over the last decade or so. There was a spark when 2005's Brokeback Mountain was released, which eventually brought us to foreign films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour being nominated for a Golden Globe or Moonlight winning best picture at the Oscars. Call Me by Your Name is the latest film to probably receive many nominations in the coming months, and believe me, the praise is not false. Being a fan of 2015's A Bigger Splash, I was looking forward to Luca Guadagnino's follow-up feature film, and I believe this to be an improvement in the best ways. Exploring the hardships of life and what it means to just kick back and relax every now and then, Call Me by Your Name is a film that's been sticking with me since my viewing of it. While it admittedly won't be able to draw in everyone to the theatres, here is why I believe this to be a fantastic, award-worthy picture.Written by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, Call Me by Your Name follows a family that lets Oliver, an older graduate student, live in their home for the summer. While this is a common thing, what's not too common is that Elio, their son, will eventually grow romantic feelings toward this man, convincing him to become his lover for the summer. From the age gap between them and having to hide it from the family, their situation isn't an easy one, nor will it be for some audience members, but it really is a wonderful story. This is easily a story that could've stirred up controversy if it hadn't been done with taste, and because of how it was made, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This was made entirely possible by the incredibly devoted performances by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer.Hammer has had his ups and downs through the years, appearing in Oscar-winning films as well as some of the worst films of the year, so his performance here was the most shocking to me. Yes, he's been talent in nearly everything he's been in, but he really gave his all in this performance and I honestly don't think he'll ever be better than he was in Call Me by Your Name. On the other hand, young Chalamet has a very bright future ahead of him. Being a relatively new actor, his chemistry with Hammer was impeccably astounding. Their relationship took a while to grow on me, but once it completely won me over, I found myself wondering if there was anything to really complain about.If I had to complain about anything, it would be in its extreme pressure to try your patience. There are very long sequences of silence, making you relax and take in either a romantic moment or the scenery around them, which I also found poetic at the same time, so I actually have trouble coming up with issues, but I have to admit that I did find the movie slow at times. Yes, it's meant to be slow, which is why that complaint isn't exactly valid, but I just have to be honest.In the end, this is a truly remarkable piece of dramatic filmmaking and there are some very memorable scenes that keep replaying themselves in my head. One scene in particular that involves Elio and his father Mr. Perlman (played magnificently by Michael Stuhlbarg) toward the end had me in tears. From the brilliantly written screenplay, to the poetic cinematography, to the terrifically calm direction, Call Me by Your Name isn't a movie that I would send the average moviegoer out to see, but if you're a hardcore film fan, I think you'll end up loving this movie.",

            "content": "Adapted for the screen by James Ivory, Egypt-born Andre Acimen's 'Call me by your name' has already been nominated for countless awards as best picture, best actor or best supporting actor if not best screenplay or best director.The setting is summer, 1983, somewhere in Northern Italy. The camera of director Luca Guadagnino captures wonderfully the luxuriant landscape of place rich lush in greenery, water flowing with abandon in streams and pools; the air is light and bright with sunlight.Guadagnino's camera eye is on Arcadia: poetic in images as he evokes a poetic fantasy, a pastoral paradise, and at any minute, we expect the Greek god Pan to gambol and frolic with abandon.The cinematic ambiance is thus set to arouse gratification of the senses esthetically and more especially sexually\u0085of a highly passionate kind.The Perlman family welcomes a summer intern from America, Oliver (Arnie Hammer), to help Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) with his research in Greco-Roman culture.The Perlmans are Italian Jews who wear Judaism discreetly, no outward distinguishing them from their neighbors. There is Arnella (Amira Casar) wife and mother, an accomplished linguist from whose lips fall Italian, French, English and German. And Elio (Timothee Chalamet) a precocious boy musically gift, speaks Italian, French and English effortlessly, and to whom girls are attracted. And it is not without a sense of irony that Arnella quotes and translate Goethe who in his letters and poetry had his own love affair with Italy, as a traveler from abroad. The stage is set for the Sturm und Drang of a short love affair.And into this household Oliver enters , for Elio, like a summer storm, aroused as he sexually from quiescent desires he never knew.Oliver wears his Judaism openly, as the gold Star of David he wears around his neck, as easily as he wears his privileged self-assurance as an American. Carefree, he mingles effortlessly; flirts with no physical exertion with women and is larger than life mixing with the village men who drink and play cards, He is a graduate student preparing for medical school and in a sense, internship with the Perlmans is his last taste of youthful freedom.Elio instantly drawn to Oliver slowly discovers that Oliver casts his desires on Elio with an intensity Elio has for Oliver. And into this garden of Eden that Guadagnino that creates for a summer affair between the 24-year old American and the 17-year-old Italian.A bittersweet love that declares itself in the cool mountain springs, the verdant hills of Northern Italy and in the bed.The pursuit and enjoyment of physical pleasure is fostered by a tolerant, cosmopolitan ambiance that dwells in the Perlman family. It is further accentuated by the father's passion for Greco-Roman art, as well as the discovery in a lake of a Roman copy modeled on the muscular nude body of Hermes of the greatest 4-centurry BCE sculptor Praxiteles in all its grace and its raw masculinity.And this theme is an echo of the love physical and romantic Elio shares with Oliver.Summer's over; Oliver leaves never to return. Elio confesses to his father his affair with Oliver. And the professor admits that he and Elio's mother suspected all along the passion Elio had for Oliver, and more to the point he and Arnella tacitly approved as Elio sexually awakens.Professor Perlman confession may win Stuhlbarg a nomination for best supporting actor; he acknowledges to his son that he too knew a similar passion he himself stifled as a youth. (Does this explain his own youthful suffering in the study of Greek art that his son has lived in his love for another man?) Oliver telephones during Hannukah, the Jewish festival of lights commemorating the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem after its defilement by Persians.A small festival of renewal and Elio takes it as a fanning the embers of Oliver's love for him. It's not for Oliver will marry soon and never return.The camera catches Elio crying silently before a blazing winter fireplace, realizing the Oliver was sowing his wild oats and has in his mid-twenties has conformed to the social and sexual norms of heterosexuality, even though he calls Elio by his own name and Elio responds with Oliver.Elio feels betrayed and the lights of Hannukah cast a long shadow of a sadness and sorrow and a finality. As the camera fades, we know Elio with bear existentially a deep scar that will never heal as long as he lives.Overall, esthetically 'Call me by your name' is wonderfully cinematic. Sensuous and sensual in the way its capture nature's seductiveness and the passions that it can arouse in man or woman. And in this manner, it is profoundly romantic in nature. And may very well earn the accolade of 'new classic' and among the very best films.And yet, Hammer and Chalamet as Oliver and Elio are the least attractive and sexually appealing protagonist. The spark and fire between them is absent. Would other actors portrayed these two characters better, we cannot say. The die was cast when they were chosen, but they remain spiritually and emotionally empty.",

            "content": "James Ivory's screenplay for Call Me By Your Name brought home Oscar gold for\nthe film. It's a beautiful gay love story of two young men set and photographed\nbeautifully in the 80s in Northern Italy. The scenery alone is guaranteed to\nbring out any romance in your soul.Professor Michael Stulberg and wife Amiri Cesar have invited a young teaching\nassistant Armie Hammer to live with them and work on some excavations of\nrecent artifacts. Living with them is their most precocious and brilliant 17\nyear old son Timothee Chalamet who got an Oscar nomination as Best Actor.\nThe two of them have and do explore the opposite sex, but before the summer\nis out they can't deny the physical attraction.Chalamet is as another reviewer said just completely beyond perfection. He's\nthe ideal twink boy who might have been your first crush. He's fortunate he\ncomes from educated parents who recognize what he is and let him go his own\nway. How insightful they are we find out at the end.The rest of the characters outside of these four are as much background as the\nscenery in northern Italy where the story takes place. The story just lasers right in on the family quartet. Watching the family dynamic as the parents\nrelate to Chalamet you also get sad when you realize how many uneducated\nones who were brought up to hate and fear gay crush the spirit of the Chalamets they bring into this world.The story ends on a sad note, but it also leaves open the plot elements for the\nsequel already in the works.Call Me By Your Name also got nominated for Best Picture and for Best Original Song. It certainly has joined the pantheon of great gay cinema. I\nhope the sequel is just as good.",

All of the performances were really solid, in particular the lead character played by Timothy Chalamet was a truly unforgettable performance which will stay with for a very long time, perhaps forever.The story is often over-simplified to one of love/lust between the two male leads but there is so much more to it that that. It's about self-doubt, self-discovery, self-identity and how those are all wrapped up in those around us and how those we care about view us. The setting and world this film creates is like a wonderful, sun-drench postcard come to life in the best way possible. It's a complex story beautifully expressed in this film which I consider necessary viewing.",

            "content": "I've wanted to see this movie for a long time, so I was happy I finally got a chance. Most of my friends raved about it, although a small subset hated the movie. I wasn't sure what to expect. After half an hour, I began looking at the time, wondering where this over-two-hour movie was headed. I turned it off after ninety minutes and finished the final forty the next day.Okay, so non-spoilers first.The scenery is stunning. The cast, for the most part, is excellent. I agree with the hype surrounding Timothee Chalamet. He gave a breakout performance as Elio, and I also enjoyed the father and the entire extended family. I did not enjoy Armie's acting or the fact that he looks almost a decade older than the 24-year-old character he's portraying. I did not feel any chemistry between Elio and Oliver. Ever.The pacing of the movie is terrible. The director seemed so captivated by the Italian countryside that he felt compelled to dwell on the vistas. There's one scene where Elio and Oliver ride their bikes down this long winding road, and the camera just stays on the shot forever. Far too many scenes like this pad the movie and do nothing other than make the movie way too long. Long shots can sometimes create atmosphere, but in this film, they create boredom.I couldn't help but compare this to the movie Under the Tuscan Sun. That movie is also set in Italy, but it spends a lot more time focused on the characters instead of the views. When they do show the views, they are stunning but short.Spoilers begin.As I mentioned earlier, the chemistry between the two leads is non-existent. Oliver comes across as pompous. I never once bought into any flirtations between the two. When they finally admit to having feelings for one another, it comes from nowhere. If you plan to draw out the \"will they won't they\" for half the movie, the audience should be anticipating when they will finally connect.The often discussed peach scene came across as a total LOL moment for me. Then when Oliver came in and tasted it, I wanted to throw up. The movie had many of these cringe-worthy moments.And that brings me to my primary gripe with this movie. If you replace Elio with a girl, would this movie get the praise? Given the visible age difference on screen, would people be applauding a 17-year-old girl that looks 12, hooking up with a guy in his visible 30s? It all came across as highly inappropriate.Lastly, the dad's big speech at the end, although poignant, seemed rather misplaced. The dad basically said, \"I'm so glad you hooked up with this much older guy who came here to work for me. Cherish that.\" And then, months later, when Oliver calls to announce he's engaged to a woman, the dad is THRILLED! Really? Shouldn't he have said, \"What about my son that you seduced last summer?\"I never read the book, but the visual adaption with the two actors didn't work for me. I never bought the chemistry or the actions of many of the characters. Overall, this movie gets a 3 for the acting quality of a few people, but the story and pacing are a huge fail.",

            "content": "Not since the Oscar winning \"Brokeback Mountain\" have I seen such a beautifully acted, written and directed LGBTQ+ drama. Perhaps this all lies within the wonderful source material from author Andre Acimen with its screenplay adapted by James Ivory (who scored an Oscar for his work) and the top quality direction of Luca Guadagnino (himself a member of the LGBTQ community, lending authenticity and understanding).The film's true beauty really lies within the performances of its leading men: Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer. Chalamet, who was only 20 at the time of shooting, makes a remarkable semi-debut in his role as Elio, the youth trying to understand his sexual identity in 1987 Italy. The young actor brings such a beautiful naivety and youthful confusion that echoes the prose of Acimen's novel, in addition to Chalamet's actual age and visage. Occasionally voicing his thoughts aloud as in the novel, we get into Elio's head and can feel his confusion and attempts to come to terms with who he is. From the opening scene where Elio's displeasure for Oliver is shown to the heartbreaking closing shot of a shaking, teary-eyed Elio in front of the fire, Chalamet more than proved he is a star to watch out for and we want to see the proposed follow-up. Coming in as an opposite personality to the repressed Elio is the smiling, socially flamboyant Oliver, wonderfully portrayed by Armie Hammer. Having portrayed plenty of characters comfortable in their own skin, Hammer brings out Oliver's charming personality that wins over Chalamet's Elio by being subtle and coy. From his dismissive-like \"Later!\" to that sensual and heart-melting \"call me by your name and I'll call you by mine\" and eventually that saddening phone call at the climax, we fall in love with Hammer's Oliver as much as Elio does.Thanks to instructions from the director, the actors spent time together to develop their bond as on-screen friends/lovers. This direction paid off as the chemistry leaps off the screen and makes you long for Oliver and Elio to stay together for the entire film. The banter, often spouted by Hammer with genuine and cute reactions from Chalamet, will put a smile on your face and make you laugh and sometimes cry. A notable shout-out to Michael Stuhlbarg in the role of Elio's professor father. The actor deftly handles the discussion scene between father and son with nuance and genuine care and concern.",

            "content": "This is the kind of film that you see in 'Coming Attractions' and you think that though it sounds interesting enough to see, it will never live up to its hype. And still you go see it. And yet, even though you knew the buzz for the film was overblown, you are even more disappointed upon leaving the theater than you were prepared to be. This is sub-mediocre cinema for the pretentious mass of moviegoers.For one thing, it was way too long, at least a half hour more than necessary. Too many wasted, extended shots that did nothing to advance the paper-thin narrative of Vulnerable Younger Man Elio falls for Manipulative Young Man Oliver, involving themselves in a six-week summer fling with full parental approval. Oliver has his peach and eats it too, then moves back to the United States to proceed with his pre-planned heterosexual lifestyle. Elio is then left to pine and yearn and mourn with a beautiful sad-face through the closing credits. Two hours and ten minutes for this? No thank you, sirs.About the performances: Armie Hammer is a truly beautiful physical specimen of a man, but in this film that is the full extent of his acting ability. Preening, with an exaggerated sense of dismissive cool, his portrayal of Oliver left the sense of an actor trying too hard to pretend that he was comfortable in the role. This sense is re-inforced in the promotional interviews for the film, where he seems to be working just a bit too hard to show how cool he was with kissing and simulating sex with another beautiful young(er) man. The utter sterility of the sex scenes or the lack of explicit nudity, however, as dictated by Hammer's contract, belie his overcompensating demeanor. Understandable, perhaps, but this kills the credibility of any emotional chemistry beyond the two men on- screen.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, on the other hand, is remarkable in the way he inhabits his role, with a kittenish physicality, all lean, wiry lines and lithe angles, that more than holds its own in the scenes with Hammer. Despite the unbelievability of any emotional connection between the two characters, Chalamet's Elio gives a palpable sense of physical attraction to the older Oliver, a man-crush that gives way to physical yearning. The depth of Chalamet's performance was what carried the film, and was by far the most interesting, successful aspect of the production. The novel could actually be interesting, but as brought to screen it was diffuse, dissolute, and disparate; like a collage attempting to depict a mosaic of a mural. This film will get praise for dealing with a sensitive subject, and I suppose that is fair enough; I only wish it had been more interestingly and convincingly executed.",

One of the biggest issues is it's pace, it drags and goes on and on without much pay off or anything dramatic happeningA root of this problem is from the fact that there's barely any conflict in this filmThere aren't much challenges or hurdles, but since this is a self discovery film, that's a bit forgivable but the fact that there's not really any conflict at all or the problem that the film doesn't highlight that conflict until the very third act is problematic The characters are also lacking something. Even though the film spends so much time developing the relationship between the two main characters and establishing their personalities, I never got the sense of knowing the characters or understanding what they were aboutIt's really messy and there's a lack of focus/direction and there are way too many distractionsThere are positives too. The film doesn't rely on exposition that much and the characters do a good job of expressing their emotion without using on the noise dialogue, and that's credit to some really great performances by Timothy Chalamet and Michel Stuhlberg The cinematography is also really good. And the soundtrack is amazing, they chose the right songs for the right scenes. What this film really had it going for itself is that it didn't feel like a film, it felt like a real life experience. But there are issues that made this film dull and kind of unbearable. It's not a bad film, I can appreciate it's positives but it didn't quite click with me, it's my least favorite oscar contender.",

As you watch the film it doesn't unfold as most films usually do. It doesn't follow the standard pattern of storytelling. It purposely meanders along, because it's about two guys who are meandering through a summer discovering thing about themselves, and as these characters explore this blossoming relationship, the film just becomes something really beautiful.The two lead performances are fantastic. Both actors have the most amazing chemistry, it's palpable and there's something devastatingly romantic about what they accomplish on screen, and the two of them work magic.\nThis film could, for some, sometimes come across as slow and boring, as it shows things you don't really need to know, for example, Elio sitting writing notes about his music because he has an interest in music, sometimes they are just looking around at the scenery, a long shot of them swimming in a pond for no particular reason other than, look at this beautiful moment with these two characters, but it's these moments that make you feel like you are there, and they create that sense of realism that most films just don't have.\nEven the sound design doesn't try to make it feel like a movie, it feels very realistic. In an early scene, the two characters are sitting at a table outside by the street and cars are passing behind them, and they have to raise their voice to talk over the cars, the sound of the cars hasn't been lowered by the sound department in post-production, it's right there as if it would be if you were actually sitting there, and it lends to that feeling of realism and environment.It's also a film thats emotion builds and builds and actually kind of sneaks up on you. It is purposely slow-paced but towards the third act of the film, as the summer is winding down, the impact of the events for these characters is really felt a lot more significantly. The brilliant thing about this film is that sometimes in life it's not all sweet and wonderful, life can be complicated and complex and they have shown that with these two men having feelings for each other, and the film doesn't have any easy answers and doesn't give them an easy way out.If I have any flaws with this movie, I would say, I'd have liked to know more about the characters, especially with Oliver. You basically learn what you see and a few things that you hear, I felt I wanted to be a bit more attached to them, I felt for them I just didn't know enough about them. And yes, the pace, though deliberately slow can wear on your patience a little, but this film is so different and so unique that it didn't bother me too much.Flaws aside, 'Call Me By Your Name' is a very romantic, extremely well directed and very well acted film.\nI loved it.",

Just because the age of consent is 18 in your country, doesn't make it so everywhere else in the world! 18 is comparatively old by global standards. I believe the average age is 16 (as in my country) and in Italy where the film takes place it's actually 14. Whether you agree with it morally or not, no criminal act takes place - US law does not apply!However, I agree with many reviewers that Armie Hammer is miscast in terms of his character's age. He is 31 and looks it, whereas Oliver is meant to be 24. His age is never referred to in the film, so viewers who haven't read the book are left with the impression of a 30-ish man engaging in a relationship with a 17-year-old, which Timothee (20 at the time) does convincingly portray. I can fully understand how that would ring alarm bells for many. If they'd had an actor who actually looked 24 I think that would have created a very different dynamic. Even so, the relationship is hardly of a paedophilic nature. And I don't think most people would regard 17-year-olds as \"children\" physically and emotionally, even if they may be legally.Timothee Chalamet gives an incredible performance fully deserving of all the accolades, but I found Armie's inconsistent at best. He does get better as the film goes along. Maybe it's just that I didn't find his character particularly appealing... to me he comes across as rather abrupt and arrogant, and weirdly passive-aggressive and patronising towards Elio for much of the time. The physical scenes between Oliver and Elio were excruciatingly awkward to watch and didn't ring true to me - but I'm a straight female so what would I know? I haven't had that reaction with the (admittedly few) other gay films I've seen though. Maybe it was supposed to reflect real life, or maybe I am just too accustomed to male-female depictions. Ultimately the relationship seemed to consist of Elio being infatuated and Oliver enjoying being the object of that infatuation, rather than a true love story.Personally the relationship I found most touching in the film was that between Elio and his parents. Although they aren't given much to work with, both the actors playing his parents do beautiful, nuanced work... and the much-lauded scene near the end with his father was stunning and truly moving. It was refreshing to see a such a loving and accepting child-parent relationship, done in a natural and non-affected way. It rang very true to my own experience as an only child and it was nice to see this portrayed on film for once, instead of the tension-filled relationships American films usually depict.Overall I thought the film was absorbing and well-done, but neither the masterpiece or great love story it's being hyped as.",

After four days not having contacted her, after two lovemakings, he rejects her point blank. He has not even taken the initiative to let her know that he is not interested in her anymore. The look of grief on her beautiful face is heartrendering. And that is my main critic of the two characters of the movie: they are so insensitive to other people's feelings, and as such there is no identification of the viewer with them, gay or straight. If you have found out that you like boys more than girls, why giving girls hope that you will be her passionate lover. If anyone is a traitor in this movie, it is Elio, because of making love to Marzia, knowing he can not give her what she is prepared to give him, and Oliver, when he anounces that he is going to marry, and in 1983, that could only be to a girl. Another flaw is in the parents: -do you think mother knows-, asked Elio his father (about his lovemaking with Oliver). I don't think so- is the answer. Of course she knows! Every mother knows intuitively that her son is gay, which is proved when she tries to console him on the way back from the station. Apperently the two parents don't talk to each other about their son, between smoking there cigarettes. And that is my last point: why the cigarettes? In 1983 the negative effect of smoking on health was already widely known, and there you are, in beautiful Italy, a nice home with books, music, erudite guests, gardens and orchards; then follows a moving speech of the father to his gay son that he will be always there for him, while in fact after another ten years of smoking he will only be there for the oncologist or the cardiac care unit.",

Even scenes that feel more erotic, convey the physical acts as the couple expressing their feelings for one another rather than being explicit for the sake of it.It's because of all the strengths, that when the conversation between Elio and his father take place, as well as the gut-wrenching twist at the end (which I won't spoil here) actually have an impact and compels the viewer to feel like they are in the scene and feel the same emotion as our protagonist.Overall, Call Me By Your Name is a modern cinematic masterpiece that was clearly handled with a great passion by not only the director, Luca Guadagnino, but also our leads, Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer. 10/10.",

            "content": "'Call Me by Your Name' is directed by Luca Guadagnino and written by James Ivory based on a novel of the same name by Andre Aciman. It is the story of a sophisticated and cultured seventeen year old named Elio (Timothee Chalamet) whom over the course of a gorgeous northern Italian summer experiences first love, romance and what it feels like to truly find oneself. He is on vacation with his parents at their beautiful 17th century villa spending his time writing and playing music and flirting with his girlfriend. His father Mr. Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) is an archaeologist who specializes in Greco-Roman culture and his mother Annella (Amira Casar) is a translator. Every summer Mr. Perlman hires an assistant to help him with his work and this particular summer he brings in and American college graduate student Oliver (Armie Hammer) which completely throws off Elio's easy going behavior. Elio is immediately taken aback by the new arrival. Oliver is a tall, handsome, smart and good-natured young man and Elio's admiration for him begins as soon as they are introduced by Mr. Perlman. He spends as time with him as possible, wherever Oliver goes he goes and he attempts to court with unbeknownst to Oliver until he a certain scene when he subtly reveals his intentions. Eventaully they bond over such things as their friendship, their shared Jewish heritage and of course their summer romance. Subtle is actually one of the many words that describe this film very appropriately. Things are often said without words but simply through the performances of the amazing cast. Particularly Chalamet and Hammer who both give career best performances. Stuhlbarg as also shines in a few standout scenes especially towards the end of the movie.One of the things I like the most about this film is how the writer and director treats a gay romance. There have been countless movies about the victimization of gays and struggles they face which are also important when done correctly. However it is remarkably refreshing to watch a gay romance depicted just like any other. Elio is not persecuted in this movie for his sexuality, which is technically bi-sexual as he does have girlfriend at some points in the movie but nevertheless, he simply learns to deal with his emotions and how to express himself in an honest way. Another major strong achievement of 'Call Me by Your Name' is its ability to create a sense of mood thanks in large part to the cinematography, musical soundtrack and on- location production design. It enjoys a number of original songs which are very much complimentary to the themes present in the movie. They are topped off by 'Mystery of Love' by Sufjan Stevens. The movie moves along with a wonderful simmering pace, not too fast, not too sluggish. Thanks to this you legitimately feel like you are spending a whole summer with these characters and are just a fly on the wall observing their experiences. I honestly do not think that there is a single flaw with this movie and if there is I couldn't find it. It is immaculate from the first scene to the last. 'Call Me by Your Name' might not be the best movie of the year but it may just be the most perfect. It is a knockout and deserves every bit of praise and recognition it gets this awards season. I couldn't recommend it enough.",

The film wallows in human kindness and caring. It's just about as beautiful an American film as I've ever seen. The direction, writing, cinematography, music, and the acting by all is superb, but the film hinges on Chalamet and it is a remarkable performance, even extraordinary considering the range he shows at such a young age. He is mesmerizing and the intensity and versatility he displays is simply overwhelming. This film is an absolute must for anyone in love with serious cinema.

The village summer holiday setting also reminded me of Before Midnight, people eating alfresco, drinking wine and getting into discussions about art or relationships.Set in the summer of 1983 in Northern Italy. Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) is living in an idyllic house as he researches Greco-Roman artifacts. Each year he invites an intern, this summer Oliver (Arnie Hammer) arrives from America, he is 24 years old, clever, casual was easy going manner charms everyone around him. Both Pearlmans and Oliver are Jews. While Oliver wears a star of David, the Pearlmans are a bit more discrete in Italy. However they are a cultured family.The Pearlman's 17 year old son Elio (Timothee Chalamet) is musically gifted and like the rest of the family speaks several languages. Although Oliver easily finds it easy to get girls, while Elio rather gawkily tries to relate to them, as the summer wears on both become attracted to each other. Maybe rather awkwardly at first but it becomes more passionate.It is a sexual awakening for Elio, sowing of wild oats for Oliver, his last blush of youth. Elio's parents suspect that their is something blossoming between the two and tacitly approve of it. This is not a film that wants to cast eternal damnation to the protagonists, even though for Elio the ending is bittersweet. As the summer ends he knows Oliver will return to America.Call Me by Your Name is a literate film, it is slow, it is awkward, at times sensual.",

            "content": "I genuinely do not understand the hype of this Movie.Armie Hammers Character is supposed to be a 24 year old Grad Student. The man is a solid 31 (Born 1986) who looks to be in his late 30's, whether that be from costume, or makeup. So to picture either one of them as a young adolescence exploring each others sexuality, is not there. It looks more like an old man trying to (and failing at) seducing a young uninterested boy.His character should have been recast at the first table reads. Armie Hammer makes Oliver seem like a pretentious showboating creep, and the random acting from happy, to laughing, to dancing in the street, to screaming,t o anger...it's all over the map and it;'s terrible. The screenwriter should have his Oscar revoked. There was Absolutely no Chemistry between the two main characters, which didn't help that their dialogue, body language, and facial expressions towards each other was uncomfortable and forced. In the book, the internal dialogue of Elio's longing for Oliver is rampant, NONE of that is Portraid on screen for the first half of the movie, so when it finally happens, it's seems so unrealistic and forced.An example, When Oliver reaches out to Elio to help his shoulder, The actors cringing and pulling away does NOT give the idea that he's interested, or fighting back emotions he can't control. He seems to be frankly disturbed by this man touching him. It also doesn't help that for the first half hour these two male characters showing their interest in women, from (HORRIBLY) dancing with them, to rendezvous in the water, to dates in the city, to sexual encounters in a field, to a secondary planned out encounter in an attic, NONE of that is any indication that Elio is interested in Oliver, at all!! But they talk to each other in riddles at a war monument and it's supposed to be believed that they're talking about a homosexual attraction that Elio has for Oliver.Can I also mention the forced plot movement, from the mom randomly reading to her husband and 17 year old son about a prince who just doesn't know how to tell a princess how he feels....or the father and his slides of young desirable men, just beckoning to be touched.... to the songs in the car, or alley, about new love. That's poor writing when you have to dumb down the story so much that you're TELLING the audience \"This is the part in the story where the characters have to tell each other hoe they feel, and this is the part when they're going to have sex\"And what was with the editing? The cinematographer should give his head a shake....Apparently the scene in which Elio is sitting in the garden and the Music is playing while those blue filters and visible film was from an issue with the physical film of the movie, but it didn't fit into the movie in any way! Or going from a full orchestra backing to immediate cut to silence to the bizarre jump cuts....A perfect example of being pulled out of a scene, Oliver and Elio are spinnign and twirling randomly in a field, then on a Mountan, screaming the whole time like idiot children with too much sugar. Then it cuts to a midnight scape in a stone street alley, where they're twirling on the wall, Oliver randomly runs over to peple, grabs a woman, pulls her to an exact spot and starts dancing with her like a drunk uncle at a Wedding Reception. Then, out of NOWHERE provoked by NOTHING Elio Throws up. We then immediately cut to then kissing, then Oliver naked in a window, with Elio in bed, then a train station.Where did that come from?! Why did he throw up?? What was with the dancing? Where was the explanation for any of this? Was it just not important enough to be adapted from the book? Did Elio HAVE to throw up?!The only redeeming factor was the Robin Williams Stand in Father, talking to his son. Which, for a father to be that accepting, in 1983.....Is the most fantastical part of this movie.The ENTIRE time I watched this movie I wanted to scream out \"WHAT IS HAPPENING?! WHAT?! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!\" I felt like there were ants on my skin as I tried to piece together why SO many people insisted I just HAD to see this movie. I truly do not understand the Hype.",

I will not say who was better in acting or whose dialogues were prefect. This movie is like the afternoon siesta that you enjoy so much and become sad when the evening sets in.

The whole of it feels like a warm-regarded memory of a lazy, sunny holiday in the heavenly Italian countryside. It's a refreshing dip into a different type of culture; one that is rich in history and etymology and music. The cinematography lends itself to the scenery and architecture; everything is so bright, so alive. The fleeting nature of beauty and thirst for life seems to be constant themes in this film. Mr. Perlman says it wonderfully: \"How you live your life is your business, just remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it.\" Chalamet was nominated for his performance, and he absolutely earned it. He switches seamlessly between three languages - English, French, and Italian- he plays Bach in three, distinct styles, and there are many scenes that are composed of nothing more than him emoting his feelings and woes, but he does so with elegant grace. Hammer does a great job of showing the inner qualms Oliver has about starting a relationship with someone younger- the moral ambiguity here is honestly what makes the film interesting, and Hammer does a great job subtlety and silently wrestling with this. The ever-underappreciated Michael Stuhlbarg is wonderful as Elio's father. I would actually say the best scene in the whole film is between Stuhlbarg and Chalamet (the scene near the end on the couch, for those who have seen it).This film does a wonderful job of showing us an unforgettable summer in Italy; it is a culturally rich masterpiece, one I'd be happy to dive into again.",

Handsome newcomer Timothee Chalamet turned out to be just about the only redeeming feature in an otherwise hollow and artificial waste of time.\"Call Me By Your Name\" suffers from numerous fatal flaws: The main characters lack any believable \"chemistry\". Armie Hammer (Oliver) is a horrible actor with as much depth as a cardboard cutout. There is absolutely no effort to explain the attraction Elio has for aloof Oliver and visa versa - it seems to come from nowhere and for no reason. There are hints that each of the two main characters has special talents - intellectual Oliver and musical prodigy Elio - but those scenes seem out of place and contrived with no payoff in the plot. The weird request from which the movie gets it's title is spoken in a scene, but there is no explanation for it. It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. If anyone said to me, \"Call me by your name\" after we just had sex, I'd say \"Later\" (this will be more amusing to those who have seen the movie). I haven't read the book, but the screenplay lacks any kind of conflict, which makes it BORING.The highlights are the beautiful Italian locations and Timothee Chalamet.

It as sweeping movie that you will not soon forget. Expect many Oscar nominations and even a best actor nomination for Armie Hammer. After several days thinking about this film, I remembered another Italian film that I saw that had a very similar premise, albeit a more controversial one called \"The Flavor of Corn\" (Il sapore del grano) Starring Lorenzo Lena as a university student assigned to teach at a remote northern Italian small town.

Now that's out of the way, dramas that showcase rich developed characters whilst conveying an emotionally beautiful story are rare. Yet here we are with one of the most engrossing dramatic journeys of last year. A young boy undergoes a transformational traversal of self-discovery as he rapidly falls in love with an American man who is residing in his family's Italian abode. Coming hot off 'Moonlight', it tackles homosexuality from the perspective of a young impressionable boy who struggles with dealing with these unknown feelings. The inner conflict that rages within him starts to manifest and take control, where he is soon plunged into a forbidden love. And what a beautiful film this is. Guadagnino captures the natural beauty of rural Italy, with mint green colours glistening in the sunshine, and the tantalising romance between Oliver and Elio. His usage of long takes and landscape shots allows both the actors and environment to be at the forefront of this drama. An understated style that still elevates the cinematic quality. Chalamet was magnificent at portraying innocence, fragility and humanity. He held the whole film on his shoulders, not an easy feat given some of the scenes involved. His onscreen chemistry with Hammer was outstanding and the sole selling point for watching this. However, it's Elio's parents that add that extra slice of humanity as they are undoubtedly the nicest parents ever. The monologue from Stuhlbarg proves he is the best \"chameleon actor\" working today. I clung onto every word during that scene. Aside from the heartbreaking conclusion, there wasn't a massive amount of emotional impact for me. It's a nuanced story which carries emotion throughout, I just wanted some more power in certain scenes. However, an incredibly mesmerising journey that is both beautiful and sorrowful.",

And if you love the Psychedelic Furs - \"Love My Way\", you will see what I mean.There are many things going on this film from the pretence of being something you're not, the absolute ecstacy of discovering the power of sex with someone you care for, and then the heartbreak of losing them.I love how this film shares with you, and invites you, to participate in the highs and lows so that you are so drawn in you feel a part of it all.

            "content": "The old-fashioned love story may appear to be lost in antiquity, but that's only because so many movies and TV series have attempted to rehash it over and over again without anything new and profound to say. What makes Call Me By Your Name an exception is its perspective of a passionate love affair that may externally be labelled as taboo, but is actually an opportunity for a young person to express their emotions explicitly and without shame. This movie captures an important life lesson about respecting time, before it disappears. This human construct imprisons a lot of people in a stupor of routine and depression, because they keep looking back and trying to relive past memories. Whilst remembering is important, and brings out the nostalgia in all of us, this movie tells us to continue living beyond that. The general story of the movie is simple. Not many words are spoken, but the actions speak louder, and what unfolds is a complex relationship between a 17 year-old boy and an American visitor with whom he becomes infatuated. This is a gradual process, but Luca Guadagnino makes it so subtle that it can be a matter of looking for the signs. There's a lot of references to the possessions of people, the bikes, the books, the shirts and the necklaces. Symbolism plays a key part in how we see Elio's sexual development. As his parents appreciate, he is new to the world of intimacy, but his naivety also brings forth a chance for him to learn about his feelings. That is one of the key themes to take from the film - his seesaw journey through the definition of his sexuality is a common factor in most people's lives, but this film addresses that as something natural and something normal.My favourite scene is towards the end, after Elio has been struggling to deal with his lover's absence by suffering in silence. His father consoles him, knowing full well what his time with Oliver has meant. The fact that his father accepts Elio's relationship and feelings to begin with is a great moment, giving Elio the freedom he needs to ask for his father's support. Secondly, it's his father's words that mean the most in the movie; about making the most of these short, yet ecstatic escapades before the chances wither and fade away. Finally, I'd like to commend rising star Timothee Chalamet for his unprecedented and tender performance of Elio. Throughout, you are captured by his innocent nature, and empathise with his internal struggle. The final shot of Elio relentlessly giving in to his emotions is guaranteed to move you at the end of cinema, so much so that you will be struggling to hold in your own tears as you exit the theatre. Needless to say, 2017 has been triumphant in its host of emotional movies, what with Dunkirk, The Circle and Wind River, but Call Me By Your Name stands above them all, with its simple, yet honest, interpretation of love and the emotional consequences that inevitably follow.",

It is a work of artistic beauty in so many ways and I will enjoy watching it again many times in the future.The movie is slow in pace but this reflects the nature of time in the summer: slow, easy and free- flowing. There is nowhere to be at a specific time, no agenda to meet, just slow summer days and the beauty that comes with being this at ease. I think that is one of the beautiful elements within the film: it reflects this Italian/European lifestyle which perhaps we should all think more seriously about, as what is life when you are constantly rushing to meet this deadline or catch this certain train when you compare it to the life of living out in the rustic countryside, eating fresh fruit and swimming in the local river? I know the film is set in the 80's, but that is not to say people today still do not live like this at least part of the year. Anyway, from someone who has never seen a LGBT based movie before, I felt a bit unprepared and as if I had nothing to compare it to. Although by the end of the film I really didn't feel I needed to as the love story transcends any artificial labels to simply express a pure and innocent tale of first love that is rarely as genuinely portrayed within cinema. I think both Chamalet and Hammer did wonderful jobs in their performances, balancing the innocence and curiosity of Elio with the experience and desire of Oliver. Chamalet in particular, I believe, as a younger actor, brought a great deal of raw emotion into his performance which really enhances the whole film overall. The beautiful landscapes combined with the focus on the Italian lifestyle brings another wonderful element to the film and really helps to complete the story. The symbolism within the film, with the ripe peaches, also builds on the artistic direction of the film that is sure to make it a possible contender for the awards season next year. I certainly hope that the film wins at least for Best Foreign Film, yet I would hope that it would garner wider recognition and very much hope that Chamalet is considered for Best Actor. The speech by Elio's father at the end of the film, played by the talented Mr Micheal Stuhlbarg, is very moving and really has a wonderful message in the end I think that challenges us all to think about how we live our lives and how we judge others.",

Anyone who has fallen for an older guy while young and impressionable, not only to be dumped, but having the dump rubbed in during a holiday will NOT like this movie and in fact may experience some PTSD from it.Whether this is pedophilia depends on the ages under consideration, but the implication was there. Whether 17 years old meets the definition depends on the location, but there is no doubt that the 17 year old character was in turmoil and unsure of his sexuality. This affair, even when endorsed by Eilio's father, didn't make it less troubling to Eilio.The FIRST clue comes when Oliver makes the statement after a long involved kiss \"We haven't done anything we are ashamed of.\".... YET.Oliver \"works\" Eilio clearly throughout the movie and finally entices him into sex. Naturally there is a lot of emotion involved in it, but Eilio is hooked. You can understand that this is not going to turn out well.The last straw comes during Hannukkah, when Eilio seems to have resolved this and appears to be happy. Oliver calls primarily to announce to Eilio that he is getting married, completely destroying Eilio's joy. He is left sobbing. Can anyone predict that Eilio will have a wonderful life, or maybe exactly the opposite.Who is to blame? Oliver with the first \"rub\" of Eilio's shoulder. He should have known better as an adult, but wanted to reel this one in. Armie Hammer should have been ashamed of this role. As I said, there are clues that all of this is absolutely the wrong thing to do, but the audience will overlook these clues and view the movie as a wonderful coming of age movie. It is not.",

It's disappointing, for sure, especially since there's such a lack of mainstream LGBTQ+ representation in cinema. The flick just isn't all that compelling, regardless of its solid performances and interesting direction. Of course, these elements do deserve praise. Occasionally, they combine to make for some relatively entertaining scenes. Plus, the picture is pretty important. I can't claim to really enjoy it, though. It feels longer than it needs to be and, in a way, actually feels quite 'cold'. Honestly, it was teetering on boring, basically, the entire time. As you can maybe tell, I'm a little conflicted about this one. I know it's a well-made movie, I just don't like it that much. 5/10",

            "content": "It must be terribly disappointing for Andr\u00e9 Aciman to see his novel CALL ME BY YOUR NAME so thoroughly ruined by Luca Guadagnino's horrible direction, and by the totally dreadful failed casting of Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in the lead roles of Elio and Oliver. How could everyone on this film fail to notice that these two straight actors have absolutely no interest in each other whatever? And that, except when they are (mercifully) saying goodbye to each other forever, they're not even able to PRETEND they like each other? I haven't seen casting this awful since Streisand & Matthau!In case you haven't already seen this dog turd, here's the gist: For one solid hour we are bored stiff by watching a bunch of unpleasant and irrelevant people doing pretty much nothing at all in a dreary and run down little country place \"Somewhere in Northern Italy\", as the titles tell us. (Barf.) Thirty-year old Oliver (hideously miscast Archer) is stuck here for six weeks to do... something. We never find out what. Elio, played with alternating whining and petulant pouts by twenty-three year old Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, is supposed to be seventeen, and does nothing but play the piano quite poorly, pout, and whine. When Oliver shows up, the script says Elio is interested, but Chalamet is completely incapable of displaying interest or attraction or lust or any emotion other than petulant boredom. So, for an hour, the two men antagonize each other while spending a lot of time together. Then, hideously and for NO reason, these two straight men start having sex with each other, and the film goes from boring to horror. Far from chemistry, these two men have physics: that is, magnetic REPULSION. You can actually see their bodies thrashing and twisting, trying not to touch each other. Director Guadagnino keeps the camera on them until Hammer grimly removes his pants, and then wisely pans away from the men and focuses on a tree in the garden outside the window. It's the last act of mercy in the film.Special blame must go to Worst Cinematographer nominee Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, who manages to make even rural Italy look like the inside of a porta-potty. I mean seriously: how can you mess up a sun-sparkling-on-the-water shot? Mukdeeprom knows how! You focus on the detritus floating on the surface, so it looks like a sewer. Total vomit.",

            "content": "Some of these reviewers think there is a bigger age gap than there actually is. \nAt the time of production in 2016 the actors were 21 and 29, and they obviously depict people younger than their actual years, and that is aside from the fact that the age of consent in Italy is 14. From what I can see the people making these remarks seem to be stemming from homophobia, and trying to turn a love story into a predatory horror. They ought travel outside of their own borders once in a while, and realise that their hate stems from nothing but bigotry. No doubt if the age gap were smaller they would find something else to be disgusted with. Thank goodness we don't live in America. That aside, this is a wonderfully beautiful film that draws everyone watching back to their first love, the passion, euphoria and then the pain of the loss as the world just carries on. The production values and direction are excellent, and I would go so far to say that this was easily the most engaging and emotional love story I have ever seen depicted in film by a country mile as not a single viewer will watch it and not think back to their own first love, so the journey the characters go on becomes very personal for the viewer too. Rarely does a film like this come along, perhaps only a handful in a generation, if that. Movie-goers who prefer chick flicks and marvel movies will probably be get bored early on, as the drama and engagement from this movie stems not from outlandish and unbelievable special effects, or shocking twists and turns, but from emotional depth and personal experience. Rarely can a film be so entirely predictable and yet completely mesmerising. I simply can not recommend this film enough, and can tell you right now that it has set a mile marker for future movies, and will be discussed and dissected for decades to come.My only slightly negative comment would be the choice and placement of some of the soundtrack, although that is a matter of taste. 10/10 without a doubt. \nEnjoy!",

            "content": "A sensual romance about a boy who finds himself through the discovery of another.Luca Guadagnino's third chapter in his desire trilogy, following I am Love (2009) and A Bigger Splash (2015) is Call Me By Your Name, a novel arbitrary love tale between two young men in the shimmering summer of 80s Italy. A romantic drama pealing back the layers of its Romeo and \"Juliet\" in a elementary yet bewildering fashion.In the 80s suburban Italy, 17 year old Elio ( Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his parents unwind for their summer lounge, when Oliver (Armie Hammer) a 24 year old academic arrives at the families home to work along side Elio's father Lyle (Michael Stuhlbarg). While Elio's first impressions of the strapping American are sower, Elio's enchantment with Oliver blossoms a beautiful friendship between the two and then as the drama proceeds a romantic one.Guadiagnio's vision of a summer love affair is one to truly be admired by the way Call Me By Your Name eases you into a conceivable relationship. Instead of your traditional love at first sight films. Call Me By Your Name has the confidence to take its time with the characters to produce a remarkable layered character journey. From this we are given the perspective of Elio's world and his flourishing growth as young man, before his world is truly altered by his contact with Oliver. The film is more a coming age of story of Elio as well as a romance.Obviously the coursing heartbeat of the film is the central characters relationship as it blossoms from the very start to finish, an amazing master work in romantic story telling to say the least. As Elio and Oliver converse over music, philosophy and archaeology, the two's connection is thickened in the company of each other, and of us the audience as well. This is wonderfully transcribed in James Ivory's script beautifully adapted from Andr\u00e9 Aciman's book. Although Elio is our main window into this romance, both characters are as equal as each other, as the title implies.Real masters giving life to this tale is the cast themselves. A fabulous ensemble performance by all participants in a warm welcoming environment, usually found unfamiliar in this narrative context. From Michael Stuhlbarg's wise Lyle passionate about his love of archaeology that he shares with Oliver, while also being a passionate father to Elio guiding him in his journey as a youth. Armie Hammer's Oliver is scene stealing charming puzzle which along side Elio we are trying to unravel. Hammer brings forth an exceptional performance which is already ringing potential Oscar bells. Although those bells better be ringing louder for the true standout performance of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Chalamet brings a marvellous collection of young but also mature character in Elio trying to decipher his own identity which becomes all the more clear when he meets Oliver. A major break out performance hopefully to set Chalamet on the path of even greater work.What moulds Call Me By Your Name is its glistening flavour is its exotic summer presence in honourable landscape beauty of Italy, tenderly caught by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's cinematography. A strong throwback to the hot summer just gone, as we now enter the cold winter. A lavish film in its own right, seriously a film to really immerse in with its exotic atmosphere while, pouring its heart out in the characters.Call Me By Your Name is the most remarkable drama of the year, if you believe in any love story this year let it be this one, as your swept in a fantastic voyage of discovering love for the first time. Truly a masterpiece in romantic story-telling.",

I don't know what my favorite film of the year is just yet but I'd except Call Me By Your Name to be in the top ten of the year.This film is about a 17 year old boy living in Italy who falls for an American assistant to his father, who comes and stays with them for a period of time. Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), soon realizes that he has feelings for this older man and they begin a relationship. Elio has to come to grips with his sexual awakening and see if a relationship is possible despite being in a relationship with a local girl. There's definitely much more to the film than my horrible summary of it, that's for sure.Its a coming of age film of sorts but feels so fresh and like it makes a point to be different. New face Chalamet is now here to stay, having appeared in both Lady Bird and this film. He is fantastic in it and this happens to be the best I've seen from Armie Hammer as well. I had to just see two minutes of this film to conclude that this was a Luca Guadagnino film, the vibrant color and the gorgeous vacation setting cinematography made it feel like A Bigger Splash, and it turns out to be a spiritual successor in a trilogy to that film.The backdrop of the 80s works so nicely with the film because this was also a time where homosexuality was quite hidden but becoming public. The score and soundtrack for this film is fantastic. \"Love My Way\" hasn't sounded this good since the Grand Theft Auto Vice City days. Once you finish the film, you know that you've been treated to something special and a strong contender during awards season.8/10",

Elio(in a good turn from Timothee Chalamet) is a young man who enjoys summer, reading books, and good food, and learning and living culture, along with being with friends and this Lacoste shirt wearing young man is about to have his world changed when Oliver(Armie Hammer)visits to be Elio's father research assistant.Along the way the two hit it off and slowly, but surely one thing leads to another as the two make out and learn and feel each other out. It's like Oliver has taken Elio under his wing both emotionally and mentally. Overall this movie proves that love is different and uncommon and it can be magic and enjoyed, yet when it's over it can be painful and affect life.",

            "content": "I've just seen this for the 2nd time after a festival screening last year where everybody loved it. In this screening and in the reviews here, there's a lot of division, so maybe I can add a few things to help some younger, straighter people out there to know what to expect.It's a novel adaptation from someone who grew up at the same time I did, and I can confirm that this kind of story is what we fantasized about back in 1983 - from the younger guys\u00b4 perspective. This is very much a gay fantasy, but unlike \"Moonlight\", it isn't bent to straight expectations - if you ask gay friends what they thought about \"Moonlight\", they'll very likely tell you it's utterly unrealistic, if you ask them about this, they'll very likely tell you that they wish it was true. A gay teenager in the 80s usually wasn't fantasizing about other teenage boys, because we considered them too immature, and because it was still quite dangerous to test the waters at school. The consequences could range from assault to social death. So we often had this ideal of a sophisticated 25-30ish guy like Oliver as a first romance, especially since \"Greek Love\", which the film alludes to with the statues, was pretty much the only positive identifier for homosexuality available at the time. There was no internet, there were no films, porn and bars were yet out of reach. So the people here who think this has a pedo touch to it are totally off, it's the other way around. But I give it 9 instead of 10 because the age difference in the book is narrower. For younger people, the pace must be painfully slow - that's definitely the most courageous aspect of the film, it replicates the narrative structure of the book and allows its story to breathe and slowly grow on you. Many get that, there's no need to point this out expressly, but this is a very realistic approach to first love, for a long time nothing happens and then - boom. This is the reason why I cherish this film, it can make straight viewers understand that we're really not different in our feelings and choices, and that love is love, as Stuhlbarg says in his monologue - which could come across really awkward from a lesser actor.It's also realistic that Elio experiments with the other sex, most of us did, and as with the girl in the film that usually ended up OK, there were no hard feelings. In that respect, the 80s were probably a better time, interchanges among the sexes were really less forward, more playful, people judged you less harshly for what you were and looked like, the film brings that across really well. It strikes a perfect balance between capturing what the 80s were like for teens, a period of aimless waiting just like the summer, and a nostalgic fantasy of bygone days and a romance that never was. But it's not for everyone. Stay clear of this if your favorite film is \"Justice League\". No judgment, it's just not for you, wait a few years. And it's sometimes too subtle for its own good: many people will wonder why Elio is OK with Oliver's decision in the end, and why their story is so definitely over. Well, think about what the Star of David means, and of that scene with the grandma giving the guys water, and then they notice a portrait of the Duce... I only noticed that on my 2nd viewing, so I recommend watching it more than once to catch on to these drifts.",

            "review_title": "Azzurro is the warmest color... or is it?",
            "content": "Raised in an intellectual, liberal, upper-class Jewish-Italo-French family of rural Northern Italy, Elio (Timothee Chalamet) finds himself at the crossroads of two pivotal moments of his life: adolescence and summer holidays. When the two coincide, he's a living hormonal volcano at the verge of an eruption. Luca Guadagnino's \"Call Me By Your Name\" is the chronicle of Elio's sexual epiphany during that fateful summer of 1983.Rid of any academical obligation, Elio's enjoying nonchalant pleasures under the Mediterranean warm summer: he reads, plays music and spends time with childhood friends Chiara (Victoire Dubois) and Marzia (Esther Garrel)... while his archaeologist father (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his socialite mother (Amira Casar) just let youth have its fling. Elio is tall and good-looking enough but with a spoiled child's bratty attitude that can compromise the attraction. He's introspective and obviously inexperienced but knows how to underplay his awkwardness to keep a chance with girls.But then comes the intruder: a 24-year old graduate American student named Oliver (Arnie Hammer). He's hunky, looking like a man in his late twenties and could be a model for a Lacoste or Givenchy ad. It's not exactly thunderbolt but Elio finds himself strangely drawn to Oliver. The scenario is a reverse \"Graduate\" with same genders but not much a 'film with a message', it is closer in spirit to 19th century French realism (it's James Ivory after all, from Ivory-Merchant) and the theme of crystallization of love, as a mixture of pain and pleasure even more vividly felt in the stagnation phase.But stylistically speaking, in a sort of homage to French culture, Guadgnino directs the film in a very 'Nouvelle Vague' style, setting up some very beautiful-looking scenes for a small little interplay. He doesn't aim for narrative significance and trusts the value of ordinary moments where one exchange of looks, one gesture, one word will satisfy our 'appetites'. It's one of these movies where the unspoken speaks loudlier than the actual dialogue. After a volleyball game, Oliver touches Elio's shoulder, he brushes him off but the ease with which Oliver gets the girls infuriates him.And while girls are given rather thankless roles as pawns in the cat-and-mouse game between Elio and Oliver, the two meet in secret and get closer and closer. We understand the transgressive aspect of these moments but we never exactly know the degree of the family's open-mindedness to assert how much is in jeopardy and I guess that's not an issue. Luca Guadagino doesn't resort to formulas and doesn't exactly put much obstacles in the romance because these are already set in Elio and Oliver's minds (or hearts). It's an internal battle between a quest for pleasure and a social guilt, leading the two to have little breeches of intimacy in case the 'big time' doesn't come.Guadagnino doesn't care for momentums and let the romance float on a cloud of uncertainty and uneasiness. Chalamet looking 17 does convey that innocent naughtiness and indirectly highlights the maturity of Oliver at the risk of making the story a tad controversial for our sensitive minds but I suppose same-gender romances are so seldom made on mainstream cinema that this one could get away with the criticism. I'd rather judge the coming-of-age story, I don't think they should follow specific narrative purposes, the interactions are enjoyable to the degree that I kept envying the lifestyle of these two guys while freezing my ass here in the North of France.In a way it provided me a certain escapism but once I got past the existential torment boiling inside Elio, even the scenery turned out to be a sort of hideout to cover the thinness of the script. I wish there could be some energy some anger, a real momentum... I guess Elio losing his virginity with Marzia was one, the infamous peach scene that could work as a metaphor for the forbidden fruit but even then, the story didn't have that little glue to stick these moments together. Even in the realm of sexual transgression, there's a 'bourgeois fa\u00e7ade' that becomes irritating for a while.Now it is highly possible that my dismissal is physically biased: am not and can't be aroused by the sight of two men kissing. I happen to have a foot fetish and I couldn't stand the sight of Oliver massaging then kissing Elio's foot... and the peach scene grossed me out. And naturally, I had no problem with the sex scenes in \"Blue is the Warmest Colon\". But just because I'm not in a position to enjoy the film on a visual level doesn't mean I wouldn't have wanted the film to stop being so civilized about what remains a call from the flesh. I saw \"Call Me By Your Name\" back-to-back with another gay romance \"The Kiss of Spider Woman\" and there's no comparison. The former makes it look like a game, the second like an existential ordeal.And I maintain my other grief: there's never a moment where we feel there is any justification in the whole secrecy, Elio's parents seem rather progressive and the father's climactic speech seemed like a late confession that could put even more frustration than consolation. Or maybe the secrecy was due to age concern but 17 isn't exactly a taboo age, and it certainly wasn't in 1983, not for boys, not for girls. Speaking of girls, how about their treatment in the film, displaying their naked bodies to better highlight that the two boys don't care about them... they're literally objectified to insist that they're no objects of desire, making them twice losers.What the film had was a certain truth to life, a capability to make you relate to Elio and reminisce of your own adolescent insecurity and attraction to older people... but in my case, it only worked on a superficial level. I wish the story was energized by the same anger or transgression of \"Blue is the Warmest Color\". It's intended warmth still left me cold.",

On one had, our characters are enormously fortunate (materially, intellectually and in their own good looks); on the other, the way that love (and lust) wrongfoots yet delights them is expertly portrayed, as is the fact that the knowlege that this is a casual relationship cannot completely pre-empt the pain of breakup.

The movie tries to make it out to be so much more than it actually was.It also felt so long, yes it's two hours long and slow paced but it felt so much longer. And for something that was that long there isn't as much dialogue, even more so meaningful dialogue that carried any weight. Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet did alright, but Michael Stuhlbarg was the only one who really drew my attention whenever he was on screen; and his conversation with Elio towards the end was the only aspect of the movie that lived up to expectation. The story was decent but felt like it was told surface level. Music was great. I just wanted to feel what the characters felt, the love, the rush, the mopes, the longing... that's what good movies do, yes?It just felt like a beautiful yet hallow film. Reading through what others who hold it in high regard's opinions on the movie makes me feel like either they probed too deeply to find more meaning where there wasn't much, or all the subtleties the film had just went unnoticed to me. The more I think on it the less I think of the movie which is frustrating because I loved the movie before I even watched it and wanted to see what others see in it as well.

            "content": "Luca Guadagnino's films are all about the transformative power of nature-the way it allows our true selves to shine through and inspires us to pursue our hidden passions. From the wild, windswept hills of \"I Am Love\" to the chic swimming pool of \"A Bigger Splash,\" Guadagnino vividly portrays the outside world as almost a character in itself-driving the storyline, urging the other characters to be bold, inviting us to feel as if we, too, are a part of this intoxicating atmosphere. Never has this been more true than in \"Call Me By Your Name,\" a lush and vibrant masterpiece about first love set amid the warm, sunny skies, gentle breezes and charming, tree-lined roads of northern Italy. Guadagnino takes his time establishing this place and the players within it. He's patient in his pacing, and you must be, as well. But really, what's the rush? It's the summer of 1983, and there's nothing to do but read, play piano, ponder classic art and pluck peaches and apricots from the abundant fruit trees. Chalamet and Hammer have just ridiculous chemistry from the get-go, even though (or perhaps because) their characters are initially prickly toward each other: testing, pushing, feeling each other out, yet constantly worrying about what the other person thinks. They flirt by trying to one-up each other with knowledge of literature or classical music, but long before they ever have any physical contact, their electric connection is unmistakable. Lazy poolside chats are fraught with tension; spontaneous bike rides into town to run errands feel like nervous first dates. They know what they've found has to end-we know it has to end. But a beautiful monologue from the always excellent Stuhlbarg as Elio's warmhearted and open-minded father softens the blow somewhat. It's a perfectly calibrated scene in a film full of them, and it's one of a million reasons why \"Call Me By Your Name\" is far and away the best movie of the year. In between is Guadagnino's inspired use of the Psychedelic Furs' \"Love My Way,\" an iconic '80s New Wave tune you've probably heard a million times before but will never hear the same way again. The first time he plays it, it's at an outdoor disco where Oliver feels so moved by the bouncy, percussive beat that he can't help but jump around to it and get lost in the music, lacking all sense of self-consciousness. Watching this towering figure just go for it on the dance floor in his Converse high-tops is a moment of pure joy, but it's also as if a dam has broken within Elio, being so close to someone who's feeling so free. The second time he plays it, toward the end of Oliver and Elio's journey, it feels like the soundtrack to a time capsule as it recaptures a moment of seemingly endless emotional possibility.",

There is an underarching theme, as described in a scene with Oliver and Dr. Perlman analyzing the slides of figures from antiquity, where the figures themselves are formed almost entirely in curves, evoking a sensuality that almost demands desire. Throughout the movie, there is this undertone of sensuality that somehow maintains this innocence and intimacy that feels nearly impossible to capture on screen. The relationship that develops between Elio and Oliver feels both tenuous and inevitable and explores homosexuality in a way that feels natural and emotional.The best way I can describe my feelings about this movie is that there's this feeling of unfamiliar nostalgia, like reading an old book about an ancient civilization in my grandpa's musty library. I can visualize with my senses what that centuries-old villa smells like in the backdrop of the Italian countryside, how the air tastes, how the openness of the day feels. The serene environment provides the backdrop for emotional experiences to take hold and requires the viewer to sit quietly along as Elio's self-discoveries and heartbreak feel as raw as if they were your own.

And Hammer's acting failed to make an attraction from a 17 year-old in the least convincing. As others have said, there was simply no chemistry.

While Awards talk is high across the board for actors Armie Hammer (\"The Social Network\") and Timothy Chalamet (\"Lady Bird\") - especially his final scene in the film, the breakout performance (in my book) here is Michael Stuhlbarg (TV's \"Fargo\") who embodies the soul of a thoughtful and honest father, and who delivers one of this years best end of film monologues - kudos to writer James Ivory for these final words of self revelation and wisdom. Also standing out in this film is French actress Esther Garrel (\"17 Girls\"), who graciously walks the line of the young women on the outside. As beautiful as the film develops into, the heart of film really doesn't get started until the proverbial fruit is pulled from the tree. Yes, cinematography (Sayombhu Mukdeeprom) sets the carefree warm summer Italian villa mood, and Ivory's story about this educationally astute family is appealing, but I wanted more of everything at a faster pace. Not to be missed here is the films score, written by Giorgio Moroder and Keith Forsey, featuring amazing songs by Sufjan Stevens.

When I was a freshmen on the first day of high school someone wrote \"Fag\" on my locker.So I never used the locker again the entire time I was in school. It was too \"Risky\". Sophomore year someone wrote \"Fag\" on my new OP Jacket. Afraid of what my parents would say when I brought it home I decided to \"Throw it away\" and act like it was stolen.This is what happened to me. Sad thing is that \"Yes I was gay\" but I never acted on it. It was drilled into your head gay sex =death. I was in my twenties by the time I came out and becoming the man I was born to be.When you are a straight guy growing up you have heroes and role models. When your gay \"You feel your on a sinking ship\" with no life rafts. You are drowning not in an ocean but in your own tears.So this brings me to the film \"Call Me By Your Name\" Set in 1983 in northern Italy, Call Me by Your Name chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, Elio Perlman (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), and Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father Samuel (Michael Stuhlbarg), an archaeology professor.What was nice was the film did not deal with AIDS, COMING OUT, or politics. It's just a love story. I do not want to give too much away but it was nice to see a film that I could relate too.What is a miracle is that since the film takes place in 1983 none of the issues you think it would deal are not talked about at all. This is a relief. The story is really about 2 men and a romantic Summer romance.",

            "content": "The setting is rural northern Italy in 1983. Oliver (Armie Hammer) is an American graduate student visiting the Perlman family for the summer to work on an internship with the family patriarch (Michael Stuhlbarg), an archeology and art professor who used to live and work in the U.S. Professor Perlman has a seventeen-year-old son Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) who is infatuated with Oliver.A great film is one that succeeds in getting past early hurdles and leaves one with an exhilarated feeling by the end. Here are the early hurdles for \"Call Me By Your Name\":1) The atmosphere was one of such super-privilege that it seemed inaccessible to more than 95% of the population. To have enough wealth to live in beautiful large home in northern Italy while being paid for working in the arts and archeology (with plenty of free time) seems like a dream for most of us. And when the family and their guest casually change languages (English, Italian and French with occasional German) while discussing all forms of the arts, it sometimes seemed rather lah-dee-dah.2) It took a while to get past the fact that the two young lead actors both looked like younger versions of other famous people. Chalamet resembles what could be a young Justin Trudeau. Even more so, Hammer could easily pass as a young version of the TV character \"Frasier\" played by Kelsey Grammer. Not only does he look, sound, and act like \"Frasier\", being a wealthy art-lover is the icing on the cake.The film not only passes these hurdles but the viewer even gets over the initial dislike of Oliver who, in the beginning, comes off as pompous and presumptuous (like I mentioned: \"Frasier\"). But in the second half, Hammer succeeds in showing the genuine vulnerability of Oliver to the point the viewer can feel compassion for him.Chalamet is even more powerful in subtly putting Elio's feelings on display after initially succeeding in reminding viewers of the frustration and insecurity of a teen falling in love with a young adult who seems so worldly.The character of Professor Perlman seems ornamental for most of the film but at the end, he delivers a monologue that is the movie's highlight - in addition to being one of the best scenes of movies released in 2017. It not only provides a shocking twist (and subtly at that), it gives a lecture on life that might seem to be addressed to young Elio; but no doubt it is the writer addressing members of the audience of all ages about our deepest feelings, memories, and life choices. Kudos to Stuhlbarg for his delivery, screenwriter James Ivory, and his source - the book by Andr\u00e9 Aciman.And the greatest kudos go to director Luca Guadagnino for putting this brilliant work together. He uses the beauty of northern Italy to mix with the film's deeper themes of love, compassion, and the willingness to risk and be vulnerable to more fully experience life. This goes way beyond any class differences that seemed so apparent at the film's beginning. And Guadagnino takes the viewer in so slowly, it's impossible to see how he did it - we're too caught up in our own feelings.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:1) Directing by Luca Guadagnino2) Acting Ensemble",

Armie Hammer, meanwhile, impresses in a completely different way as Oliver, an American arrived in Italy to work as an academic assistant for six weeks . Initially presenting himself as an old head on young shoulders, Mr Hammer seems to shed years as the story progresses, his spirit freed by his encounter with Chalamet's Elio.The first hour of this remarkable film winds up the sexual tension to an almost unendurable pitch, as misunderstandings give rise to missed opportunities and missteps. The course of true love never did run smooth....The film is not without flaws. Only an actor as good as Michael Stuhlbarg, as Elio's father (who is Oliver's employer) could convert a self-conscious, set-piece speech into the moving, compassionate declaration that we get. And although on occasion Luca Guadagnino's direction borders on genius -- including the astonishing final scene -- it occasionally resorts to unsubtle symbolism that would turn into something comic if it weren't for the commitment of the actors. All that aside, I find many images, lines of dialogue, and Mr Chalamet's incredible intensity, haunting me. I expect this will continue for quite a while yet.",

He can't help his face and physique, he inherited them from his parents combined DNA...and Jessica Chastain has red hair, so what's that got to do with the price of fish in China?\nChalamet has a super annoying screen presence and the movie is a sub par semi-arthouse wishy washy product. Unconvincing boring characters and story, talking heads instead of some action, and Armie Hammer is just the pitts. He can't act his way out of a paper bag. Nominated for an Oscar? Yeah, right!

            "content": "This is quite an emotionally-absorbing film. Call Me By Your Name is a story of sexual and emotional discovery during one summer in Northern Italy circa 1983. In it, we see a seventeen-year-old boy named\nElio developing and eventually exploring romantic feelings he has for an older male graduate student staying with his family for the summer. The boy's father is some kind of expert in linguistics or classical art, or some such thing. Apparently they host a grad student there each summer. The grad student, (Armie Hammer) immediately catches Elio's eye and they become fast friends. Elio has an advanced intellect himself, and their mutual Judaism also helps forge the bond. The two spend a lot of time together and banter back and forth between long bike rides and mingling with the locals. Its a very pleasant atmosphere in and around the family home. Obviously, once one reads a synopsis of the film, we know where things are headed, but it takes a while for it to play out on the screen. Both young men are cautious to say the least when exploring this potential relationship, and the two are also apparently involved sexually with local woman. Then, there are Elio's parents to potentially worry about, though this does not turn out to be an issue. Far from it. The first half of this film is a leisurely setup, the the second half deals with the affair and its consequences. There is quite an emotional payoff this author did not expect.The theme that made the most impact was the fleeting nature of such a relationship and the brief happiness it brings. When you are Elio's age, things change rapidly, and before you know it, you've passed a point where you can never get back to that place every again. Once Oliver hops on a train and heads off to live the rest of his life, Elio is crushed. And anyone who also shared a summer like that in their lives will feel it too. There is no going back. It was 31 years ago that I had this kind of summer, and within a matter of a few weeks of college, I knew that it would be impossible to find that happiness ever again. I understand Elio's despair even though I was the one who left. My relationship wasn't with another guy, but what does it matter?Once Oliver has moved on, Elio and his father have a very honest and touching conversation about what he has just experienced. His father (Michael Stuhlbarg) could not be more understanding. He does however lie to Elio when the boy asks if his mother knew about the affair.This is just one of those movies that, like the situation that it depicts, will be hard to duplicate. I cringe in hearing there are possible plans for a sequel, though Armie Hammer's career problems might prevent him being involved. You cannot recreate this kind of emotion in real life, and they should not try to do it in a sequel, either. 9 of 10 stars. The Hound.",

            "content": "Have you ever seen a movie that you liked but then once you see the ending you really really liked the movie? Well, that was Call Me By Your Name for me. What is undoubtedly a good movie for 115 minutes, becomes a great one after the full 132 minutes. Luca Guadagnino directs this film in such a calming but yet provocative manner. When the film needs to heat up, it does, and when it needs to slow down and provide a more methodical and thoughtful approach to romance, it most certainly does that as well.I guess with every big film there's always a section of the audience that comes out with serious backlash to some sort of aspect to the story. With Call Me By Your Name, it was that the romance between a 24-year old male (Oliver, played by Armie Hammer) and a 17-year old male (Ellio, played by Timothee Chalamet) is unethical and highly controversial. While I can't speak for how that particular group of people felt watching the film, I can tell you that I never once felt like this was a relationship that wasn't consensual. In fact, it's not even so much that it was definitely portrayed as consensual by the two males (and the parents of the younger male for that matter), but it's that the film never makes an outright statement saying that a relationship with this age gap is \"right\". It's a fictional story with fictional people. No one is telling you this relationship is right or glorifying what is considered to be a forbidden relationship.Personally, I took it more as a young male figuring out love for the first time and the person who helps him discover that love is an older (albeit only 7 years) male with more experience. I won't tell anyone who feels differently that they are wrong, that's simply the way I saw the story play out. And if I'm being honest, I thought the relationship between Ellio and Oliver was beautifully told and portrayed. Chalamet is magnetic and relatable (no matter what your sexual preference is) and Hammer nicely balanced the \"hard to get\" and effortlessly desirable part of the romance. I'm a straight man in my mid-20's but I found there to be things very relatable in both of their characters.The film also does a good job of presenting a world that feels foreign but also approachable. Taking place in Italy and in 1983, Call Me By Your Name is great escapist cinema, while also being something timeless in storytelling. Something only few films can capture, a few being Richard Linklater's Before Trilogy, which was clearly an inspiration. My only gripe would probably be the pacing, which is purposefully slower in nature. For me, I just would have liked something that gets to the punch a little quicker. Speaking of \"the punch\", the clear winner of this picture is Michael Stuhlbarg's ending speech about love to Ellio. I never thought a short monologue from one man to another could be so powerfully poignant, but that was this speech.8.6/10",

            "content": "In the idyllic setting of Northern Italy in the summer of 1983, an ebullient, wordly visiting scholar arrives to work closely with an archaeologist in excavating sensual Hellenistic statues. That the statue they uncover is a copy of Praxiteles' \"Venus\" speaks volumes about the story that is to unfold. The cocky and arrogant visitor is warmly welcomed into the home with the feeling that \"mi casa es su casa.\" But the welcome apparently extends to the scholar seducing the underage son of the host!In this eyebrow-raising drama, there is an extended period of flirtation and innuendo with the scholar (Oliver) and the seventeen-year-old boy (Elio). Lengthy scenes depict the mature man and the teenager cavorting, wrestling, bicycling, swimming, dancing, and engaging in general horseplay. Their mantra could be \"Catch me if you can!!!\"Finally, the moment of truth arrives where the boy is seduced. Then, the visitor leaves, returning to his fianc\u00e9e in America where he will be married in a heterosexual union. Yet someone both the boy and the older man cannot let go of their febrile union in the lush terrain of Tuscany. Astonishingly, the film draws extensively on ancient Greek culture with the statues and philosophers to portray the ancient Greek tradition of the mature male \"initiating\" a boy into sex with the sense that the male-male love connection is superior to that of a man and a woman.The most jaw-dropping moment in the film is a lengthy monologue at the end where the professor, who has by now discovered that the coupling of the visitor and the son has taken place under his own roof, delivers a pious and sanctimonious lecture to his son. The father implies to Elio that he will never experience anything like the love ardor he felt for the older man and that he will likely be physically and emotionally \"bankrupt at the age of thirty,\" due to the humdrum experiences he will have in the future with women! It would have been interesting if the professor's wife had been eavesdropping on her husband's paternal wisdom imparted to her son.In one of the most dishonest subplots of the film, young Elio seduces a young woman friend at the time that he is falling in love with the older man. He then callously discards the young woman, undoubtedly breaking her heart. It was completely unconvincing when the young woman later shakes hands with Elio, asserting she harbors no ill will, and hopes that they will be friends for life! In matters of the heart, that is usually not the way it works.The smarmy nature of this pretentious art film comes across in the bonus segment titled \"The Making of Call Me By Your Name\" that is included in the DVD version of the film. The young actor playing Elio has bought into the film's phony message that the story is \"a lens into a young person's existence.\" That assertion sounds like another one of the platitudes spoken in the film, such as the choice words from the father that \"nature has cunning ways to finding our weakest spot.\" On the other hand, the actor is right on the mark about another inference of the word \"lens.\" One aspect of the film that was successful was the cinematography. The filmmakers chose to use the 35mm single lens throughout the shoot. The lens permitted both long shots and close-ups in continuous film sequencing. The Italian locations, landscapes, and cityscapes were examples of creative work with the camera. Unfortunately, the beautiful work with the lens did not make up for the shallow and unconvincing narrative that reflected the sordid nature of hedonistic and self-absorptive human conduct in the shenanigans that were occurring in the old Italian villa. To boil the film down to the baser instincts that it was portraying, a more apt title would have simply been \"Boys Will Be Boys!\"",

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name is a complicated but powerful story filled with emotion and beauty. It addresses two people and the feelings they have for each other in a breathtaking way. It demonstrates how adolescent love can be both adventurous and difficult. The two strong leads equally contribute to the overall impact viewers feel from the beginning to the end of the film. Many films that have male leads fail to embrace the true emotions they feel. This film does the opposite. It shows all of the raw and true emotion that each character feels. At the beginning of the film, I feel like it lacked some context in explaining who Oliver was exactly. Other than that, everything else was clear and thoroughly thought out.\nElio Perlman is a 17 year old boy who spends his summer in Italy with his family. Elio's father invites a graduate student named Oliver to stay with them and to work as an intern. Over the course of the summer, Elio and Oliver begin to explore their relationship and eventually fall in love. With Elio being only 17, he is confused and his emotions are constantly in flux. Elio has been coming to Italy every summer since he can remember. With no responsibilities, Elio is able to take on many hobbies such as music, reading, and biking. He knows his way around town, and many of locals as well. A summer romance with a local girl has been going on, but there is something about Oliver that makes Elio feel a different way with an instant connection.\nWith the story set in the Lombardy region of northern Italy in the summer, it makes for truly beautiful scenery. I was fascinated by the elegance of the architecture and landscape shown throughout the film. It added to the love story and worry free environment. The scenes of them swimming in the rivers and biking through the city are things that make the film have the charming romance that is does. The shots were stunning and visually pleasing to watch.\nBecause the film is set in Italy in 1983, same-sex relationships would not be entirely accepted. Elio and Oliver act hesitant to admit that they have feelings for each other. Eventually they do show their feelings and admit to one another. The film does an amazing job at portraying this idea and displaying the situation similarly to how it would be if it was actually during this time period. Another movie that came to mind when analyzing this one, was Love Simon. Both films consist of same-sex relationships that start off being timid and end up being something special with a significant impact on the audience.\nThroughout the film, the acting was constantly impressive. Elio, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet performs in such an organic and confident way, which makes viewers even more drawn to the story. Oliver, played by Armie Hammer, perfectly portrays a man who is intelligent, charming, and empathetic towards Elio who is a lot younger than him. Not only is the acting outstanding, but Elio is shown playing the piano and speaking three different languages. The film production and costumes portray the rural part of Italy in the late 1980's exactly.\nThe soundtrack includes a mix of classical, and subtle italian themed music that incorporates into the film perfectly. The film has a relaxed type of feel, and the music illustrates that in a exceptional way. Being that the whole film was shot with a 35mm camera lens is not only extremely impressive, but allows for the scenes to feel more realistic and effective to the viewers.\nThe overall story focuses more on the emotional connection between the characters instead of the characters themselves. It embraces the things that come with first love and inevitable heartbreak. The jealousy, the nervous energy, and the sensitivity. The message is executed in such a impactful way. In one of the last scenes of the film, Elio is heart broken after Oliver leaves. His father comforts him and tells him that what him and Oliver had was special. His father responds in such a positive way that makes Elio feel very accepted and loved for who he is. His father tells him how powerful love can be and that he is happy for Elio. This strong connection between a father and son creates such a positive message to the audience. The impact this movie has on viewers is beyond words. The film leaves us with the gorgeous song that Sufjan Stevens wrote which wraps the film up in a brilliant way.",

There was no reason for it to be as long as it was. It just felt like it was dragging on for hours with no real purpose for doing so. In its 132 minute runtime, it manages to be both uneventful and completely empty.Call me By Your Name is nothing other than just another gay movie. It does nothing to separate itself from other gay romance movies in the slightest. How is this any more than the male version of Blue is the Warmest Color?Isn't the entire plot of this borderline pedophilia? Like this kid is 17 having sex with a 24 year old, who by the way looks far older, probably more like 30 (which is how old Hammer was when this was shot). Either way, there is seemingly no chemistry between the lead actors. It's set in the 80's, but there is no noticeable stylization from that decade, or any other obvious reason for it to be set then. \nMuch like this, a number of other elements just didn't seem to matter or have any effect on the plot line at all. Why was it set in Italy? Who knows. Why were the characters Jewish? Doesn't matter apparently. Gay porn is probably much more satisfying than this.",

However it was about so so much more and it is a movie that requires several viewings to draw out the multiple and profound themes that lay just below the surface.The movie looks atThe nature of sexuality linked to age and the tragedy of a sexual prime slipping away. The father says \"there will come a time when no one looks at you, let alone comes near\", and yet he appears \"happily\" married to Elio's mother. His message is to seize the moment to avoid regret.That any sexuality cannot be ultimately \"forced\" or suppressed despite the strictures of any society, and that we should just be ourselves.The careful way the age gap between Elio (17) and Oliver (24) was handled, they are both equal in their needs and desires at that moment in time, planets colliding.Elio adolescent liaison with Marzia demonstrated his strength of desire for Oliver far outweighed his attachment to her. This was nothing personal, never stated, but entirely understood by her when they agreed to be lifelong friends.The metaphor for Oliver was \"later\", but in fact the reality was \"now\".The movie went on to introduce a breathless heat and sumptuous cinematography with a ravishing score.Timothee Chalamet brought a animalistic, instinctive and nuanced portrayal of teenage infatuation. Without being to effusive he demonstrates the art of invisible acting effortlessly, this man is the entire package. I only hope he is given the quality work that respects his talent.Armie Hammer was solid and he really gave a great performance and perhaps well outside his comfort range as a non-European lol!I really loved this movie, it is just a joy to watch 10/10",

In terms of the movie however I can see why it was filmed in such a way, as it allowed us to watch the mundane regular things a boy would do during summer in 1980's Italy. The film could've move slightly quicker, but it set the scene well for what was intended. Thankfully the film had some great cinematography. Some of the camera angles were fantastically placed to make the most of the beautiful locations. The excellent score compliments the scenes nicely. Timothee Chalamet was very impressive as Elio. He perfectly portrayed the confusion and angst that a boy in his situation would be feeling. As the second half of the movie develops it becomes clear where Elio's feeling sway; and it leads to the best scene in the film; a speech from Elio's father. Essentially it's about accepting love when it comes along because it's not something everyone is lucky enough to experience. It's a well scripted scene. From a personal perspective there were parts of the film I felt uncomfortable about, including Oliver's interest in Elio, who is technically still a child. There was certainly an element of taking advantage that came across. That said there was a lot to admire about the film. The way it looked and sounded was great; Chalamet gave a fantastic leading performance.",

            "content": "\"Call Me By Your Name\" is about a teenage boy who has a gay affair with an older man who is rooming at the Italia villa owned by his parents. This teenager doesn't get yelled at to clean up his room or to stop smoking pot. He isn't that kind of kid, and this isn't that kind of movie. When our 17-year-old protagonist isn't playing classical music on the piano or speaking fluent Italian or expounding upon obscure WWI battles, he snuggles up to mom and dad in the semi-darkness as mom strokes his head and translates German romantic poetry in a dreamlike whisper. You know, just like your mother did when you were 17. Dad finds out all about his son's gay fling, and his big moment comes towards the end of the movie where he cautions his son about the pitfalls of \"feeling nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste.\" Then Dad pauses his flowery monologue to ask: \"Have I spoken out of turn?\" You know, just like your dad did when you were 17 and he was giving you a little fatherly advice about your sex life. I could not stand those parents with all their smug PhD tones and carefully measured phrases and over-the-top liberalism! They seem to transcend mere mortality with their how-to-raise-your-child perfection; it's as if they do their parenting way up on Olympus with the Gods. Even when the ex-boyfriend calls the house some months later to announce his engagement, these parents raise nary a peep of disapproval that their scoundrel houseguest was giving blowjobs to their teenage son when they weren't looking. Instead, they whoop with sheer delight at the older man's newfound happiness. You know, just like your parents did that time when you were a teenager and your adult gay lover married somebody else.News flash! You, too, can experience this sort of parent-teenager bliss even though you don't have a PhD or live in an Italian villa! Why, it even works in suburbia with boring, run-of-the-mill people and boring heterosexual relationships! So the next time your 17 year old daughter has sex with the older auto mechanic renting your basement suite, just remember to tell her about \"feeling nothing so as not to feel anything\" so she's sure to cherish her feelings! Oh, and don't forget to ask her if you've \"spoken out of turn\" so she doesn't get pissed off at you!Insufferable.",

Every character of this film is a poor copy of a real life personality: see the professor who is a more handsome, gay friendly version of Umberto Eco. Under all this stylization lies nothing.

This movie feels more of a poetry to love as it captures the raw feelings of the two characters Elio and Oliver with great magnificence. The story which is being told to us feels so real as if it is actually happening infront of our eyes. The background noise sits in quite well and makes us feel like we are experiencing it too. It is a heartfelt coming of age movie about two men who fall in love during a summer in Italy, during the times when homosexuality was stigmatized. Luca Guadagnino very tastefully capture the essence of love,longing and desire and the pain and sorrow that gets associated with that. He spectacularly shows us the pure, akward yet intrensic moments of a budding relationship and the passion of new love with the sense of freshness. He tells us a story about love which must have been felt by many people over the course of their lifes but is capable of encapsulating it with artistic visuals and great acting by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer. The most fascinating thing about the movie is how Luca uses his tools of symbolisms and cinematography to depict what the characters felt on the insides. The track \"Mystery of Love\" by Sufjan Stevens - beautifully captures the heart of their relationship and makes me wish for a love like that.Everything about the movie is so beautiful sometimes words fall short to describe something so immensely beautiful. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's acting is so iconic in this movie that I totally became a fan of him instantly. He made me feel the full spectrum of my emotions in 2 hrs 12 mins. The very last scene even after being so static in nature is one of my favourite as it shows the magnificence of Chalamet's acting. I stan Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet!!!! The climax is just everything ufff.I just wish I could forget that I ever watched this movie and rewatch it for the first time again for the immersive experience.

His scenes with Elio don't seem to have any spark at all (from his side, the kid playing Elio makes a wonderful job). Also, how am I supposed to believe a guy obviously in his 30's is playing a 24 year old?. As much as I find him handsome and a decent actor (I only seen him in \"The man from U.N.C.L.E\"), he didn't live up to his role\nChalamet and his parents are other story. You can see and almost feel what Elio is going through, and for the year it's supposed to be (80's) his parent are quite open minded.\nNow the ending, spoilers start here...Oliver call the family after gone for months for Hanuka, only to give Elio the wonderful news he's engaged, but, oh yeah, he \"remembers everything\"...how lovely...Then we get to see Elio crying in front of the fire while the credits role...Oliver fell as a selfish and cruel character in my opinion at this point. I'm not saying he should have stayed and get married (\"they\" are too young for that), but dissapearing and only calling in Hanuka to destroy Elio's heart only seems like a cruel move.

The music throughout the film was Melodious. But where it was slack was the character of Oliver. Maybe mis cast, maybe not clear writing but something about his character is just so unsatisfactory. However, you feel for Elio all the times and you might find yourself shedding a tear or two for him at times.Almost solely due to his performance, Timoth\u00e9e has given life to this movie and made it one of the good coming of age movies out there !",

            "content": "\"Call Me by Your Name\" is one of the more tedious gay-themed films I have seen. It is impossible to care about its main character, because you never really get to know him. The movie is drastically overlong, at over two hours, and feels like twice that length. You'd think you'd get some kind of insight into the protagonist after spending all that time with him. You'd be wrong.I wonder if \"Call Me by Your Name\" is actually just an exercise in cynicism. Hear me out: It's about a young gay man who is attracted to the boring hunk who comes to stay. They end up having sex, but the young man also has sex with a girl. Aside from that, the protagonist doesn't do or say much. He just lies around reading books and smoking.Here's where the cynicism comes in. Could it be that the filmmakers believe that if their character is gay, he doesn't HAVE to say or do anything interesting - people will go see the movie and defend it regardless, because he's gay?Just a thought.Armie Hammer has to be one of the dullest actors around. He makes absolutely no impression. I have seen him in movies before, but didn't recognize him in this, because he is so boring you forget about him from movie to movie, or even scene to scene. Just as there is no attempt to make the protagonist interesting, there's also no attempt to make this object of his lust interesting either.People are probably going to be too scared to say they didn't like a movie such as \"Call Me by Your Name\", for fear of being branded homophobes. I am not: characters have to do more to keep my interest than just being gay, black, female, whatever. \"Call Me by Your Name\" is a snoozefest.",

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name is not a complicated story. It's just a short love between two teenagers in summer. But after the overwhelming theme of love has been repeatedly interpreted, this movie can still move people with such a simple narrative, probably because it is the most original presentation of \"love\".In most love stories, there are various resistances, which may come from society, family, time, space, and self ... These resistances are on the one hand a source of dramatic conflict, on the one hand, they also weaken their own love \"Discussion of the kernel. However, the film created a nearly closed space from the beginning.In the summer of 1983, in a small Italian town, complicated mobile communications have not yet invaded people's internal and external spaces. Paper and pens are still common tools for expression and communication, and the time is very slow. Retro double-storey villas, orchards, maids, everything does not need to worry about Elio, he only needs to write music, listen to music, read, eat a bit, and daily chores that may hinder his spiritual life are all insulated from him.The resistance from the family and the outside world in homosexuality has no trace here. Elio's parents are all open-minded intellectuals. They said to Elio: \"Eli baby, you can talk to us about anything, you know.\" Sensing his and Oliver's feelings, they just inadvertently expressed their support, not to make Elio feel embarrassed or ashamed.This is a space that can almost be called zero resistance. In addition, it is also beautifully distorted-sunshine, orchard, clear blue sea water, endless apricot juice, young and beautiful flesh, wanton flowing music, philosophical discussions interspersed ... The environment is overflowing The catalyst of love. In a space tailored for them by story creators, it is almost impossible for two beautiful and intelligent young people to meet without a love affair.\nSummer has finally passed, winter is coming, how many days and nights, time will always ease all the pain. However, the brief calm that Elio obtained was overwhelmed by Oliver's phone call. The two casually exchanged information on each other on the phone, and when they learned that Oliver was about to get married, Elio seemed very calm. This was expected. After the greeting, they fell into silence, Elio stuck in the chair, muttering tones, and began calling Oliver far away on the other side of the earth with his name again and again. You remember at that time, in your arms, you told me, Call me by your name, and I will call you by mine ... At this moment, the teenager was defeated again. Hanging up the phone, Elio walked casually from this room to another room, the pretentious expression relaxed, the fire crackling, he walked over, squatted down, and tears began to flow down without listening. The camera is here to shoot his crying face all the way, and then the list of cast members appears. This picture is the last shot of the movie and the most sad picture. Forgetting you is the most difficult thing I have ever done, but you just use a phone call easily and let me give up my efforts.",

            "content": "Heading into Call Me By Your Name with high expectations after hearing so many great things about it, I have to admit that I'm quite baffled by the near-unanimous praise it has garnered since its premiere. Tedious, overlong & painfully boring, this coming-of-age romance is one hell of a disappointment.Set in 1980s Italy, the story of Call Me By Your Name follows Elio; a young kid on the cusp of adulthood who's instantly smitten by Oliver, his father's new assistant who will be sending the summer with them. As the two begin spending more time with each other, a beautiful bond blossoms between them.Directed by Luca Guadagnino, this is my first stint with his works and while I do find the simplicity & purity of its tender romance a plus, the lethargic pace at which it all unfolds makes the entire experience a very frustrating sit. Sure it allows more space for the characters to breathe but there's nothing about them that's compelling.Wandering aimlessly for the most part with no sense of direction, it had me wishing for the end around the halfway mark only. The film does find its sure footing during the final act but it takes too long to get there and the interest is already lost by that time. Its soothing camerawork & serene setting do help but even they can't fill the emptiness that lies in between.Performances on the other hand are commendable. The film packs a reliable cast in Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg & others, with Chalamet impressing the most with an emotionally complex input and is at his best during the final frames. Hammer leaves a mark of his own while Stuhlbarg chips in with good support and his final monologue is the only moment that resonated with me.On an overall scale, Call Me By Your Name is a deceptively simple, melancholic & uncontaminated portrait of first love that seems to have won over everyone but left me indifferent for the most part. At least those couple songs by Sufjan Stevens are mesmerising. There's no denying that Timothee Chalamet is a revelation here but if you're not already invested in his character's journey, then Call Me by Your Name is going to be one excruciating cinematic experience.",

Few films are able to transport me so fully that I feel I'm there with the characters, experiencing each moment as if it's happening in real time. There is something so palpable about this film, like you can just reach out and touch it. The setting and mood are absolutely intoxicating to the point where you can almost feel the water through your hands and the sun on your face. Pinpointing how the film creates this effect is nearly impossible because it's really the combination of so many things: the colors, lighting, editing, music, pacing, and, of course, the incredible performances by its two leads. This is definitely a film that lives and breathes in the subtle details, which collectively create a feeling of richness and depth. Crucial as well is the film's masterful use of restraint in its patient, languid rhythm that perfectly captures the feeling of a lazy summer afternoon. Overall a beautiful, poignant love story that feels simultaneously intimate and overwhelming; blissful and melancholic. Destined to be a classic. Hell, it already feels like one.Decent 4.5/5",

The score and soundtracks are beautiful, all of them either charming by themselves or fitting to the film's time and place. The overall acting feels natural and real, if you're part of an Italian family or have lived amongst them, you'll recognize the warm and homely vibes from their interactions. This feeling is also reinforced through the beautiful setting of the italian summer; the color palette and filters are all fitting too.So, what is it lacking? The actual plot is dull. Some scenes shine through and might add some meaning, but half the film is just filling: characters going to places, staying at places, having daily life interactions with each other, with very little dialogue through it all. A lot of it could have been cut off and it wouldn't matter. But, most importantly, the relationship between the leads had no real chemistry between them; we do see Elio sneaking glances and touching Oliver's stuff, but when did Oliver even start being attracted to Elio? And what about the girls? Why do they keep making passes at them if they're not into it? The conversations are scarce and don't help clarify anything either- not until the very end, at least. I do realize a more poetic, intellectually romantic sort of public might find their relationship more appealing, though. I'm pretty sure most of the really bad reviews (1 to 4 ratings) are because of the disappointment resulting from the high expectations its hype generated. Taking that aside, it's just a (seudo?)intellectual movie trying to display love and relationships in a natural setting, nothing much else happening. Nothing great, but nothing horrendous either.",

Beautifully shot, evocative of a lazy, lovestruck summer month in the gorgeous Italian countryside, it's a thoughtful, peaceful slice of bittersweet romance if not a terribly active one. Strangely edited, we'll cut away in the middle of a conversation but linger for long stretches of scenery and minor character actions. That does effectively convey the boy's listlessness, his adolescent ennui within a magnificent family estate, but it also leads to major pacing problems. Though it runs just over two hours, I caught myself glancing at the clock after one. Our two leads, Elio (the boy) and Oliver (the intern), share the flicker of chemistry, but initially flirt with so much nuance and subtext that I thought I'd missed something when it came time for their inevitable heart-to-heart. The climax is excellent, with a charged, open-hearted monologue from Elio's father and an unforgettable close-up during the credits, but by that point I was more than ready to check out.

            "content": "Film Review: \"Call Me By Your Name\" is possibly the name of the best film of 2017. I will likely remember this movie more than any other film I saw this year. Set in the summer of 1983 in a countryside villa in Italy, filmmaker James Ivory (\"Maurice;\" \"A Room with a View;\" \"The Remains of the Day;\" \"Howard's End\") penned a screenplay, adapted from Andre Acimen's novel, that is truly breathtaking. Intermixing American English, French and Italian, Mr. Ivory carefully crafts a human story.The main characters are Elio, played by Timothee Chalamet (\"Interstellar;\" \"Lady Bird\"), and Oliver, portrayed by Armie Hammer (\"The Social Network;\" \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\") Elio's father is an eminent professor of archaeology who brings in Oliver, a doctoral student, for the summer to work on his thesis. Bathed in golden sunlight and the ravishing Italian countryside, Elio slowly develops feelings for Oliver.Director Luca Guadagnino (\"I am Love;\" \"Bertolucci on Bertolucci\") triumphs. With only one read through with the actors and shooting most of the film in sequence, Mr. Guadagnino achieves an honesty that is rare on film. Never forced and full of doubt, insecurity, hormones, and missed opportunities, everything about Elio's first love feels like what I remember when I fell in love for the first time. It's a heady experience to be transported back to what it felt like to be in love at 17 or 18 or to remember what it felt like to have a romance that begins in the long afternoons of June and ends when the sun begins to set too early in August. Mr. Chalamet's performance is without a doubt one of the best of the year. He navigates a quiet, yet soulful and sensual summer with disarming ease. He leads the screen with a confidence equal to Armie Archer's bold American bravado. The gentle, yet fiercely emotional, relationship revealed over the course of the movie is stunning.I must also note that this is one of those films that makes you feel like you've been on vacation. The cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom and attention to detail construct a vivid experience. The charming cobblestone streets, beautiful rocky trails through pine-filled forests, leading to lazy rivers and watering holes are experiential. This film is pretty perfect. \"Call Me By Your Name\" is a film where you meet real characters and visit a very distinct place in a very specific year. Winner of the American Film Institute's Best Films of 2017, nominated for 3 Golden Globes, including Best Picture - Drama, and nominated for 6 Independent Spirit Awards. I understand that at the New York Film Festival \"Call Me By Your Name\" received the longest standing ovation in the festival's history. I hope the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences likes this film as much as I did, because it deserves an Oscar Best Picture nomination.",

            "content": "I was so excited to see this film, and I was glad that such a film was even created because we rarely see the LGBT community represented so clear in cinema and when we do, the films themselves aren't that good. I couldn't wait to see it because I was certain it was going to be amazing.The film started, the background was beautiful, the soundtracks too. I was waiting for their relationship to 'happen' and waited for a very long time. Nothing wrong with a build-up I thought as I became more and more anxious to see them get together at last. Both Elio and Oliver are interesting people but I could't quite sympathize with them. For some reason, I didn't see past their carnal desires. I wanted to see Elio struggle with the fact that he liked men, maybe fear what his parents would think of him if they found out. I wanted to see Oliver question his sexuality as well, before their platonic relationship turned sexual. It was like I waited an hour to see how they came together. They were distant from each other for an hour and I didn't feel a connection there and next thing you know Elio tells Oliver he wants him to know about some 'things' which Oliver correctly translates to ''I want you'' and they start making out. In other films with couples, I get attached to them, understand their feelings, feel their longing and struggles, and I'm rooting for them. I was waiting for this moment in this film as well but it never came.What's more, I wish I could understand Elio's sexuality, as he sleeps both with Marzia and Oliver. I couldn't figure out whether he slept with Marzia thinking of Oliver or he actually liked her, too. Oliver says he misses him but informs him he's engaged to a woman. Is he bisexual or just gay but can't do otherwise? It would help me understand if this film is about lost/forbidden love or just a fling that was good while it lasted but couldn't be anything more than that.Nevertheless, it's a coming of age film that depicts first love nicely and has a very moving scene in which Elio and his father talk about Oliver. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is extraordinary and his performance is compelling.",

            "review_title": "This film is sentimental and cruel: depth missing",
            "content": "First of all, beware of the fact that the film uses three languages, English, Italian and French. The French is hard to follow but yet from what I can hear it is some French. The Italian is for me an opera language and the Italian in this film does not have that music, a lot flatter. The English is standard American English and all foreign languages, I mean non-English languages are subtitled in English, still standard American English, what they call mid-Atlantic English.Second? this film is an adaptation of the eponymous novel but it cuts off all the last part, after the phone call on Hanukkah, the phone call being identified as being on Hanukah, which is from a Jew to a Jew a very cruel present, since the phone call tells Elio that the unforgettable affair he had with Oliver is not only finished but it has no hope for no future since Oliver is getting married. The point is not even that they were lovers, even friends should not behave like that. Friendship should have no end, but too often it does. And when the two friends are lovers, gay lovers mind you, that makes things a little bit tricky, but there are some more decent ways. In this case, Oliver is gross and cruel, \"crudel\" as they say in so many Italian operas. Third, the cutting off of the last part of the novel gives no future to Elio and we cannot know anything and of course, it makes the story a soap opera more than a real-life adventure. The last part showed that this affair had irreversible consequences for Elio. In the film, we assume it will. But the novel also made Elio meet Oliver again many years later in the USA on Oliver's campus. And that profound ending that demonstrates how impossible it is to forget what happens to you at 17 and for a young adult what happens to you with a 17-year old boy, who should have known better: just the evasive eyes of Oliver when the train is leaving. He had already closed the chapter. Not so easy in the novel. There might be some hope after all.But fifth, we miss the main conclusion of Elio's at the end of the novel:\"You are the only person I'd like to say goodbye to when I die because only then will this thing I call my life make any sense. And if I should hear that you died, my life as I know it, the me who is speaking with you now, will cease to exist. Sometimes I have this awful picture of waking up in our house in B. and, looking out to the sea, hearing the news from the waves themselves, He died last night. We missed out on so much. It was a coma. Tomorrow I go back to my coma, and you to yours. Pardon, I didn't mean to offend - I am sure yours is no coma.\"I said hope, yes but for Elio, because Oliver's response is ethically and empathetically disquieting: \"No, a parallel life.\"The film then is beautiful all along, though slightly more discreet about the real sex and going on the bike on the following morning but it remains very sentimental and superficial. Such a friendship, especially if love is added, between a younger man and a slightly (or much) older man raises many questions about the effects on both men and what such a friendship or an affair can enable both men to do that they couldn't have done before, but also what it can block that could have been brought to life. And I am not only speaking of girls and women, marriage or not marriage. I like the film but I am frustrated and I find it too emotional for a soft-hearted audience. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",

            "content": "'Call Me By Your Name' is a simple and beautiful love story, with brilliant visuals, acting, and soundtrack. Luca Guadagnino ends his trilogy of desire (which follows 'I Am Love' and 'A Bigger Splash') with the best installment yet. It is by far the most visually stunning, with a ravishing, soft color palette that brings the hazy Italian summer to life. From the rivers to the fields and the old buildings, the scenery in this film, accompanied by the cinematography and direction, is a visual delight. The storyline, based on the book of the same name, is surely an engaging one, in all of its simplicity. While for the first act of the film, there's not much plot development, it rather effortlessly shares little moments of the summer that ultimately was nothing to be complaining about. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer are both perfect in their leading roles, with the both of them portraying their characters exceptionally well. Chalamet's young and raw talent steals the film, with his moving performance of a complex and infatuated individual coming to terms with his identity. While there's absolutely nothing wrong with Hammer's performance, as he does it flawlessly, his character is not as likable as one would expect as he comes across as rather arrogant and perfunctory. It wasn't clear whether his character cared that much, and thus made the whole romance questionable. This, of course, went hand-in-hand with the heartbreaking ending, in which Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's talent was truly shown. What also makes the film worthy of its acclaim is the soundtrack, which a wonderful mix of classical pieces, Italian pop music and original tracks by indie artist Sufjan Stevens which definitely have a profound effect on the atmosphere of the film and add to its beauty and heartache. Overall, this film is certainly worthy of the critical acclaim it has received and is Guadagnino's best film yet, due to its beauty in every aspect.",

And in the process of adapting this bittersweet story of gay love the filmmakers have improved on an often beautifully written novel that tends to ramble with its first person narrative, punctuated by vivid descriptions of the Italian land and seascapes it wallows in , often to the sensual delight of the reader. As he did with the equally colorful , Italy -based romantic drama of \"I Am Love\" (2009), Guadagnino paints with robust, sometimes subtle cinematic brushstrokes to bring forth an evocative atmosphere of heat, sun, flora and fruit as vivid background to the main story at hand.What is it about the best Italian film directors whose penchant for telling stories is so entwined with production values that dazzle the eye, be it in black and white our color? Luchino Visconti, Frederico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni , Bernardo Bertolucci and Franco Zeffirelli all had this gift, and it is readily apparent that the torch has been passed on to Luca Guadagnino. Abetted by the brilliant acting of Timothee Chalamet, Michael Stuhlberg and the impossibly handsome and able Armie Hammer, Call Me By Your Name emerges as an unforgettable, erotic and deeply moving saga of love found, lost and remembered.",

Elio's girlfriend was just a sexual prop to develop what story line?? I felt far worse for her than i did him, How humiliating to have sex with a person you really like only for him to be secretly having a sexual affair and not at all interested in your feelings at all. I understand how a story like this could be romantic to some but it also seemed wildly confusing and painful (remember that summer I had sex with that grown man who got married and still calls me?) That seems incredibly painful. Also all the reference to ancient greek art played into this theme of the older man with young boy thing that left a foul taste in my mouth.

In my opinion, the film could be have shorter, and would have benefited on that. It's a too slow and somewhat tedious. The film's content is also not very new, but it's beautifully filmed. It also reflects on a theme that shows that we are not going back so many years back before gay relationships were taboo and that such love had to be hidden. In addition, this is also about an adult man initiating a relationship with a teenage boy. There is solid craftsmanship in both filming, acting and role- playing. But the direction could have been tighter, in my opinion, and the film is too long. But I still enjoyed seeing it.",

            "content": "Not the kind of movie I would seek out or watch but it generated so much positive buzz and every time I came across something referring to it on YouTube or the interwebz, I would read people gushing praise and hurling adjectives at it.Decided to rent it off iTunes the one night as I had nothing to watch and I wasb't in the mood for reading or playing a game and I was spellbound right up until the end. This was one of the most moving and beautiful pictures I have ever seen. I was skeptical about the praise initially because as often is the case when something is hyped to the heavens, be it a book or a movie or a CD or a game, you are bound to end up being disappointed.Not here. Everything from the wonderfully lazy and meandering way this love story unfolds (just like I expect summer holiday to play out). to the gorgeous Italian landscape, to the outstanding soundtrack (the music is just as much a character in this film and the songs chosen elevate the entire film), to the performances from every single actor. While Chalamet is the breakout star here, and his work is exceptional for such a young actor, what surprised me the most was the depth and vulnerability on display from Armie Hammer, not somebody I would associate with this kind of delicate acting given his poster boy movie looks. I became an instant fan. Don't even get me started on Michael Stuhlbarg's monologue towards the end of the film. It felt like being hit by speeding train. It leaves you shattered.This movie is sublime and is now in my top 5 favorite films of all time. Thank to to everyone involved in making this, I haven't been moved, to tears, like this in a long time.or felt such a profound sense of emotions since I was a young man in my late teens and early twenties (I am now in my mid forties).Excellent, excellent stuff.",

He has a weird obsession with this guy who constantly said that they can't be together. In the end though they still loved each other. Well... Elio loved Oliver. Who knows if it's mutual. It probably is because they had sex a lot and they went to Rome together. I think it was rome.\n Also if you read the book i suggest reading the first half. The second half is kind of boring.",

            "content": "It is absolutely refreshing to see someone trying something NEW, INNOVATIVE, and BOLD in independent and homosexual-themed cinema. I'd argue this movie is not \"gay\" it is a love story. The nuance is layered, and articulate - and for the educated (or those seeking deeper understanding of classics). That said, it relates directly on a very human level. It is the best character study of a teen-aged male I've seen to date. This film pushes aside all the tired, clich\u00e9 \"McGay\" films that have littered the landscape for far too long. It is also groundbreaking in finally pushing back against the current culture of leftist PC one-size-fits-all nonsense. The characters aren't role models, or carrying flags on their backs (Thankfully) they're human beings. What?? A film about people being people and not \"saving the world\" or \"fighting\" some ridiculous political battle?? Again, thank you.(Spoiler - you've been warned). My only quibble structurally is the filmmaker needed another edit, and seemed at times to get in his own way. 10 minutes at least could have been spared.We don't learn who Oliver 'is' enough. The story line that he was lying in wait for Elio to 'come around' doesn't necessarily add up in the narrative as presented. The stop-off for a glass of water - just to make the point that Right WIng fascism is alive ad well (image of Il Duce/Mussolini) doesn't really do anything - especially when they arrive 2 minutes later at a fresh Spring. I also found some of the repetitive biking scenes monotonous - we get it - you got a great location and you're serving us so much beauty - however too much sugar can make your stomach hurt. The end scene with the father will play well with the common audience I believe, but it seems a bit long & forced. HOWEVER, none of this negates the 10-star brilliance of the film, and its definitive place in a new canon.I just hope the PC keyboard warriors don't ruin it and make other innovators shy away. It's time to keep pushing that envelope. Well done! (The understatement of the century).",

It's a beautiful story full of great and memorable characters, an incredible soundtrack and memorable and well directed scenes.\nEvery single scene in this movie has an impressive cinematography, the colors, the scenarios, everything is beautiful and artistic and gave us an incredible summer vibe. I've seen the movie during a winter night and sometimes I felt something that I can't explain, like if I was watching the movie during the summer and feeling that vibe (I'm really sorry, but I don't know how to explain).\nThe chemistry between the main characters Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer, some scenes made me wonder if they're are a real couple in the real life. Even the scenes between Timoth\u00e9e with Esther Garrel look realistic. These actors deserve an Oscar.The only problem I've found was during the Elio's coming out for Oliver, I mean, Elio never said was gay, how Oliver understood that?Call Me by Your Name tells a beautiful and sad story in the same time. Why is sad? It's sad because we know since the beginning, Oliver only came to Italy for the summer and after that he needs to go to USA again. I won't tell if that happens or not.\nI'm sure a lot of people will love, even if they're straight, bisexual or gay. Because this is a story about our first love and disappointments. It made me want to see more about these characters. I'm really waiting for a sequel and know what happened to Elio and Oliver.Rating: 9.5/10",

            "review_title": "Elio, Elio, Elio...",
            "content": "This is a visually stunning film. Dramatically, it pulls its punches until long after you've expected, and wanted, them. And stubbornly, it never goes where you want it to go. And that is the point. Even so, by its conclusion you will feel that you've been on a profound journey drenched with strong, and confusing, emotions. Armie Hammer plays Oliver, an American college student on a foreign study assignment to Italy. There, he is a house guest of a family in a country villa with a 17 year old son played by Timothee' Chalamet. It is the early 1980's: the purgatory years for gay people when \"Dynasty's\" Stephen Carrington whiplashed between gay and straight from one episode to the next on American television, the AIDS epidemic was in, what turned out to be, its infancy, laws criminalizing gay people remained in penal codes around the world, and marriage equality had not yet been imagined; much less litigated, even much more less become a reality. Within this geo-social landscape, questions began to echo through these societal, and homophobic, norms. \"Norms\" that turned out, in fact, to be abnormal. They turned out to be merely dominant; and poorly examined. It is within this societal context that Elio and Oliver meet. The pace, and arc, of their relationship is deliberately, well - not fast. On the way, however, we are treated to the breathtaking beauty of the Italian countryside, squabbling, and of course passionate, Italians, and the heterosexual distractions that constitute the moat between the two main characters. Armie Hammer throws his acting depth onto the sacrificial fires of this film for the greater good of delivering an Oliver who is as one dimensional as a billboard and as alluring as a mirage. He is tall, handsome, and cocky. He smiles with acres of white teeth and punctuates his conversations with one word quips like, \"later\". The power in his character is literally its lack of obvious depth. It is a thankless job. But so effective in the totality of this story. He is allowed a few brief moments to reveal the roiling conflicts inside of himself. Then just as quickly as they appear, they're withdrawn lest they be examined too thoroughly; which is the point. Elio, by contrast, is a walking human autopsy of the living. His deepest troubles and longings are laid bare. And Chalamet is extraordinary in revealing something about youth that we are incapable of taking our eyes off of. He is a fawn pulling himself up by his wobbly legs for the first time and then bursting into a full gallop fueled by instinct, exuberance, and energy. These are the qualities that have been slowly killed in the adults who surround him. They are the qualities that echo from the past; from the relics that Elio's father dredges up from the ocean floor (foreshadowing here...), to the beautiful countryside's centuries old stone walls adorned with faded, macabre, Mussolini posters. These same qualities will be killed in Oliver, ultimately. But you can't prevent instinct, exuberance, and energy, because it is continuously reborn. As it has been in Elio. The deliberate, and sometimes deliberately frustrating, pace with which this story is told renders its most powerful moments a punch to the gut. Before that sledgehammer (no pun intended) lands, we are re-acquainted with the chaotic messiness of youth where anything is theoretically possible; until it crashes head on into reality. That's the time in life when we learn how not to hurt people by hurting them and then regretting it. By the time the final conversation between Elio and Oliver arrives, over a hissing and crackling long distance phone line, you will need to pick your stomach up from the floor. Elio, in a barely audible whisper, cries out to Oliver. His voice is the only voice that hasn't succumbed yet. He is the sole survivor that, for all practical purposes (bizarre plot line detour notwithstanding), is alone is the wilderness. Oliver cannot hear his pleas over the din of the grinding gears of the pantomime of life around them. Elio's pleas echo back to him alone; and leaves us with the question, him too? You'll get an answer to that. But not in this review. Passing through the lobby after the film I saw a man, seated, head buried in his hands, sobbing uncontrollably. He was being comforted by a female companion; his sister, a friend, or wife, don't know. Truth be told, we all felt at least a little bit like the way he looked. Was he Elio? Or Oliver? Don't know. That scene in the lobby, for me, was the inescapable ending to this film.",

            "content": "Any movie that makes me want to read the original is a great movie. But \"Call Me by Your Name\" achieved a little more than that. The movie tells a love story between Elio (played by Timothee Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer), who is a grad student that came to live in Elio's house, working for his father who is an archaeology professor.The movie has a rather simple storyline -there is no deceit or major conflict that drives the movie or the romance. It just captures two different people falling in love, slowly. The movie is set in somewhere in Northern Italy and the atmosphere is almost dreamlike and carefree, all captured through some beautiful shots and screenplay. Music was fantastic. As a sucker for classical and Sufjan, I thought it was so beautifully incorporated. The entire movie is so incredibly sensual, and reaches to the core of the audience through its portrayal of young love and the inevitable heartache. This was all possible because of Timothee Chalamet, who was honestly eye-catching. I am straight and it made me question myself. His performance was truly some of the best and I regret myself for not watching his movies earlier as I only watched Dune.This movie was set in 1983, which was a time where homophobia was the common zeitgeist of the age (although the movie didn't feature any of that). Even then, the two pursued each other in a limited amount of time. To cherish both the joy and the heartbreak is the advice that Elio's loving father (Michael Stuhlbarg) gives to his son and that bit was the most beautiful moment of the movie. Ultimately, what does it mean to call somebody by your own name? It's a foreign practice if done alone, but what makes it so incredibly romantic when you do it to someone else? It could mean that they are so absorbed into one another that they are essentially each of their partner. It could also mean that love allows you to see your own reflection many times. Regardless of what it means, it's an inexplicably romantic gesture that I may hope to use one day.",

In this movie, of course the surroundings are lush, most of the people are good lucking and well educated and cultured, so no wonder you have atmosphere, but it would not be enough to make this movie as good as it has turned out to be.The music is an excellent mix between classical music, dreamy contemporary melodies and pure 1980s tracks that were popular in France, Italy and other European countries back in the days.Of course the acting and the chemistry between the protagonists made it all come true. I loved the subtle play that built up tension, attraction and affection between these two young men. And the verbal punch of the father in the end, who I wrongly thought was just a professor not paying attention to his surroundings, that made this the movie of the year for me - while a week ago I would have given that to The Hero. \nListen to the father's speech and you re-wind the movie for yourself, and see it make sense. I have only seen this done in one other movie that was almost perfect and that was As Good As It Gets when Jack Nicholson summed up what Helen Hunt meant to him. Wonderful to see how living through grief can also mean realizing the joy you have had, and still have in a memory for the rest of your life.\nThis movie will stay with you for days which means forever, since something will have have changed in you.\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet will be big, hopefully!\nSuperb!",

Since Elio's parents have educated themselves about homosexuality via literature and history, they do not have homophobic attitudes. As a result, while people might see Elio and Oliver's friendship with disgust and anger or insecurity, they look at them with respect, admiration, and compassion. Their respect for him and Oliver and their understanding of the relationship is plain to see. For example, while Elio is sobbing in the car, his mom does not question or scold him; instead, she sits quietly next to him, driving, showing compassion, understanding, and respect.

Contrary to so many gay love stories, one avoids the \"love-is-misery\" angle that permeates so many gay stories. It's simple: Boy meets man, becomes attracted, then attached, then falls in love. And it's reciprocal.\nPeople complain that Hammer can't pass for a 24-year old. What a petty complaint: Dorothy couldn't pass for a 12-year old in the \"Wizard of Oz,\" but it didn't destroy the story, which is now one of the classics of all time.\nThis was beautifully told, with the sex not happening too soon (a la Brokeback Mountain, another good (but tragic, love story)), ,and the tenderness between the two growing as a flower does: in its own time. Chalamet never made one wrong move as Elio. Hammer was just a. tad too sophisticated for a 24-year old, but that can be overlooked, as he brought out Chalamet's vulnerability without the sarcasm or mockingness inherent in the majority of gay films. Hammer is warm and embracing (psychologically) and, as Chalamet says, in his late-night tv inteview by Neil Patrick Harris (see youtube), \"Who wouldn't fall in love with this guy?\" and that about says it all about the tenderness between the two men.\nReally lovely, without snarkiness, pettiness, unncessary drama or anything to muck up the blossoming of the beautiful flower called Love.\nAnd the father's speech towards the end? Brilliant and touching. \"But to make yourself feel nothing, so as not to feel anything...what a waste.\" (A heartwenching and wise understanding of how so many people try to rush past pain when a relationship dies.) Many people need to learn that simply because Love does not last does not make it less beautiful. As Kahlil Gibran once wrote, \"In order to be able to contain Great Joy, One must be able to contain Great Sorrow.\" And this film delivers on both ends of the spectrum.",

It's less than that too, and very sensual.The film stars Timothy Chalamet as a 17 year old American boy summering with his college professor parents in Italy, in 1983. The family takes in an older male graduate student (Armie Hammer) as a house guest to assist with the father's academic research, and the man develops lustful feelings for the boy who reluctantly reciprocates. The film builds on that connection, turning it into a fully charged sexual relationship that both characters recognize is socially unacceptable, but they carry along anyway in the shadow of the parents who knowingly allow it to blossom. The film delivers moments of tenderness, and moments of discomfort that beg for an off switch but nevertheless must be seen. It's a complex film stuffed with metaphor and message, but that message probably won't sit well in contemporary America. In that sense, the film feels very Italian and very, very, grown up.\"Call Me by Your Name\" is mostly in English, but there is some Italian with subtitles. If you see \"Call Me by Your Name\" please give the closing credits their due and spend the last 3:25 appreciating a single lingering tight-shot of Timothy Chalamet, as his character relives the enormity of one brief summer burned into his soul forever. It's an unforgettable shot that closes out a powerfully memorable film.",

It's beautifully shot. The fact that it was shot on film rather than digital adds some grain to the picture that definitely gives the movie a little something extra. The visuals were definitely the best part of the movie. As for the storytelling aspect of the movie, I do think it left much to be desired. In the book there are a lot of little moments and back and forth between Elio and Oliver that build up and culminate in Elio telling Oliver that he has something to tell him. On the other hand, in the movie it just kind of happens out of nowhere. If I hadn't read the book, I might have not even known that Elio had any kind of feelings towards Olivers. Also, the appearance of supporting characters like Chiara and Marzia was so minimal that they might as well have been left out of the movie completely. The thing that bothered me the most was that scenes began abruptly and ended abruptly. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not, but it was unpleasant to me.Maybe I should have waited and read the book after having watched the movie. Maybe I wouldn't have such disappointment over how the movie turned out. Clearly a lot of people enjoyed the movie, but I wonder how man are on the same boat as me.",

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name (2017).Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.Most of us can recall that first kiss, that first crush, perhaps even our first love. The first, it may be said, is awkward, grandiose and all-consuming. Rarely is it forgotten, because like all things experienced for the first time, it can never come again. Call Me By Your Name, a book written by Andr\u00e9 Aciman and brought to the big screen under the same title by director Luca Guadagnino, features a great setting, lyrical cinematography, an amazing soundtrack and a superb cast; but that's like telling a blind man that water is wet. It is the how, the when and the why of this movie - but that description does little more than scratch the surface.Call is the story of Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer) in the summer of 1983 in the bucolic setting of Crema, Italy. Elio is a very worldly 17 year old, a healthy and intelligent only-child of scholar parents. Oliver is a 24 year old American graduate student who visits Italy to work as a summer assistant to Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg). As Oliver moves into Elio's orbit, an inexplicable attraction grows between them, forcing Elio to reevaluate his naive comprehension of love and its myriad meanings.Director Luca Guadagnino personally conducted the screen tests of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer by vaguely instructing the two men to make out on a grassy knoll. Rumor has it he walked away mid-kiss because the two actors passed the test - and the rest, as they say, is history. The success of Call may be attributed to many factors, but since the story is told from the perspective of its youngest star, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet will receive most of the credit. He is brash, inquisitive, charming and self-assured in a way that breathes real life into the character of Elio. He is in every scene, and as a young man experiencing love for the first time, we cannot help but be reminded of ourselves - yet, this story truly belongs to Elio, and we are all just passengers along for the ride.Oliver and professor Perlman are perfect foils to Elio's development - a safe cocoon in which to experience love, making choices which last a lifetime, even as the temporary rite of passage floats away on the departing summer breezes. Call Me By Your Name is a timeless love story. The trick of all this beauty is that you don't really know just how wonderful it is until the credits roll.",

Everything plays out just perfectly; there's no dead space, nothing is dragged on and nothing is rushed. We have just the right amount of screen time to get to know Elio and Oliver to invest ourselves in the characters.

There are signs of love and rejection early on and there still is more love laying around.I'd say our protagonist (the younger one) has quite some issues and he is far away from being nice (see how he handles someone who has a lot of affection for him), but that may be because he is confused.

And Mr. Guadagnino does a fantastic job at vicariously placing you within the film already through how sensual and real life it feels. That's the most incredible piece of this movie - being able to feel the sun warm the backs of your arms, the sweat developing between your back and the weirdly uncomfortable lawn chair, the smell of an old paperback lying open on the arm, and the sweet nectar of an apricot squirting into and out of your mouth. It's an environment that feels almost palpable, and rarely do settings feel this much as if they are a character. And the organic nature happens to carry through in the camerawork, oftentimes being voyeuristic as you peer into these lives, and the character interactions and decisions. People feel real, although the dialogue may lack a little bit, and really, the impeccable acting by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer and the rest of the cast more than outweigh that gripe. And the use of symbolism throughout this film felt wholly unique (at least to me - I haven't seen some used in this way ever).\nThe aesthetic qualities of this movie are no doubt astounding and are what truly make this film special, but there were a few pieces to the story that held it back from being something that I completely loved. Probably most notably the fact that the story is a little generic. It won't really spoil the story, but you can already picture how the film will run if I say that it's a gay/lesbian film. Doubt, \"clandestine\" sexual meetings, spilling the beans, I mean it's all here. Beach Rats was another film from 2017 I saw and I loved how it took a refreshing take to a somewhat monotonous genre. Every sort of experience with coming out and becoming who you want to be is different, so I can't help but question why so many films end up having the same framework as Blue is the Warmest Color. Secondly, I felt the transition from the first half to the second was a little jarring and out of left field. They had hints at something bubbling, and maybe some were too subtle for me to catch, and I knew it was coming eventually, but it really took me by surprise because I wasn't expecting it at the time it came. And my last gripe is with the father's monologue at the end where he's telling Chalamet's character about acceptance and whatnot, but my oh my, it honestly would have felt more natural if the father broke the fourth wall and just started talking directly to the audience. It became waaaay too obvious very quickly that the message was meant for everyone in the audience to hear, not just his character. Disguising this better or thinking of a better way to implement the ideas, because they weren't necessarily things I disagreed with, could have given this film a very uplifting ending. So while the structure of this film is not perfect, I think it almost makes up for it enough in the environment department to make this a film I completely love. Regardless, it is still one of the best movies of the year.",

There are still plenty of people in the world who would not give a film about the budding sexual and emotional relationship of two young men a chance. This film has some serious balls for treating the subject so delicately and yet so erotically.Make that two sets of balls, one owned by Timothee Chalamet and the other by Armie Hammer, who play the lovers. Chalamet gives one of the most understated but impressive performances of the year as the younger of the two who is experiencing an infatuation comprised of equal parts love and lust for what we suspect is the first time. Hammer is the object of his obsession, a studly, bronzed student who is staying in Italy for the summer and working for Chalamet's professor father (Michael Stuhlbarg). The film is languid and sun drenched, creating visually what a summer spent lounging in the Italian countryside must feel like. Both of the principal actors have a great deal of screen time, but the film easily belongs to Chalamet, who in the course of one summer experiences more reciprocal love and inevitable heartbreak than many people experience over the course of their entire lives. The best scene in the film comes late into its running time, and it's comprised of a soliloquy delivered by Stuhlbarg in which he attempts to help his son deal with the pain he is feeling over an ended romance and also hints that romantic relationships between men, even men who identify as primarily straight, are possibly more common than anyone realizes, or would be if men felt that they were allowed to have them. It's one of the best scenes I saw in a movie this year.Grade: A",

            "content": "I have watched this film on two different levels. First is like a sugary-water romantic coming of age film and second is like a youth-fetishistic film. I have enjoyed the first level, although it is a bit to long with many unnecessary scenes. I don't see the reason of mentioning the partizans and second WW, and lots of the scenes seem too staged. From the discussion about old german tale to the father's speech near the end. But, still if you watch this film like a light romantic movie seen through the eyes of Elio you will be OK. \nBut, if you want to dig deeper, you are entering some murky waters. Oliver is not very clear character. We don't know from the beginning if he is gay, bi or straight. We assume he is straight, he is going out with the girl and doesn't show any interest for Elio. Because of that it can be interpreted that his sexual feelings are awakened intellectually, through the archaeological findings and slides of Greek sculptures of ambiguous young boys and the speech about them which Elio's father is telling to Oliver like some kind of incite for Oliver to go after Elio. This interpretation would be more interesting to me than later revelation that he was attracted to Elio from the start. Oliver is then just a character who is attracted to younger boys. I don't mean pedophile! He doesn't discover his homosexuality in the proces of friendship with Elio, but he is determined from the start. He is the type of men who are attracted only to the youth. He is not interested in men, just young boys. Later, after summer is finished he goes back to his heteronormative life with the future wife to be. For him Elio is just a summer escapade, although he behaved very well and wise towards Elio. He is not a bad guy.But author's films are not abut the characters anyway, they are about authors themselves. They choose themes which are closer to them and this movie is therefore a proclamation of fetichism towards youth. Nothing wrong with that. That is a legitimate theme. Only I didn't liked the manipulation and bypassing of it, camouflaging it with the coming of age theme. Father's monolog to Elio near the end confirms that youth fethisism assumption. \n\"When you get older no one will look at you, let a lone touch you\" said father to Elio, and he also confess that he had romance with the man in his youth. Unfulfilled and therefore cemented like a fetish towards youth in his older days. This is why he envies Elio and why he is so encouraging for their affair. Not because his libertarian, educated and therefore open minded stance. \n\"Does mother knows?\" asks Elio. \"No\" replies father. We are not sure if he asks about his own affair with the Oliver or father affair in the past, but judging from the mother's behaviour through the whole movie it can be assumed that this question refers to the father's past. He is not open towards his own openminded wife. He keeps his youth affair like a secret. Allowing therefore this secret to develop in to a fetish. And to conclude, I didn't like the end scene, that forced tear jerker. It is like they wanted us to feel something in this too pretentious and too staged movie. Off course you will cry if you see someone crying and suffering for 5 minutes if you have any empathy in yourself. Manipulations like that, plus too much unnecessary parts in the movie are not features of good directors. Maybe in the future Luca Guadagnino will develop his crafts better but till then I will give this film 4 stars.",

I felt like I wasn't watching a movie but actually watching real people being documented which is probably the intention.

The screenplay isn't structured and it side steps a lot of the things writers generally have rules about where to put things in a film like the inciting incident or character motivations, and this film basically doesn't aim to play by those rules, but rather make you feel like you're living with these people and experiencing their summer in Italy. Sometimes it's exciting, sometimes there's just quiet moments and it's all very real. This will either make it or break it for you, if you don't mind the slow pace and want to see a nice coming of age story with a backdrop in Italy then I'd say give it a try. You could tell this was crafted by someone with an actual European background and not by an American perspective so I appreciated that. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer definitely have chemistry and the romance is strong but honestly I felt like it played it a little too safe?

It felt like I had travelled to the place and time of the film and not only witnessed the love of the two main characters, but also fell in love with them and empathised with their pain.This film is beautifully shot, every scene is crafted like a perfect painting. The actors are great. The film has lengths, which some people find fault with, and I too had to get used to very long scenes showing the lavish lifestyle of Elio and his family. But in the end I think it was a clever trick to make us feel even more immersed in the atmosphere of the movie, almost feeling the warm weather, almost tasting the food, but also being \"stuck \" and waiting for something to happen. By the time the film was over, I felt like I had just spent 6 weeks in a summery Italy, falling deeper in love than ever before. And if a film is capable of something like that, I think it's a damn magical work of art.",

            "content": "I have seen a lot of films, but only very few stay with me weeks - even months - after viewing. And I'm a complete sucker for romantic films so I was very excited for this release.Where do I begin?First of all, despite I am still yet to see Darkest Hour (and I'm sure Gary Oldman's performance is as sublime as everyone has said), I was living in great hope that Timothee Chalamet would take the Oscar home for his completely unforgettable, raw and authentic portrayal of the character Elio. For the fact I recently discovered some of my favourite scenes were improvised e.g. the closing scene where he sits by the fireplace and looks directly at the camera with a face full of woe, just goes to show how talented he is. He captures the pure essence of a teenager experiencing first love: the confusion, the frustration, the tension, the excitement - all shown through his facial expressions that even in the most subtle ways scream unconcealed emotion. I think this breakthrough role will bring him more success in the future, hopefully resulting in an Academy Award.The scenery, the music, the characters and the plot as a whole concocts the most eloquent romance film I think I have ever seen. (The only film I could compare it to, regardless of its parallel topics, but with more focus on the artistry of the filmmaking and the authenticity of the relationships would be Blue is the Warmest Colour). It is so because the chemistry between Armie Hammer and Timothee is beyond perfection. You almost forget they're acting because the connection between them is so real. You become so invested in this powerful relationship that they slowly develop, that it is merely impossible for you not to feel as if your heart has been smashed by the end (a bit exaggerated, but that's just how I felt after first watching). Maybe my empathy towards Elio is greater due to the fact the first time I saw this film I was dealing with my own heartbreak which made my overwhelming sadness become strangely beautiful, but also more intense: after being intoxicated with a sensory overload of rich Italian summer landscapes, a gorgeous soundtrack, peaches, and wonderful characters. The scene where Elio is in the car with his mother is what really got to me. But it gave me some sort of reassurance and reminder that other people experience this kind of inexplicable pain: saying goodbye to your first love and not knowing how to cope with your grief.I would also just like to say how I think Armie Hammer and/or Michael Stuhlbarg could have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Both of their performances were just outstanding, and I think Michael's monologue near the end of the film can only be described in one word: flawless. It's incredibly refreshing to portray a parental figure in such a positive light considering the main theme of the film which deals with sexuality and the underlying fear of shame when coming out.On the whole, I would recommend this film to everyone and anyone. No matter what your sexuality is, you will find it is very relatable. I hope my review has summarised the sheer excellence of the characters and the actors, but what perfectly summarises the soul of the film would be Sufjan Stevens' \"Mystery of Love\".",

            "content": "Unfortunately when I say possibly this year's 'Moonlight' (last year's Best Picture winner at the Academy Awards) I don't necessarily mean it as a good thing. When I reviewed that film I described it as a \"film about nothing\". While I wouldn't go as far as to say the same about 'Call Me by Your Name', there are similarities in that sense. What is actually separating this from other love stories out there? Is it the homosexual element? Is it two straight actors playing homosexuals convincingly well (ala 'Brokeback Mountain' - another highly over-rated film in my opinion)? Are the movie-going public simply fascinated by this concept? I'm not sure, and while I'm certainly not calling 'Call Me by Your Name' a bad film, I don't think it was Best Picture nomination worthy.I kept expecting more from the film. Around the 65 minute mark I actually had to get my phone out and check what the movie was supposed to be about, because nothing had happened as yet. The synopsis was vague to say the least and I hoped it was just holding back information for fear of spoilers. It wasn't. The film really is as simple and straight-forward as the plot line suggests. So what are we, the audience, supposed to grasp onto here? Well, put simply, we have to buy into the love story 100%. And to be honest I'm not sure I did. I've seen a lot of great love stories told in films over the years, and this one wouldn't rank in the top 100 I'm pretty sure.If you break the film up into three parts, before the couple get together, during the time they've got together and then after they've gotten together, then I think the structuring needed to be different. Too long is spent on the first phase, not quite enough on the second phase and then far from enough on the final phase. The final phase was the chance to really drive things home and draw some emotion out of the audience. Even during the short time we get in that final 1/3 we get two tremendous scenes. One with a speech from the father and then the very final scene of the film. More of that and you would've had yourself a truly great film.The actors do do a tremendous job and fully immerse themselves in their respective roles. The potential was certainly there for this to be something great, but it was just lacking in creativity on the writer's part. The story plays out far too straight-forward. A missed opportunity.",

Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet who is the star of the film did an amazing job. He perfectly embodied the often confusing stage between adolescence and adulthood. One of the best scenes in the entire movie was him sitting in front of a fireplace quietly crying. He certainly is a talent to look forward to in the future.His father portrayed by Michael Stuhlbarg also was a standout. He had a number of excellent scenes in the film, but one in particular should have earned him a Best Supporting Oscar nomination.The relatable story and the acting where the best parts of the film. Unfortunately I did find a few problems that detracted from the film for me. The movie had some pacing issues. It did feel overly long, and some scenes could have been completely negated without impacting the film. Overall a great, but flawed film. A 8.5 out of 10.",

            "review_title": "an artistic lustful romance",
            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Although confusing the two is understandable, there is a difference between a story of romance and a story of love. That's not to say that the two can't overlap; in fact, they often do. In movies, romance is the dish most often served because it's usually more interesting. Watching the flirtatious dance and often awkward exploratory stage of what was once called the rituals of courting offers a writer, actor and director infinitely more possibilities than what we associate with the years of deep connection labeled as love. Andre Aciman's novel is adapted by James Ivory (of Merchant-Ivory fame, and 3 times Oscar nominated for Best Director) and the script leans heavily on romance ... lustful romance, to be specific.Director Luca Guadagnino (A BIGGER SPLASH, I AM LOVE) is an expert at making movies that engage our senses. His movies delicately tease us - they slowly absorb us into the emotions and feelings of the characters. Very few filmmakers have the skill to subtly seduce the viewer, and draw us into the story so that we are no longer merely observing. It's nuanced story-telling at the highest level. Elio's (Timothee Chalamet) family spends the summer at their estate in northern Italy. You've likely never met a more cultured family. His father (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a renowned professor, his mother (Amira Casar) a recognized translator, and Elio himself is a musical prodigy who whiles away the days by transcribing classical music and reading every book he can get his hands on. Oh, he also flirts with the local girls because he is, after all, a 17 year old boy. His intelligence and corresponding wit is of a much older person, standing in stark contrast to his innocence and childlike maturity level with all other pieces of life's puzzle.Elio's world is rocked when his father's newest research assistant, Oliver (Armie Hammer), shows up. An \"Americano\" who offsets his extreme politeness with an unrefined \"Later\" when departing any encounter, Oliver explodes on the scene like a Greek God. He and Elio have an initial passive-aggressiveness towards each other as they test the boundaries for weakness, and more importantly, interest. Things move very slowly as the passion and curiosity brews during their bike rides, walks through the apricot orchards (forbidden fruit), swimming in every watering hole, and competitive banters on intellectual topics. There is a sensuality to most every scene, though those same scenes are filled with unspoken tension.The sunlit beauty as each summer day passes initially masks the emotions, and the stunning setting, people, colors, and music is accentuated by the camera work of cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom. Nature is on display in its full glory; not just through trees, sunlight, and water, but in that elusive and unexplained connection between two people so strongly drawn to one another. Director Guadagnino's film easily slides into the romantic sub-genre of such films as BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, and CAROL, and the artistic approach provides a gentleness that even the peach scene can't undo. Michael Stuhlbarg (who seems to be everywhere these days) has an extraordinary father/son scene near the end which reminds us that each one of us has a story on how life may or may not have turned out as planned. The gut-wrenching pain with sharing that story usually means it remains untold; however, the invaluable lesson is not lost on Elio. First love and first heartbreak bring both emotional ecstasy and emotional devastation, and whether you believe the film's statement \"We have less to give each new person\", you'll likely agree that the use of Psychedelic Furs \"Love My Way\" is spot on.",

I strongly feel that the stars are mainly given due to the \"delicacy\" of the subject (which, however, is not even really addressed in the movie), or its being non-main stream.I was eager to watch a film, in which James Ivory was involved, since the name is sort of a guarantee. Unfortunately it was quite disappointing. I do not know Ivory's personal involvement in the subject of coming out (neither do I consider it relevant), but compared to Maurice, this one has no real reason to exist whatsoever. The storyline is easily told within half a line: Oliver comes as an assistant to spend some time with the family of an art professor, the son of which, Elio, falls for him. And that's it. Besides the super long aimlessly hanging around there is nothing really happening to justify the film. No internal struggle due to homosexuality, due to age difference, due to Oliver getting engaged, due to Oliver being the assistant to Elio's father. None. Just some half naked bodies hanging around and a series of Elio's tries to approach a much older guy, who is simply indifferent (I do not know whether because the script wanted it or simply bad acting). Oliver kisses the much younger Elio in one moment, rejects him the next without any obvious or implied explanation, only to show him his bruises in his abdomen a few seconds later. The father tries very hard to look like Robin Williams, but fails miserably at tacitly communicating any inner feelings to the audience (provided he is supposed to) like Williams would. He ends up being a father who is absent with the exception, when he consoles his son in the most understanding way thinkable. There is also a mother whose presence is not even noticed, and a girlfriend (Elio's) who is equally understanding and magnanimous, so that no one actually brings any real significance to the plot. Boring as hell, it offers nothing but superb landscapes (thanks to the Italian province, but then again there are much better documentaries for this).IMHO any film must present some action, be it real hero-like action, inner emotional/social development action (which can be twice as captivating, as we are so much used to from other films of Ivory's), or personality analysis/discovery. This one doesn't.Notwithstanding the overall mediocrity, I must certainly praise Chalamet's performance, who excels as a teenager battling with boiling emotions, and surely saves the day, although his last scene should be cut in half. I give the film four stars, three exclusively for Chalamet, and one for Italy.I suggest you watch the film only if you like mediterranean landscapes and in order to appreciate a young actor's talent.",

I do agree he looks considerably younger than Armie and 7 years is a large difference between characters (while I understand this is consistent with the book, it's still a problem and is displayed in the youthfulness of Elio's character). In the end I didn't feel the love and passion as much as I wanted to. Stories about the LGBTQA+ community are important and I respect this aspect of the movie greatly - def worth seeing.",

            "content": "This film exceeded any prior preconceptions or expectations I had and to be honest it was an introduction for me to a couple fantastic film practitioners. There were some scenes where the tone was so beautifully maintained and transitioned from scene to scene, the narrative feeling like an entire journey and experience. The acting performances were brilliant and was honestly subtly so skilful, especially in: Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Timothee Chalamet. Speaking of performances in the film, the dialogue had so much meaningful depth and was constantly engaging for me as the audience. Additionally something that I will be highlighting is the pacing in this film, it was fluid, the editing was seamless and this review will be praising this film.Now the acting performances in this film were beautiful; Armie Hammer masterfully portrayed his character, he was confident, persuasive, and also so seductive in his body language, his expressions, and articulation of his lines. Michael Stuhlbarg didn't have as much time/ screen time for his character's development as Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet had, however his character is still incredibly powerful and impactful to the storyline. His performance of his lines felt so very impactful especially in his monologue: \"remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now there's sorrow. Pain. Don't kill it and with it the joy you've felt.\". This monologue in general is powerful in itself, however with the skillful mastery of Michael Stuhlberg, it became so much more, and brought it to life. Timothee Chalamet was excellent, especially when presenting the character development Elio goes through. His shift in body language, the way he performed the lines, and even the presentation of youth, as well as a character going through love and heartbreak.The cinematography and camera work was honestly fantastic; it encapsulated the calm, pain, and joy that was felt throughout this film. It helped in manipulating the audience's emotions and allowed the audience to take the setting the characters found themselves in. There is a certain hypnotic effect that I believe is created in films such as: Donnie Darko, Taxi Driver, and Nightcrawler, however those films create a more off-putting hypnosis, however this is a different type of hypnosis, it almost felt like a dream at points of the film, it seemed Elio lived the perfect life, and it created pure escapism for me.",

The music plays into the movie so perfectly to the extent that it would take away from the beauty of it all if the music was different. It's been said before but, without spoilers, the end credits are so overwhelming and emotional. If Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet doesn't win an Oscar for his role as Elio then people will be extremely upset for him, myself included. His work here is undoubtedly the most realistic and truthful performance I have ever seen in my life. Oliver, played flawlessly by Armie Hammer, becomes a counterpart of Elio and it is striking to see the two become so close. This movie does take its time, but it is so natural that it doesn't affect the film's impact whatsoever. Elio and Oliver's chemistry feels so palpable and unscripted. Often in romantic films the script is written so that the characters act or speak in a way that directly and forcibly pulls the heartstrings. With Call Me By Your Name, however, it's as if you are watching a beautiful and giddy relationship unfold in front of your eyes. Every emotion felt by Elio is felt by the audience. The last third will completely drain you of emotion, particularly one scene with Michael Stuhlbarg. Along with the emotion felt while viewing the film, it also manifests your thoughts afterwards and hits you harder and harder as time goes on. Rush to see this as soon as you can; it is not only the best movie this year, but one of the best movies ever made and a timeless classic.",

Dialogue can be a bit sappy at times, but I guess that is a side effect of love rather than just bad writing. Nevertheless it feels stupid. Other times it can be a bit too vague. The dialogue. As well as what's currently happening. These are mostly minor issues though.Acting is great. Perhaps even slightly over done for the main character. Not in a bad way though. Perhaps they just wanted to show him off. Switching between 3-4 languages, playing guitar and piano with ease that'd make Rachmaninov blush; scribing music, reading tons of books and looking like a teenage Greek god in the process, is too good to be true. Relations between people feel natural and organic and most part realistic. Or lets say believable rather than realistic. The visual style and tone is smooth and gentle. Fitting well with the general flow of the film. Setting feels authentic and fit for the period. The countryside is as dreamy as everyone. The soundtrack, concerning the pop music, is brilliant. Did not care too much about the piano score in some parts. Though there is piano played in the film, the piece playing in the background at times, did not seem to fit. Pace seems to limp on occasion, but is not a major concern. There aren't too many obvious mistakes, but the scene where they pick up a freshly found archaeological artefact like it's just a random stick, is mind-blowing. Overall, Luca Guadagnino does a great job in portraying love without the usual drama and still maintains interest. It's easy to destroy innocence, much harder to retain, but the film succeeds. And his love looks a lot like love. And love doesn't care who you are.",

It's because of its stars, Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Theirs was a casting decision made in heaven.\nThe movie is alright. You can't go wrong setting your story in northern Italy, the art direction is gorgeous, the rest of the cast is very good, and the soundtrack is spectacular. I wasn't very impressed by the direction and the script fell short in building Elio and Oliver's relationship. There were a few inconsistencies in the editing that threw me off, and the fly on Elio's shirt when he is breaking down in front of the fire, ruined the final scene for me.\nThe film itself doesn't give us enough elements to believe Elio and Oliver have fallen in love. Based only in the director and writer's work, it's just a summer fling, kind of intense, but in the same way Sandy and Danny had a thing in Grease. \nEnter Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. It is their interpretation what makes this movie one of the most beautiful and honest romantic film of this decade. Every word, every breath, every move, every glance, every heart palpitation take us through the journey of what it is to fall in love and be broken hearted when it all ends.

All aspects of the film are well served - scenery, costumes, cinematography, musical score - and delivered by a sterling cast of actors. Andr\u00e9 Aciman also has a bit part that adds to the finesse of the film.CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is a sensual and transcendent tale of first love. It's the summer of 1983 in the north of Italy, and Elio Perlman (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), a precocious 17-year-old young man, spends his days in his family's 17th century villa transcribing and playing classical music, reading, and flirting with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel). Elio enjoys a close relationship with his father (Michael Stuhlbarg), an eminent professor specializing in Greco-Roman culture, and his mother Annella (Amira Casar), a translator, who favor him with the fruits of high culture in a setting that overflows with natural delights. While Elio's sophistication and intellectual gifts suggest he is already a fully-fledged adult, there is much that yet remains innocent and unformed about him, particularly about matters of the heart. One day, Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old American college graduate student working on his doctorate, arrives as the annual summer intern tasked with helping Elio's father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of the setting, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.In addition to a delicately rendered first love story, the interaction between Elio and his parents (especially the very special father/son relationship) adds depth to the story. The splendor of the foods prepared by Mafalda (Vanda Capriolo), the discovery of lost Praxiteles sculpture in the lake, the visits to the swimming hole, the visit by an elderly gay couple Isaac (Peter Spears) and Mounir (Andr\u00e9 Aciman) - make this a cherishable film. Or in Elio's father's words, 'How you live your life is your business, just remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now, there's sorrow, pain. Don't kill it and with it the joy you've felt.'",

            "content": "Well, I made it through to the end at last, and man, am I glad! It DID get better!At exactly 1:57:00 on the Blu-ray, when Elio and his father meet in the library, an entirely new movie starts, and it is fabulously, fantastically, spectacularly, amazingly good. Perfect, in fact. Moviemaking cannot get any better than that. If the first part had been even half that good I'd have loved the whole movie and enthusiastically given it at least 8 stars.Now I understand why Chalamet was nominated for an Oscar (the first two hours give no clue) and marvel that he didn't win. Now I understand why the movie and the director were nominated and why Ivory won. It's pretty amazing that the last 15 minutes could be so much better than the 117 minutes that came before.I stand by every word of my original review (so I'm leaving it unedited below, and I think I'm going to leave the one-star rating), because it perfectly says what's wrong with the bulk of this movie. That's too bad, because some people won't press through all of that to get to the good part.So I would advise anybody who has ANY problem with this movie -- whether it's a personal, aesthetic and artistic problem like mine or a moral problem with the subject matter -- to skip the entire first part, all the way to 1:57:00, and watch the remaining 15 minutes to the very end. Do NOT stop when the end credits start to roll, or you will miss some of the finest acting you will ever see.The last 15 minutes are completely self sufficient; there's no need to know what came before -- in fact, you'd be better off NOT knowing. This is still really crappy as a gay movie, there is still no credible chemistry between Chalamet and Hammer, but that's irrelevant in the last 15 minutes. The dialog in just those final scenes gives you all the information you need and makes the relationship completely credible after the first two hours failed to.The fact that the first 90% of the movie is bad is no problem after all, because you don't have to watch it. At the first urge to hit STOP or FAST-FORWARD, just FF all the way to 1:57:00 and enjoy 15 minutes of the best movie you've seen in a long, long time.------------------------------------------\nORIGINAL REVIEW:Dead at its erotic core, and Elio is obnoxiousCall Me by Your Name reminds me of Brokeback Mountain, because they both seem to me like movies made about gay men but by straight people and for straight audiences. In both cases, though, the characters aren't actually gay men but straight men who experience spastic episodes of gay-like behavior, which is one of my chief problems with both movies.I love James Ivory, but he should have won Oscars for writing and directing Maurice -- the first unhomophobic mainstream gay movie ever made and 30+ years later still the best gay movie ever made -- instead of for writing Call Me, but it's typical of the Oscars to award the right person in the wrong year for the wrong movie.Hollywood is full of morons, but occasionally they accidentally get something halfway right, like a roomful of monkeys eventually pecking out Hamlet on a typewriter if you give them a trillion years to do it. Ivory included Ismael Merchant and Ruth Jhabvala in his acceptance speech even though both were dead and had nothing to do with Call Me, so he realized he was getting the award, at least in part, for the wrong movie.Two things bother me about Call Me, one trivial and one not. The trivial one is entirely James Ivory's fault, because it's something that's in the movie's screenplay but not in the book. It's the way Elio and his friends and relations switch effortlessly and fluently -- often several times within a single conversation -- between English, French, Italian and German (in the book, it's all English with a little Italian, since it's in Italy).That IMMEDIATELY elevates the characters beyond reach and alienates the audience, because normal 16-year-olds (or 70-year-olds) CANNOT speak four languages so fluently that they can start a sentence in one language and flit at will in and out of the other three languages before they get to the end of the sentence, without even taking a breath. It made me hate Elio before he'd even done anything. What a privileged, obnoxious brat!The second thing that bothers me about Call Me is exactly what bothers me most about Brokeback Mountain. It's that the sexual attraction between the two men is completely unbelievable.In both cases (Call Me better than Brokeback) the actors go through the motions PERFECTLY, doing everything they ought to be doing exactly as they ought to be doing it, but it leaves me feeling as cold and dead as a dead fish. Nothing they do resonates with the part of me that resonates with sexual attraction. What they do LOOKS authentic, but it FEELS completely false. Empty, Cold, Mechanical. Expertly choreographed and performed, but lacking even a tiny spark of the relentless, consuming fire that drives real sex.I would say that it's because the actors, in both movies, are completely straight (which they are), and that it's just impossible for ANY straight actor to get gay sexual attraction exactly right, making it feel real and alive and inescapable. But that obviously is not true, and, again, it's Maurice that proves it.James Wilby and Rupert Graves both are completely straight, but the fire between them onscreen in Maurice is REAL, so real it's almost scary, but very wonderful. FINALLY I'm seeing on a movie screen what I feel inside and have NEVER seen onscreen before (or since). James Ivory got that from those two straight actors in Maurice, but it's completely lacking in the two more recent movies.It makes it worse that the two actors in Call Me are extraordinarily beautiful men, while neither Keith Ledger nor Jake Gyllenhaal is. Ugly men making out can't be expected to be very sexy, but men as beautiful as Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet making out OUGHT to be sexy just BECAUSE they're so beautiful; so when it's not, the disappointment is much greater.I should admit now that I haven't finished watching Call Me yet, although I bought the disc and started watching it almost three months ago, on March 13. I still have more than a half-hour left to watch out of the 2+ hour movie -- so I've averaged watching one minute of it every day for 90 days, although actually in spasmodic chunks of 3-5 minutes each.The infuriating multilingual conversations and the erotic deadness at its heart make me so angry that I can take only a few minutes of it at a time. So it's possible that it gets a lot better before the end, but I doubt it. Struggling through that movie is for me like climbing Mount Everest in a blizzard; it will be a miracle if I ever actually make it all the way to the end.",

But thankfully good hearts like his father in the quote above, know how rare and salutary love is even if it is same sex.This Oscar-nominated small film deserves its acclaim, from writer James Ivory, who knows a thing or two about rich locales in Italy, to \nSufjan Stevens' classy score, Call Me is Masterpiece Theater reworked for our time. Just add it to Brokeback Mountain and Moonlight for three peerless, artful depictions of queer love.The languid pace that allows the revolutionary love to grow like ripening fruit is just right for those of us who long for the magical, bucolic Lombardy region at summer with lunches that last delightfully forever.Come to think of, there is little conflict except for the girls who must forsake these handsome men not even knowing they are at the least bisexual but heading to homosexuality at a rapid pace. Call Me By Your Name is a romance as much about adolescent coming of age as it is about the vagaries of love in any form or any age.If you long for the sweet Merchant-Ivory motif set against a seductive Italian hill town, this work of art will inspire you to love again.\"He was good, and you were both lucky to have found each other, because... you too are good.\" Mr. Perlman",

Having a liking for good films since childhood, I went along willingly, and couldn't wait to indulge. The problem is, I just never got the chance. Having no idea what the movie is about dragged on for another 40 minutes, where I got so tired of waiting I stepped out to use the bathroom and buy a drink. When I got back, the movie did not progress even an inch. Granted, it does get a little bit more interesting in the second half, but it is still nowhere near what I would expect from an Academy Award nominated movie. It is utterly boring. The main character is simply unlikable. Very cold and dry, you just wait for him to display some smile, or any feelings at all. As mentioned previously, in the second half the action gets a little better, but it is too little too late. The biggest mystery to me are some of the ratings and opinions of this movie here on this website. I'm wondering whether we've seen the same movie. It's not a masterpiece, the plot and screenplay aren't phenomenal and they are most certainly not keeping you in awe. Are people really enjoying this, or do they just say they do because they are pretentious and think that this is the right thing to say about this film? There were some brief upsides, beautiful scenery and location, good and sometimes great acting by the actors. But that is why I'm giving it 3 stars, because the plot/story was just boring with a rather unsurprising ending.",

This year there are 9 nominees vying for the Best Picture at the Oscars and I'm looking forward to watching all because I'm only familiar with this one and at best I only knew the title and that it features Armie Hammer, who played twins in The Social Network and whom I was sure was destined for stardom along with his disarming voice until he did The Lone Ranger.Based on the novel with the same name, the movie tells the story of the friendship (that's what they called it back in the day - or even until now actually) between Oliver, a visiting research assistant and Elio, the 17 year old son of Oliver's professor. Their initial chemistry was uneasy, with the former's arrogance typical of an American and the latter's condescending typical of a teenager. In time, they agreed to be friends (there's that word again) and ended up with the most memorable experience one could hope for set in sunny Italy in the 80s. For the longest time I've been looking for the right term to call that feeling when the sun is shining just right, the wind is blowing the dandelions in the air, you're laying beside your loved one and you don't want it to end. This movie helped me find it: it's called Romantic.I've read multiple articles on how many chances Armie has been given already only because he's the very definition of white privilege, but it's good that the director took a chance on him to tell us that stereotyping in any way, shape or form is a loss for everyone. He also defended his decision to cast straight actors for the role by saying to cast someone in a role based on gender identity is oppressive. Timothee Chalamet deserved his Best Actor nomination (see end credits of movie). Praises as well for Elio's parents who made me realize that's the kind of parent I want to be if ever I become one.As for it's prospects of winning, if the academy is ready to make good on the error they made when they chose that movie no one remembers anymore over Brokeback Mountain back in 2005, it wouldn't be wasted on this. But if the other eight nominees are more deserving, I wouldn't give them a hard time about it.Favorite quote:\n\"We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste!\"",

It's about a 17-year-old living in Italy, who begins a romantic relationship with his father's American assistant. It's based on the 2007 novel (of the same name) by Andre Aciman, and it was scripted by James Ivory. The film stars Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar and Esther Garrel. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards (including Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Actor-Drama, and Best Supporting Actor). I found it to be well made, but extremely slow-paced. Elio (Chalamet) is a 17-year-old Jewish American boy, who lives in Italy with his parents (Stuhlbarg and Casar). During the summer of 1983, his father, an archaeology professor, invites a Jewish American graduate student, named Oliver (Hammer), to come stay with the family in order to help with paperwork. Elio initially doesn't like the presence of Oliver, but he slowly becomes attracted to him. A romantic relationship between the two soon develops. \n \nI've enjoyed Guadagnino's other films, especially 'I AM LOVE', but this one I had a hard time sitting through. I appreciate that it's a coming-of-age gay love story, I think Hollywood needs more of those, but it's just so slow-paced in my opinion, and long. The acting is all good in it though, the cinematography is beautiful, and the climax is involving. It's definitely not a bad film by any measure, but you have to have a lot of patience to sit through it (I did at least).",

I mean, really love it!For me, this is a very slow movie about a couple of bland, unengaging people. While I generally like coming of age films, I like them for the romance and the sense of changing and growing, but I felt there was little of any of that. There's also very little in the way of plot or conflict. It's basically a slow-moving lust-mance. I am not a fan of slice-of-life film making; I like stories. There isn't one here.I will admit that some of the issue might be I'm straight. I think it's easier to relate to a relationship movie if you understand the attraction, and I don't know why either of those two would want the other one. I mean, the older guy is generically attractive even if he's obnoxious, but is the teenager even attractive? He doesn't look like much to me, but he's also got a really hot girlfriend so maybe he's a very attractive young man? Who knows?But I don't think the issue is *just* that I'm straight. I didn't *love* Moonlight, the critically-lauded film about a gay black guy, but I did find it generally interesting. But the only reason I watched this movie to the end was because my girlfriend really liked it, and I spent the last third reading twitter on my phone (apparently missing a couple of moving moments, but I'm okay with that because I just don't care if the characters live or die).The most I can say for the movie is it's a great ad for Italy, very pretty and idyllic. And there's a good soundtrack. My girlfriend, FWIW, found this movie moving and profound. It also made her desperate to visit Italy.",

            "content": "Call me by your name is, in my opinion, one of the few, rare films that have the power to deeply move and affect their viewers as if they were watching scenes of real life or perhaps even of their own experiences. This film is so special that it has been stuck in my mind and imagination for many days after the first viewing. I could not resist but watch it a second time, which was in many ways revelatory on the quality of the movie. It is directed by Luca Guadagnino, an incredibly gifted Italian film-maker who has worked on the critically acclaimed 'I am love' and 'A bigger splash'. The artistry and the sense of taste of Guadagnino's cinema are immediately evident in this movie. The screenplay, by James Ivory, is based on the 2007 book by Andre Aciman. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer are incredibly believable and delightfully genuine in their portrayals of Elio and Oliver. Elio is a young man who lives in a gorgeous small town of Northern Italy with his cosmopolitan family during the summer of 1983. Oliver is a handsome American academic who has come to stay at their villa for the summer as a student of Elio's father. Michael Stuhlbarg also offers an incredible performance during the film, playing Elio's sensitive and intellectual father, who faces the reality of his son's sexuality and reaches out to him in one of the most touching and most virtuously written scenes of the past few years. Everything falls smoothly into place and looks astonishingly beautiful, from the luxuriant Italian setting in the town of Crema and around Lake Garda, the carefully picked and elegant costume design, to the crisp and vintage looking photography. Some moments in this movie will probably become cult scenes, like Elio's self sexual discovery through a peach and the conversation taking place between Elio and Oliver in front of a war memorial, where they begin to reveal the feelings they have for each other. This scene is particularly interesting (and is followed by shots of the two cycling through the sun- lit countryside) as the camera moves around the square with no interruptions and observes the discussion without ever getting too close to the characters. It seems like Guadagnino has the talent to reveal his characters' emotions without necessarily having to indulge in close-up shots. Still, when he does, I guarantee it feels pretty magic. The soundtrack also plays a big part in creating the special mood of this film, with two songs performed by Sufjan Stevens. I believe this movie deserves a 10 as it represents all I love about cinema and it casts a magical spell that makes it a little cinema miracle. Everyone should watch it and fall in love with Oliver and Elio!",

            "review_title": "Beautiful snoozefest",
            "content": "With critics and film afficionados inventing new superlatives to describe it, I really want to love this film. Cinema needed a new entry in gay romance that could take its place alongside Brokeback Mountain. Alas, this is not it.Set in the 1980s, the story centers on the summer love affair that develops between 17-year-old Elio (Timothee Chalamet) and visiting grad student Oliver (Armie Hammer), who shows up to assist Elio's professor dad at their idyllic Italian villa. The film touches on all the pitfalls and heightened emotions of first love between two erudite and well-spoken guys. The parents are present throughout, but pretty much leave Elio to his own devices, to write his music, read and fantasize. The film largely has two things going for it. First is the beautiful photography. Everything looks lush and intoxicating - the villa, the quaint Italian villages, and gorgeous scenery. Second is Chalamet's lead performance. He disappears into the role of Elio - never for one moment do we not believe that this is who he is. The intelligence, the emotion, all are genuine. Although not a fan of the film, I think this performance is easily better than Gary Oldman's bring-out-the-latex Winston Churchill that took the Best Actor award this year. It will be interesting to see if Chalamet can maintain the acting momentum in his next roles.That said, the film is well over two hours and does not merit that length by a long shot. As beautiful as the scenery can be, director Luca Guadagnino spends absurd amounts of time focusing endlessly on fountains and streets and trees to the point where one wants to shout at the screen to get on with it already. While establishing the scene is important, a little less of Elio's parents and visitors having long-winded philosophical conversations to hammer home the point that we are walking among brilliant, high-minded individuals would also have been welcome. It truly seems forever for the leads to acknowledge their attraction and act on it, and that is the crux of the film.A big failure is that every great love story needs chemistry. As terrific as Chalamet is in bringing his character to life on screen, he cannot generate any chemistry with co-star Hammer. In my mind, Hammer suffers from something I tend to call \"The Idris Elba Syndrome\" in that everyone keeps stressing what a fantastic and charismatic performer he is and I really want to like him, but I find him more often than not stiff and uninvolving. Here is no exception. I give him credit for taking on what is apparently still a stigma of playing a gay role, but there is not an ounce of chemistry with Chalamet. While physically Hammer fits the bill of the glamorous movie star-like American visitor (I keep waiting for him to reach under the table and bring up a box of toothpaste to shill) that is about all he brings here. He looks a bit long in tooth to be a 25-year-old grad student. He keeps referring to working on papers and is given a moment to wow us with his intellect wherein he corrects Elio's dad on something - but the dialogue seems unbelievable coming out of his mouth. He captivates all the young women in town who gaze at him adoringly on the dance floor and discuss his prowess as a dancer - another laughable moment since Hammer looks more like someone suffering palsy than dancing. Worst of all, in the romantic moments, he is stiff, stiff, stiff. We know ahead of time that Oliver and Elio will eventually part at the end of summer, but we should not already be acknowledging that Elio can do better.Another problem is how staid the film is given its purported bona fides as being an \"erotic\" tale of first love. The much-ballyhooed notorious peach scene seems more American Pie-ish than erotic. When Elio and Oliver finally have their first love scene, the camera moves from the still partially clothes actors to a minute-and-a-half stationary shot of a tree outside the window. Really? If the actors and/or the director were this timid, why not just fade to black rather than have a lengthy shot of a tree? If any film called out for some degree of nudity, it is this one, but all we get is brief or blink-and-you'll miss it shots. Chalamet briefly bares his rear walking into the bathroom to change. You would need a bionic eye to catch a split second shot of Hammer pulling up his bathing trunks, while his only other revealing scene takes place in such darkness by a window that it could be Kate Smith standing there. Ironically, we get more skin from a topless supporting actress in a tete-a-tete with Elio. The male nudity in this film could easily have passed unedited in a PG-rated film - I am pretty sure Cops and Robbersons had more lengthy nudity. Producer/writer James Ivory complained to the press about the timidity of American actors and their refusal to do frontal or casual nude scenes when the material called for it - and he has a point here. Perhaps at least Hammer's role should have gone to a European actor that could assimilate an American accent. As it stands, instead of eroticism, we get a rather staid and dull series of coyly filmed encounters - and let's not forget that tree!By the end, I was struggling to stay awake and actually was mentally urging Elio and Oliver to part. Michael Stuhlbarg as Elio's dad gets an inspiring speech at the end, but you may well have wished the film ended a good thirty minutes previously. I am all for further explorations into gay romance and look forward to them, but I certainly hope that they are more successful than Call Me By Your Name. Perhaps in another 10-20 years someone will remake this effort with a bit of a pulse. It would be hard to better Chalamet, but the inclusion of a mannequin in Hammer's role may be an improvement. I know people love this film, but this was a really sad miss for me.",

Over the years I haven't watched nearly as many foreign or art films as I once did, but this one is a nice change from the shallow Hollywood garbage that I am exposed to living in America.I like that \"Call Me By Your Name\" doesn't really have much of a plot, and there isn't much conflict other than the unspoken desire between the two main characters that takes up most of the first half of the film. This is a film about a gay relationship, so homophobes beware. It is refreshingly devoid of gay stereotypes.It's nice to see a movie that doesn't rely on forced dramatic conflict to make things exciting. In a typical Hollywood film, for example, Elio's father would find out about Elio's and Oliver's relationship, and there would be a big fight and lots of clich\u00e9d drama. No such thing happens in \"Call Me By Your Name.\" Elio's father is compassionate and understanding, and is almost quietly envious of Elio's and Oliver's friendship. In fact, all the characters in the film are kind and compassionate, and the film is filled with sweet little moments of the two main characters swimming, exploring an old church, dancing to The Psychedelic Furs (the film takes place in 1983), etc. The characters are shown being sexually intimate, but the sexual intimacy isn't the primary focus.\"Call Me By Your Name\" was directed by Luca Guadagnino and written by James Ivory (one half of Merchant/Ivory). It's full of sumptuous scenes of the Italian countryside, the dialogue is literate, and the characters are smart. So many films (especially ones I'm used to in the U. S.) are about dumb characters doing awful things to one another. It is nice to see a film about intelligent, passionate people. For most of the film, I watched Elio and Oliver as if I were watching real people interact and form a relationship. If that sounds like something you'd hate, I feel sorry for you. The next Marvel movie is being assembled at this very moment.",

The film may be a star-making performance for lead actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (career year for him, he's in Lady Bird too among others) and he was really good most of the time, even if I am not entirely sure if it was good enough for an Oscar nomination. He succeeds with his charm for sure and with the fact that he is in virtually every scene of the film from start to finish.It is the story of a young man who falls in love with his father's new assistant, so this is a gay-themed movie for the most part and the fact that the two cannot live out their dedication to each other in public makes things very complicated, especially as it is the experience of first love for the protagonist and here we are talking about love, a deeper sensual feeling, not just sexual attraction. Elio is a boy who really can have all the girls and also has a pretty attractive one and enjoys having sex with her too. I think besides the character study and coming-of-age component, the one area where the film really succeeds is the joie de vivre, the dolce vita. You really want to be there with the characters in Italy and enjoy the delicacies and the nature and it fits in extremely well with the sensuality of the whole story. What else? Oh yeah, you see how well the film works because you will never feel envy or jealousy watching this one. the central character may be a rich kid, but it's never at all about rich people problems etc. The calling one's name component is one that is not too easy to appreciate. There is an ounce of pretentiousness to it to be honest, especially when they say each other's names at the very end during the phone conversation. But it is not a negative deal breaker. There are perspectives from which you can like this too.Another thing I need to say is that I really liked Michael Stuhlbarg here. While everybody is complaining about Armie Hammer being snubbed at the Oscars (and yes he was good for sure too), I think that Stuhlbarg gives such a simple, effortless and restrained performance here that I just could not look away during all his scenes. The scene at the ending with his confession to his son is a definite contender for very best scene of the year. Man he was so good in this one, really touching and easily the best moment of the entire movie and that says quite something. The closing credits rolling in with the tears rolling was a nice way to end the film too and it worked pretty well. And the Oscar-nominated song fits the film perfectly too in tone and style and I would have been very fine with it taking home the grand prize, even if the one from Coco wasn't too shabby either. All in all, I would not say that CMbYN is one of the very best films of the year, but it has some very good moments for sure and there is no hesitation when it comes to my decision that I give this one a thumbs-up. Sure Chalamet is far from the level of Ledger in Brokeback Mountain and the film as a whole is weaker too, but he is also way younger still, so it is all good. I definitely think you should check this one out and if it is too slow for you, then you can still stop watching. It is certainly not a film for everybody and scenes like the jerking-off on one occasion may be a bit irritating to some, but these moments when the film does not feel too realistic are really not too frequent and almost everything else about these almost 2 hours and 15 minutes is pretty swell. Go see it.",

A coming-of-age tale of a 17 year old boy, Elio Perlman (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), who never knew what love was until his father's annual summer intern, Oliver (Armie Hammer) visits them in the summer of 1983. The initial part of the story is about Elio spending his summer with the locals and flirting with Marzia, his friend, feeling nothing but the impulse of a teenage boy until Oliver starts dancing to the same tune as Marzia. Elio's heart finally beats in rhythms, he feels alive, just like every person who watches this masterpiece would feel!Unravelling the Mystery of love!The love Elio and Oliver feels crawls into us in a way unclear to the mind, that we never get enough of the love they feel. The music by Sufjan Stevens (Mystery of Love, Visions of Gideon, Futile devices) in the movie also creates an ambiguity in the viewers that we will find ourselves craving for more of their love, each and every time we contemplate.Another factor that attracts us to this spectacular adaptation is the connection Elio has to his father and mother, especially his father. To the end of the movie we come across a monologue by Mr.Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) which will stay in our hearts forever knowingly or unknowingly, one which we will keep speculating, wondering why.In this era where 'Pride' is all about being proud about ones sexuality, desires and personality, this movie is a diamond shining in the dark of a homophobic society set in the earliest of times as a proof to the fact that being gay or not living according to the traditional gender norms is not a \"condition to be treated\" or simply a \"choice\".The walls in our hearts begin to fall apart when the walls separating Elio and Oliver start melting into the ocean of their love, unravelling the mystery of their love.",

            "content": "-Spanish speaker girl writing (and first time doing a review of a movie) so please bear with me, might have some weird expressions-Over the last days, I have been trying to get myself together from the emotional shock I felt after watching the movie Call me by your name. This movie only reached out to me in the first days of 2022 while being in bed with Covid. I am recovered from Covid but not from the movie shock. Oh no. I have talked about this emotional tsunami with my family, friends, a co-worker and therapist, and still can't find the thread to pull me out from the revolution it caused in my life.Some people say that when one enters a crisis it is never just one thing that lead us there, but I can surely affirm that this movie was the trigger and hopefully the spark for something new in my life. It was a trigger of feeling and desires that were inside of me. There is something about some kind of art, that to experience it so close, provokes me to release things from within me I didn't even know they were there. This is what this movie did to me.The first thing it released was pain, that pain I feel from frustration, the frustration of something I haven't achieved, or succeed at. Different scenes of the movie centers around the feeling of Elio of not reaching its object of desire and I felt that feeling in the deepest part of my body. It broke my heart one and over again to watch him suffer, and remembering inside me that pain I felt so many times before, not only desiring a love one, but also other elements of life itself.There is a very present aspect in the movie that is the naturalness of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet acting. You can see him playing Elio so freely, loose, expressing his feelings and wishes. That aspect moved me enormously, I saw myself reflected in my youth or maybe my inner youth right now, those aspects of myself that want to be free and that I had covered for so many years.But, putting aside the narrative of the movie, the story behind it and the admiration I felt for the talent of Timoth\u00e9e, what shocked me the most was the way this movie expressed art, the wonderful soul of art, the only way I feel I can call art by its name, it's unsurprisingly with calling by your name. This art that reached to my heart, that left me on my knees, in front of it I just want to crawl and cry... so its lucky I didn't watched this movie on its released in cinema, or I would have been really embarrassed by all the movements and noises I had to do to release the stress from the emotions I was feeling. In front of this art I felt small, I felt like nothing, like nothing is worthy after this or apart from this. I am sure it wasn't Luca's intention, or maybe it was. But this art made me feel the only thing that matters was to live this art inside, inside of me.The scene where Elio confesses what he felt to Oliver, I needed to watch it in sections, had to stop and process everything that was going on. I later heard Luca saying that on Armie's suggestions this was shot on one take, and that they had to wait quite much to do the scene. Its incredible how the fusion of reality and fiction can become a piece of art. One can feel the tension, the nervousness of the actors when talking about what they felt, showing with their bodies how they want to stay apart from each other but at the same time, be together at the end.In this incredible scene, they are talking about something that the camera doesn't show, I guess on purpose, to create this intrigue around it and to focus on the characters, they are talking abouts the monument of the young men that died in the first world war. Although this scene starts by them reaching to that square, it actually starts the day before, when Elios mom (probably already suspecting what was going on between him and Oliver) reads a story to Elio about a knight who didn't dare to confess his love to a woman. The knight raises this dilemma: to speak or to die.Meanwhile, in the movie, in that square starring at that monument this dilemma becomes artistically graphic. Death represented by the monument of dead soldiers and the young Elio trying to awkwardly confess what he feels to Oliver. And the camera just sits there, like if we were drinking a caf\u00e9 in the square and witnessing it all. Watching them move with lightness, shyness, security and insecurity, naturalness....so much humanity portrait in just one scene that it hurts! So real and human. I am astound on how so many elements can be placed together and create something this beautiful!And of course, the peach scene, the crying of Elio while hugging Oliver, the whispering of: I don't want you to go....expressed after so many moment of silence and tension between the characters, moments where Elio was experiencing an uncomfortable strong feeling that he couldn't express until Oliver shows how much he loves him and accepts him by tempting to eat the peach. Elio then dares to express how much he didn't want Oliver to go, and that was the reason he was so apathic and mad. So many emotions hidden and beautifully graphed.I not only left exactly as Elio was feeling in my life, but the way the movie represents it, the phase of that scene, that tussle to try to take away the peach like metaphorically trying to take away the uncomfortable feelings they had. And then, the relief Elio feels when he realizes he can cry and express his wish for Oliver to stay, by giving him the most real hug I have seen on a movie. The way the scene is shoot, first making you feel you there with Elio, with him in bed, feeling the awkwardness of the peach situation, and then when Oliver arrives to the scene the camera moves away, not to far but enough to give them privacy, to not interrupt them. The colors of the scene that transforms a dirty and dusty attic in a nest of love and comfort. If this is not art, I don't know what it is.And like those, many other scenes left me in awe: Elio and Oliver riding their bikes on their way to the lake, and the camera just leaves us there watching them get far away from us, made me feel like please don't leave me here, take me with you!; the clumsiness and nervousness of Elio on his first night with Oliver and the quiet and lovely way he confesses that he is nervous, when moments before with Martia he seems so confident and like he knew what he was doing. And there with Oliver, on the presence of a true connection of true feelings that upstand the sexual attraction, he was just a scared kid. The need for that physical and emotional connection between them, of breathing close on to the other, so well portrait by 2 heterosexual men made me reflect on the beauty of love, the purity of love, and the transcendent dimension of it. Of course, I instantly felt bad for Martia throughout the whole movie, because of the way she doesn't know how to realize that the relationship with Elio was not real love, it was not a real connection.The almost final scene where Elio speaks with his father, and the loving acceptance he upholds for his sons feelings, the phrase (that I had to stop the movie to write it down): \"but to make yourself feel nothing as not to feel anything...what a waste\" making us feel like we are his sons and daughters, transmitting with subtlety the most beautiful learning a loving relationship can give you: to just feel it all! To let love and sorrow and pain flow through you, it matters not if you suffer, it is a waste if you don't let yourself feel, it's a waste of life and it makes us having less to offer. Who would not stop at this point to reconsider if they are living according to this!The many faces of Elio's mother watching him from distance, knowing what Elio felt for Oliver even before he knew it, so well played by the actress. The crying of Elio in her mom's car, the same as my many tears droped in my mom's kitchen! And specially the recent ones, after this movie has made me rethink what I am doing with my life and why I don't dedicate it to cinematography arts.That final crying in the last scene, that was difficult to come, but finally it did come, because yes, time had passed....water under the bridge had passed, but the pain is still there...and it needs to flow.Maybe someone working in the film industry can tell me how do I continue from now on...how one continues living when a movie like this shakes your foundations, makes you reconsider what you did with your life and question why I haven't dedicated to do exactly what Luca and this team had done: an emotional and audiovisual art (I would call it). What do you do when you realize nothing you have done so far makes sense if you don't give space for this type of art in your life? Any cinema affectionate that has gone through something like this? There must be....any tip? Any experience to share? Please help me find the thread to pull and get out of this mess in which, unlike Elio and Oliver, I don't even know my name anymore.",

First, Andre Aciman has a deep understanding of the problem of men who are both gay and also feel unhappy about being gay, or rather understanding men who are both straight and gay at the same time. He is better than a shrink or therapist in demonstrating the joys and sorrows of men of this sort.Still, living through the emotions of the two male characters is not only painful, it is also boring and predictable. It turns out that the only really sympathetic character in the story is the father of the young boy Elio. He alone seems to understand his son and his protege's basic problems and he alone has himself been to some extent in their predicament. In fact one could believe from his role that all men are to some extent in this dilemma of dual sexuality.My only question is this: who want to know all this? Does this story, granted its brilliant analyses of the problems dealt with, really help anyone who might be in similar dilemmas? I think rather the story is so true to life that it can only cause pain. And if all men to a degree are represented here by the two principal male characters the pain is even more intense for those who do not recognize who they really are sexually, having perhaps blocked self understanding lest they learn too much.",

I'll be honest by saying that I personally did not love this film as much as the majority of viewers did. But I am in no way bashing the film or saying it's not worthy of praise because some aspects of it are worthy. I'll go over the positives first. The biggest upside to this film is the acting. Both Charlamet and Hammer give great performances, they really do. Charlamet was deserving of the Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. I was very impressed by his work and I connected with his character. Hammer was good as well, and I was also impressed. I didn't really like his character that much, and I didn't care for their chemistry, in fact I felt there was a lack of it.

It impresses on every level.More than anyone else, Guadagnino has a perfect grasp on appeal to the human senses. Just because of the sound design, this world was immediately immersive, believable and realistic.One thing that immediately sets this film apart is that it is essentially plotless. It has a well-defined structure for sure, but really the whole story is just about how these two people discover themselves and build a relationship. This in turn helps avoid so many of the gay romance tropes that have come to annoy me incessantly; no \"angry parents walking in\", no \"OMG GET AWAY FROM ME FAGGOT\" at school, no \"we're just friends, I'm not gay!\".I won't reveal how this film ends. Even if I did, I don't even know if I would call it a spoiler. It is incredibly sobering and is a hard dose of reality; no overly contrived turn of events waiting for you at the end.My only complaint with this film is that there could have been less time spent on Elio's girlfriend and more on Oliver. At times, it felt like the screentime delegated to Marzie somewhat detracted from the main relationship.",

I loved the peach theme running through the film from Oliver chugging a glass of juice as if it were water to the insanely sensual while barely sexual scene towards the end with feelings of violation and pleasure and disgust and sweetness and so much that cannot be translated into words that Elio might have felt. I loved how there were no close-ups of Olivier early on - we were getting to know him at the same time as other characters were. And how in spite of his brash, borderline rude demeanor half way through the film everyone on screen and me watching fall in love with him. The acting is restrained and real. My only complaint is that Armie Hammer may have been too restrained. I get it, Oliver is used to putting up a front and keeping his emotions tightly wrapped inside, but I felt a little bit of warmth could have gone a long way.",

One day, his parents decide to host 24-year-olf graduate student Oliver during the summer in order for him to help Elio's father with his research. Elio and Oliver's personality are drastically different, with the former being quite an introvert and solitary youngster, while the latter is a carefree and extroverted mature man. Elio will not find much interest in Oliver at first, but he will soon find himself attracted to him, much to his own confusion. Begins here a game of seduction which will bring more to both men then imagined at first. \nCall Me By Your Name is love between two individuals at its purest form and leaves viewers with tissues to cry with when the credits start rolling at the end. It is relatable in so many ways, tackling the subjects of first love, first sexual relations, separation, heartbreak and does so while beautifully and adequately representing the LGBT community. While the story can seem slow at first with very few dialogue, this brings the movie its realistic aspect and helps the viewers truly get to know Elio and Oliver's personalities and identify with their individual experiences. The cinematography, with many shots within Elio's house's garden or in the woods, is beautiful and fits very well with the simplicity and naturality of Elio and Oliver's relationship. Finally, the soundtrack is a blessing to one's ears and resonates Elio and Oliver's personal feelings in each scene, notably in the very last and heart wrenching scene with Elio.\nCall Me By Your Name therefore successfully transports its viewers to their first teen summers, but also helps younger viewers see the beautiful yet harsh reality of love in a poetic and aesthetically pleasing way and how to handle it. I therefore greatly encourage everyone to watch it and enter the world of Elio and Oliver.",

            "content": "In 1983, the year this film takes place, I was 22, coming out, and studying art history in university. I knew guys like this - gay men leading straight lives... and that's not them. I also know intellectual banter and pretentious meanderings when I hear it, and that part didn't ring true either. The conversation over the word apricot is borderline silly, but the explanation of Hellenic sensual art is downright unbelievable! The words of a professor to an introductory class on Greek Art 101 are not spoken between a doctoral candidate and his professor -- that's baby talk.The biggest problem with this film is that there is no chemistry between the actors who play Oliver and Elio. They clearly come across as two straight actors pretending to be gay in a very guy way - complete with rough housing.Oliver who is supposed to be 30ish? is played by Armand Hammer (who looks a LOT like Halston and should play him in a movie some day if he can learn to play gay because he's not doing it here...) He is a PHD student of an indeterminate age supposedly helping his professor with research during the summer, but is rarely shown doing anything related to work. He has an inability to eat soft boiled eggs, manages to fit a LOT of clothes into one knapsack, can NOT dance like its 1983, and comes across as short tempered and pretentious.Elio who is 17 and played by Timothee Chalamet is precocious, inexplicably weird about certain aspects of gay sex, can not dance like a gay man, has no problem obtaining record breaking fast orgasms with women and fruit, and does NOT come across as a virgin with men or women in the film. Elio does not hide his feelings - something a gay man who doesn't want his parents to know would have hid MUCH better. Aside from the creepy factor of 30 and 17, which is justified in a Greek Love kind of way, the movie suffers from a contemporary metoo# sensibility with the Oliver character coming on to Elio, who rebuffs him - Oliver then ignores Elio, while Elio throws himself at him, and culminates with the two of them getting together but only after clear verbal approval is granted by Elio. With follow-up discussion about not wanting any trouble... This was NOT how gay sex went down in 1983... And certainly not under the approving eyes of the 17 year old's parents!",

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name is a drama film starring Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Based on the 2007 novel of the same name by Andr\u00e8 Aciman, it is a beautifully told and often poignant story of forbidden love.In 1983, a young man named Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) lives near a countryside town in Italy with his parents. One day, Elio's archaeologist father invites an American graduate student named Oliver (Armie Hammer) to stay with them over the course of the summertime to help out with his paperwork. During Oliver's six week stay, he and Elio bond over their mutual Jewish heritage and their emerging feelings for one another.Touching and melancholic, Call Me By Your Name never feels pretentious or forced in its showcase of love and romance and it leaves a powerful impression on the viewer right up to the end credits. Both Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet have great on-screen chemistry and director Luca Guadagnino does a superb job in showing their growing relationship throughout the course of the story. The film's cinematography is fantastic. We are often shown the glorious open Italian landscape, which serves as a great setting for some of the film's more dramatic moments. The soundtrack, which includes songs from musician Sufjan Stevens, is worth noting as well. Stevens' lyrics about personal longing and coming-of-age suit the film's tone perfectly and help project the viewer into the mindset of its two lead characters.I rate it 8.5/10",

Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet provides us with an abject ebullition of beauty and perfection, when it was least expected, and his career in cinema can only burgeon from here onwards.

I was hoping for another Brokeback Mountain, instead I sat through I film so dull it felt like it was six hours long. I don't know how old Oliver was supposed to be, every indication seemed to be that he was in his late 20s judging by his apparent education and physical appearance. That just makes him pretty much a sexual predator preying on a confused, naive seventeen year old boy. That is not the basis of a great love story. If the story was about a heterosexual relationship and Elio was a girl, then Oliver would come across as a predator and people might notice that nothing actually happens in the entire film.There was no conflict at any point in the film, Brokeback Mountain or Moonlight had the societal pressures against their relationships weighing on them, feeding into their confusion and struggle. That is not present here, no one has any problem with homosexuality, and while there is certainly nothing wrong with that, storytelling thrives on conflict, and that was certainly missing. It was essentially a summer love rom-com without any comedy. There was no reason to care about the characters, as someone who is not homosexual, there was no way for me to connect to any of the characters, because they really weren't given any other traits. This led to me really not caring what happened to any of them in their pampered carefree lives.The entire film is building towards a speech at the end that was well done and served as the culmination of the entire film. Then, at a perfect moment to roll credits and leave on a high note, it then proceeds for 5 more minutes to no effect besides destroying any lasting impact of the speech.",

It's just gorgeous; sure, it's a tad too long, but the story and the setting is just wonderful.But don't be fooled, this is a story that quintessentially captures the essence of the 80s: fear!If you're a millennial who has no experience of that time, where you are now free to love who you wish and the world is accepting of homosexuality, then welcome to a new and wonderful world. BUT it wasn't always this way. The 80s were a time when homosexuality was a dirty word, where gay culture was really in its infancy and there was a lot of fear. Most people didn't even know an \"out\" gay person and gay people were mostly the subject of jokes and derision. Hell we didn't know about Freddy Mercury - that's how naive we were!So this was the 80s, and WORSE, the EARLY 80s, so it's entirely understandable that Oliver is terrified about his secret coming out; it ruined careers and shattered lives back then.Most men in the 80s lived bizarre double lives, and it's entirely true to form here. The men had families, wives, and were visiting public toilets to get their true desires fulfilled. This was how it was. Ultimately, the relationship between Oliver and Elio is a fairy tale which only now could be made real.",

But I have this weird feeling on the stomach and the tears have almost dried on my cheeks, so I have to speak my truth. It's such a bittersweet story for two people that are wondering if they should \"speak or die\".\nIt's such a worthy experience going through this emotional trip with them as the main characters. It's like holding the hand of the person, you have fallen in love in the past, but he/she broke your heart into pieces, because.. well because of one thousand reasons. It's bringing you back memories of all the moments that passion has overruled every inch of your logic, your heart was racing and your breath, except of getting faster, was here and then cut.\nSo, this movie May break your heart and if you're a bit like me, you may beg for endings full of smiles, flowers, rainbows and everything colorful, but the realism comes silently and hugs you from the back, trying to give you the comfort to cry on her shoulder (the realism's) and in the same time find your forgotten, just a bit broken, smile. So this is a sweet, realistic, must see, brilliant, with amazing power to make you feel the passion and even more amazing actors, movie!!",

Let alone one that is of LGBT-themed. But the thing is unlike many other LGBT-themed films that usually independently-made this one got mainstream attention.And I'm glad it did, especially having read the book years ago. So knowing that it's getting a screen adaptation I was naturally ecstatic.And it could very well be the best LGBT film I'd seen so far.As genre-centric as it is, the pair of lovers could simply be interchangeable with hetero couples or anyone with a heart.In essence, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is a human story that is multi-layered. As for the tempo of the film, no doubt it was a slow burn but the emotional payoff at the end of the movie was worth it. In a sense that, we feel the heartbreak that Elio felt. Not to mention, those scenes served the story in the bigger aspect of the movie.As strange as it sounds, it weirdly felt good to be torn apart emotionally in such a way. Perhaps, as human beings, we yearn for some affection some way or another. And thus, deep in our hearts we can relate to the emotions of the characters whether we choose to be opened or discreetly be quiet about it.And granted that, both Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer (even Michael Stuhlbarg) were playing their respective roles, yet the impacts from the characters they played left a deep impression on myself having seen how they evolved through the film.To quote a reviewer, he described the film as a visual poetry.

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name (2017, Luca Guadagnino)\nSo this is another of those films that I wonder if I was just watching it without the added virtue of knowing it is one of the best reviewed films of 2017 would my thoughts and feelings about it change, and I think to some degree that can't help but alter my perception. This is a very sweet, low key story with a European aesthetic which is not surprising considering it's production team and setting. It feels very languid yet not unfocused which is perfect for the Italian setting and as the story revolves around what is essentially a summer fling it fits that type of story very well. The story focuses on teenager Elio, played in an Oscar nominated performance by Timothee Chalamet, whose father is a professor and during the summers he usually has a research assistant come stay with him and his family in the Italian countryside for the summer. The year is 1983 and this summer's research assistant du jour is Oliver played in an excellent supporting role by Armie Hammer. Over the course of the summer Elio and Oliver get closer until eventually they become embroiled in full fledged sexual relationship. The film takes a very interesting stance on their burgeoning relationship though and I am not even sure how to categorize it. It is completely nonjudgmental and their relationship doesn't necessarily progress in a completely rhythmic, linear manner. There is an ebb and a flow to it along with a kind of will they or won't they or will they vibe. Wrapped up in that is a complete absence of any sense of societal guilt or pressure. I think from an American standpoint this story would be told and it would have to so clearly be wrapped in the politics of homosexuality and some resulting fear and oppression possibly leading to a cathartic moment. In this film they completely abandon, for the most part, any need to quantify or justify anything that occurs which I think is a breath of fresh air for a film that deals with homosexual themes. That lack of sexual judgment is also in apparent in the fact that despite dealing with a homosexual summer fling I am not positive that either of these two main characters are fully gay or straight and the film doesn't really demand they be one or the other. We see Elio in a heterosexual relationship before seamlessly transferring his attention to Oliver. There is a lot to really enjoy in \"Call Me By Your Name\" not the least of which is the acting combined with the genuine feel of the script as well as the music by Sufjan Stevens. The European setting is just glorious and feels like one of those memorable scenic places just plucked out of time serving as an example of aesthetic beauty. This film also contains one of the best scenes/interactions of the year in my estimation. I sitting there watching thinking this is a nice enough movie. Pretty enough to look at with a sweet story and everything, but then near the end there is an interaction between Elio and his father that was so heartfelt and lovely and emotional that it raised the entire profile of the movie for me. I enjoy seeing a product like this get recognition when otherwise it might just spiral into obscurity and never find an audience. That being said I am not sure I would quantify it as one of the best films of the year but I did enjoy it very much.Eric's Grade: B+",

It is not the kind of emotions that can be released. It is very vague and difficult to express with words. This feeling is wonderful. As if you were close to them, and surrounded them like a transparent person, and experienced that unforgettable summer together. In those days, Elio was blessed to have such enlightened parents, because in that relatively feudal era, in the face of such a special relationship, it took more than love and courage.When you are truly immersed in this story, you will feel that Elliot is like every adolescent teenager. The careful temptation between love and love and sex will be attracted by the shining people and be moved by him. . What deserves to be treasured is the purity of love, the simplicity of love. In this short summer of love, Oliver is at the relatively rational end. In a sense, Elio loves Oliver more than Oliver loves Elio. The long shot at the end of the film says it all.I have to say that summer in Italy is really attractive. Sunlight, villages, bicycles, fields, creeks, peaches, guitars, pianos, it seems like all the beautiful things in summer. Play guitar and compose in the shade, swim in the creek, ride a bicycle on the field road, drink soda on the roadside seat, read books, and wait for winter to come together. It couldn't be more romantic.Nothing feels more profound than these words of elio's father:\n\"When you were most caught off guard, God slyly found our most vulnerable place. You just have to remember that I am here. Now you may not want to feel anything, maybe you never want to feel anything, or maybe you are not willing Pour these things to me, but please feel what you feel. You have had a wonderful friendship, maybe beyond friendship, and I envy you. In my opinion, most parents would like all this to disappear and pray for them. The child let go, but I am not such a parent. In order to heal quickly, we stripped ourselves of too many things, so that at the age of thirty, our relationship was bankrupt. Every time a new relationship begins, we can give The less it is. But in order to keep myself from feeling and not feeling, how wasteful. I may have approached, but I have never owned what you have. There is always something blocking or blocking me. How? Living your life is your own business, you just have to remember that God gives our mind and body only once. And before you realize, your heart You are exhausted. As for your body, one day, no one wants to look at it again, and no one wants to approach. Now, you are full of sadness, pain, don't let these pains disappear, and don't lose the happiness you feel . \"These words apply not only to love between the same sex, but also to love between the opposite sex. The way to spend your life is up to you. Let it cry when you want to be sad, and laugh when you want happiness. You have the right to love someone, as long as it is reasonable and legal, no one is entitled to interfere. Same-sex love or heterosexual love is in essence the love of a person, love is not right or wrong. As spectators, we should respect each individual's right to pursue their own happiness.",

The shots are so beautiful and exquisite. The ending scene with Timoth\u00e9e crying in front of the fire with Visions of Gideon playing in the background. That is all. Beautiful. A French critic (Cin\u00e9ma Teaser) said that the film was \"Beautiful and heartbreaking like a first love\", I think we can not describe this film better. Masterful and poetic film, the best movie of 2017 !",

Elio and Oliver have several very emotional, romantic scenes until Oliver inevitably returns home and emotions boil over. Look out for the very best scene in the film towards the end where the father discussed the prior few week's emotional events with Elio during an extended dialogue scene (a master-class in parenting).

It is sadly the sort of film that attracts the sort of comment beginning, 'simply calling it a gay movie...' which is deeply patronising to LGBT people. That it is about how millennia of same sex hatred has poisoned many relationships, including this one is clear to me. Emotional abuse and loss of innocence are at the heart of this story, and the romanticism is soured. The actor who played Oliver was not a good choice. He had no ambiguity, and his heterosexual credentials were written like a badge all over him, but he will and has no doubt been praised for his courage on taking on the role. As for Elio he had more inner truth, but it was all acting and no BEING. It is yet another 'Gay' film in the pantheon of a half- hearted mainstream machine that wants to please everybody. Once Oliver was out of the way I felt something, and cried. With different male casting, and men who feel emotions from the INSIDE this could have been a masterpiece. And maybe another director. Too much Bertolucci in image and pace took up too much of the playing time. I like slow films. But too much scenery, and too much faux eroticism ( the male statues of antiquity for example ) ruined many a scene. I give it an 8 for the last part of the film. Before that I would have given it 5.",

            "content": "\"Call Me By Your Name\" is a marvelous meditation on first true love on a gay theme. The director, Luca Guadagnino, has created a film that simply refuses to force anything upon the viewer. The film is a masterful study of direction as observation-of letting things be as they are. Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet is a joy to behold on screen as a coming of age youth in the throws of self-identification and self-legitimization. His late-pubescent struggles with societal constraints and self-inflicted moral dilemmas permeate his nascent feelings for a mid-20s scholar who has come to assist his father at the family's Northern Italy summer retreat. It is an Oscar worthy performance-at once charming, evocative and tender. Armie Hammer's brusque and intelligent performance as the American scholar is also noteworthy. HIs scenes take us by ambush. As hawt as he is to look at, one can't help but be reminded of a rhinoceros charging out of underbrush when his character enters a room. And just like that, a rare new experience unfolds for these tentative lovers who find themselves in an era (the 80s) of overall non-acceptance. One gets the feeling, too, that this experience as it develops will never again be repeated. Interestingly, the AIDS epidemic does not touch this film. In my opinion, a wise decision by the director who transports us to a place of transcendent beauty, as first love ought to be. Love here is remote, fragile, un-worldly, and yet all-knowing, brave, undeniable. It is difficult to create a film so clear and direct in its depiction of life's ambiguities. I didn't want the film to end. A pleasure through and through.",

I'm simply stunned by the blatant hypocrisy that exists in a society that can't get enough sex in it's entertainment, and then is appalled when it happens in real life. When will we get some consistency? I'm also stunned by more than a handful of reviews here that extol the beauty of the relationship that developed between seventeen year old Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and twenty four year old graduate student Oliver (Armie Hammer). And with the apparent knowledge and consent of Elio's parents! The wonder of it all is that the film is wrapped in a sublime package of vibrant color and dashing provincial Italian life, and who wouldn't extol in the brilliant sun filled days of love and romance with a European back drop.Personally, the sight of Elio attempting to engage Oliver in a moment of wild abandon looked more to me like a frog trying to gain purchase on a slippery tree leaf. It looked just plain embarrassing to me if not downright comical. Look, I try to be as tolerant as possible with what passes for entertainment today, and I guess this resonates for a lot of movie watchers who admire a sympathetic treatment of gay relationships. But wouldn't it be something if ten years from now, actor Chalamet comes forward with his own tale of sexual exploitation in order to advance his career. It wouldn't surprise me a bit.",

            "content": "There are awful, bad, regular, admissible, good and excellent adapted screenplays. This belongs to that last lucky category. Adapting Aciman's words is not easy, I would say that it would be an unfilmable material, and not precisely in visual terms, it's actually the narrative and emotional weight that requires a reliable adaptation. \"Eight White Nights\" American writer has shown a particular delicacy describing the situations on paper, uses language and technique in a compact and naturally functional way, his narrations seem to breathe life in images, in real images. That's why James Ivory's screenplay deserves gold recognition, because, with the duty to be up to the vision of the author, the level of demand was considerably further, however, there was no risk whatsoever here. Based on a customary but effective mold, the plot has a traditional structure until the third act, because the resolution seems to get us back, emerging more problems, knowing such difficulties are mere vehicles used by the author to represent an irrefutable truth: real life isn't a fairy tale and will never be; at least, it was for half an hour. There are several tools implanted in the script that demonstrate a radical change to the romance genre, because, just like \"The Big Sick\" did, exposes the flourishing of a relationship in a tangible truth, I.E., around a panorama in which any of the viewers would live, unfriendly neighbors, relentless destinies, disappointments transformed into hope. It often ends in a \"realistic\" way, but we don't get ahead of it, and let's return to the beginning. Elio's tale is simple, not flat, he's a boy like any other, resigned to the emotions and warmth of the heat wave in his parents' holiday home; reading, playing, taking baths in the icy river and pedaling through the emblematic Mediterranean alleys. The touching and formally important thing about this character arrives when Oliver pops up in the place because he's the one who sets off the deep journey that the protagonist and the spectator will undertake. From the first scenes, this young man connects with the audience by means of his simplicity, candor and austerity, he's a teenager who simply lives music throughout summer, and then possibly the other, and the other, and so the same way until he typecast in the group of people who lives the moment and dies as a response to fate. Oliver is the key to a necessary abyss, because not only mean the awakening of a new sexual dimension, but also the awakening of maturation, acceptance, pain; love isn't always pure happiness. And we see that Eliot's life is rebuilt every time he is in Oliver's company in an ordinary, but beautiful way, he portrays what many young people may be experiencing now. Ivory didn't be seduced by sexual superficiality or bland approach on sodomy, he cuts out from the book the necessary stuff to conceive each line with patience, slowly but with a dynamic pace that achieves that the spectator, independently its gender or sexual identity, is reflected in the mortal desires of this pair of characters, makes us complicit in a thorny spiral that ends in a concerted fantastic point. There is no complete catharsis for Eliot because the movie doesn't represent a purgative experience for anyone, what the film aims to show is the vulnerability of feelings, regardless of race, color or flavor; we are indelible in the face of danger, we can always be hunters but also preys. As far as Oliver is concerned, from a distant and quite objective perspective, many would identify him as a supporting character, and although in part he is, the writer knows very well how to endow argumentative importance the limited cast, so he doesn't feel like a mere addition, as a tool, is someone vital to the story, someone who equally experiences not only sexual but emotional discoveries, is a three-dimensional invention that wants to have a \"summer love\", even so, if his life breaks apart. In the end, many people may think that Oliver got a happy ending, however, before a more acute and committed perspective, it was fully concluded that he is not, they will understand if they analyze in depth the telephone talk scene, it's not joy or simplicity what we notice in their voices, which have changed fully.Separate mention must be made of certain scenes that borders on the memorable. The pictures get a solid position in the story, thus, the conception and the approach of those moments play a vital role in different but powerful ways. From vitality-radiating lines to power-expelling dialogues, each moment builds one more pillar in the plot, no matter how insignificant may seem - there's a lot for the ordinary spectator surely, - they keep an intrinsic meaning correlated with the characters. I have selected just one and not randomly, this is starring Eliot and one peach. But, what does a peach turn into something so disruptive and disturbing, as Oliver would have said: (its scientific name, Prunus persica, literally means \"Persian plum\", as it is closely related to the plum)? Enough. Those who have seen the film will immediately understand what I'm talking about and although it seems that this scene simply finds its raison d'\u00eatre in the mania to disturb the audience, it's not, rather, its meaning expresses the doubts and experiments passing through his mind due to the moment in which he is, this scene insinuates Elio's final elections. It's a scene that, free from morbidness or stupefaction that it causes, has become lodged in my head, and not only my head, it 's curious to write in my browser \"peach\" and run into content related to the film. Interestingly, not all the best situations have to do with intrepid sexual stuff, because although in this field slides quite well, are those in which the reality spits us in the face, in which we see ourselves reflected our past or our present. Without a doubt, an intimate and very important achievement for adapted-screenplay stories.The performances are, beforehand, a foretold delight. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is off the charts as Eliot, the sincerity and fidelity that this young actor- who participates in two of the films nominated in the Academy Awards this year -imbues into the extracted-from-the-book character are overwhelming, establishing himself as the promising young of the moment, since with that final scene he ratifies a commendable tour de force. There is no doubt that the film wouldn't be the same without his simplicity and natural charisma, what is more, it'd be nothing because Chalamet is the whole film, his interpretation steals all the attention, even the praises that were directed towards enormous - figurative and literally - Armie Hammer. Over the years, we have seen that Hammer, a great Californian actor, has been able to balance the roles he signs up for, that is to say, has not been categorically opted for indie leads, therefore, taking part from Guy Ritchie's hyperactive stories to Boots Riley's narrative ferocity. It seems that the actor has taken on a big challenge with Oliver, one that means transmute himself internally with sensitivity and moral complexity. Hammer could catch much more attention if his character wasn't tied to the actions of the protagonist, however, with the great work done, in the same way you can notice an intoxicating and even captivating determination. Without hesitation, the chemistry between these two actors is mind-boggling and really unexpected, absolutely neither one of the scenes in which they shares screen feels synthetic, ridiculous or unnatural, nor those in which eroticism takes precedence, each part is propelled by the commitment and talent of these passionate actors, who, without necessarily being homosexual, builds a beautiful and intimate portrait about what love means, getting above barriers or stigmas. It's worth mentioning the fascinating work of the protagonist's parents, Amira Casar and Michael Stuhlbarg, especially the father's due to his tearful monologue, brimming with understanding and power, he expresses and encloses unusual skills.The soundtrack is also very well developed, with the anomaly of having two completely rewardable original songs. Every year, I've coincided with the winner of the BOS in the Academy Awards, because without thinking, I end up listening to the memorable song from the winner film on and on again. Last year, 'City of Stars' or 'Audition' from \"La La Land\" become my addiction, now, something strange happens because although \"Mystery of Love\" by Sufjan Stevens is nominated alongside great contenders from Disney, Netflix, and other indie studios, I feel and I think that either \"Remember Me\" from \"Coco\" or this fabulous song should take home a little golden man. One of the most beautiful, intimate and special compositions of the year.Personally, it could be the \"Brokeback Mountain\" for a new generation and not for its realistic approach to the portrait of virility or the importance of any person's feelings, but by the vastness of messages that a simply deep story can say, a change, that's what it wants. \"Call Me by Your Name\" by Luca Guadagnino invigorates again homosexual-love stories in cinema by means of a staggering coming-of-age, led by a terrifying interpretation of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and a shrewd and very personal eye of a director who fortifies his filmography, while it's one of the most faithful and emotionally charged film adaptations of the last century, proving that even if you have a pre-established foundation, originality, passion and creativity in the artistic field are vital for a motion picture which reaches a whole new level of emotional power, here, an example. Getting rid of taboos, this film is one of the most human, magnetic and heartfelt movies about teenagers and love I have seen in my short life, one that leaves opportunities for more bold and talented writers, actors, directors or any kind of artists to raise their hands and say: Here I am and this is my story.",

            "content": "There's the old saying \"The third time's the charm.\" Most directors figure themselves out or make their best film on the third try. Steven Spielberg (Jaws), Martin Scorsese (Mean Streets), and Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums) are some of the names on this list. After premiering his third feature film at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, director Luca Guadagnino unfortunately doesn't get access to this prestigious club. Set in northern Italy during the summer of 1983, 17-year-old Elio Perlman goes through the days with nothing to do expect playing piano, swimming, and reading. One day, a grad student by the name of Oliver comes to the house for a summer study abroad with Elio's father, who is an esteemed professor of Greco-Roman art and sculpture. At first, Oliver and Elio are two completely different people that can't seem to figure each other out. Both their physical bodies (Oliver strong and tall, while Elio skinny and pale) and ways of thinking (Oliver has confidence, Elio sticks to himself) are different, which leads both of them to be wildly curious about the other. This curiosity sparks a wide range feelings, eventually leading to an intimate relationship that makes them question and explore their sexual identities. The chemistry between the two leads is off the charts. Chalamet and Hammer excellently play off each other and keep every scene feeling natural. Director Luca Guadagnino patiently plays out their relationship throughout the whole summer, letting us soak up every detail of the Italian countryside and the lives inhabiting it. While slow and long stories usually bring out high emotions, this one failed to do that. The slow build up of rising actions drag the emotional weight down and make the final resolution fall flat and feel disappointing. The 130-minute runtime feels much longer as we painstakingly watch for the first two thirds as the leads contemplate the choices they are about to make. The emotional peak and my patience had worn thin at the point when they do make their decision. Guadagnino specializes in slow films that explore character's hidden wants and needs. He did this in 2015 with A Bigger Splash, which garnered fairly positive reviews from critics and mixed from audiences. He's definitely an expert on shooting in Italy, as this is his third consecutive film to be set in the country. His eye for breathtaking visuals is apparent in this film. The villa and the surrounding farmlands are shot beautifully and lend to a feeling of openness that the characters inhabit between each other. Guadagnino also uses the land as a way to get the characters to interact with each other. Whether it be bike riding or swimming, the earth offers many opportunities for the characters to spend time and learn about each other. The film also uses a couple songs from independent musician Sufjan Stevens. Each one brilliantly encompasses the setting and events that unfold throughout. \"Mystery of Love\" is an absolute must listen as it flows like a summer breeze and quietly symbolizes the emotional eight each character carries. Each actor holds their own and translates the heavy material from the page to the screen. Newcomer Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has a bright future ahead of him as he brilliantly plays a young adult experiencing a period in time where is uncertain of what he feels. He plays Elio as both intelligent for his age and challenged by what is going on around him with the arrival of Oliver. Armie Hammer gives probably his best performance yet as a character that can best be described as the perfect American hunk. He has the looks to get all the girls, but something inside of him lures him towards Elio even though it is against everything he's been taught and done. Hammer has the confidence of a beautiful man, but also the insecurity of someone who is experiencing love for the first time and doesn't know what to feel. The similarities between Chalamet and Hammer's performance is what connects their characters so tightly and make them so engaging to watch when they are on screen together.Michael Stuhlbarg also knocks it out of the park as the studious and caring father of Elio. He's always reaching out to his son to offer advice and support, but also wanting Elio to figure things out on his own. He caps off the film with an impressive monologue that ties everything up to an emotional close. It's a shame that a film like this one can have everything going for it except for the main plot. The great acting and gorgeous cinematography couldn't hold on to my interest long enough to warrant a reaction by the end. Just like a hot, lazy summer abroad, I just wanted it to end so I could go back home.",

Hammer portrays Oliver--a graduate student in anthropology. Oliver is every woman's dream, and every gay man's dream. He's handsome, intelligent, and he's immediately accepted by the villagers as he joins their ongoing card game.Elio Perlman (played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) is the son of the famous anthropologist with whom Oliver is working. He's handsome, intelligent, and talented. The girls love him, but he's exploring his own sexuality. Can you guess what happens next? This is basically a happy movie, because the Perlmans are so loving and approving, and the Tuscan scenery really is beautiful.

I was extremely bored with everything that does or doesn't happen in this movie from the beginning to the end, and in a few scenes, I was even disgusted. And that's not because I'm homophobic, \"Brokeback Mountain\" is one of my favorite movies, but because this movie is simply boring and these two people feel terribly wrong to me. Instead of rooting for them, the strongest emotion I felt while watching this was sorrow for that poor girl Elio screwed, literally and figuratively. The movie is far too long, too empty and unconvincing, and the only bright moment of it is the scene at the very end, when ending credits start and Timothee Chalamet shows his true skill, making everyone who has ever been brokenhearted relive that memory.5,5/10The scenes from which my stomach turned over: Third place is shared by the scene in which Marzia tells Elio that she is afraid he would hurt her, he was at that time already aware of his feelings for Oliver and he still has sex with her and then leaves her, and the scene where Oliver tells Elio that he's getting married.

            "content": "Call Me by Your Name had me hypnotized early on, before it revealed itself as one of the great coming-of-age love stories. This is a film told with masterful restraint, with enormous respect for an audience and for great cinematic traditions, shot in lush 35mm and it transported me to a time and place so specifically that I had to jar my head and reconnect with my surroundings when it was over. It is a great treat for the senses.The story is simple. It is the summer of 1983 and we meet a teenager, Elio (Timothee Chalamet) who spends his summers living with his family in a small village in northern Italy. His father (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a professor of history and archaeology, and invites a different graduate student to live with them each year. This year, the student is a charming, strutting American, Oliver (Armie Hammer). What begins as a tense sharing-of-space between the Elio and Oliver, morphs into something else, at first unmentionable, dancing around the obvious subject. And then onto something deeper, until we are lost in it along with them.Like Brokeback Mountain, another great film about love and loss, it transcends the narrow viewpoint about the characters' sexuality and tells a story simply about two people sharing a moment in time and a fleeting romance that impacts them both. This is not a movie about reckoning with sexuality, or dealing with intolerance, or shame - everybody surrounding the characters are accepting and loving. There are challenging aspects to the subject, around the age difference of Elio and Oliver, which also go unmentioned. It is not meant to carry a social or political message, and it doesn't judge. It is about a young man's first love experience, and all the complexities and strangeness around that experience which rings true to life, because life is complicated too.The performances are free-wheeling and touching. The cinematography is spectacular. Avoiding typical postcard-like views of Italy, it was shot in intimate 35mm and the result is transportive, with crisp, bright blue skies, deep sun-drenched yellows and colors of lost summer memories and landscapes and views of Crema which jump out at you. The format creates an atmosphere of nostalgia and romance which is captured so perfectly.Call Me by Your Name is a beautifully told film which is so obviously a classic that it left me immediately spellbound, and stayed with me for days after.",

Timothy Chalet was superb; as a viewer he brought me fully along for the sensuous and heartrenching ride of coming to terms with one's sexuality, identity and falling in love for the first time. This was a brilliant yet quiet depiction of someone coming to terms with their homosexuality and truly loving someone fully for the first time with the heartbreak that can naturally follow. Both Timothee and Armie Hammer deliver excellent performances: I truly believe that Elio and Oliver had this unique love story somewhere in the world. Elio's subtle yet wise and incredibly perceptive parents are a delight. The film has been directed beautifully, and the intensity of the love portrayed has a universal appeal. For me, Call me by your name reminded me simply that love is love; hurt is hurt; and longing is the same regardless of your sexual orientation.This film has truly touched my heart, made me reflect on my own first love experience, and for that reason, it will stay with me for a long time and go down as one of my all time favourite films.This is an easy 10/10.",

Such a rare chemistry between the two main actors (it will offend some people, those who are both prudes and priggish).It is a lovely tale..told beautifully and with such sensitivity to the 'subject matter' of the book giving the characters in the film the ability to shine. There is not one bad scene.The scenery itself is as stunning as the acting mostly taking part in Northern Italy in high summer and part in the winter too.There is humour, pathos, happiness and sadness too. One or two scenes will obviously offend even distress those weak and lacking in compassion in our society. But what those unfortunate souls will not realise is that this story took place in the early 1980's not much more than a decade after the subject of male love was altered in law in the late 1960's. One particularly simple scene but stunningly beautiful in its simplicity and delivery between Elio and his father right at the end of the film is worth watching in detail. Acted superlatively by both.It's one of those films that flies under the radar and was missed by most (including myself, I only discovered it by accident when I was trawling through films to watch late into last night instead of worrying and fretting over my wife being post operative in hospital).If you haven't seen it, I would urge you to... just be attentive to detail and open minded .....oh and have a box of tissues with you.P.

The two scenes at the end (the father/son dialogue and Elio by the fire) are heartbreaking/awe inspiring and stand among some of the best examples of acting/writing/filming in cinema. Kudos to everyone involved.\nOnly have a couple comments....as a gay man, I would have liked to see more physical sex scenes to heighten even more the intensity of their love. However, I understand that that could have resulted in an X rating in US which would have limited distribution and affected possible award nominations/wins. Also, Timothee looked 17 even though he was around 20/21 at the time of filming. However, Oliver (according to the book) was 24 at the time. Unfortunately, Armie was 29 at the time of filming and looked even older (probably due to a lot of filming in bright sunlight). This probably had a negative effect on some non-gay viewers and may have hurt the film's chances at more awards. The age difference seemed magnified by this and I don't remember that Oliver's age was ever stated in the film although Elio's was. It should have been.\nFinally, read the book. You will appreciate the film even more. Thanks to all involved for creating such a beautiful film. Look forward to seeing Timothee in future films....a great actor with a very promising career.",

The reason I say that is that this movie is clearly trying desperately to give off a foreign-movie vibe. It is trying to be a French movie, or maybe Italian or possibly Spanish. Alas, it is doing it very badly. It simply comes across as a very poor facsimile of this world movie genre.In the end we fast-forwarded from the 90 minute mark to the end. We could see the images at 10x speed, but couldn't hear the dialogue. Trust me, you can do this and won't miss a thing.There are three redeeming things to this disastrous movie.1. The fathers speech at the end. Absolutely brilliant and superbly performed.2. The acting. There are some superb performances.3. The cinematography. Very good, if slightly predictable for anyone familiar with international movies.

This for me was a long, drawn out, boring, not believable Stealing Beauty. While the Liv Tyler film was also slow and very similar, there was something likable about it. Both had beautiful scenery and seemed to parade young people's coming of age, first sexual encounters, and the European casualness surrounding sexuality. What I was very confused by is how Kevin Spacey was blackballed and dragged through the mud for misunderstanding cues by an underage guy in the '80s and then months later this movie is praised and yet is about the relationship of a man and a boy of similar ages in the '80s. Seems extremely hypocritical and a bit disturbing.Other than that this film had a tinge of creepy. I just did not get their relationship or on what planet Armie Hammer would be interested in this kid. I thought it was just me so I asked some gay male friends that are a similar age to Armie Hammer and they both did not get it either and their criticism of the pairing was harsher than mine. First of all, I'm shocked Armie Hammer is in his early 30s. I thought he was late 30s to early 40s. The whole time watching the film I was thinking, \"He looks like his father. What is romantic about some guy 20+ years older pursuing this kid?\" It seemed very Lolita to me. I was also shocked to find out the book was about a 26 yr-old having an affair with a teen boy. On no planet does Armie Hammer look 26. I just got the impression that this was some Roman Polanski style infatuation with twink boys because I did not find the relationship remotely believable. I'm sure the people who find this film beautiful and remarkable are guys like Bryan Singer and his cadre of old, creepy producer and casting friends. Armie Hammer is this Adonis who can hook up with anyone and Elio is this twerpy, annoying, dorky-cute teen that I can't imagine any grown man being attracted to let alone in love with unless, like I said, he fits into the Roman Polanski camp of dating teen French girls and dropping them off at high school. And, of course, like a classic Italian film, the parents know about it and are super chill about the affair.I also did not believe the pretentious scene where Elio, a 17 yr-old boy wanted to lay in his mother's lap while she read him 15th century German literature. Give me a break. This also played into the fantasy of some old dude's brain of Grinder fan fiction. I know American brainiacs who spent their teen years in Europe and they were obsessed with comic books and Dungeons & Dragons and dreaming of getting a girlfriend someday.The scenery in the film is beautiful...that's about all the film has. It's not a terrible film, it's just a bit creepy, unbelievable, and very slow without much payoff...other than the scenery and the romance of living in Europe.",

I still really enjoyed it, and thought it was touching, intimate, stylish and emotional, but there was just something missing.What was missing for me was the chemistry between Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet. Individually I thought their performances were great, and even when they were together and interacting it was fine. It was just when things got more emotional and intimate that the chemistry just didn't click. I just didn't find it believable and considering the lynchpin of the film is this bond between the two, it is hard to score this higher than an 8.I loved almost everything else about this film. Great plot, lovely tone and style, beautiful direction with a romantic accompanying score, but the chemistry just didn't come through. Disappointing as I think individually each actor is great, but they just didn't fit together in this film.Definitely worth watching as I'm sure for lots of people the chemistry was palpable, but not for me. Still a great film regardless.",

            "content": "Simply, this is one of the greatest films ever made. From the moment it begins you are enraptured in North Italian summer. The first time I saw the film, I was waiting for the inevitable crackdown on Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and Oliver's (Armie Hammer) forbidden romance. However the unexpected happened. Instead of the taboo nature of their relationship driving them apart it was a more realistic process. Time, circumstance, distance. All of these factors have affects on real life relationships and director Luca Guadagnino certainly understands this given his honest portrayal of relationships. As the events of the film unfold you are caught in the explosive romance of Elio and Oliver. After finally professing their feelings for one another Elio and Oliver have a brief trip together. The camera tracks a path in the woods, all other sounds drop out and only the score plays. Finally, the audience and the characters are free. Free to enjoy the beauty of nature, humanity, and appreciate love (however fleeting it may be).The intimate, loving, and sensory experience provided by this film is unmatched. You cannot resist the charm of the Perlman's villa and their unnamed Italian town of residence. Anyone who has visited Italy or frankly anywhere in the Mediterranean will be able to relate to the perspective of this film. It captures a lazy Mediterranean summer in away only a director familiar with this lifestyle (such as Guadagnino) could.By the end of the film, you will walk away absolutely devastated. But as Mr. Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) says (in one of my favorite scenes ever put to film) \"...to have felt nothing at all, what a waste\". This is a modern masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come. It is easily one of the best romance films ever made. It solidifies Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as one of the most exciting young actors currently working, features an excellent supporting cast including wonderful performances by Michael Stuhlbarg and Armie Hammer, and a beautiful piano heavy score that occasional features original compositions by Surfjan Stevens.Summer, youth, love, loss, heartache, coming of age. All these themes are explored by Call Me By Your Name with sensitivity and occasional brutal honesty. Do yourself a favor and watch this once in a generation movie, you will not regret it.",

A spoiled 17-year old boy is in lust with an American man about ten years older who stays as a guest in their luxurious villa in Northern Italy. The longing, jealousy and insecurity of the boy are beautifully played by Timothee Chalamet, who steals the show in his breakthrough film. When the two men finally sleep together the film becomes much duller, with too many sex scenes for my liking and without the tension that kept the film going. To be openly gay was problematic in early eighties Italy (it still is), but the boy's parents are liberal and accepting and it doesn't seem to hold the boy back, nor does it give him the feeling of guilt and shame often associated with semi-illicit affairs.The social setting is straight out of Woody Allen with its privileged and cultured intellectuals. The boy is constantly seen reading high-brow literature, he plays the piano and transcribes classical music. The father is an archaeology professor who, as he admits to the boy in an overlong speech at the end, had homosexual leanings himself that he never acted upon. The scenery is reminiscent of Bertolucci and especially brings to mind his film Stealing Beauty. Attractive people who are swimming, dancing and playing games. Somehow there is not a tourist in sight. The idyllic surroundings and life style feel a contrived. Everything is just too perfect.Call Me by Your Name is convincing tale of young love with all its complications. The film is beautiful to look at and it has a sweet melancholic air about it, but it's also shallow and in the end has very little to say. Enjoy things as they last? There is no joy without pain? Not the masterpiece it is proclaimed to be, at least not in my opinion...",

I don't know if the actors adapted well to the script or if it's there talents that made this masterpiece of art, but the whole story had a real life rhythm.There aren't a lot of sex scenes and kissing but the bonding and and involuntary construction of a chemistry world. The way that Elio wanted Oliver badly and Oliver made it quite hard for him to it happen, is a portrait of our real life crushes on an individual. It is an image of the fear we feel when we are wondering if we really have to be involved with someone romantically.Marzia loved Elio dearly and him did loved her too. Chiara also wanted to be involved with Oliver but little did she know, Oliver was only interested only in Elio. Chiara reminded us that the perfect things that we relish and desire to possess are really not meant to dwell with us. Elio's confusion in deciding between Marzia and Oliver was a clear image of how unsure we get about the legitimacy of our desires when we're involved with someone and again happen to meet someone so special that we can't let go so easy.Call me by your name is a life-like masterpiece in the art of cinematography.",

Thimotee Chalamet is BEYOND PERFECT. He is like an open book. All his feelings are expressed so PERFECTLY on his face: the pain, the love, the confusion. This is a masterpiece. This movie is very personal to me and certain scenes just make me explode in tears. He is spot on!!!! I remember and I can feel the pain from 30 years ago and this young actor is simply magnificent. Armie Hammer is also terrific and the father is just an amazing character. The dialogue with his son towards the end is so true, so exact, so human.... even if fairly unlikely coming from a father.... I discovered this movie well over one year after it came out. I am not a movie fanatic and I must say that except for 20 or 30 movies I tend to forget everything about them because it is seldom memorable. \"Call me by your name\" is the real deal! I have never felt the need to post a movie review before. My all time favorite movie was until now from 1996. It took 21 years to best it.... This one will be hard to beat!

The movie can be draggy and at times, show random scenes that only last for 2 seconds but after rewatching it a second time, I realized the importance of these short scenes. This is not a film for people who don't understand Literature because this film expresses its form like Literature expresses its message. Elio and Oliver's relationship is that of innocence, something that is not completely based off sexual desires but it is also through attraction and love. There is also Oliver's fear of doing something wrong, especially with homosexuality since they are both Jewish which poses as one of his problems throughout the film. I loved the escalation of the film, the music that was nicely done and not popping out of random nowhere and the growth of Elio and Oliver's relationship is one of my biggest favourite things. The both of them not ending up together at the end was a great thing, no matter how heartbreaking. It shows the reality of both their lives and the distance that separates them both even though they still love each other. That was my favourite aspect of the movie and I respect films that have the courage to shatter people's worlds just like that because we're all too used to seeing happy endings by now. Heard there's a sequel coming up and I'm excited to see how distance and age have caught up to them both and how it'll change their relationship.",

            "content": "After only seeing one good movie during 2019 (Captain Marvel) and having nothing to do I started to check Oscars winners and I stumbled across this gem which I strangely ended up really liking. This is a very good movie!I thought this would be one of the worst movies I would ever see - it is a love story about gayness, Oscars winner, so of course this will be pretentious crap and political correctness stupidity right? Some Jewish family in Italy get a visit from a older gay guy that seduce the young \"boy\", so of course this is some pro pedo movie only loved by Joe Biden and James Gunn, right?\nSo wrong, I was so wrong. What I thought would be a bad movie I would laugh at and give a bad grade, ended up surprising me like few other movies have. I could not be happier of being so wrong. Well, perhaps \"happy\" is not the right word, because this is also heartbreaking on several levels.Let me start with the bad of this movie.The music is atrocious. It sort of fits, mostly, but it is not good, and sometimes even awful.\nA few scenes drag out a little too much - the movie is pretty long for this type of movie, and it get a bit boring, especially during the (sort of) 2nd act. This movie do not really have act\u00b4s, which fits the story, but it lacks that normal flow we as movie goers are used to, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I think they drag it out too much. This could easily have been cut down 15-20 min, and the movie would have been better for it.\nAnd for those of you looking for a LGBT movie with lots of political correctness to love (or hate) you will be disappointed. This is a love story, and it does not matter what gender they have or who they are, the story is what matters, and although everyone do a great job acting out that story it is the story, the very, very well written story that is the gem here.\nWhich means this is not a political statement, this is not promoting gayness or anything of the sort, which probably will disappoint a few, but for me this was so refreshing so it is a positive.\nAnd finally there are a few moments, especially in the long dragged out parts, that I think the directing could have been better. Don\u00b4t get me wrong, I think the director did a great job with this movie, but a few more cuts, and a few scenes that could have been shot better - since the script is so amazingly good, those directorial misses stand out.The god is literary everything else. I already mention the story, but it cannot be stressed enough. This has to be one of the best screenplays ever written - apparently based on a book that I have never read. The setting of the movie great, the acting amazing, almost everything in this movie breathes and show emotion in a way few movies do. The love story is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Few movies have captured my heart as much as this movie did, and the movie is about two Jewish men in Italy doing gay stuff, how did that happen? Why do I like this movie so much? Not sure, but as mentioned before, the script and the love story is fantastic and cannot be praised enough.I give this movie a 8/10. A strong 8. The reason why I do not go higher is because the movie drag too much, and the music bugged the hell out of me. This is such a great movie, but if the director had fixed a few scenes, cut perhaps 15 min or run-time and got better music to enhance the feeling of the film; then this could very well have been one of the best movies of all time. It really is that good.I do think you should either see this movie alone or as a couple. As a straight middle-age man thinking I\u00b4d see a politically correct gayness bonanza, I was crying and living this movie. But this love story man, oh man... If you have a partner or a girlfriend or whatnot, this will likely also be for you. If you are a bunch of friends looking for a nice entertaining movie; well, this might not be for you.With those impasses, I highly recommend this movie. Surprisingly great!",

Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet--who was recently introduced to audiences in 'Ladybird' and is destined for an even bigger spotlight--bask in the Northern Italian countryside, soaking in each other's company as the camera drifts like a zephyr through the idyllic scenery.The acting and cinematography particularly stand out, so much so that one must pity those (or themselves) who have to trudge back to their cars through crusty snow and single digit temperatures after watching these two lovebirds lounging in the sun for an entire summer.Given the subject matter and release date, I suspect that various film executives hoped this film would replicate last year's success of 'Moonlight'--which, let's not forget, won the Oscar for Best Picture--yet 'Call Me by Your Name' is simply far less compelling. And while it served as a pleasant respite from the harsh winter, it felt more like a June release both in feel and overall impact.",

These moments come in all of their melancholic glory in a conversation Elio shares with his father in the closing moments of the film. A conversation that soon becomes an honest lesson of life from an experienced academic who wasn't lucky enough to find what Elio so clearly experienced for even just a matter of moments. It's a beautifully touching scene that pleads to the inner romantic in all of us to muster up the courage and take every opportunity life throws at us. Because as we have learned on this journey we all share, even if just for a moment, to love and be loved by someone in return so completely is rarer than one could imagine.

The very first example which comes to my mind is Brokeback Mountain. The recently released BBC produced mini-series Man In An Orange Shirt is also worth mentioning. Elio is handsome and young, his father is rich and owns a luxurious villa in Europe. When spending his summer holidays on his father's estate Elio meets Oliver who is also handsome and young and just happens to be gay. The guys spend a lot of time together, swimming, bicycling and visiting neighboring cities. Eventually they have sex. But wait! The story is set in the early 1980-s. So, they can not be together. And their lives take them in different directions. The end. I have no idea if gay man who will watch this movie (and they definitely will watch it because Armie Hammer playing Oliver is very hot even from my straight point of view) will be able to relate to these characters and their story. After all as I said it is a well executed escapist gay themed fantasy. Watchable but not memorable.",

It's a visual poem and both, a sophisticated pure love portrayed through high arts, classical music, poetry and sculpture and a Lustful, crude\nand X-rated, steamy love as Elio and Oliver go from playing Love compositions and citing poems about entrapped love to Wild Love making and Peach* eating ;) all set in a colorful summer in this romantic village in Italy and the result is just beautiful, heart-warming and heart breaking too. I just loved how they grew to love each other more with each day as they got comfortable with their attraction and explored their love rather than boxing it in, going from defensive and tension to vulnerable and relieved and this was a joy to watch and Mr. Perlman's (Michael Stuhlbarg) lines to Elio at the end must be one of the most touching and evocative movie lines I've ever heard and the last scene is just heart-wrecking.

You will need to check your own compass to decide whether a homosexual sweet, gentle, coming-of-age love story between a 17 year old boy and a 23 year old grad student is the type of movie for you. But, if you give this one a chance, it is sweet and...well, gentle.It also is slow, languid and devoid of much story, but full of beautiful images, angst and heart.Based on the acclaimed novel by Andre Aciman, with a screenplay by James Ivory (of Merchant/Ivory fame) and directed by Italian Director Luca Guadagnino, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME tells the story of Elio, who is discovering life and love while spending the summer in Italy with his College professor father, his mother and graduate student Oliver, who lives with them while working with the professor. Elio discovers his own identity and sexuality when he builds a relationship with local female Marzia and then with Oliver.The lynch-pin of this film is the character of Elio, since we spend the entire film with him, and in the hands of Academy Award nominee Timothee Chalamet, we are in good hands. This young actor,shows much angst and frustration and the depths of joy, love and sadness in his face (often-times in the same shot) that made this character seem very real to me. Chalamet well deserves his Oscar nomination. Strongly complimenting him is Amira Casar as his mother, Esther Garrel as Marzia and, especially Michael Stuhlbarg as his college professor father. I had heard grumbling that Stuhlbarg should have been nominated for an Oscar, and I didn't quite see that - UNTIL - the final scene between father and son, which is (in essence) a marvelous long monologue by Stuhlbarg that is delivered in a quiet and unflashy fashion. This scene is worth the price of admission itself.And that is good, for the rest of the film is just as quiet as this final father/son scene. This movie is quiet, real quiet, almost...too quiet. I would have preferred some variation in mood and pacing along the way and this is because I really didn't care for the performance of Arme Hammer as Oliver. An actor I normally like, his character's age was supposed to be around 23 (which would only make a 6 year difference between the two characters), but Hammer is 31 and looks (and plays) mid-'30's, while the youthful looking Chalamet (who is 22) is playing a believable 17 year old. This difference in age (for me) took me out of this film. I would have liked to have seen this with someone who looks (plays) 10 years younger than Hammer. As it was, I kept getting a feeling of Oliver taking advantage (and not falling in love) with Elio, so didn't buy his exhortations of love.If you can get past that, the film is beautifully shot, but there just isn't enough story or variations of pace to make this one to recommend (besides the performances of Chalamet and Stuhlbarg).This film is nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor, Chalamet (deserved) and Best Picture (not deserved at all).Letter Grade: B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

Not gonna lie, when I started watching the movie It seemed a bit boring to me, but the more I watched the more I was glued to the screen. The dialogues were well thought out and felt natural, the interactions between characters looked realistic. Over the time I became more and more interested in Elio's life, sympathizing with him, being able to understand what he's feeling.Many people bring up pedophilia when talking about this movie, and all I want to say about that: it's bull. First of all, Elio is 17, which is above the age of consent. Secondly: The movie is not about that, it's not about emphasizing the age gap, it's about pure, unconditional love.What I also love is the fact that the word gay wasn't even used once throughout the movie. How I said before, It's not a movie about specific type of love, it's just about love... Well, to be honest, it's also about a heartbreak. Oliver's and Elio's summer fling ended up in flames. No matter how much they loved each other it all had to end. Oliver can't stay forever and eventually found someone else, leaving Elio shattered. The last scenes portrayed Elio's feelings perfectly. The action takes part in winter, portraying the emptiness and the death of what Oliver and Elio had. The moody blue lighting also helps to portray how upset Elio is over Oliver finding someone else. After the call with Oliver ends, you expect for Elio to throw a fit, scream, shout, but you get none of that. He just sits and cries while staring at a fireplace. And my boy Timothee acts throughout the credits. You know that the film has ended, but you just can't peel your eyes away from the screen and continue to look at Elio crying. And then bam, he looks directly into the camera. It was a breaking point for me, I started bawling my eyes out after that. This movie changed my outlook on life and love. I never felt the same after watching this film. I would watch this movie again and again and again.",

            "content": "Like Brokeback Mountain, this devastatingly sensuous romance features two people who meet and fall in love despite the risks of their relationship in a society that frowns upon such same-sex attraction. Elio and Oliver have a brief but powerful relationship that is still conflicted and messy. Oliver is not necessarily gay, but finds himself attracted to Elio anyway; Elio is trying to figure out what he wants and who he is.Elio's parents are well played by Amira Casar and Michael Stuhlbarg, who gives one of the most punch-to-the-gut monologues in recent years during the final moments of the film. Both suspect and even encourage the relationship of their son as he explores his way into adulthood. Casar's performance is particularly understated, all knowing glances and hidden messages. She knows a lot more than the other characters believe she does. Stuhlbarg deserved an Oscar nomination for his portrayal as Elio's father, but he was sadly overlooked. He is excellent throughout, but his final scene with Elio is so well acted and filled with love, I felt like a raw nerve had suddenly become exposed inside of me, and Stuhlbarg had just strummed it like a guitar.Armie Hammer gives a great performance as the brashy American who first upsets the apple (peach?) cart with his mannerisms and more aggressive personality. While physically he seems too old for the role (sparking some unnecessary controversy over the age gap between the two characters), he has a natural chemistry with Chalamet that is riveting. The two of them have to navigate a complex array of emotions with personality clashes and mockery slowly melting into attraction and love. But this is Timothee Chalamet's film, and the young actor gives one of the most authentic performances I've seen in years. There isn't a moment that suggests he's just acting. While Elio is hardly a flashy character, that makes what Chalamet pulls off even more astonishing. He is the heart of this film, and the final scene as he stares into a fire should not be missed. It is powerful, endearing, emotional, and every bit worth the Oscar nomination he received (and probably should have won in all honesty).This film is a heart-wrenching portrayal of new love, the difficulty of communication even in a multi-lingual world, all overshadowed with the inevitability of knowing it must come to an end. The best film I saw from 2017.",

Chalamet and Hammer portray a relationship that is one of the most real i've ever felt watching a movie and while the cinematography is quite different from other movies, it manages to create an extremely real atmosphere that often made me forget I was watching a movie.There are some pretty raunchy scenes, but they feel like a natural part of the movie and help develop the characters.The setting is also absolutely beautiful and is accompanied very well by the cinematography. I now want to live in 1980s Northern Italy.For me, the thing that really makes the movie is how raw it feels. Scenes that would often utilize background music to set the mood, instead gets carried by the amazing acting by Hammer and specifically Chalamet.Now without spoiling the ending, all I can say is that it has changed the way I think about love, and has helped me understand more about what love is to me. The movie will probably stay in the back of my head for a very long time, and for that I'm very grateful.(I apologize in advance for any errors in my writing, in my defense English isn't my main language.)",

Society if 1980s Italian countryside scenery in a gay movie wasn't basically claimed by this movie because it is such a wonderful setting and it would be a lot more wonderful if it was with a healthy relationship.

An intellectual, multiglot family chills out in the summer at some villa in beautiful Italy. Some grad student Oliver comes to \"work\".I could not see at all where this movie was going. Which meant, of course, that there was only one utterly predictable possibility - the 17-year-old son Elio was going to have some sort of love affair with the grad student.But this possibility made no sense to me. There was no chemistry/romance between the two of them and not the slightest hint that either was attracted to more than just members of the opposite sex.Then boom, midway in the movie, they suddenly start hooking up. You see it coming only because that's the only way the movie could possibly have gone (to have any hope of redemption), yet it was utterly unconvincing. They then spend the rest of the movie frolicking and having more unconvincing hook-ups.I will admit that Elio's performance was pretty good and thus worthy of a Oscar nomination (but certainly nowhere near as good as Gary Oldman's Churchill). But Oliver's performance was especially unconvincing and wooden. It was possible that Oliver was engaging in a manipulative, one-sided fling with a kid, but completely unbelievable that he was madly in love with Elio, as we were made to believe towards the end of the movie with the \"epic\" father spiel and the phone call.",

The dialogues between Elio and Oliver are lost in their snobbish and intellectual self-realization, the film seems to want to focus solely on this relationship as if its cultural baggage were the only object of desire among them. But not only is there the perfection that the film tries to show, the story takes place in an idyllic villa in northern Italy, a decoration that seems like a cover of Vogue magazine rather than a teenage love story.\nWith the exception of this, the film is wonderful, one of the best of the year and will remain in our retinas for many years.

A perfect match for the role. The acting overall is strong and there's no one who really disappoints. The only thing that keeps me from scoring this a 10 is that I would have liked to see more of the internal struggle when it comes to Elio's sexuality. At a certain point it goes quite fast, it would have been a welcome addition for him to talk to someone about his feelings. His parents are very open minded anyway so it would not have been a stretch for him to talk to his mother or father about his struggles. In general the connection between Elio and is parents is also one of the highlights of this film for me.",

            "content": "Call Me by Your Name stars Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg and Amira Casar, and is directed by Luca Guadagnino, who brought us 2015's A Bigger Splash, which is in many ways a bit uneven in terms of tone and pacing, but certainly not inadequate. He also directed I Am Love, which I haven't seen, but hear great things.\nSet in 1983, it tells the story of 17-year-old Italian-American-intellectual Elio, (Chalamet), whose family regularly visits their 17th century villa during the summer in Northern Italy for his father's (Stuhlbarg) archaeological research, involving the salvation of ancient sculpturing. Along comes mid- twenty-year-old grad student Oliver (Hammer), who comes to spend the summer to assist with Elio's father's research. Though Elio at first slightly despises Oliver's \"over-confidence\", the two grow closer and closer, and Elio's cultured, sophisticated, yet naive and hormonal nature coupled with Oliver's higher maturity and life experience creates some of the most emotionally charged and truly charming chemistry that I have seen on film in a long time.\nI think what makes Call Me by Your Name so special is that it's one of the most immersive movies ever put to cinema. Watching it feels authentically like you're on a holiday in the summer of Northern Italy in a way that trashier American romance films in which the central characters travel abroad on holidays cannot capture. \nThis is a movie that isn't afraid to just meander and lull about, and just generally chillax. It doesn't concern itself so much on plot, but more on atmosphere, environment and performance. By golly, it would be fundamentally unfair for both Timethee Chalamet and Armie Hammer to not both win best lead actor simultaneously for this one film, but alas, also impossible. I would also be surprised if Stuhlbarg doesn't get a nom here for supporting. But the lack of traditional storytelling beats, such as conflicts and turning points etc etc only work in the film's favour to further emphasise the sense of environment and love and passion, and the sense of it feeling so very much like real life, which unlike a screenplay, isn't all structured accordingly and specifically. Real life is messy and spontaneous and instinctive, just like this movie.\nThe immense level of confidence brought to the screen by Guadagnino in collaboration with his actors make this one of the most beautiful films of the year, maybe even of all time. This is also quite a long film, and in many ways it feels long and meandering, also a bit like real life, which is not a bad thing at all, and it works for what the film is going for.\nThis will draw a lot of comparison's with 2016's Moonlight, mainly due to it being an auteur piece of awards-caliber filmmaking that happens to be about being gay. However, I will say I think Moonlight has the slight edge, possibly due to it having distinct conflict within, but also because I found it connected with me on a slightly deeper more personal and relatable level, despite me being a straight dude. Other teensy flaws are that even though the movie feels wonderfully real, there is some dialogue which isn't as realistic as the film in which it's contained, where it doesn't quite feel like how people talk in real life, which is the complete opposite case with Moonlight.\nBut Call Me by Your Name is an absolute master work, there's still several 2017 Oscar contenders I'm yet to see, but right now it stands as my favourite film of the year, it's a film that you need to just sit back, relax, get comfortable and just go with it, become involved with it, let it literally wash over you, take it in, and it will hit anyone and everyone who's ever been through, or happens to be going through either hormonal stages or finding first love. On many occasions throughout, some quite early on, I was having to fight breaking down into fits of sobbing and heaving, and when the power of cinema can do that on a genuine level, it's two thumbs up and no less than a 9.5/10",

I understand that the age of consent in Italy is 14, but Elio looked like a child and Oliver looked much older than 24. This made it really hard for me to become invested in their relationship. The movie itself was too slow. It took so long for Elio and Oliver to get together I stopped caring whether they got together or not. They also had no chemistry. If you were to replace them with dolls, the story itself wouldn't change. I couldn't figure out when exactly Elio stopped hating Oliver and became attracted to him.The secondary characters were all flat and didn't do anything for the plot.

I didn't find any of the characters to truly develop - you could argue Oliver develops, but I think it's just him becoming comfortable and getting to know Elio. Elio I'm sure many would argue also develops, but I think his actions and words are reactions to what happens, and he is an insecure, uncertain young man looking for love throughout, and who he is doesn't change at all in my opinion. Frankly, very little happens in the movie - it's all just seeing the development of their relationship, which was generic and boring in them becoming familiar with each other and falling in love for no discernible reason. Hardly anything beyond their relationship was offered up to consider, with Elio's girlfriend being the only other relevant storyline. While she added to the film, it didn't fundamentally change the film and felt more like a minor detail to show Elio become more confident as a gay man as the film progressed - not dynamic, just a plot device. Contrary to many, I didn't find the performances of Chalamet or Hammer to be of note, and I thought the writing was very inconsistent, though the monologue by Stuhlbarg at the end was excellent. A satisfactory ending and good score and cinematography prevent it from being an outright bad movie, but it was nothing more than a boring, plodding romance to me.",

            "content": "While I can almost guarantee that CALL ME BY YOUR NAME will *not* win this year's Oscar as Best Picture (despite the well earned nomination), by my lights it is head and shoulders the most deserving of this year's nominees. Proceeding at a stately pace to best appreciate the subtlety of the story and beauty of the settings, this is not a film for the overly shallow or those unable to appreciate adult films in the Merchant/Ivory tradition, but for those emotionally prepared to meet it on its own terms there will not be a more satisfying revelatory exploration of a male coming of age and first love this year. The films greatest achievement may be that while, as many \"first love\" stories, it can be painful, it is grown up enough that (unlike a film that attempted to treat this territory a decade or to ago and forced to pander to the bigot audience that didn't realize its own bigotry) no one has to die. The \"object of desire\" is a wise, highly moral graduate assistant who (contrary to the few IMDb reviewers sniffling that the film ignores the potential ethical or moral problems of the seven year age difference of the protagonists) spends a considerable part of the film avoiding the deeper relationship his academic sponsor's eldest - and almost adult - child so obviously desires in large part for that very reason. This implied danger actually gives the film an impressive edge of tension. Setting the film in Europe is probably the film's (and book's) master stroke, freeing the parties from the stultifying 50's repression of too much of what is remembered by those of us who lived through it in the U.S. - the surface cultural homogenization that the current Administration in Washington imagines as a \"happy time\" to be returned to and which explains the melancholy coda to the film when the older student does have to return to it. Yes, the father's knowing, loving discussion with his son late in the film (which perfectly captures the relationships the luckiest among us HAD with our parents) is a high point that should be required viewing for every American or anyone who expects to be a parent - but the set up for that discussion is what makes CALL ME BY YOUR NAME a masterpiece of American cinema.",

It's not the plot that makes a movie great. From second one it was so tensive I couldn't wait to figure out where it was going and unlike most movies I didn't want to miss one second of what was happening on the screen. This movie makes you crawl into the mind and body of a knowitall, intelligent, slightly obnoxious, 17 year old boy, still dealing with puberty. Falling for the \"advances\" of a charming 20something man who is actually just as, if not more, conflicted about his feelings. It's a passionate love story two people who feel like they shouldn't be in love. It's absolutely heartfelt and stunning. I am definitely going to watch it again.",

I was going to see another movie, and the tickets were all sold out, and Call Me By Your Name was playing at the same time, so I went to it instead. After I finished watching it I wasn't sure what I thought to be honest. I do think that this movie could transcend gay or straight, and just relate first love, and what it's like. I found myself remembering my first love, and my \"second\" first love that came many years later after my first; both of which that didn't work out... It's one of the most painful things to think about in life I think, even now. First love... not like, but love... it makes you do things you never would see yourself doing (mine was flying 3,000 miles to find mine after we broke up to beg that we come back together. He was convinced he would go to Hell and lose his family if we were to marry since we were both guys... so I felt empathetic to some parts of this movie) The final seen of the movie at the fireplace made me remember all the \"fireplaces\" in my own life when you find out the one you loved more than anything has moved on, and you are figuratively still in the same place during winter, alone, sitting next to the fireplace crying, trying to remember even how to breath without it hurting. It made me uncomfortable to think about it. There have been times where I would rather die than feel those emotions, and this movie, somehow was a form of catharsis for that. Maybe because it showed someone else feeling as neurotic as I have when it came to my first loves. I found myself in a lot of the two main characters; and I disagree with a lot that has been said about the older character being manipulative. I don't think he was. I think he was a prisoner that was trapped between two worlds, and had probably just as much experience in that kind of situation as Elio did: just because your older, doesn't always mean you're wiser. It was a really heartbreaking movie, and the music was another character in the film that was necessary. The more I've thought about this film, the more it rings true, and the more I do like it. I am planning on going to see it again. I don't really cry at movies, and this one actually made me tear up at the end, and on the way home. I think the actors, especially Elio, really made me believe what they were doing, and it was skill beyond his years to perform. Oh yeah, and if he's single and interested, I'm totally interested!!! lol :)",

I guess it's open to intepretation what the movie is about. Seems to me that Elio is gay but doesn't know it, and Oliver is gay and can't accept it--or at least he can't when he's at home. So the two come together at an opportune time for a brief period and end up with broken hearts when they have to part.As a gay man, I find the criticism of the \"gay sex\" aspect amusing as this was about as mild as can be. Seriously, a gay guy having his first gay experience with a closeted gay guy finally able to taste the forbidden fruit should result in far more explosive sex. Another subtle thing that I didn't see mentioned anywhere. It was clear that this was a European film and not an American one. All the Europeans spoke like 50 languages and spent their time listening to, writing, or transposing music, or reciting poetry, or engaging in other cerebral activities. I get it: Americans are loud, unsophisiticated monoglots lol. I don't necessarily disagree, but the point was made, however subtly.I'm not one to cry at movies but the last few minutes put me to the test for sure. Again, this actor is amazing.Very good film, highly recommended. I look forward to seeing Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in other movies.",

The story's pace and the timing of any important revelations is perfect, the sensitive and effortless direction captures the beauty of Italian landscape and the mood and spirit of the '80s. A lot have changed still then regarding the treatment of LGBTQ issues, but given the location of the film is in Italy, I'm guessing the male machismmo is still very much pervasive there at this day and age. It almost feels like were watching a contest going on between Elio, Oliver or Mr. Perlman, Elio's father, as to who is the most miserable.Chalemet gave a very heart-breaking performance for a straight guy as a teenager trying to discover his sexuality with his father's research assistant in his mid-20s. Too effective and credible a performance that I believe he should not gain a reputation for brilliance entirely just because of this film. It's an acting talent that should not be wasted, more doors should open up for the audience to show off his acting chops.With Hammer, he exudes the melancholic aura that he desperately tries mask. Whatever it is that looms at the back of his head, it is best for the viewer to figure this on their own make theoir own opinion. It is this ambiguity that makes his performance an interesting one to watch as the story unfold.Mr. Stuhlbarg, on the other hand, is just an important character in the film and just as pivotal as the two male lovers because as the title suggest, he could have said that line himself to Elio or Oliver.. \nMy rating: A-minus",

With a continuation planned, it will be interesting how they will tell the end of the story, needing to develop things that are not in the book.

            "review_title": "Call me by your name - How not to live up to expectations (the Italian way)",
            "content": "When thinking about 1980's Italy, one thinks of things aplenty: Italo disco, timeless films (\"Non ci resta che piangere\", \"Vacanze in America\", \"Cinderella 80\" to mention a few), teen magazines (the cult Cio\u00e8) and much more. Of these three elements, \"Call me by your name\" only has the first, and this in very small quantities. For, director Luca Guadagnino had another vision with his film: he wanted to tell the story of a relationship not very much accepted in the society of the time, a homosexual one. He did achieve this, but not successfully. He rather managed not to live up to expectations, the Italian way.1983, northern Italy. An Italian-American teenager, Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) is on vacation with his parents (Michael Stuhlbag and Amira Casar). Everything is going well in his life: he flirts with his French, charming girlfriend, Mazia (Esther Garrel), his family is supportive, and no problems are in his way. All this changes when Oliver (Armie Hammer), a twenty-four year-old American, who has come to work as an assistant to Elio's father. At first, they only feel contempt and suspicion for each other. They seem to be so different, the one rich and privileged, the other lacking this wealth, Elio being just an immature child, Oliver a mature young adult. Still, their differences soon matter little to them, as they start to develop a romance like no other: for the first time, Elio learns what real love is, and Oliver seems to be the perfect teacher.Despite the promising premise of the film, and its equally captivating start, the story is not executed well. This is due to two factors: the extremely slow-paced direction and the weakness of the actors'performances. Guadagnino didn't serve the movie well, filling it with long shots that are truly antithetic to its topic, which is the definition of youthful enthusiasm and energy. Instead of really offering us the experience through the eyes of a teenager, he gave us a version of it through a pair of eyes as sleepy as can get. The young performers didn't deliver either. Chalamet, for all his young age and obvious passion, seemed too submissive and hypotonic for such a role, which requires constant intensity of character. Hammer, though charming and dominant on screen, did not have the energy one could expect from a romantic, young man in Oliver's situation. There generally seemed to be a certain lack of intensity in the film, with none of the actors showing their emotions, instead waiting until the last moment to do so. And of course, then everything has been lost.The film's title, \"Call me by your name\", indicates the honesty present in the heroes' romance. The name is one of the most important elements of a person's identity. By calling each other by the other's name, the heroes understand that they have nothing to hide from each other and treat each other as equal. This honestly, while coming off in the movie, was not made particularly felt, hidden under the uncertainty of the first romance and the lack of real contact the two lovers had until later in the film.What made up for the disappointment that was to watch the performances was the atmosphere. At this extent I have to congratulate Luca Guadagnino, since he took care of that to the last detail: from discotheques, to vintage fridges and televisions, to clothes representative of the time, everything was well-chosen and showed not only the love of the director for accuracy, but also his will to complement his story visually. The setting was a feast for the eyes to see, thanks to Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's admirable photography, with the help of which the amazing landscape of Italy came to life. Musically, the movie felt like a time machine to this time, with the Psychedelic Furs, Joe Esposito, and even forgotten one-hit wonder F. R. David offering (among others) the accompaniment to the film. Sufjan Stevens's original score, on the other hand, didn't make any impression to my eyes and thus deserves no special mention.The joie de vivre that the director wanted to communicate through his work does not come through because of all the factors mentioned above. For a film slow and emotionally reserved - this of course being an oxymoron - from start to end, one cannot expect from it to deliver this sense of freedom, this sense of love, carelessness and adventure, that is entailed in the term \"Joie de vivre\". For all the people experiencing \"joie de voir\" while watching \"Call me by your name\", I found none of this joy. The film was not satisfying. Only by saying that could I call it by its name.",

In any case, the mind-games and the loose, uncommitted sex this film shows is not a very good example of love- it's not what love should be- and it's not love at its best- so why all the love for this film as though it's the best?!First love/young love can be final- it doesn't have to be fleeting.And age-gap love doesn't have to be fleeting either and can last.Some of the most beautiful relationships ever in the world have been age-gap couples. It can work when both people within the couple want it to- but this isn't one of them.Not my style. I recommend the following instead:\n\"Losing Chase\" (1996),\n\"Ladies In Lavender\" (2004),\n\"Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing\" (1973)\n\"Moment By Moment\" (1978)\n\"The Story of O\" {1975)Watch them for truly tender, sensual, artful, and moving love stories.For music lovers though, the one positive thing I can say about this film is it has a very nice soundtrack.",

Just ordinary life and relationships, but bit off or weird. Similar in quality to Brokeback Mountain (2005) , in fact less emotional. I only liked bit emotions and environment which looks somehow so natural, real, authentic, like this is not movie but live camera or personal experience of someone. But the topic, the action, the relationships are neither interesting nor deep. I would usually find much more emotions, interest, insight by watching some action movie and heterosexual relationship. Looks like this is bit experimenting subjective movie, but definitely not interesting. Reminds me of personal affections, oddities, fetishes, associations...but barely. Bit nice Italian environment. Too boring and worst of all long time, so time waster.",

            "content": "This was one of the movies mentioned a lot during Awards Season, I remember it mainly for its slightly confusing title, but it did make sense once I actually watched it, from BAFTA nominated director Luca Guadagnino (A Bigger Splash). Basically set in the summer of 1983, 17-year-old Jewish American-Italian boy Elio Perlman (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) lives with mother Annella (Amira Casar) and father Mr. Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) in the countryside in northern Italy. His father, a professor of archaeology, invites 24-year-old Jewish American graduate student Oliver (The Lone Ranger's Golden Globe nominated Armie Hammer) to live with his family to help with his academic paperwork. Elio is an introspective bibliophile and musical prodigy, he finds little in common with Oliver's carefree and exuberant personality and resents him taking his bedroom for the duration of his stay. Elio spends a lot of the summer reading books and hanging out with his girlfriend Marzia (Esther Garrel), and to his annoyance, Oliver is attracted to one of the local girls. Elio and Oliver do eventually spend some time together, what starts as a good friendship slowly emerges into a seductive courtship, as they go on walks, swim together, and accompany Mr. Perlman on an archaeological trip. Although Elio has a sexual relationship with Marzia, he finds himself increasingly attracted to Oliver, he sneaks into his room one night to smell his clothing, and then thinks about him while masturbating. Elio subtly confesses his feelings to Oliver during a trip to the post office, but Oliver tells him he should not act on them, however later that day they share a kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further, the pair subsequently get distant over the next few days. Oliver responds to a note left by Elio, asking him to meet him at midnight, Elio spends the day with Marzia, all the while longing to see Oliver. Finally, at midnight, Elio approaches Oliver on the patio, they make love for the first time, over the next few days they grow closer, having sex frequently and keeping their relationship a secret, in bed Oliver says to Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine\". They become more intimate both physically and emotionally, on one occasion, Elio ejaculates into an apricot that he has split open, and when Oliver discovers it, he takes a bite of the fruit in front of a humiliated Elio, who begs him not to, Elio is completely smitten with Oliver and starts avoiding Marzia. Oliver's stay is coming to an end, he and Elio are overcome by uncertainty and longing, Elio's parents are aware of a bond between them, they suggest taking a trip to Bergamo together before Oliver has to return to America, they spend three romantic days together. Oliver boards a train to return to America, Elio is heartbroken, he encounters a sympathetic Marzia, who still wants to be his friend, Mr. Perlman sees how miserable his son is, he tells him he was aware of Elio's affair with Oliver. Mr. Perlman confesses to having gotten close to his own love affair with a friend in his youth, and urges Elio to find pleasure in the grief, he says true love like Elio and Oliver shared is rare. During Hanukkah, Elio receives a phone call from Oliver, he tells him that he is engaged to be married, and they call each other by their names a final time, after the phone call, a pained Elio sits by the fireplace, many emotions cross his face as the people in the background prepare a holiday dinner. Also starring Victoire Du Bois as Chiara, Vanda Capriolo as Mafalda and Antonio Rimoldi as Anchiese. Chalamet gives a terrific performance as the clever and talented virginal teenager, Hammer is equally good as the visiting and confidently attractive intern, their relationship is believable, it is a nice simple story of gay eroticism unfolding, it has a witty script, and the Italian scenery is beautiful, an enjoyable coming-of-age drama. It won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for James Ivory, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Original Song for \"Mystery of Love\", it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

Personally only bothered to watch this film because of the good reviews and the fact that it will probably be mention around awards season.Due to the fact that I'm not the best person when it comes to romantic films, this film sort of didn't work that much however I did find myself enjoying some elements quite a lot that surprised me. Straight of the bat, the directing and acting in the film is top class, even if you hated the film you have to expect that the people in front and behind the camera have done a great job. Having a great setting obviously helps because it would actually take a miracle to make the shots in the film look horrible or disgusting. The Story for the most part just goes straight over my head but again thats because I'm not into this sort of stuff usually, but I think that audiences that like this type of film will really appreciate this film. The character dynamics in the film are interesting from the two main leads to the family as a whole, there is a intriguing laid back atmosphere throughout. This can be a positive and a negative at the same time, this is because the film does drag quite a lot, it could just be me because I'm not that invested in the film that much. Saying that I was surprised with how much comedy there was in the film which actually worked for me!There are some character choices throughout the film that don't make much sense to me but again that just me be. Another that kept me.......i don't know.....erm thinking why.... was the change in languages that would happen throughout the film. One minute its Italian and then the next minute i swear its French, I could be wrong but to me it just made the location almost feel like a fantasy. I expect the fact that on the border of two countries there will probably be a language cross over, but to me I didn't work, if anything it was quite distracting. Either you stick to Italian or French why both??After all of this I'm surprised to say that the directing and the character moments throughout the film for me a really strong and quite good even though I'm having to drag myself through it at times. Give me another 10-12 years until I'm in my mid 30's and then I'll probably appreciate this film more. I still think its good but its not that memorable and I'll probably never watch it again, however I do understand people for loving this film and it deserves the awards mentions it gets. 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10 its good but not really my thing, each to your own!",

Elio escorts Oliver to a bedroom where Oliver falls asleep till the next day. Over time, a quietly sensual relationship blossoms between these two young men.Well, I'll never look at peaches the same way again. To be honest, there's a lot to love about this movie. Technically, the film's cinematography is magnificent. In terms of the narrative, it's universal in the depiction of young relationships finding love and sadly heartbreak. But there are extra layers, if anyone decides to revisit the film. For instance, to me, this story is about two individuals (one man is closeted and the other is questioning his sexuality) who find unity with each other in silence. Words don't need to be expressed by them about their longing and passion. Timothee Chalamet is astonishing and Michael Stuhlbarg gives one of the greatest monologues of 2017. All the performances are realistic (almost too realistic). While I think this film is great , there are some major caveats. This film is drenched in water symbolism. At one moment, Elio and Oliver assist in pulling out a dilapidated statue of Venus (or Aphrodite), the goddess of love, from a body of water and they begin to caress the statue signaling their emerging love. The film took me about 50 minutes to connect with the material because the story is subtle and slow. Elio and Oliver eat, stroll, swim, play volleyball, dance, flirt with women, pull a statue out of a body of water, and ride their bikes for long distances all before their romance starts. And I understand the romance has to blossom in some way, but the film makes me ask many confounding questions. For instance, when does Elio acknowledge an attraction to Oliver (or men in general)? Vise versa for Oliver? Where are the conversations about their longings, fears, past lovers, pleasures, etc? Ultimately, I asked myself, \"Does this film ring true?\" \"Call Me by Your Name\" does ring true, it's flawed and misses the mark sometimes, but the film creates an impressive examination of lust, first love, heartbreak, tolerance, and unity.",

I was quite curious to know as to what was so great about this film. After viewing the film I can say that it was quite a decent watch.Plot: Tells the relationship between Elio and his father's assistant, Oliver in 1983, Italy.Story and direction: To be very honest, I am not quite keen on films that deal with same sex romance. So the film came as a bit challenge for me. I was quite in doubts. But all got cleared after watching this film. I felt it was very beautiful and pure. It never felt adulterated. The characters instantly strike a connection with you. It feels that you are living with those characters. That's what I liked about this film. Kudos to Luca Guadagnino. Also it was great of Luca to use Italy as the location. It felt like no sets were used and all locations were real. So much detailing was done to make it look like the 80's. But still I felt some issues with the film. I felt the film stretched at times. Although the runtime is 132 minutes, I did feel the film would be perfect if kept under 2 hours. Most of that is due to the fact that the first hour of the film felt like it was wandering and had no such real motive.Performances: Timothee Chalamet was the star of the film. I could very easily get connected with his character. It was maybe the first time I liked Armie Hammer's performance. He delivered quite a performance. Michael Stuhlbarg was also good in what he was given. The rest of the cast offered good support to the film.Favorite Scene: It would be the one near to the end where Elio and his father have a talk. This scene summarized the whole film into one scene and also showed the love of a father towards his son.Verdict: I would say that this film is not everyone's cup of tea. I would like to see the film again as I think I would love the film more if I see it more number of times.But for now, I am going with an 8/10.",

A stylish romance set in beautiful countryside of Italy.The film captures the beauty very efficiently both from its actors and locations. It has some great music in it. But when it comes to setting up these pieces to make one story, it falls short. To be honest, I felt the chemistry between Elio and Oliver seems artificial. Timothee was trying too hard to make the audience believe in his character and Hammer seems to be not trying at all.The screenplay and the way the film is directed is totally weird and lame, it almost seems that the characters were doing stuffs just because someone told them to do those. None of the characters seems believable. For instance, the scenes involving Hammer and Chalamet seems to be uncomfortable to the point that you can almost imagine someone dictating them what to do from behind the camera. You can almost feel the artifice in their act. The film was filled with such poor and pretentious acting. The screenplay seems to be all over the place, things happening for no reason at all (just to remind, it got an Oscar for it's screenplay). The plot didn't seem to be moving anywhere until suddenly everyone's having sex with everyone.Everything was agonizingly boring already when finally the two characters say they like each other, the scene in the WWI monument somehow establishes that. Somehow at that point they started understanding each other so well that they didn't even needed words to express themselves. How did they reach there, who knows. The film had some great dialogues but the characters were just not written sincerely enough to make us live those dialogues. At the end, these were just great dialogues without any depth being uttered by some actor pretending to be someone else.The only thing which I liked are the songs. I was waiting for them to come. But finally when these songs gets kicked in, it was already too late to rescue the drowning ship. This film just don't deserve the hype it got before the awards season.P.S. - I gave one extra star for the \"Mystery of Love\".\nP.P.S. - Please someone give these two guys something to wear.",

The actors are also great and the viewer gets a sensation of ease from the combination created by the genuine atmosphere and natural acting throughout the movie.\nThe bad.- my main complaint relies in the plotline and character development. There are certain things I just don't buy. Just to clarify, this has nothing to do with the fact of the couple being homosexual, it could apply to any couple in general. As for the plotline I hated the fact that Elio and Oliver fell in love as I found abusive for a male adult to breach the trust of the Professor and getting into the pants of his underage son who is side by side to his bedroom. Surprisingly, the Professor is extremely comfortable and happy with this. Again, this could perfectly apply if Elio was a girl or viceversa, it just doesn't work.\nAs for the character development, I find it hardly credible for an academic philosopher seeking the meaning of life throughout his stay in the countryside, to be so extrovert and calm to the point of playing poker and speaking italian with locals, dancing to hit songs and getting immediately laid, being a perfect athlete, and all this while having time of concluding a complex philosophical investigation of Heraclitus (which is not sufficiently depicted in the movie) and getting the son of its Mentor (i.e. Elio) laid. Again, it just doesn't work.\nThe script was more focused on depicting and idilic homosexual couple rather than constructing a convincing plotline and thus feels like a desperate message rather than a credible story towards the road of acceptance of couple diversity.",

I say \"hate\" because there were so many \"problems\" with this film... I wasn't supposed to like it this much. No parents back in the 80's in Italy would have been ok with their guest having sex with their little 17yo boy. And as soon as the town had found out these two would have been tortured and killed. Also, there was no indication of their romance starting to develop. Like, none. Whatsoever. Elio, out of nowhere, starting expressing to Oliver his feelings. Who does that?? In the gay world, first you'll try to get a hint or a clue if that man could possibly be even remotely open to the idea of liking another guy. Elio just tells him \"oh yea, i feel the same way\" and poof - it's magic. Like, no. Hold up. It doesn't work like that!! You don't just confess your love to this gorgeous man and it just so happens that he actually feels the same. What??! Egh... this film is a complete fantasy yet it tries to be \"real\". Honestly, Armie Hammer is just too perfect of a human being. I mean, they both delivered oscar-worthy performances but Armie... Oh, Armie!! And despite the fact that both of them were so incredibly amazing I can't help but wonder - weren't there any gay actors who could have been cast in this film?? I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely having a full-on relationship with Armie Hammer in my fantasies but I just think that gay actors should be given a chance. It would have added to the \"realness\" of the film so much and the possibility that maybe - just maybe - this beautiful story could have actually been true... is that so much to ask for?? Because right now, we all know it's nothing more than just stellar acting performances and that's all it would ever be. I really shouldn't have liked this movie so much!! I should be giving it 5 stars.... but the way it makes me feel.... the memories it brings up... I too grew up in the 80's in eastern europe as a gay kid. And every summer when I'd go visit my grandma out in the country... Oh, how i can relate to this movie. Nothing like this ever happened to me. This film makes me want to turn back the hands of time and go back to that place and time - something I HAVE NEVER wished for!! That's why I hate it. It wasn't a good time. It wasn't a good place for a gay kid to grow up. It was terrible. Still is. This movie is such a fantasy fairytale - even with its terrible ending. I am so torn... I just hate how much I loved it.",

            "content": "Call Me by Your Name was a gorgeous film with an enjoyable but simple story. A coming of age story about a gay man who falls in love with an older student; this film is a slow burn. It has a relatively slow pace, but the film is still captivating with its beautiful shots and interesting characters. This film excels at character development. You can see both Chalamet's and Hammer's character change the way they feel about and act toward each other throughout the film. I also think that the acting was very good. Timothy Chalamet, Armie Hammer, and Micheal Stuhlbarg had great performances. All of them really displayed their character's emotions well. The last thing I really enjoyed was the cinematography. I thought the visuals were very beautiful, partially because of the amazing location choices and partially because of the lighting and camera work. Now the reason that I gave this film three and a half stars and not higher is because of the few things I did not enjoy. I thought the film had a hard time ending. It kept acting as if it was about to be over, and then an additional scene would start up. I enjoyed how the film concluded once it did, but before that I kept feeling restless. This film also did not make me feel as many emotions as other recent coming of age stories (e.g., Moonlight). I felt less connected to the characters even though I thought they were great. Overall, I enjoyed this film and can see why many people loved it, but I do not think it added anything new to the coming of age teen romance genre.",

That a son cannot get pregnant doesn't make it okay!That the father is okay with this (turns out he's a closet gay) goes a long way to explaining the current backlash against a PC liberalism in which apparently anything goes and ours is the failing if we cannot comprehend. I'm sorry, but a healthy society has standards to live up to and there are limits to tolerance, such as the good reasons why sex with parents, children, siblings, grandparents, and pets is a no-no, however much you may love them. Because loving someone means putting their interests before your own, not having sex with them!As a hetero I know how great sex is within a relationship of shared love. However, that does not make me homophobic, as I have a number of friends who happen to be gay, but I find it disturbing the way we are supposed to embrace homosexuality as the new norm - we mustn't let a sexual preference define us as people!What we should be embracing is LOVE, and that is something that has no gender basis whatsoever. But this film is not about love, it's about sex - which is frequently and grossly treated as a synonym, with the tragic consequences we see all around us. If it was about love, Oliver would not have phoned Helio at the end, on the eve of his wedding - he'd have had more consideration for the boy's feelings. The film merely reinforces the notion that gays and bisexuals are promiscuous and will take sex wherever and whenever they can get it.If we are going to have homosexuality constantly rammed down our throats by the media, let's see the couples that are faithful to one another and have stable relationships that are based on real love and deserve all the civil rights pertaining to any other stable civil relationship (leave religions out of this - they have their own rules, which should be respected as long as no harm is done). Those are the portrayals that are going to convince the antis to give homosexuals the same respect as they would anybody else, not the ones that portray homosexuals as sexual predators that heteros have to be wary of!I'm not sure where I found the 3 stars; maybe the nice location and photography, and perhaps the acting can be said to be ok, given the rubbish they had to deal with.",

This movie blew me away in so many ways, first I would like to mention the sound track which was amazing. Now let's talk about the screenplay, the script was written by James Ivory who also directed A room with a view, and he is 89 now and I hope to god that he wins best adapted screenplay. The dialogue was incredible, the way how he mixed English with Italian with French was just great and how it has those slight poetic speeches that made you feel. Luca Guadagnino directed this film he also directed I am love and A bigger splash and his directing in this movie blew me away. From those wide long shots of them talking from just simple shot of them just riding their bike around, he captured the beauty of Italy and showed the love these two men have. But the thing that stood out the most for me, the thing that blew me away the most was Timoth\u00e9e Chalament's performance. His performance was one of the best I've seen in a long time and his raw performance was incredible, he was so realistic, you could tell that he was struggling with his sexuality and his love for Oliver felt so real, but the seen that showed his true talent was the ending seen. Over all I cannot flaw this movie it was raw and intense especially with the love making and its movie like this that really set a landmark in cinema",

I'm not sure, but I didn't feel any sense of wanting things to work out for them. And the peach - really? Wasn't American Pie enough? I did enjoy the very loving relationship between the parents and their son, and how they supported their child as he figured out his own sexuality. I thought that was a very good message, and yes they were very European in their lifestyle and philosophies, despite being American. Still, I think it was one positive in the film. I was, ultimately, very confused by the whole thing though. I did not think it made much of a point, despite the topic and potential, it just fell flat. And the hero of the film seemed to be nothing more than an opportunistic brat, and I was left not caring about him or his happiness at all. Disappointing.",

            "content": "I must confess I didn't think I'd enjoy this, believing it would follow the same predictable path as most other gay-themed dramas. I was mistaken, and pleasantly surprised by the affectionate story-telling of 'Call me by your name'.So many love stories mistake lust for love (especially Hollywood romantic movies), but here it was romantic. The love story was realistic and believable, and it was truly romantic. I enjoyed the very likable characters, and the wonderful performances. The chemistry between Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer was so good, one could easily mistake them for a couple (both men are in fact straight in actual life, though).Everything about this film was so perfectly planned, and equally perfectly executed - thanks to fantastic direction by Luca Guadagnino (who is openly gay in real life). Armie Hammer stars graduate student, Oliver, who is invited by his Professor to stay with him and his family at their home \"somewhere in Northern Italy\" to help him with his paperwork. Oliver soon meets the Professor's son, Elio (Timothee Chalamet), and - off course - they become romantically involved in the most natural way portrayed on film in a very long time.'Call me by your name' has none of the boring cliches most gay dramas fall victim to. It was refreshing and really fun to watch. The film makers knew their intended target audience and made sure they showed plenty of flesh. They further ensured wide appeal by their characters: a twink (smooth and skinny), and a hunk (meaty with a hairy chest). This way they displayed the best of both worlds. (Oh, and Armie is a delicious looking specimen indeed!)Set in 1983, the film has a retro feel to it. Note the old television, the phones, and no mobile phones or modern technology. I loved this setting for the movie. This is a beautiful movie I thoroughly enjoyed.",

I was able to feel its weight, it was no easy task carrying it but I wanted to carry it even after it was all gone. But that is not true even now, many month from my viewing I still feel that feeling which I would rather not try to write down. I, once awakened from the deep slumber started to collect evidences that would support my argument for the greatness of this movie. I could not find for a while nothing but staggering and a feeling of such peculiarity that I couldn't, not even now explain or write down. So after all this time I cannot argue for why you should watch this movie, as I feel uncapable of giving an advice that would sum up or give a pre-feeling of this movie. I would not do that not only because of my simple uncapability but also I feel it would just take away from this film/feeling. So, my advice is to watch it and, even at risk of your own sanity and health pursue others to watch it and be a part of this feeling. I said the risk because of my, sad understanding of how the world and its \"most capable\" beings work. We, even in the era of second enlightment ( as i usually call it. It is not official) are just not able to think with our brains and still feel with our hearts. To know whats rights is as close to impossible as it gets but, I firmly believe that feeling a sense of rightness in a deed or word is always true and one should act accordingly. But I do not encourege, however the fact that one should just do whatever his appetite pleases. We also have a brain which is a beatifull but at the sam time simple machine that we could use to understand our feelings, which at first glance might look simple but we are never able to understand them. That is the reason we dont follow them. But all this is just a nice story, what im trying to say here is that please just because it shows two lovers from the same sex, please watch it. I know it is against all forms of rules you have known, if you are older than 30 but you have to see and accept that love is everywhere and one should not find logic behind it. So do watch it and try to persuade others into watching it as I feel it just didn't get enough popularity but that might as weel be a good thing. Well thats it, i am giving no rate, it would just ruin the whole thing because you expect something. And once more, for the last time PLEASE WATCH IT. Thank you!P.S. \nmost probably im thanking no one as this will not be read by any living soul, but it is no concern of mine. Im just here to write down my thoughts.",

I lost interest about halfway through the film, as I find gay relationships boring and not useful for my particular universe. However, the acting is very good, as is the direction, and the film is mildly amusing. A tourist, who is arrogant, ill-mannered, very smart and dances like Elaine Bennis, comes to vacation in beautiful Northern Italy. He meets a young gay Italian boy, who has not come out of the closet yet. And there you have it. This is why I got bored halfway through the film. The rest is just so predictable. When they break up (and they always do), there will be some type of profound message, which I have heard before dozens of times in both gay and straight films, so that part of the film was not necessary for me to see.

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name (2017) :\nBrief Review -Perhaps the most daring attempt of mismatched homosexual romance. I recall watching 'Portrait Of Lady On Fire' where Female romance (I believe LGBT or lesbian is a wrong word) came on screen in portrait and artistic mode and set the fire right where it was needed. Now, what that film does for Females, Call Me By Your Name does for Males (i know the latter came before). This coming-of-age-romantic attempts for gutsy and taboo-breaking subject where a teenage boy falls in love with the older man. This is where mismatched term comes and this is why it is a very daring film. The same age gap wasn't seen in any film made on same subject before hence this one is far ahead in breaking taboos which are still ahead of time by margin in cinema world. You see, the story takes place in 80s means the perspective to look at it has to be reversed 40 years back and then you realise it's terrifically path-breaking. Coming to the negatives of the film, see, i feel the writing needed some more detailing of characters and events. Some serious events happen just like that without any efforts and then the reactions for it are too cold to digest. Even the female characters of the film does not get any space to understand the issue and just pass it as if nothing happened. When you are trying to handle a taboo breaking concept you must look at nuances and take care of them which doesn't happen in case of Call Me By Your Name. However, the attempt is worth seeing for brilliant acting of Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, uncompromised storytelling and human friendly vision of director Luca Guadagnino. Less use of human emotions also hurts a bit while feeling the heart-touchingness and incompleteness of this film. Overall, a Great Attempt but not a Great Film.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

I dont know exactly how long it takes but it felt like half the movie had already gone by. And the first half is pretty boring. I didnt feel like much of anything was going on. Plus, I had a hard time connecting with the characters initially because they felt so pretentious. I mean who sits around and discusses the origins on the word \"Apricot\"? And speaking of apricots, the director seems to have a hard on for them. So many shots of the apricot tree, or them eating apricots or literally has sex with one. Why? Its too bad because there was the potential there for me to really like this movie. I bought into their love story and Timothee Chalamet in particular is fantastic in it. Theres so much range in emotion just in the last scene next to the fireplace alone. And there was beautiful heartfelt moment between father and son after Oliver leaves. It was very poignant. I wanted the movie to be more like that. But it wasn't. And for that I feel like I cant give this movie any higher than a 6.",

Most importantly, there simply isn't enough conflict to make the story interesting. Everyone is simply too nice and too reasonable; Michael Stuhlberg's climactic speech of reassurance not only goes on too long but sounds like it came from a textbook; it is Polonius for our time. The effort to create some tension in a young gay man's coming of age by setting the problem 35 years ago in the early 80s is ineffective, in large part because nobody seems to be aware that AIDS exists.

            "content": "\"Call Me By Your Name\" (2017 release from Italy; 132 min.) brings the story of Elio and Oliver. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is \"Summer of 1983\" and \"Somewhere in northern Italy\". We get to know 17 yr. old Elio and his parents, spending time at their summer home in Crema, Italy. Then Oliver, who is a research assistant to Elio's dad (a professor of archaeology) arrives to spend 6 weeks there. Elio shows Oliver around in the local town. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Italian director Luca Guadagnino, who just a few years ago brought us the excellent \"A Bigger Splash\" (and you can immediately pick up on certain structural similarities between these two films). Here, Guadagnino examines the restless and at times confused state of Elio who, for reasons never made clear, comes around to liking Oliver, a lot. Frankly, I struggled with that. Another thing: am I the only one who raises a question as to the age difference between Elio (whom we know is 17) and Oliver (his age is not disclosed, but I'm guessing, being a research assistant, probably mid-20s, if not older), a significant gap from a 17 yr. old's perspective. But there are plenty of other great things about this movie. First and foremost, having grown up in Belgium (with significant vacation time in the south of France), the movie captures the endless summers of my youth perfectly (I moved to the States in... 1983, the year this movie is set). The bike rides, the meals outside, the laying around in the grass, etc. etc., that is what summer time was like in the late 70s/early 80s. Second, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (as Elio) is nothing short of spectacular (on the heels of his smaller role in Lady Bird). While his name sounds French, he is in fact an American, but perfectly bilingual. Third, the production set and photography is pure eye-candy. Last and certainly not least, there is a fabulous soundtrack, with several new songs from Sufjan Stevens that capture the movie's mood just right. No surprise then that when the Oscar nominations were announced today, \"Call My By Your Name\" got 4 of them (Best Movie, Best Actor, Best Adopted Screenplay and Best original Song).The movie finally went wide this past weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Bottom line is that there are a number of great things about this movie, but I cannot give it a \"perfect\" 5 star rating for the reasons I mentioned. That should not stop you from checking out \"Call Me By Your Name\", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",

The viewer will quickly fit them together, but they do require patience as the movie will be considered slow-moving by contemporary standards.My recommendation is to make every effort to see this film; however, don't bother if you are homophobic or do not want to see female breasts on the movie screen.

Oliver (Arnie Hammer :The social network), an American student ,stays with the family for 6 weeks to study under tutelage of professor Perlman. Elio is drawn instantly towards Oliver's good looks and American ways of relating to others. Passion is beautifully captured between two humans. When it is time for Oliver to leave, Elio is filled with gloominess. Elio learns about life and life's opportunities from his dad. Oscar nomination for style and Oscar worthy acting by Timothee Chalamet. In some ways, the movie had some similarities to movies Beginners with Christopher Plummer and Breathe in with Felicity Jones. What makes Call me by your Name special is the quiet understanding of the situation by Elio's mom who sees the need for Elio and Oliver to spend some alone time. enjoyed the beautiful locations and Stylish Direction of sensual scenes. superb title.

            "content": "Call Me by Your Name (2017) is the latest in a string of LGBTQ+ films nominated for Best Picture. Each year, we seem to see one of these LGBTQ+ films nominated for the highest award, but this year there's a much more fundamental problem with it. Around the time the definition of marriage was changed by the U.S. Government, many opponents warned of a slippery slope that would lead to acceptance of lifestyles that are currently illegal. Call Me by Your Name is proof that we have proceeded down this slope.I understand that the themes of \"first love\" are what draw people to this film, and I'd be OK with that if the theme never entered sexual territory. As it is, this movie glamorizes sexual relations with a minor. This is statutory rape, which is illegal. Even if the parties involved were heterosexual, this would still be wrong. Unfortunately, I think it's the only reason why this film was nominated in the first place. As it is, the whole thing is quite dull and certainly kept going when it should have ended a few scenes prior to where it did.Furthermore, Call Me by Your Name just screams white privilege. Lazy summers spent in Italy having numerous sexual encounters with other white people just seems like something that even regular white people can't relate to. Despite all its flaws, Call Me by Your Name does two things correctly: the beautiful Italian setting and the music. Heck, I'm even willing to add a half-star to my rating because of the father's monologue at the end of the film. Lord knows I would never have watched this if it wasn't a Best Picture nominee, and now the Academy essentially endorsed the American Pie (1999) of art-house films.Hollywood's steady march down the slippery slope of sexuality, I give Call Me by Your Name 2.5 stars out of 5.",

It is one of those feel good and a little bit sad kinda movie.The story was meant to be purely realistic which is very nice but was delivered as a beautiful page on instagram about Italy...The direction was fine. The way the film was shot was nice but way too slow and a bit borring since most of the scenes are empty with nothing actually happening besides the discovery part...Acting wise. Armie Hammer was below average... Yes he has what it takes to be the leading male in the appearance department but unfortunately acting wise, he was trying way too hard to be the cool dude and pretend to be gay... Did not work. SorryTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet was alright. You can tell that his real self is very similar to Elio's (you can tell by watching any of his interviews). His poppy face helps him so much in being innocent. But that is not enough. Yes the last scene was interesting to watch since its a long shot (but there was a song playing in his ear when acting this scene... ) but it was a little too late because during the film, his performance was very slow and way too subtle but in a very boring way... Ok we got it that he was discovering and so but then what... Again I am not saying he was bad but an oscar nomination? Really?The father, the mother and the girlfriend were so fun to watch because even with their silence, they were heavily IN the film.I like luca guadagnino, but this film was not one of his best work at all.",

It has solid acting, but I have somewhat of a love/hate relationship with it in the way that the relationship is presented as opposed to the books. I understand why it was nominated (it won) for the Oscar for best writing adapted screenplay, but it has its faults in the way they handled the complexity of the relationship as it developed given the age difference. That being said all other aspects were solid. It's not about identity politics since a lot of people seem to think \"this is not a film for the gay community, it must be for jewish community\" but it's not intended to be a \"film for representation\" that usually comes of forced like in most blockbuster or commercial movies, it's just a coming of age film about sexuality, and people may find the concept of the house guest sleeping with the homeowners son and them just being okay with it \"unrealistic\", but not all societies are built like US and UK and they're obviously dealing with a completely different set of taboos.

This has that coming-of-age sense that \"Man In The Moon\" (the one with Reese Witherspoon). It's heartbreaking in terms of how life does move on even after devastating emotions (well, at that age anyway). And the beauty of simple life in Europe in the 1980's as a teen must've been this charming. Again, this is going to be trashed by Middle America, with good reason.

Timothee Chalamet gives an incredible breakout performance as Elio, a Jewish teenager questioning his sexuality after developing feelings for Oliver, played by Armie Hammer, a colleague of Elio's father staying over at the family's summer villa in 1983 Italy. I liked Armie Hammer and I thought that he gave a great performance as the (also) Jewish, twenty-something New Englander relenting to his infatuation and attraction to his colleague's seventeen year-old musical son.One cannot forget about Michael Stuhlbarg, Chalamet's onscreen professor father, who like Hammer, was snubbed of an Oscar nomination. Stuhlbarg's moving monologue about his unconditional love and acceptance for his bisexual son towards the end of the film had me in tears. A tear went down my right cheek twice as I watched his monologue. That is how moved I was. Maybe because I could relate to Elio and his budding feelings and sexual development is why that later scene between father and son hit me close to home.Chalamet's final scene, as the end credits roll, is heartbreaking, as he sits there by the fireplace at Chanukah-time, saddened after learning that Oliver, the love of his life, is now engaged to a woman. The film finally ends with Elio looking directly into the camera, in European film fashion, as he faces his parents with the woe that has now overcome him. The camera goes to black.The closing shot reminded me of Celia Johnson at the end of \"Brief Encounter\" (1945). The affair may be over but the memories will subsist (whether good or bad).Having read the book, I can say that \"Call Me by Your Name\" is one of those rare cases where I enjoyed the movie just as much as the book. They go hand-in-hand. They really do.The book and this movie will stay with me for years and years to come.",

Much of the usual clich\u00e9d plot lines in gay love stories are absent in this movie; there are no typical \"bullying\" or \"I'm confused\" subplots to cause distraction. The characters are multi dimensional and the story has some twists. I found the pace somewhat slow though.The only thing that concerns me with the movie is the age difference between the two characters, despite their maturity Although both actors are adults in real life, the age difference is a little disquieting though there is no suggestion of force, psychological or physical.

And I have a lot to say about it.First - and I'll get right to it - it did not live up to expectations. Unfortunately. My main issues are purely from an entertainment perspective; it's not a super slow film, but it's certainly not packed either. It's not a Hollywood drama, and while it shouldn't be and certainly doesn't try to be, it was slow at times. For personal taste, I could have done with a few more eventful scenes.Second, also regarding living up to expectations, I wasn't left feeling as devastated as many reviews had led me to believe I would. Without saying too much about the plot, that's related to my first point.Third, the hype about the acting and chemistry is real. Boy is it real! The two main actors are simply brilliant together. In fact all the actors delivered.And finally - and this is a big one as it's what led me to write this review - I experienced something I have never experienced before. When the credits started rolling, on top of a very long closeup scene of one of the main characters face, the movie theater was silent. DEAD SILENT! No one got up. No one spoke a word. Everyone was emotionally taken. We all stayed until the very end, not because of some overly dramatic event, but because of the pure realness of the entire film. GREAT job!Call Me By Your Name is beautifully shot and has great actors, and make no mistake, that's where the emotions comes from. Not from a dramatic plot. It's very much down to earth.

There is a constant sonic hue of flies, nature and organic suburban sounds that bring the scenes to life. It's deep greens and blues and long one take shots make it feel very organic.There is a visceral emotional intensity to the film that is distinct, relatable and complex. It gives you a lump in your throat. Hammer and Chamalet give an unflinching portrayal of complex, queer romance without hardly speaking on it. It is nothing short of masterful and a completely timeless work.",

            "review_title": "Ode to Gay Romance",
            "content": "GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Lyrical, sensual, and moving, the film is pure gay fantasy and it's beautifully acted and directed too. SYNOPSIS: In northern Italy, a teenage boy falls in love with an older man.JIM'S REVIEW: Oh, the fervor of first love. That unmistakable sexual need to be wanted by another person, to be caressed and kissed. The risk we take to be viewed as an object of desire, yearning for those glorious highs and that joyous awakening which begins our rite of passage, from innocent adolescent into the harsh realistic adult world. The journey is filled with unexpected pleasures, detours that can take one to the pinnacle of satisfaction and, in minutes, when false words are spoken or unexplained actions complicate the relationship, send us spiraling downward to the eventual low. We become the foolish spurned lover, shamed and laid barren, wondering if the mating dance was worth the whole experience. The answer is yes...better to have loved, as the saying goes...and in Luca Guadagnino's glorious ode to romance, Call Me by Your Name, we can observe those forgotten moments of ecstasy and anger with wistful thoughts and wry observation.The film chronicles the love affair between Elio, a gawky seventeen year old and his infatuation with an older man named Oliver, who is visiting Italy as a graduate student working with his father at their country villa. Set in 1980's Italy, we watch the tender give-and-take between the two and follow the seduction as it slowly unfolds. Neither can truly acknowledge their inner emotions, nor explain the palpable attraction in their hearts and minds. But theie feelings are quite tangible and the director captures that sense of awe and wonder. Mr. Guadagnino's vision is pure romance and he uses his lyrical imagery to build the tension between the two lovers.Call Me by Your Name is not remotely real. The film is strictly a gay fantasy, which takes place in a utopia free of homophobia. In reality, this public attitude rarely existed in the eighties, nor does it exist today. In fact, James Ivory's screenplay, while articulate and persuasive, avoids any semblance of the mere notion of sexual prejudice and intolerance. Any moviegoer has to disregard that lack-of-realism factor if they are to truly appreciate this lovely coming-of-age drama. The director's decision to play up the romantic intimacy and downplay the nudity and sex scenes allows the moviegoer to view this courtship in unrealistic terms while avoiding of the underlying corruption of a minor issue (at least, as viewed in American terms)...But can one justify this prevalent attitude as more free-thinking Europe in the 80's? (The AIDS epidemic was a real influence and is never mentioned in the scenario and Elio's parents seem hellbent on their liberal-mindedness in terms of their son's adolescent freedom and happiness, a stance that seemed odd to this reviewer.)The homoerotic moments are sensually charged and filmed on a grand scale by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom with his gorgeous lush panoramas and beautiful period details by Samuel Deshors reinforce the romantic tale. We are swept away and taken along, rarely questioning the sexual predator role or the corruption of a minor angle. It never enters our mind. It's pure impure romance. We somehow justify the indecency of the boy-man relationship and ignore our Puritan judgment. After all, love is love is love.Director Luca Guadagnino certainly cast his film perfectly, creating the most swoon-worthy pairing with his two lead actors, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer. Their chemistry together delivers the tension and pathos of first love. (Surprisingly, with all the sexual accusations and #MeToo Movement afoot, there has not been any backlash against the man / boy theme of this film. There is some questionable intent and power games on display. Granted, the casting of Mr. Hammer as the predator seems to make the seduction and conquest more credible, but imagine another less attractive actor in this pivotal role and the subject matter would have been less accepting and reaction more judgmental.) Of course, it also helps that the two actors project that necessary allure to make the whole love story believable. And they are sensational in their roles.Mr. Chalamet plays the intense young Elio and it is an astonishing performance. The young actor displays the gamut of emotions and shows the vulnerability and confusion of a young boy trying to come to terms with his own sexual identity during homophobic times. As Oliver, portrayed by Mr. Hammer, the actor uses his masculinity as a potent fixture. He allows his character to be enigmatic in his words and deliberate in his actions. Wearing his tight-fitting pastel outfits and the shortest of shorts make a strong case for the attraction and the actor takes the risk in a difficult role and makes the character kind and, at times, slightly cruel.There are also two classic moments in this film that will be long remembered. One involves a masturbation scene that is quite sensual and handled with the utmost \"taste\". The other is given to Michael Stuhlbarg as Elio's father, Mr. Perlman. He delivers a beautifully-written monologue by Mr. Ivory that sums up the film's theme. This talented actor almost steals the entire film with his emotionally-shaded soliloquy of the road not taken. He deserves award recognition for his fine interpretation of those finely-honed words. (Special mention also to Amira Casar as Annella Perlman, whose wry performance as Elio's mother says more in her subtle glances than in mere words. Esther Garrel adds fine support as Elio's girlfriend too.)Call Me By Your Name speaks so eloquently of the love that dare not speak its name. Mr. Guadagnino has crafted a lovely romanticized view of the thrill of love and has created a classic bit of gay cinema that will be embraced for decades to come.",

            "content": "Yes, this isn't a bad film. But what bothered me about it is simply that it felt ten years out of date, at least.\nBy that I mean that it was everybody's feel good gay movie, because it hit (almost) all the right buttons from top to bottom. It would have been far more daring and needed if it had been made BEFORE everyone was already on board.\nI think the best way to explain what I mean is to compare it to another \"gay\" film from the same year - the one that didn't get voted for an Oscar, didn't pretend it was being politically correct (but actually was moreso) - the one which - as a gay man - I felt to be far far better in just about ever way: God's Own Country.\nInstead of upper middle class people, in beautiful homes with top-notch educations and basically totally spoiled lives (an Italian villa for god''s sake!) - God's Own Country takes place in the scrubby, poor, downtrodden wasteland of northern England, with characters who are almost already complete losers on the social level: sheep farmers and a Romanian refugee. No pretty scenes of luxury, no real hope for a great life, and almost nothing that anyone watching this film can normally aspire to.\nSo what makes it a better film.?\nReality.\nThe film is light-years ahead of Call Me By Your Name, not only because of the crude sex and total frontal nudity, but specifically because it isn't even concerned with gay issues. The protagonists are gay - but that isn't the point. It is really about learning to let your guard down with another person, and the fact that they are gay is simply a fact, not the central part of the problem. In other words, it isn't about people trying to get to the sweet spot concerning gay issues - they are already there because they are more concerned with being simply human. How much more advanced can you get than to take the gayness for granted with no preaching nor feel-good moments between parent and child? (In this film, (SPOILER) it is a parent who, without a single comment on the relationship, makes the possibility of it working happen by simply giving her son an address which she didn't need to give, and which he didn't even know she had. Her caring for her child's welfare has nothing to do with HER feelings, but about what she recognizes as needed by her kid. And the true beauty of this film is that a good half of it is played with silences, letting the physical - be it a touch or a glance - do most of the exposition for us. That internalized tension makes it a much more difficult and perfect acting job as well.\nSO - there you have it: Call Me By Your Name isn't a bad film, but everyone who liked it almost certainly never even heard of the other one, as CMBYN had all the money and media hype behind it. But when I have talked to other gay men - especially those who are not 22 year olds on the circuit in big cities - it is not CMBYN which is considered to be the true Oscar material. Go see for yourselves and compare. I think you might agree.",

Boy, was I proven wrong! After they had their first kiss, any issues I had with the age difference just evaporated, and I found myself being blown away by how amazing their chemistry was! I ended up rooting for them, and ate up every tender scene they had for the rest of the film. \nWhile the love scenes with Elio's girlfriend were a bit more explicit (despite Elio eyeing his watch during the second time), it was his liaison with Oliver later that night that bled with sexual tension, desire and sensuality. I kept myself from grinning during this, afraid that my mom might turn to me and see a smile on my face. I simply declared in my head, 'They're in love!!'\nEvery time they locked lips, you saw and felt the intensity and hunger in them. We have to owe the director, Luca Guadagnino, for that.\nAnd even though I'd already figured out how it would end, it was still sad to see the heartbreak the characters endured. Not just Elio, but also his girlfriend, Marzia.\nI know Guadagnino is planning on a sequel, and I don't quite have high hopes for it. I think the movie ended just fine, the way it needed to; a sequel would be, not only unnecessary, but break away from the novel it was adapted from.",

            "review_title": "Call Me by Oscar and I'll Call You by Winner",
            "content": "Not to single out this particular premise, but films revolving around gay couples have been terrific over the last decade or so. There was a spark when 2005's Brokeback Mountain was released, which eventually brought us to foreign films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour being nominated for a Golden Globe or Moonlight winning best picture at the Oscars. Call Me by Your Name is the latest film to probably receive many nominations in the coming months, and believe me, the praise is not false. Being a fan of 2015's A Bigger Splash, I was looking forward to Luca Guadagnino's follow-up feature film, and I believe this to be an improvement in the best ways. Exploring the hardships of life and what it means to just kick back and relax every now and then, Call Me by Your Name is a film that's been sticking with me since my viewing of it. While it admittedly won't be able to draw in everyone to the theatres, here is why I believe this to be a fantastic, award-worthy picture. Written by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, Call Me by Your Name follows a family that lets Oliver, an older graduate student, live in their home for the summer. While this is a common thing, what's not too common is that Elio, their son, will eventually grow romantic feelings toward this man, convincing him to become his lover for the summer. From the age gap between them and having to hide it from the family, their situation isn't an easy one, nor will it be for some audience members, but it really is a wonderful story. This is easily a story that could've stirred up controversy if it hadn't been done with taste, and because of how it was made, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This was made entirely possible by the incredibly devoted performances by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer. Hammer has had his ups and downs through the years, appearing in Oscar-winning films as well as some of the worst films of the year, so his performance here was the most shocking to me. Yes, he's been talent in nearly everything he's been in, but he really gave his all in this performance and I honestly don't think he'll ever be better than he was in Call Me by Your Name. On the other hand, young Chalamet has a very bright future ahead of him. Being a relatively new actor, his chemistry with Hammer was impeccably astounding. Their relationship took a while to grow on me, but once it completely won me over, I found myself wondering if there was anything to really complain about. If I had to complain about anything, it would be in its extreme pressure to try your patience. There are very long sequences of silence, making you relax and take in either a romantic moment or the scenery around them, which I also found poetic at the same time, so I actually have trouble coming up with issues, but I have to admit that I did find the movie slow at times. Yes, it's meant to be slow, which is why that complaint isn't exactly valid, but I just have to be honest. In the end, this is a truly remarkable piece of dramatic filmmaking and there are some very memorable scenes that keep replaying themselves in my head. One scene in particular that involves Elio and his father Mr. Perlman (played magnificently by Michael Stuhlbarg) toward the end had me in tears. From the brilliantly written screenplay, to the poetic cinematography, to the terrifically calm direction, Call Me by Your Name isn't a movie that I would send the average moviegoer out to see, but if you're a hardcore film fan, I think you'll end up loving this movie.",

I'd seen him before but he blew me away with his beautiful performance of Elio. Armie Hammer was perfect as Oliver...\nIt also helps that my girlfriend and I watched it while on vacation in Italy for the summer... adds to the magic...Official score 10/10\nPersonal score 20/10",

            "content": "I just now watched \"Call Me By Your Name\" after renting it on iTunes, meaning that I was going into the movie with very high expectations due to its acclaim and all the hardware that it received. However, I can happily say that I finished the movie with the feeling that it had absolutely exceeded my expectations, and there are VERY few movies that have done this. I would not even know where to start but I guess James & Luca deserve all the praise for bringing this movie to fruition. Luca's directing made the movie feel very realistic, very authentic yet very cinematic and emotionally draining. I have never seen a love story depicted with such depth and to such perfection like in this movie. No stereotypes, no melodramatic moments, just a movie about pure love. And coming from someone who is gay, I watched this movie not even thinking about that we were seeing two MEN falling in love, and that is because it absolutely didn't matter. That is what makes this movie very special. \nNow to the thing that wowed me more than anything else - Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet! The best performance of any actor in the last few years. Subtle acting is a very difficult task and very few people do it right, but he was above and beyond. The final scene in particular is a masterful, so many emotions expressed with his eyes and his lips. He and Armie Hammer had so much chemistry that you would definitely think they were a couple in real life, haha. And then there is the brilliant Michael Stuhlbarg, that final speech is just pure gold. I don't think there is anything else I need to say about that.After watching the movie, I felt empty and sad, and that's because it was so beautiful. It was so good that I actually watched it a second time, and that just one hour after I had finished it for the first time. Please do me one favor, and watch this independent movie. The absolute definition of a masterpiece! Bravo!",

            "review_title": "A Documentary on Falling in Love",
            "content": "\"Call Me By Your Name\" is a documentary record of two beautiful, privileged young people falling in love during an idyllic summer in a seventeenth-century villa in out-of-the-way Crema, Italy. There are lots of slow, quiet scenes of eyes peeking above a book, furtive attempts to make fingers touch flesh, kids playing volleyball, riding bikes and swimming, and an old man showing up with a freshly caught fish for dinner. Burgeoning nature is omnipresent. The fish, though caught, is still alive. The air is full of the sounds of birdsong, songs that will be evocative to anyone who has spent a summer in Europe when young. The grass is lush. The water is clear and blue green. Clouds are puffy. Everyone, from the young to the old, is half naked. The men are bare chested much of the time. Days stretch forever and the highlight of a day might be pondering the meaning of a quote from a knight in a medieval poem. I did start becoming a bit bored, but at the end of the movie I felt pressure in my chest, churning in my gut, and moisture in my eyes, and I was rethinking my own lost youth. Give this film the time and patience it demands. It will sneak up on you. One of the two young, beautiful, privileged people who fall in love is Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), a 17-year-old virgin, and the cosmopolitan and multilingual son of Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his beautiful wife. The other half of the couple is Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old American graduate student who is rooming at the Perlman's villa. When Oliver first arrives, he is arrogant and pedantic yet casual and Elio is snotty - Oliver is taking over his room for the summer. He, Elio, must sleep in a smaller, adjacent storage room. Elio is put off by Oliver's arrogance, and he continues to pursue his attempt to seduce a local, Mariza (Esther Garrel). Eventually Elio and Mariza do have sex. Almost imperceptively, attraction builds between Elio and Oliver. Finally, one day, during a bike ride, Elio kisses Oliver. Oliver says, no, we shouldn't do this. Later, though, Oliver and Elio kiss and more. Read further only if you want to know how the movie ends. Oliver and Elio become lovers. Before Oliver returns to America, they take a hike in the Alps. Oliver boards a train and Elio returns to Crema. There his father tells him that he is very lucky, and that few experience the kind of bond he has experienced with Oliver. The father also appears to come out to Elio, announcing either that he is gay or that he is unhappily married. \"Does mom know?\" Elio asks. No, dad replies. Later, the villa is surrounded by snow. The Perlman family has returned to celebrate Chanukah. The phone rings. It is Oliver. He announces that he is engaged to be married. \"I remember everything,\" he tells Elio. Elio goes and sits in front of the fire, his eyes brimming with tears, a fly crawling around on his shirt. Both Elio and Oliver lead on girls whose feelings they could never reciprocate. The girls are tossed aside by the movie just as Elio and Oliver toss them aside in real life. After Elio has sex with Mariza, he shouts, \"That felt so good.\" \"That.\" She's a thing. Later, on the same mattress he used when having sex with Mariza, he has sex with a peach. A peach, a woman, both things to be tossed aside. Even Elio's mother, who is given very little to do in the movie, is made to be cluelessly living a lie.More importantly, I resented the film trying to force me, in the father's speech scene and in the final seven minutes of Elio staring at the fire and crying while a fly crawled around on his shirt, to believe that the movie was about something other than what it was really about. I just don't believe, based on what I saw, that Elio and Oliver are a love affair for the ages. These are two gorgeous, horny young men in an idyllic setting, privileged enough that getting up and going to work every day is not an issue. Rather, they get up and loll in the grass while thinking erotic thoughts. Nice work if you can get it. If these two had truly loved each other, they would not have tossed each other aside at the end of the summer. With the fly on Elio's shirt, and an infected cut Oliver sustained while bike riding, the film seems to be telling us that decay is the enemy of love. Some people love each other even as they age, sicken, and even after they die. *That's* love for the ages. Some object to this film because it depicts a homosexual relationship. There's no talking to such people. Others object because Elio is 17 and Oliver is 24. The actors were 21 and 30 when the film was made. But Chalamet looks about 16 in the movie. He is very thin and pale with no chest hair. Armie Hammer is 6'5\" with the body of an Aryan god. In their scenes, Hammer does look very much the older man. We know, though, that some of the folks who object to this relationship were entirely supportive of Judge Roy Moore, when he was a district attorney in his 30s, abusing young teen girls in powerless positions.",

            "content": "It took me two sittings on different transatlantic flights to get through Luca Guadagnino's much vaunted coming of age film. And I accept that this piecemeal approach might not have enhanced my opinion of the movie. Because I'm going to upset some of you who claimed it to be your \"film of the year\" last year. While I enjoyed it, it certainly didn't grab me like that.What I will admit is that the film is gloriously sun-drenched and atmospheric, set as it is in the countryside around Crema in northern Italy. Shut your eyes and you can almost smell the olive trees and the bolognese simmering on the stove.The story, set in 1983, concerns the 17 year-old musical prodigy Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \"Lady Bird\", \"Interstellar\") who, with his good looks, has the opportunity to seduce his fair share of Italian babes, specifically the gorgeous Marzia (Esther Garrel) who has the hots for him. Although not one to look a gift vagina in the mouth, Elio is sexually conflicted and finds himself increasingly drawn, romantically, to the dashing and cock-sure 24-year old American visitor Oliver (Armie Hammer, \"Free Fire\", \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\"): a feeling that is, initially, reluctantly returned.The Oscar-winning screenplay by James Ivory (he of Merchant and Ivory production fame) is rich and deep with lines that roll off the actors' tongues like syrup. The action also includes the most inappropriate use of foodstuffs since \"American Pie\" (and presumably that went in the bin afterwards!).The drama is slow and drawn-out, so action-film fans will be asleep within the first 30 minutes. That wasn't a problem for me.... it is a film in which you can really soak up the atmosphere. And it exquisitely explores the genuine pain of first love.But what I'm afraid I really couldn't relate to was Elio's action about half-way through the film. In the main, he acts as a typically introspective and sensitive teenager, slightly awkward and bashful in approaching sexual matters. But then in a pivotal scene he makes a daring move which - to me - seemed completely out of character. This rather threw me, and I never really got my equilibrium back with the movie after that.It's no doubt a finely crafted film. The sex scenes are beautifully shot and could never be accused of veering towards the pornographic. But I'm honestly not sure it's a film that gripped me enough to seek it out to watch again in the future. (Sorry CMBYN lovers!)",

Part romance, part coming-of-age, the movie presents an astute view of a romantic relationship between two men. A melancholic and introspective movie due partly due to Elio's character, it feels a film that is part of the romantic movies that presents a more progressive view of characters and reality.This makes the journey between the characters the main development in the movies as the plot of the film is relatively simple. I felt that the movie was interestingly avant garde in a few ways it was shot. Cinematography, landscapes and some camera effects creates an innovative depiction in the film. Music score is wonderful; matches the mood perfectly. Character performances are powerful.While the movie is definitely well made, certain flaws I felt were in the story and motivations. Oliver seems too much of an impecable character which might be because the performance of Hammer is done too well. It's strange but he felt unrealistic in this regard. Plot points were forseeable. The earlier interactions between Oliver and Elio did not suggest much tension (Which might just be because I'm as equally unaware as Elio).Even though I'm nitpicking, the movie was great but other movies have done a better service to the plot before. Yet, this might just be because the relationship didn't feel as believeable to me.",

Doesn't matter if you're a woman or a man, if you're straight or gay, if you live in Italy or not, if you're 17 or 47, you just get the feeling!Only defeat is that it feels like there's a big age gap between the characters, even though there's actually not so much, and makes it kind of unrealistic (although love has no age apparently).",

In the book, Elio does not cry when Oliver leaves, there is no big drama and we all knew it was coming. Oliver was a visitor, only. Visitors leave. That left the book without a powerful ending. The film changes that and adds this expected element so that the audience can have a proper ending. The book also drags on giving pointless views into the future, which the film wisely drops. Although greatly reduced in the film, the \"I'm jewish too,\" scene and totally pointless jewish discussion in the book is unfortunately not removed from the film and comes across as it does in the book, leaving viewers scratching their heads as to why it was mentioned at all, as the jewishness of the characters adds absolutely nothing the story. The necklace could have been any necklace, and is not even part of the book.like the book, there is a flat quality in the film which can be seen as either good or bad: we have an unexceptional story about a commonplace thing - two people experiencing an inexplicable attraction to one another - which simply exists as it does in life, not for any reason or rhyme, but nonetheless being totally overpowering to the couple involved. It's just life and love. And pain, and it's beautiful if you feel it and perhaps boring if you don't.",

Many can see this movie and believe it's merely a romance film but it has a lot more to it.Taking place in summer of 1983 in northern Italy, we follow a seventeen year old boy named Elio (Timoth\u00e8e Chalamet) as he falls in love with his father's research assistant named Oliver (Armie Hammer). Together they imbark on a loving relationship that lasts until Oliver goes back to his home, leaving Elio heart broken.Along the beautiful story among the two characters, we also get a beautiful soundtrack that follows us throughout the movie, every scene with a different piece of music composed especially for the film.Timoth\u00e8e Chalamet is a great actor, kind of a surprise he hasn't won an academy award yet. Not only for this role but in general. There shouldn't be a justified reason for now.Armie Hammer is wonderful and really captivating as Oliver, both his \"dance\" skills and compassion towards Elio make him a generally good character.The cinematography is astonishing, not only the sites shot during the film but it is all filmed so well.

It's not long before Chalamet's Elio realizes his feelings for the college student, and not much longer before he realizes the feeling is mutual.While the plot is supposed to make for some form of scandal or controversy, 'Name' is more boring than anything. While the scenery is beautiful, as is the constant Italian that is spoken among the cast, and the music that weaves the scenes together (including some pretty impressive piano playing), there are plenty of shortcomings here. For one, the acting is stale. While Chalamet has a few scenes that are hard-hitting (the fireplace scene during the credits comes to mind), the dialogue between the two leads is not well written by any means. As for the long, droning soliloquy by Elio's father, Mr. Perlman, at the conclusion of the film - while the content is powerful and has a good message, the way it's written and delivered makes it more awkward than anything else.There are also too many instances where we're reminded that the producers did everything they could try to make it feel like the 80s...to the point where they tried too hard and it instead feels like a cheap, formulaic blast-from-the-past romantic foreign film.'Call Me By Your Name' made a lot of noise during its run, and clearly has found itself fans.

You lack the ability to perceive the amazing qualities of this movie. Ok?If you are gay or have any kind of decent ability to empathize with the notion of love between any 2 people regardless of gender, race, age, etc., this movie is simply the most brilliant gay themed movie ever. It is brilliant on so many levels. Rarely does a movie inspire me to read the book that it was adapted from.

Most of the dialogues in the movie don't make any sense. Especially throughout the first 75% of the movie, there is just one weird unintelligible dialogue after another. Nothing hits the spot. I bet many people appreciate this movie for the fine Italian scenery, but that it really the only good thing about this movie, and I can go to Italy for that.The storyline itself also doesn't make any sense. The movie seems a loose collection of scenes, and perhaps if you've read the book it all makes more sense, but without reading the book, it's quite hard to understand what the hell kind of random thing is going on now.The worst thing is the end where the father appears to say that he is also a closeted gay guy. I mean... he's having a conversation with his gay son about his first love, and there he goes and he reveals he's been gay all along as well? His son is crying and he just goes and says like \"I know what you're going through, I'm married to your mother and all, but I'm also gay! Surprise!\" Well hello. Just absolutely ridiculous this movie. I appreciated it more for its ridiculousness than for anything els.",

            "content": "A film that knows how to deal with love, loss, encounters and solitude, in a light way, without being forced, with a very good direction, great performances but an excess of contemplation that ends up weighing in the rhythm of the long. The main highlight of the script is not the story itself, quite the contrary, the film's plot is even common, a couple who falls in love in the summer, the film's main highlight is present in the character construction, especially in the character of Elio , his sexuality is practically constructed from scratch, just like his experiences, challenges and discoveries, and unlike most of the films that expose this subject always forcing an extreme sexualization, here we do not see here the awakening of desire until the final act, in a very playful and beautiful way, and his romantic pair, Oliver, is also a very well worked character, even if the same is not built from scratch, we still have the negation and the discovery around Oliver always. A good part of the film is that it does not force itself to touch on social issues, or discuss this or that, the film simply is what it is, and it brings an incredible naturalness and beauty to the work. With a soundtrack ruled by classical music, we have many symphonies already known by moviegoers, and even sometimes getting strange in some moments of the film, in the general context it is beautiful, especially when some tone is used acutely in a certain scene, scaring the viewer and character, it's as if the movie sometimes screams, \"Hey, do not sleep, look at me,\" and the film needs it, especially because of its slow pace, which seeks an exploration of the Italian landscapes, after half an hour nausea, the film could easily take about 20 minutes less. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer are great, the two actors have incredible chemistry, and a sexual tension that permeates both from beginning to end, both actors make a brilliant performance. A film that knows how to talk about discovery, a film that builds characters and then breaks them, as it happens in our lives, construction, victory and failure, a personification of our day day in a playful but visceral, passionate and grotesque, passionate and devastating way , although the film still has problems of rhythm and sound, is still a great film.",

At first, Oliver seems to like Elio, but he maintain distance between them, The cultural context and etymologies dialogues are vast to fill the story. Elio plays guitar and piano, read a lot of books that lures Oliver to him, until his friendship became more physical. Oliver pushes him away in order to avoid a shame becuase of their actions. Elio refuges himself in Marzia when Oliver is not around in order to fullfill his sexual desires, but not his heart.\nThere is a great italian landscapes and nature, contrasting with some nudity and homoerotic scenes that is magnificent created without embarrasing the audience because it seems innocent and spontaneous.\nOliver explores his early sexual awakenning with some fetishes like sniffing Oliver\u00b4s shorts and masturbating with a peach, arousing by Oliver.\n The acting is perfect and the direction is very accurate in every moment. If this story would developed in a city, probably the movie failed. \nSadly, most of the gay cinema end their stories with death and silence (Mulholand Drive), loneliness (BrokeBack Mountain) and this is no exception. Elio ends sad and without the man he loves.\nOliver and Elio transmits real human passion and maybe touch your soul very rarely in afilm.\nI highly recomend this film, a new gem.",

Screenplay, directing, cinematography, music, and of course the acting by an ensemble cast that is all hands on deck, with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet & Armie Hammer leading the way. I came to this film through the book first (audiobook; read by Armie Hammer). Books of course are a different media than film, so knowing this you understand it's not going to be an apple to apple comparison. The adaptation to film however was beautiful done and satisfying. At its core this movie is about first love, and how as a young adult experiencing this un-explainable emotion to which you have no past experience or tools to manage. Is heartbreakingly captured by everyone involved in this film.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is truly amazing in this film. I won't go into specific scenes. In general however, he so deftly conveys the anguish, confusion, helplessness, happiness, and connection his character Elio is having for another person. Elio is so overwhelmed by his love, and how to express it, that placing his face into the chest of Oliver is at times the best he can do. It's so real and heartbreaking. I know more about Armie Hammer and his body of work. Oliver is a great role for him and he takes it on, makes Oliver his own and provides the lift and backdrop that Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (Elio) needed. I'm excited to see more from Armie with this role as a spring board. I enjoy his work. Again, I think Call Me by Your Name at its core is a film about first love; orientation is irrelevant. For me the pace of the film is exactly what it needed to be. It takes it time...just like first love does.",

This info is laboured throughout the film. What had this to contribute to the story? I found neither of the leads empathetic. The Americano visitor, Armie Hammer, seemed to acquire a special status for no better reason than that he was Americano. They fainted at the sight of his tepid dancing. (If you want to see dancing see Jean-Pierre Moulin in Klapisch's Paris.) In fact every move he made, whether playing a game or just sitting at the dinner table, no matter how tiresome, was marvelled at. The other lead, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, had some quirky ways. He was adequate. At the end Chalamet's father makes a speech, essentially explaining the film. If you have to explain a joke it is no longer funny. Explaining the content disemboweled the film. I was not surprised to see that James Ivory had a part in writing the script.",

I was reminiscing with him. I fell so hard in love with this movie as Elio fell in with Oliver. I hope the same people get a chance to work on the sequel. I need to read that book and watch more of Luca Guadagnino's movies.It's a wonderful love story. It feels like you get to know the characters Elio and Oliver at the same time as they get to know each other. I couldn't help to fall in love with them. Every scene in this movie builds the characters and their arcs. It is so wonderfully portrayed why Elio and Oliver feel so torn and drawn together at the same time.I don't know if the languages are used as a tool to show how conflicted the situation feels for Elio. He speaks French with the girl, he speaks Italian with the locals, English when he can be himself with Oliver and his parents, and even a tiny bit in german when they have this intimate family bonding moment. Or maybe i interpret too much into it.The music switches from classical to modern (80's) but it fits in every scene.",

            "content": "This honestly has been my most anticipated Oscar nominated movie this year. \"Call me by your name\" is based on a book by Andr\u00e9 Aciman. It's plot centers around Elio (played by Timothee Chalamet), a 17-year-old boy who lives in Italy with his father and mother. His father's 24-year-old American assistant Oliver (played by Armie Hammer) comes to stay with the family over the summer. As everyone adjusts to Oliver being there, Elio starts to develop a strong connection with Oliver. One that both confuses him and intrigues him.Any LGBTQ movie I will always support, whether it's portrayed correctly and with respect is the question. The director (Luca Guadagnino) both captures the beauty of Italy, the elegance of the French language and the affection of two people falling in love so perfectly that it brought me to tears. This movie is written, shot and composed breathtakingly. I immediately downloaded the entire soundtrack, which is comprised of various piano centered pieces and amazing tracks from Sufjan Stevens. Everything together just just perfect. The actors all brought their A-game, especially Timothee Chalamet. Though I do think Armie Hammer as Oliver looks slightly older than he should, his performance makes up for this nit-pick. The emotion flowing through each actor had me feeling exactly how they felt in that moment.I also love that this movie didn't shy away from the harsh reality of first love, age differences and what its like to grapple with your own sexuality. This movie will make you emotional! Please go see it if you haven't already, it's a work of art.Check out the full review with GIFS at:filmfreakreviews.video.blog/2019/06/17/call-me-by-your-name-showcases-gripping-self-discovery-romance/",

            "content": "Wow, that's some poetic stuff right there. \"Call Me by Your Name\" is my new favorite movie of 2017. Yes, I liked the story about two young men falling in love in 1980's picturesque small Italian town more than any other movie released in 2017, if I have to choose one.It's like an antidote for my previous favorite, \"Loveless\". Whereas the Russian drama is a bleak study of modern man having lost the ability to love, hence living without the hope, \"Call Me\" is about the possibility of finding hope thanks to love... Maybe the first time, maybe once again, it doesn't matter.It's not technically perfect. Just like \"Loveless\", the last chapter of the story would benefit from a trimming, there's more content than is strictly necessary. But all in all, the result wonderful. Love it!So, what's all the fuss about young men being gay to each other? Firstly, the movie looks just strikingly gorgeous, thus making it attractive for the widest possible audience.They have also efficiently used Steven Sufjans's new songs which, perhaps fleeting, ephemeral and not that original on their own, work extremely well in the context of the movie, adding the tender story an extra layer of magic.But it's not all about looking good and artsy, \"Call Me\" is superbly written, the original novel by Andr\u00e9 Aciman was adapted by the director Luca Guadagnino himself and James Ivory who you may remember as the costume drama master of some 20-30 years ago (\"Howard's End\", \"The Remains of the Day\" et al). I would not be surprised if much of the movie's delicacy and subtleness owe thanks to Ivory's experience.Anyway, the writing. It's not just a story. They have used the most difficult \"format\" of screen storytelling available, which turns the result even more a triumph.And the format is what I like to call \"state of the mind movie\". Meaning the emphasis is not so much on events but the main characters, especially the state of the mind they are in. Everything flows through that.This approach can easily alienate audience if they are not in the right mood, or especially if they have not experienced the same state of mind yourself - hope through love, in this case.But if you are able to hop on the train, so to speak, the story opens up as ripe and delicious peach, and the beauty of the play may transcend you for some time. This kind of magic is why cinema was born for!Of course, the gay thing may alienate people too. But I am sure the easily offended would stop viewing long before the physical intimacy scenes occur, which are well done too, actually. They are so intimate that I felt a mild discomfort by watching. Both leading men are straight, by the way, although they have great chemistry on screen.In the beginning, I mentioned the work being poetic. This calls for elaborating in further detail because the visual side - just how everything looks - is an important character on its own.For lack of a better term, there's something extremely natural about how everything is, in the air, how the people move and talk. I am talking about this pure state of \"here and now-ness\" which makes it easy to you kind of live in the movie, linger in its atmosphere, not just watch it. (\"Loveless\" also exhibits this quite rare quality, by the way.)The location also strengthens the illusion of being transported to another world - the early 80's Italian countryside, where there are no PC-s, phones, screens everywhere. There's more time for everything, to exist, just notice the world around you. The sense of place and time is stunning, thus giving the movie an unique meditative feel.The tension between young lovers also adds a lot of intrigue and tension in the air. Many moments and places, limited as they are in the real world, seem to expand and stretch to forever. It's like your best memory of being still young and relatively carefree, brought to screen!Oscar nominations are not announced yet, here's what I would like to see: Hammer and Chamelet as the actors, Stuhlbarg as the supporting actor, best movie, best director, best adapted screenplay, best song (Steven Sufjans, \"Mystery of Love\").\"Call Me\" was nominated for three Golden Globes as well - best movie / drama, Chamelet as the best actor, best Hammer as the best supporting actor - but did not win any. A shame.There's also a sequel planned, I kid you not. I am not sure the experience so unique can be done again. But the director and the two leading men are on board, so let's give this a benefit of a doubt, eh?",

I rewatched the film many times and 4 years later I can still call it one of my favourites. The music, the setting, the actors, the visuals, the whole aestehtic and the story is just immaculate.

            "review_title": "The utmost form of love, and the pain that allows us to grow",
            "content": "Call me by your name takes place in Rome one summer when a 17 year old adolescent played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is transfigured by a bond with a college-grad played by Armie Hammer in a somewhat forbidden but beautiful relationship. Call me by your name is about the tenderness of first love, the depth and long lasting marks that love leaves you with and the utmost form of desire and ownership to be one with another. This was a brilliant film that takes its time to slowly burn through the summer in Rome but to harshly cut to the departure and ending, as out of nowhere as the beginning. A transcending dream like state as viewers follow Elio through his summer. Indeed, As an audience you often don't appreciate as much until it is gone towards the very end. This film captures that state and creates an euphoric and erotic journey about identity and love. Call me by your name was wonderfully embodied and captured by the two leads, Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. First of all, Armie Hammer portrays his character of Oliver to a level of brilliance and perfection, smoothly and mesmerizingly slipping from the firm, boisterous character in public to the tender, thoughtful character in his privacy. Whereas Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet perfectly blends shy and defenceless with a sense of taking charge and trying to seem more 'grown up' or more 'mature'. Both of these performances were definitely what makes the film such a great watch, adhering to the cinematic trope of 'show don't tell' as a matter of fact, the acting work was transpired ever so brilliantly with the simple dilation of the eye and slightly awkward movements. Call me by your name at its core is about conflict and confusion, specifically those in one's tender age of adolescent. The lack of identity is a great theme that call me by your name wonderfully discusses. This can be seen through out by the deliberate contrast made in the artistic choices, from larger symbolic contrasts like Elio's logic sensibility in contrast to the irrational, sensual and illogical love and relationship that he forms with Oliver; and the seemingly logical, wise and systematic parents of Elio to the relationship of the leads. Down to details such as the pattern of Elio's shirt, with faces representing the many identities, and therefore lack f identity in the character.But, also at the center of this film is the love between Elio and Oliver most symbolically represented by the title of the film: Call my by your name, an action referred to in several points of the movie. A quote seemingly the utter opposite of self identification is the core of the film, the idea of which the largest extent of love is the complete segregation from 'I' and the transition to 'us' an almost ironically tragic idea to present to Elio considering his own lack of identity.In fact, as the film does illustrate to the very end this sense of confusion and pain and tragedy that befalls him is in fact the utmost importance in his journey to maturity. An overall message so wonderfully delivered directly through Michael Stuhlbarg riveting monologue in the final act of the film. He says: \"We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste!\" A chilling and riveting message to the audience, of the value in hurt and the importance of pain. So, call me by your name can certainly be considered a sad, tragic, heartbreaking film. But in fact, the message that comes through is that the pain is what allows us to grow.",

The fact that the movie has a kind of \"natural\" sound, without mix of volumes or something like that, makes you fell like if you were there. In fact, this is my favorite point of the entire movie, you fell like if you were there, at the end, it's almost like if you just visit Italy. Those little and apparently without meaning scene, where you just see the character thinking, or the to guys just staring at each other, the unusual way that the storyline is structured make this a complete immersive experience.The acting on the movie is great too, amazing. Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet are fantastic in the film, great chemistry.I have one or two flaws with the movie. Like, \"why is everyone changing the language everytime?\". Well, and the last issue, it's just more of a question. Elio has 17 years, and ignore Armie Hammer real age, the guy has what? 28 at least? Anyway, my main question is: This was probably a pedophilia case, wasn't? lol.",

Played brilliantly by both actors. Ever scene in this movie as been shot so well, right from the part where Elio is drunk and deeply in love with Oliver you can feel their love in those hazy eyes. One of my favourite scene is the part where they run around the mountains calling their names, completely being themselves!Of course Timothee, as always, does a brilliant job as Elio. You connect with his character no matter who you are! He can get so lost in his character that there is no Timothee anymore just Elio!This was most blissful 2 hours of my week! Totally worth a watch.

In northern Italy in 1983, 17-year-old Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) begins a relationship with visiting Oliver (Armie Hammer), his father's research assistant, with whom he bonds over his emerging sexuality, their Jewish heritage, and the beguiling Italian landscape. Depictions of same-sex relationships have been deemed Oscar-worthy before (Philadelphia in 1993; Brokeback Mountain in 2005 and, of course, last year's Moonlight), but this film goes further by allowing Elio and Oliver to escape the usually devastating consequences that cinema dishes out to its gay protagonists. Not only is Elio not struck down by a life-limiting illness, persecuted by unjust laws or turned out on the streets, he enjoys the support of a loving, emotionally intuitive family. Michael Stuhlbarg may have missed out on an Oscar nomination for the role of Elio's father, but the speech he gives on heartbreak will surely save audiences years of therapy by enacting the ideal parent figure we all wish we'd had.\"Call Me By Your Name\" celebrates the mystery and power of sexuality, and all its attendant danger, exaltation and tenderness. And most importantly it oozes nostalgic melancholy and avoids the cliches in many films about gay love.",

The shots are really good, the movie is a bit dramatic and presented in a very calm way. The beauty of Italy and young Elio's feelings are perfectly shown. This is not an easy film, it presents a difficult situation between two men. Some scenes may be overkill, but keep in mind that this is a movie based on a book. In the film we can actually feel what Elio is feeling, we can see his pain and his love. To all the serenity of this movie comes a soundtrack that is AMAZING. The music fits perfectly into this atmosphere, especially the work of Sufjan Stevens. Shots, music, colors, actors, surroundings make it a really good movie. After watching the movie, there is a feeling of emptiness. Something makes it hard to forget about this movie, that something changed in us after watching it. Maybe the relationship between Elio and Oliver has been a little idealized and overrated, but maybe that's how love works? Because one of them surely loves. The last scene is heartbreaking. After all, it is just my opinion, I recommend everyone to watch it or read it. It is for sure s o m e t h i n g.",

            "content": "(Maybe only minor spoilers)I had no intention to see this movie at all, but I fast-forwarded most of it to be able to write an impartial review. And I literally coulnd't believe my eyes. This is a completely vulgar movie designed to do only one thing: To promote immorality and perversion as if they are the most natural thing, in order to contribute in the complete extinction of whatever morals have been left in Western societies. Without getting into any details, it features the love and sexual experiences of a teen with both a girl and an older man. It includes lots of sex scenes, especially homosexual ones, and a lot of other vulgar scenes,(like the peach scene) along with the admittingly beautiful scenery, and is run by a superficial \"intellectual\" vibe in order to seem smarter and pass its central message with more ease. And the central message is the absolute acceptance of immorality, promiscuity and perversion (the last scene with the father's dialogue has to be seen to be believed) All these in a nice rapping, but not much else.It is literally inconceivable how degenerate our societies have become for such a movie not only to be able to be produced, not only to be higly appreciated by the as-known-to all deeply corrupted Hollywood, to the point where is nominated for Oscars, but mostly to be welcomed or accepted as a nice movie by the majority of society and to receive such good reviews here. It's past the point of shame. There are really no excuses for a movie who endorses promiscutity and perversion so openly as this one (and with no less than a teen boy as its subject). I am writting this review to state that not all people are completely stunned and some of us still remember the difference between right and wrong, and we will try to wake up others.Besides the above elements, the movie does feature some beatifull scenery and some nice archaeological info (for which the two stars). But that's just a nice wrapping, as I said. In all, this is a disgraceful movie with no other merits at all, and the fact it knows such promotion is almost impossible to believe, but as I said, it simply underscores how perverted our societies have become- and perhaps, how hard we shall have to fight to restore some of our values if we ever decide to wake up...",

I didnt feel specially interested in the gay scenes as they mean little to me but we could feel the tension. This a romance between people that love each other and I saw myself a bit in the non gay scenes as they remind me my youth. The picture is awsome with breath taking views typical from italy and the south of europe but the movie is slow, long and I had to watch it during the day to prevent falling asleep. I loved the fact that the parents back at the 80's were so compreensive and didnt try to interfeer. This is a good love story that reminds us that love is universal and has many forms. As a conclusion I would say that is a really good movie but not a 10.",

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name depicts the blossoming romance between a 17-year-old teen, Elio (Timothy Chalamet) and his father's older research assistant, Oliver (Armie Hammer), against the gorgeous, colorful backdrop of Northern Italy during the 1980s. But it's much more than a simple romantic film about a gay couple; Call Me by Your Name is a sensual film that depicts the universal sexual awakening all adolescents experience when growing up. It's a film that so beautifully captures the intense sensuality of this critical period of our lives, and, in effect, becomes wholly relatable in the most subtle way. The film is also a beautiful coming of age film as Elio struggles with embracing his identity and its stigma, juxtaposed against the older Oliver's hardened experience and slight disillusionment with his own.The film uses its slow burn pacing to build up the relationships and sexual tension between Elio and Oliver, using its incredible screenplay to build an intellectual and emotional connection between them. The smart and deep dialogue between Elio and Oliver beautifully captures their complementary knowledge in music, the arts, and history, establishing an enriching and beautiful relationship between the two. The subtle body language conveyed by the actors as well as the implicit dialogue lets the sensual romance between them blossom naturally before it climaxes into a full embrace of their feelings.Elio's relationship with Oliver is compared to that between him and Marzi, Elio's female love interest. While their relationship is meant to contrast with Elio-Oliver's relationship and emphasizes Elio's desires to be with Oliver, Elio and Marzi's relationship is given the same treatment and helps the audience journey through Elio's sexual awakening as an adolescent. Guadagnino's dreamlike direction evokes that sense of isolation, curiosity, and pure sensuality that comes with this process of growing up, adding significant meaning and emotion to the relatively explicit scenes, both on and off camera.No matter what your orientation is, Call Me By Your Name is a film that anyone can find relatable. With a dreamy, piano-laden soundtrack of assorted Impressionistic pieces and a smooth, dreamlike directorial style, Call Me By Your Name perfectly captures the complex sexual spark of adolescence and sensuality, and captivates its audiences with elements of a coming of age story and same-sex relationship to heighten the dramatic elements in this beautiful work of art.",

            "content": "CMBYN had potential to be a film that deserves all the praise and attention it's received. But, for me it fails because of two major problems: Elio's attraction to Oliver seems to come from nowhere and Armie Hammer lacks credibility or depth as an actor.As a gay man who's been in relationships with an age disparity -- years ago as the younger and in more recent years as the older -- I have a special understanding of those dynamics.Oliver (Armie Hammer) is presented as a pretentious, semi-obnoxious, aloof character. Somehow Elio becomes intrigued and then obsessed with Oliver, even though there is nothing in the plot nor in the character development to initiate and fuel that interest. (There are a couple painfully contrived scenes: Elio playing piano for Oliver and Oliver giving Elio a brief neck rub.) I suspect the filmmakers were banking on the audience finding Armie Hammer so attractive and appealing that Elio's interest would be taken for granted. Unfortunately, I personally don't see Hammer's allure (he seems asexual to me) and his acting has the depth of a cardboard cutout. I was not going along for that ride -- I needed more convincing, which never came.By contrast, Elio (Timothee Chalamet) was perfectly cast and he delivered an outstanding performance in every scene. It's a shame he wasn't paired with another equally compelling and attractive actor who would have elevated the Oliver character to the same praise-worthy level. Then, we'd have a hit movie!There is only one \"sex scene\" between Elio and Oliver and it seems like a cop-out. It shows the pair kissing in bed, the camera pans to a view of a tree outside the window, then jump-cuts to the two waking up the next morning. The scene was nowhere near as tender and sexy as a previous heterosexual sex scene between Elio and a girl. I immediately suspected the director must be straight, so I was surprised to learn that Luca Guadagnino is gay. I'm left to wonder why the pivotal gay sex scene was glossed-over while the less significant hetero sex scene was presented almost in real time?I was also disappointed in the overall look and feel of the movie. As a professional commercial photographer, these kinds of things are important to me. The movie lacked the luscious visuals and sensual qualities of light and place that could have made the movie's appearance magical and memorable.",

The characters were really sophisticated and interesting, the dialogue felt realistic and natural and the atmosphere and the scenery was the cherry on top. I can't stress how beautiful this movie looks. Furthermore the portrayal of Oliver, Elio and his parents was magnificent. The amount of skill and talent required to pull of a musically talented and polyglot teenager is immense and Timothee Chalamet truly hit the ball out of the park on that one. Lastly the plot and the ending were very moving, to not cry at the end of the movie is a Herculean task.I can only point out two plot flaws that I noticed: 1. The characters were too intelligent at certain points. Even just outside of Elio and Oliver, many side characters often switched between Italian, English and French, which seems exaggerated and destroys the immersion during these conversations. 2. The relationship between Elio und Marzia could have been explored a bit more. Especially at the end when they shake on just being friends, it felt as if a teeny tiny bit of content had to come before that; the solution itself isn't unrealistic, just the context of their relationship came a bit short. But all in all still wonderful.",

            "review_title": "A Must See (For Most of Us)",
            "content": "This is the fourth (out of nine) of the 2018 Best Picture Oscar nominees I've seen and, so far the best of a very competitive field. It is also my favorite movie of the entire list of Oscar-nominated movies so far. Of course, expectations were already very high - both critical and audience reviews placed Call Me By Your Name in the top three or four movies of the year. But if I say that it meets expectations, I'm not being completely fair.To say this is a 'coming of age' story is an accurate statement, but I don't think it goes far enough. As I watched this movie I became very much aware of just how important human contact is to all human beings - how touch, and sexual expression, are so much more than simple human experiences but rather seem to emerge from the core of what it means to be alive. The gut-wrenching challenges that arise in adolescence as we learn how to channel and interpret these needs and impulses is a key part, maybe one of the most essential parts, to growing up.Call Me By Your Name does not let us down in the exploration of this critical human experience. And I think most of the credit needs to go to the young actor, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, an American who, when the movie was filmed was just 20 years old himself, barely into his own understanding of what this all means. He was nominated, but did not win, for Leading Actor this year. However I do not doubt that we will be seeing more of him in the near future. He appeared in 3 other films last year and has at least three more due out this year.He plays 17 year-old Elio, who is spending a hot summer with his liberal academic parents in a Northern Italian villa surrounded by small town and pastoral scenes complete with swimming holes, calculated to encourage pleasure and self-paced discovery. He is a complex person with interests in music and history and, of course, his changing body. That he is confused and torn by everything going on is a given. He has ample opportunities to explore his budding sexuality and is hot to pursue a French girl, who is more than willing to explore with him.But his interests turn with the arrival of Oliver, an American graduate student who has come to live and study with Elio's father who is a Greco-Roman scholar. Oliver is played by Armie Hammer. We've seen Hammer before in the Social Network and Lone Ranger. He is certainly attractive enough, and his role is vital to this movie. But I wouldn't argue that he out-performs Mr. Chalamet, by any means.Oliver appears, at least initially, to be interested in the Italian women around him. But he also develops a fondness for Elio, attracted by his intelligence and honesty. Rapidly, this develops into a gay romance as Oliver and Elio spend increasing amounts of time, and intimacy with each other. Love scenes are not explicit, but are honest. They are not at all gratuitous, but display the profound physical basis for their emotional intimacy. (Oh, and BTW, you will never look at a peach the same way!)\nAlthough audience reaction to the movie has been generally strongly favorable, there have been a number of very negative responses. Mostly these comments seem to be coming from people who are having a hard time with homosexuality. There are also people who claim that the movie's liberal supporters are being hypocritical by ignoring the Elio/Oliver age difference and the 'moral' issues involved there. However, these critiques are not significant, nor even relevant, when you understand that the age of consent in Italy is 14 (Elio is 17), and the relationship is voluntary at every step of its progression. Yes, Oliver is several years older than Elio, but if having sex with someone younger than yourself is a crime, then half the population is guilty in pretty much every sexual encounter. So, for me, the age thing is not an issue. (Us Americans tend to forget that a lot of the world is less prudish than we are.)So that might leave as a potential problem, for some, the fact that this is a gay relationship. If that is a concern, then pay particular attention to the Father's talk with Elio very near the end of the movie. Although I don't particularly like the Father, I found his talk with his son to be the kind of conversation I wish my own Father could have had with me - I think the world would be a much better place if we all were more like these characters. In fact, for me, the movie provoked thoughts in my own mind that I've often had before - thoughts that argue that maybe we would all be a little emotionally more healthy and mature if we acknowledge that sex and reproduction are related, but not the same thing. And that touch and pleasure are such intrinsic and necessary parts of being human, that the gender of the partner is not really important.Clearly Elio's relationship with Oliver is important to him. And, like so many relationships, the association between pleasure and pain becomes obvious and inevitable. The final scene in the movie, at the fireplace, is a tremendous statement of both Chalamet's acting skills, and of the power of love, and loss.The movie won James Ivory the Oscar for Adapted Screenplay. (At 89, he is the oldest person to win an Oscar.). However, I can't say that I recognize any other movies he has written. Furthermore, it is difficult to evaluate the writing of an adapted screenplay unless you have read the source material, which I haven't. I can say that this movie was infinitely better than Logan, the other nominee in this category that I've seen.It was also nominated for the song Mystery of Love, by Sufjan Stevens. I've been listening to that song as I write this review - it definitely works, especially \"how much sorrow can I take\".Certain people shouldn't watch this movie - and you probably already know who you are. For the rest of you, this is a must see experience. One of the best of the year. 4.5 stars (out of 5).",

And I especially liked the motivational speech at the end of the movie, which suggested it's perfectly OK to go with your heart, and it's not necessary to become an old and spent misery that no-one will ultimately want to look at.The film is about pursuing your dreams no matter what, in the knowledge that the world we live in is often dark, aggressive and hostile.The film tells its own story and lets us know that events are sometimes beyond our control or expectations, and we should embrace these events with open hearts or let them go forever, to regret for the rest of our lives, and what I now perceive is if people were more open at certain points in their lives then they would be happier today because of it, as all of us would be through living an open and accepting life.This film is not for everybody, runs a bit slow at times, but anything that makes us be ourselves and talk to each other is good.",

I have thought about this movie everyday since i have watched it. It shows that love can be in any way, shape, or form. This love story was beautifully written. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet had a spectacular performance. He is getting the recognition he deserves in 2020. He is going to go very far in the acting world. The way that Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer played their characters was done in a spectacular way. Their development into lovers was very well done. The ending was the most hurt I've ever felt in a movie. The way Elio wept in front of the fireplace was extraordinary. I watched every moment and could feel exactly what he was feeling... loss. This movie deserves every recognition possible for the beautiful location, intricate script, and wonderful acting. I recommend this movie to everyone of any background.",

            "content": "Call Me by Your name is a beautiful cinematic experience that makes you feel as though you're not only watching a movie but that you're nearly immersed in a form of art work. The movie is an adaptation of the book written by Andre Aciman in 2007. Our story focuses on a teenage boy named Elio who begins to fall for Oliver, his father's intern who resides with them in for the summer.From the soundtrack to the acting to the cinematography every element of Call Me By Your Name was carefully orchestrated to make the movie a captivating and emotional experience to do the book justice. Even from the very beginning of the movie, music and colour are used very evidently yet effortlessly to transport you into northern Italy in the 1980s, which makes the clear titling of the setting becomes more a means of clarification than a necessity. The characters also often speak in Italian and French which helps the movie feel more authentic and adds another exquisite element to the audio of the film. The filming is done as simplistically as possible without a lot of cuts, as the entire film was shot with a single 35mm lens. This was a brave choice on Luca Guadagnino's part but it paid off well in helping the audience feel more submersed in the time frame. There is even a scene where light bled into the film leaving sprocket holes and although it was an accident they left it in the movie for its real and ephemeral quality. Sufjan Stevens wrote two original songs for the movie which can be heard multiple times throughout and their beautiful somber sounds align well with the cinematography. Timothy Chalamett and Armie Hammer's acting for the film was superb, it's as though you can feel their chemistry and  tension through the screen. Every aspect is clearly carefully orchestrated to bring Andre Aciman's story to life.At the very end of the movie, when our beloved main character is left heartbroken, Timothy Chalamett is seen crying as the end titles role and it is a very beautiful and moving scene yet so simplistic. His acting during this scene is so intense and believable it allows the audience to understand what the character means to show and feel without saying a word. While he cries the fire crackles and one of Sufjan Stevens original songs play and all of the elements of this scene play together harmoniously to make the sorrowful ending unforgettable. This unresolved and heartbreaking end to the story is what makes it so great because it perfectly portrays that although it is a \"love story\" in the end the audience learns more about heartbreak than they do love, which sets it apart and gives it much more depth than most drama and romance films.Call Me by Your Name is a must see movie filled with more passion, beauty, love, and heartbreak than one might think possible. This absolute success of an adaptation is sure to become a romantic classic for the ages.",

A beautiful love.\nA perfect film in practically everything: cinematography, direction, interpretations, screenplay, scenography, soundtrack; but missing something more to be really perfect, to enter in list of my favorite movies, something that would have made me move a little more but maybe this something I will find in a second vision.

Where Moonlight (the movie which received 2017 Best picture) is ugly in its truth, Call Me By Your Name is beautiful and light. However, the topic is very polarizing and this movie is not meant for the Eastern European audience (more a bout it further).\nElio and his parents spend their summers in their house in Italy. All his family members are intellectuals: Mr. Perlman, his father, is an archeology professor, his mother - a polyglot and Elio himself is a music genius. The family spends their time either in multi-language discussions or reading books. Every summer his father asks a post-doctorate to come and help him with his work, and here comes Oliver - a beautiful out-of-the-cover-of-a-magazine American. Even though Elio is smart and very grown up for his age, this is the first time in his life he'll find out a different kind of an emotion.\nThe movie has beautiful scenery of little Italian towns, sunny meadows, clear water and colorful human characters. Even the maid had a personality even though she only said a few words. What wasn't said in the film, the audience had to understand themselves. To compensate the silence, film has a fantastic soundtrack. \nUnfortunately, the auditorium was filled by middle aged orangutans. I was surprised to find out that there are still people (yes, in this day and age of information) that don't read the annotation and go to movies blindly. On the other hand, I did manage to restore some belief in humanity: two ~14 year old girls who sat next to me (even though the movie is 16+) didn't make a sound. Aand they even exchanged excited commentaries after it.\nOverall - bravo! There should be more movies like this.",

            "review_title": "The Un-Gay Gay Movie",
            "content": "As a gay man myself, my approach to this film is that of someone who is happy to see a mainstream(ish) movie about a gay relationship. What a shame they didn't make one.The public embrace of this film by movie audiences, and especially by gay filmgoers, is completely baffling to me. This is not a gay film. This is a movie about two straight men, who inexplicably have a gay experience. The movie takes place in Italy during the violent Years of Lead, but there is no mention of those historic events. Instead, an American professor and his Italian wife and their family are living in one of those idyllic Italian homes in the middle of an apricot orchard. Mind you, these people have none of the responsibility of the orchard's upkeep or harvest. They are just the family of a gentleman farmer, which is a phrase that means \"one who enjoys the benefits of a farm but does none of the hard work.\"The family's oldest son, Elio, played wonderfully by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, is in the middle of a summer that requires nothing of him. And like so many misguided filmmakers who think ennui is a substitute for atmosphere and action, the writer and director have us following Elio through the boring pattern of his life. It's just a series of lingering shots that never even bother to capture the beauty of a region deserving of breathtaking cinematography. During this summer, Elio has a girlfriend, Marzia, with whom he has sex and evidently with no qualms or problems. Enter the tall, beautiful, blond graduate student Oliver, played with equal aplomb by Armie Hammer, in the kind of performance we knew he had in him but that Hollywood has avoided allowing from him in dreck like \"The Lone Ranger.\" Oliver is under the tutelage of Elio's professor father and he is likable and friendly, though he possesses the cavalier air of a carefree middle-class American. Elio observes that Oliver fails to say a proper goodbye, but simply substitutes a casual, \"Later\" for partings.After a far too protracted period of more ennui, Elio and Oliver strike up a friendship that has them going swimming, riding bikes, traversing the countryside, and taking in the proverbial local color. And then, suddenly, they have sex. For no apparent reason, these two have sex. They haven't exchanged a single furtive glance, a moment of seduction, a tempestuous conversation, or playful touching of skin. Imagine you're watching the wine country film \"Sideways\" and in the middle of the 2nd act, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden-Church, completely sober, just jumped into the sack and had sex for no apparent reason. There are equal amounts of flirting and sexual energy between both pairs of men in both films. It is understandable that gay men, living in a place and time when homosexuality was still considered taboo, would conceal their attraction to each other. What is not understandable is that when they are alone or in private moments (before the sex scene), they never share a single smile or longing expression. If you went into this movie cold, with no publicity telling you it was a gay film, their sex would catch you by surprise. Oliver is always with a beautiful woman and did I mention Elio's much too successful sex with his girlfriend? Sure they're gay, evidently, but they sure as hell seem to need a beginners guide to understanding and communicating their attraction. Reviews and synopses of this film explain the events that we are told happen but they really don't. They will say that Elio has a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to Oliver. Um, really? Who told you that? Because nothing in this film tells us that at all. This is a film about two men ignoring each other while not pretending to be straight, but just flat out BEING straight....until suddenly they're not. Trolls and defenders will argue that anyone wanting more cues of their affections need everything spelled out for them. But you can't have a film that is constantly spelling out S-T-R-A-I-G-H-T and then suddenly shift into gay gear. It's misleading not only to the audience but to far too many straight people who already think two gay men in a room with each other will eventually have sex. Spelling out their attraction could only have helped this movie because they do nothing interesting. They're in Italy in a tempest-tossed period of history but they don't seem to know it. Like all those films where Americans or Brits buy houses in Tuscany or Umbria or whatever, it's impossible to relate to their plight of being rich and bored.Adding to the complexities of this film's failings is how the men look as though they are about two decades apart in age. Elio is 17 but Chalamet looks for all the world like he is 13, with his hairless, skinny, undeveloped body. Meanwhile, the dashing Hammer's character is 24 but looks every bit of 34. In a movie year when Kevin Spacey was literally removed and replaced from the movie \"All the Money in the World\" for being grabby and inappropriate with young men while he was still in his 20s, this movie plows right ahead with this coupling and audiences and critics offered nary a word about how this MAN is suddenly having sex with this post-adolescent. And then there's the absurd title. Take this moment to ponder what I am going to ask you. Contemplate the nature of someone you love. What is it that makes them special? You know the answer immediately. It is their whole sense of \"otherness,\" their particular blend of quirks and charm that delight you and fills you with their energy. Now, what sums up all that person is that captivates you? His or her name. You love saying it. You love hearing it. You love being reminded that this person exists in the world by hearing their name aloud. So, who in their right mind thought it would be charming for lovers to call each other by their own names? And not only that, but the moment in which these two start shouting their own names is just ridiculous! They appear to be unable to forget themselves and celebrate each other. It plays as badly timed narcissism.That all being said, there are three lovely performances in this despite the enervated direction and content of the film. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet earned his Oscar nod for inhabiting Elio so comfortably and playing him so smartly. Armie Hammer possesses all the physical gifts along with the self-entitled air that makes for the privileged American. One hopes this is the beginning of a career of great performances in the right material. As usual, Michael Stuhlbarg delivers a wonderful performance as Elio's father, and he delivers a lovely speech near the end of the film that will pull you in.The ending of the film is beautiful and baffling at the same time. It is December and Oliver has returned home. He calls from the United States and talks to Elio's parents before talking to Elio himself. Oliver and Elio discuss their summer fling, about which Elio reveals his parents know about it. Then Oliver casually tells Elio that he is marrying a woman in the U.S. Watching Elio's heart-rending reaction is the beautiful part. Chalamet finally gets to break free and emote and show how he feels about Oliver. The baffling part is Oliver's complete ease after learning Elio's parents know about the relationship. Granted the parents are liberal and open-minded, but all parents stop being so liberal when they learn that one of their pre-adult children had sex with an adult houseguest. From the viewpoint of liberal or prude, the fact remains that Oliver betrayed the trust of his hosts. So if he is pent up with fear that he would be found out as gay that he is marrying a woman (or the alternative version that he wants an open relationship that can't had with a man in 1980s America), then why isn't he appropriately scared? Instead he is unbothered to learn Elio's parents know about their relationship, so there is a contradiction afoot: Either he is such a slave to society's thinking that he is marrying a woman, and, hence he would be alarmed at the news of Elio's parents' knowledge of their affair, or he isn't constrained by such fears, which means he wouldn't be wasting his time marrying a woman. At the very least, his Oliver's affair with Elio wouldn't be considered proper behavior for a grad student in the eyes of parents if not the letter of the law. Yet this conundrum sums up the whole film. It is constantly removing conflict, hence removing any reason to watch it. The closest to a disagreement anyone comes is a playful spat between Elio and Oliver about how the former plays the piano. It's a good enough moment to make you think the movie is going to kick in but, of course, it doesn't. It never does. It's just one boring moment of non-conflicting ennui after another. The movie was made from the source novel by the same name and a friend encouraged me to read it. I did and....WOW! What a great book. The very first pages tell us about Elio's longing and attraction for Oliver...you know...the way human beings function by revealing their desires. It's a great book that is heartfelt and open and explains why so many people had an idea of what to expect when they saw this film. It would make a great movie. What a shame this movie isn't it. A sad and total waste of an opportunity for a film that will not age well into the future.",

There was very little chemistry or substantial character development, leading to the film's often disjointed, dry pace. Less is usually more, but in this case less was non-existent. Armie Hammer was a terrible cast; not a convincing actor in the slightest and far too mature looking to play a 24-year-old.Again, I enjoy similar coming-of-age dramas, but this was more of a contrived, overly pretentious attempt to exploit another non-heterosexual narrative.

The hype for this movie was worse than Twilight or even Harry Potter (both cringy-romance-slow pacers). And gosh I was so disappointed and also like, maybe I should really just watch a film before it becomes trendy.Why didn't they created the romance by making both Oliver and Elio interact more? Cause it happened all of a sudden? Like new guy in town? Lemme just have an adventure with him just because. Cause that's what this film transmitted me. There's no romance here. Just obsessions and sexual tension.That also reminds me of the age gap. I'll just pass on that part, cause Lolita did it first (and the same as on that movie. Cause it seems fine that Hollywood desperately keeps creating immature loving stories with minors, by just doing it so \"romantic\").The movie also relays too much on the scenery. We get it, Italy is a wonderful place. Everyone knows that if you think of summer, you're just thinking of Italy. That's the 2h board, let's just focus on that and screw a good narrative, right?The peach and the BJ scenes? Literally just so you feel uncomfortable but also wanting to know \"what's next\"?

It is a rich multilayered masterpiece punctuated by sweet laughter that is the icing on a cake of resurrected memory and surfacing emotional intensity.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's Oscar loss is a testament to the Academy's backroom political shenanigans. If the Academy actually based its decision solely on acting then he deserved the Oscar. Period. His emotional accessibility, vulnerability and sizzling chemistry with costar Armie Hammer set new standards of authenticity and spontaneity. His character, Elio, takes the audience on an intimate emotional rollercoaster ride that is contagious, dynamic, and at times gutting. His final scene in front of the fire is riveting and haunting. It sticks with you like a memory suspended in time.Armie Hammer's depiction of the conflicted Oliver, Elio's love interest, is a case study of cognitive dissonance and emotional repression. His inner turmoil is deftly camouflaged by coolness and confidence with cracks hinting at his humanity. His is not an easy role for any actor yet his wise and thoughtful choices make Oliver less a character portrayal and more a revelation of what an opening heart and true intimacy look and feel like.Michael Stuhlbarg's devastating performance as Elio's father redefines fatherhood and unconditional love for the ages. His powerful end monologue will live on as one of the greatest scenes in movie history. I dare you to try and forget it.The impeccable acting and single-camera setup deceive us into thinking that we are actually in the movie. It is a mesmerizing model of immersion and more of a visitation than a movie. The film does not end with the closing credits. It plants fertile seeds of greater compassion, understanding, and love that take root in one's consciousness for life.Director Luca Gaudagnino's intoxicating visual opulence and scintillating sensory magic leave us inspired by the organic technicolor beauty that abounds, including inside of us, if we were only to look. This film compels us to look profoundly through the prismatic lens of pure love at each meticulously executed and lusciously crafted scene. Thus \"Call Me By Your Name\" is a work of fine art that leaves the world a better place and spiritually enriched with a gushing waterfall of amore in all forms.",

In the book, which is great, Oliver is far more fleshed out and feels much younger than Hammer is, which makes the book work far better as a love story. The movie is beautiful to look at, and there are some wonderful scenes but I still hear people talk about the film as this great love story and think which film did you watch? The scene were Elio watches Oliver dance with a woman and he realizes their relationship is doomed is brilliant, but I interpreted it as Elio realizing he was being used. This scene scene isn't in the book, and if anything it's Elio who flaunts girls to Oliver in the book.

It's just that it is a very low-key, deliberately slow-paced character study with one killer, incredibly well-written--and likely unforgettable--monologue at one point. It undeniably, effectively depicts a brief period in two lifetimes that will never be forgotten by the two main characters. But for some reason I felt detached and a bit put off by being a part of it. I should mention I'm a huge fan of James Ivory's (and his two partners') past films, my favorites being \"A Room With a View\" and \"Maurice.\" \"Call Me...\" has the same meticulous location detail and atmosphere of those films, but the characters here feel under-developed and almost one-dimensional, which surprised the heck out of me considering the past films he's been a part of (I realize he was the screenwriter here, and not the director, by the way). But I have to give it credit for simply and effectively portraying two young/youngish men as they are brought together in idyllic, lovely surroundings and left to discover each other because they have so much free time to do so. What they discover is portrayed as very special because they are both good people, but that killer monologue I mentioned earlier left me feeling conflicted as to just how special it truly was, and whether the character delivering it was sincere or just trying to be a part of needed healing and giving perspective to this moment in life for someone he cared about deeply. I will say I was left thinking about the film as I left, if feeling unsatisfied and confused by it, so I guess I can at the very least say it wasn't a throwaway film or moviegoing experience.",

Now, after having watched it, I honestly say, I couldn't fast forward through this \"Classic\" fast enough.Sure, it contained some beautiful scenery but that was the only thing I found compelling at all and the only reason it gets 1 star from me. Regardless of how well the book was adapted, the \"celebration\" of youthful romance and finding who a person really is totally lost when you understand what takes place on the screen is a celebration of condoned pedophilia and statutory rape. Sex with a minor is ILLEGAL, immoral and if approved by parents is most sickening. It was overtly paying homage to a culture in the Entertainment industry that is, as I write this, being decimated by scandal after scandal of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Even cinematically it was poorly executed. There were multiple continuity errors, dialogue that was hard to hear, subtitles that were difficult to read due to the color of the background and jumpy editing. Please save your time and watch something else.",

One almost gets the impression that different hands intervened in the final writing of the script.The story is not very real and at times has a fairy tale feel to it.As for the scenic department, some of the cars seen in the various scenes are a bit too old for the early 1980s, as is the train car in which Oliver gets on at the end of the film (they were in use a decade earlier).To conclude a film that, in my opinion, seen again in a few years, will be easier to understand its limitations.",

Their lyrical romance does not harm anyone, despite the fact that there is always an extra in love, who will, alas, not be at work. But this love has neither an enemy nor contradictions - that happy event, when everything is perfectly understood, accepted, forgiven and supported.Born in the beginning, the feeling of happiness, not leaving for a single moment, accompanies every moment of this picture, filled with capacious frames from intimate short and voluminous, spatial general plans expressing the thrill and deep breath of lovers, who, as the father of young Elio, very very fortunate.How lucky and all of us with the discovery of a rare gift of Timothy Shalame, who has the ability to control himself and manage his emotions, becoming a completely different person, while leaving the slightest reason to doubt the change of face, which determines the credibility of the whole story, consisting of tender appeals and responses, verbally and tactfully exchanged the main characters of this picture, happy with each meeting alone.Italian Luca Guadagnino represents a radiant light and breathing passion, not devoid of sadness and humor, a sparkling ribbon of happiness, as sincere as the characters of this story, doomed to the inevitable parting, the consequences of which enrich with new paints the psychological portraits of parents, son and his lover , and Shalame performs a creative feat, hanging on the credits in a tremendous pause, which will never be forgotten.",

The novel oozes beauty and romance, peppered with sexual tension and longing from the first person perspective of young Elio. Can it replicated for the big screen?Thankfully it can. Beautifully captured by James Ivory, the script captures all these elements of the novel deftly. It's no wonder that Call Me By Your Name swept the board during awards season for best adapted screenplay.The production is incredible too, the nostalgia of the time is captured amazingly, from the costumes, to the locations, to the gorgeous cinematography. One wanted nothing more than to swept into this world on numerous occasions, with a cigarette hanging from my lips, sipping coffee in my short shorts... For the viewer to become immersed the world so thoroughly is high praise to all involved.Timothee Chalamet, is perfect as Elio. Beautiful, yearning and vulnerable, he emotes everything with an ease and believability that more than proves his Best Actor nominations worth. Notable mentions to Elios parents too (Michael Stuhlbarg and Amira Casar) - both of whom are revelations in themselves; charming, warm and funny and add another dimension of beautiful heartache when dealing with their son.The only reason that one didn't give this movie 10 stars is because of Armie Hammer. The character of Oliver should have been younger. While Hammer has the classic looks and charm of the Oliver in the novel, he just looks too mature. Also his borderline rude nonchalance towards Elio at the start of the film, is almost too much, and makes the interest in Elio, almost come as a little of a surprise.Their relationship however is beautifully captured, the tension and the attraction between the two of them is very seductive, which makes the resolution of he narrative all the more heartbreaking.Call Me By Your Name, feels real. That's where the main success lies. It tells the truth about forbidden love, lust and loss. I dare you not to fall in love too.BOTTOM LINE: Absolutely peachy.",

The relationships that develop between Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), summer house-guest research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer) and village girl Marzia (Esther Garrel) is what saves the film from self indulgent tedium. I thought Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet was superb in his challenging role. I didn't particularly warm to Armie Hammer's Oliver, and from this there were aspects of his relationships with others that didn't seem to ring quite true to me. Elio's father, Prof Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) makes the most of some insightful lines towards the end. The film was shot on location in Lomardia, northern Italy and the settings, particularly the villa, surrounding orchard and river and scenery on quiet rural roads and little villages provided perfect backdrops.The film captures the languid summer laziness, where meals punctuate swims, naps, trips to town, reading, chatting and playing musical instruments. Maybe it captures this too well, as found the first half pretty slow. It builds slowly leading to the second half feeling pretty right. The ending is particularly satisfying, and I suggest you try to remember that if you're tempted to bail out earlier. It is set in 1983, so no smart phones or laptops, and there's a bit of a reminder that maybe we did talk, play games and interact directly with each other more then, with benefits to our overall humanity.",

Refreshing to have a film like this not succumb to clich\u00e9 Gay script plotlines. \n* Lush production and cinematography.Cons\n* Armie Hammer is wooden, in genuine and miscast as far as I am concerned. He shares uncomfortable chemistry with Chamalet and is by far the weak link to the film.\n* Film comes close to the cusp of being too pretentious.\n* At times the film is boring and really struggles when nothing happens. Having seen nearly every Gay film out there, this one ranks right in the middle of the heap. Good to see some massive recognition for a film like this, but the hype isn't really deserved.

What I can add to all that is that Armie Hammer gives a great performance in it that was in my opinion underrated by both fans and critics. Maybe because Chalamet is so good it this too and he's a newcomer, I don't know. Oliver is such a complex character, so ambivalent (I've not read the book though). He is both in love with Elio, but at the same time he sees himself as a mentor to him. He cares about Elio but at the same time he keeps his distance (even after they were together), and he feels like he's doing something wrong. He understands Elio's feelings but he is somehow past the age where he was able to feel such strong feelings himself, he's mature, he's over that already. Armie portrays all of that so effortlessly. His facial expressions say so much, in the right moments. He has just the right amount of confidence and handsomeness to be Oliver...",

Both of the main protagonist are arrogant, selfish and full of themselves. Elio appears quite spoiled.The way Oliver was dealing around the house as if he was the owner did not make sense to me. There was no indication they are old friends or related and even then his behaviour would be considered rude in Europe.Everybody seems to love Oliver and Elio falls in live with him. Why? Only because of his blue eyes?Oliver looks 30. Elio - 15.Elio is obviously full of hormones and in full blown puberty. He had a brief summer fling. The way the ending makes everything so serious as if this is a one in a million forever love was not to my taste. Anyone who has had teenage summer flings would know they are exciting and passionate but also that they run their course fast.A lot of the characters seem to act weird in different parts of the movie. I also did not understand the scheme of the professor inviting students to his house in the summer to mainly chill.

Comments especially referring to peodaphillia are quite eyebrow raisinganf strong, especially when its rubbish/ Since Italy as a age of consent of 14 but even if they don't know that they must know the just about every European Country as an age of consent of 16. just like the drinking age is lower in Europe than the US. What more imo if this was a straight relationship, plenty of those same people woildn't give their relationship or small age gap a second thought.There's even been comments I've seen about smoking and that by the 80's it was known to be bad for your health. Fact is if you ever travelled to Italy or any European main land City att you'd know they smoked like chimneys through the 80's and 90's and still do now and European Cities have always been big smokers, like the French, Spanish and Italians,ATEOTD it's right to dislike this film for genuine reasons but when peolpe are putting their own Countries laws on it as a standard bearer of sorts and start acting Conservative about subject matters, seemingly because one actor looked a few years older than the other, which is very subjective anyway, well that's just silly.

I don't know why people make movies like this. Elio is like a Caravaggian catamite enticing the intellectual, though manly male. It works well in the Italian narrative tradition, but not as a modern piece of post-Stonewall cinema - in my humble opinion. I have read that a movie should \"transport\" the viewer.

POWERFUL.\nLuca Guadagnino, Timothee Chalamet, and Armie Hammer artfully capture the essence of the characters Elio & Oliver from Andre Aciman's novel of sexual awakening, self-identity, first love, and love lost.\nThe setting for the film couldn't have been more perfect and the cinematography aesthetically captured the feel of a lazy Italian summer. The soundtrack was a mix of lush melodies, classical pieces and 80's pop that blended seamlessly. Kudos to the costume designers as well for totally nailing 1980's style! LOL\nThe sucess of this film lives or dies on how convincingly Chalamet and Hammer portray the sexual tension that develops between Elio and Oliver....and I have to say they were spot on perfect! Each actor brought the necessary nuances to their respective characters -- Oliver's somewhat brusque confidence compensating for shyness and Elio's insecurities, curiosities and 17-year-old awkwardness. Both were able to speak volumes with a glance, a facial expression, or a subtle body gesture. I was BLOWN AWAY by Chalamet's voiceless performance in the film's final closing minutes -- I felt exactly what he was feeling without a word being uttered.\nI will most definitely be seeing this one again (and adding it to my collection once available)! [5/5]\nP.S. NOTE that this review is based on the film as a stand alone work of art and not a review on how well the novel was converted into a motion picture. There were some disappointing changes and omissions from the novel...but I do not hold that against the powerfully tragic beauty of the finished product.",

It seems that the whole film is such a story of a try of a young bi.I call this film \"countryside graffiti\", not a negative prank, but to show the atmosphere of the whole 2 hours. Every scene goes slowly but clearly. That clearness is what I praise for. When they call each other by their names on the bed, I think my sense comes to the climax as them.Around a open-minded family and a lot of Archaeological knowledge, I like this simple story. Those background settings makes this film more interesting. Although it is not the 1st boy-love movie in my mind, it can still be added to my top 10 list.In the end, Oliver calls back to Elio, telling him he's married. In that moment, the acting of the young Chalamet is very awesome. His sorrowful stare just like a spear piercing into my heart. So touched.",

Nothing about the film breaks reality, like so many do. Everything is natural and real. The dialogue is beyond believable and the cinematography is perfect. Completely perfect.This is a universe you want to sink into. It's a comfortable story to breathe in.I took one point off for some minor issues; the film truly deserved upwards of a 9- perhaps a 9.5 or 9.7.I thought that the relationship between Oliver and Elio developed a bit suddenly, and there should have been a touch more rampup on Oliver's part.Additionally, some of the relationships between the family and friends were a bit unclear.

The hot silent days of the summer were very well expressed on the day by day. The slower pace of living life enjoying the moment enjoying the view away from the rush of communication through our modern smart phones and internet was greatly expressed and gave a sense of nostalgia. The core love story is just as sweet as it is sad. The touch and go by the main protagonists the apparent calm period and then the climactic engagement of a loving relationship which inevitably comes to an abrupt end, was just so touching and real. The movie expresses very well the reality of such relationships in the time that it is set, the 80's. Definitely a must watch, two thumbs up for me!",

The first problem is that Guadagnino pretty much \"re-made\" Bertolucci's Stealing Beauty. The differences: the girl is a boy, the love interest is 20 years older AND he also become this hero that restore his \"religious faith\" which I found very peculiar in a romantic movie. Superb acting by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, he IS the movie. Best scene? When he play Bach at the Piano. The photography is also excellent and overall the movie is as good as the horrendous message it carries: it's ok for a kid to \"come of age\" by exploring sexuality with an adult, not only, but with mum and dad blessing. I have NOT read the book, but it's redondant and borderline offensive the father's speech about his regrets of not having tried. The movie also, maybe inadvertently, underline the predatory image of Hammer. His grooming the kid in the movie is frightening. The idillic bucolic scenery of Tuscany where orchards and the smell of apricots almost slow time and create this \"intellectual's paradise\" it's very trite and cliche'. The editing poorly done. Not a movie I would put on the market, and definelty not a movie I would nominated to an Oscar.",

The acting is brilliant and feels almost not like acting any more, the story is as simplistic as it is down to earth,nothing feels contrived, imagined or exaggerated.

            "content": "I have to start by commending the people who decided to bring this story to the movie screen for their ballsiness, particularly at a time where such topics as age uneven relationships can be cynically distorted into inappropriate behavior due to the ongoing trail of notorious misdemeanors recently made public within the artistic community. I found \"Call me by your name\" to be a beautiful and endearing summertime love story between Elio and Oliver, two individuals who develop an intense relationship knowing it's risky, socially unwelcomed and ultimately with a close expiration date. In my opinion, if there's anything worse than unrequited love, that's impossible love.A kind of lighter \"Lolita\" tale, emotionally deeper and less crude. It's also a tale of self exploration, of letting feelings run free and of seizing the moment. The \"American Pie\" moment took it a bit too far for me, but I guess if you're going to be realist and provocative you might as well go all the way.The surroundings are evocative and idilic: 80\u00b4s countryside Italy. Beautiful architecture, bucolic environment and gorgeous lightning amount to magnificent camera shots and natural scene locations, playfully combined with a nice playlist of contemporary pop music. The setting appeared to me, at first, a little too pretentious: wealthy, cultivated jewish family who switch from Italian speaking to French, English and even German; art, literature, classical music and apparently not a single worry in the world. It's probably just jealousy. But in the end, what a nicer world this would be if all parents were like Ellio's. What a loving relationship and what a sensible, encouraging yet tender speech his father gives him towards the end of the film.The cast does an amazing job, from the stunning Timothy Chalamet, to a great Arnie Hammer and sweet sweet Michael Stuhlbarg and Amira Casar. I have to admit I haven't read the book but I'm gonna guess this was a pitch perfect adaptation of its dialogues and scenes.I believe this is a movie for the open-minded, the mature, the nostalgic and the romantic.

Their strong love and jewish life perspective set the tone, specially, when it comes to Elio, their adolescent son and his unease of being intellectually and sexually attracted to a brilliant young man, Oliver, which they admire and joins the family for some time, being mentored by Elio's father, Prof.Perlman, a historian and anthropologist specialized in ancient Art.\nThe rhythm of the piano is marked by the sounds and the beautiful landscape of the blooming Italian countryside, filled with apricots, fresh meals and sunny days.\nThey ride bikes, swim in ponds, hike, meet French girls, write, love and discuss philosophy and music in several languages. There's a complete support to find love and have a good human life experience, whithout any moral judgement, by the great and mature parents.\nBut suddenly passion, lust and human frailties take place and they find each other completely lost in a love blossom. It's like a snapshot and Oliver has to leave eventually, but good experiences become part of who we are and change us forever.\nFinally, the movie exposes the human doubts and thrills involving love and sex, somehow reflecting the thoughts and feelings of Elios's late adolescence and most recent personal discoveries.",

My hats off to the cinematography which makes the lovely Italian country feel like a familiar place, even if you have never visited Italy or the country. If you are hesitant about watching this because of the subject matter, rest assured the film focuses on the coming of age of a young man just coming into his own. There are some passionate sex scenes at the end when the relationship fully blossoms, but within the context it's not over the top or unnecessarily gratuitous.

Elio is a 17 year old boy while Oliver is probably over 24 (Armie Hammer makes the character look much older) and overall their relationship seems a lot like grooming. i'm gonna be honest, when i first watched it i didn't even think about that, i enjoyed the film, cried my eyes out at the end and that feeling was left for many days after; the soundtrack really helped with this one.

Before I saw the film, I was a little aprehensive thinking that it might be slow or that there might not be enough of a story to tell but I cannot say how wrong I was. Two hours and seventeen minutes of raw human emotion was displayed in the film and it was done in the most thoughtful of ways. I will say that one of my favorite parts of the film was watching Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet play his role of Elio. He was stunning in every way possible. He truly brought the character to life, making me not only believe everything he was feeling but making me feel everything. With the help of the script and the cinematography, he took me on an emotional roller coaster that finished with the brutal but brilliant ending of watching him stare into the fire for four minutes with the only other variable being the music. This is now my transition into the perfectly crafted music. The music is another aspect of the film that is my favorite. Every song is smart and makes sense for the scene and for the characters which is extremely impressive. I will forever cherish the music used in this film because of how emotionally attached it is to the characters and to the story. This movie isn't afraid to move slowly and to give the audience time to truly understand how the characters are feeling. The dancing scene is another one of my favorites because of how much time is taken to show Elio's reaction to watching Oliver dance. Genius. Absolute genius.",

It represent the power of love that goes beyond limits and genres.Elio and Oliver, which are the main charachters, played respectively by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer, live a love that at first is characterized by a tormented feeling of attraction and desire which later is lived in its fullness.It is really worth to watch it, an invite to take the real meaning of love that must be lived with corage, in its deepest way and without regrets.",

Their chemestry made the film even more empathic and moving if it weren't enought the brillant screenplay written and perfectly adapted by Aciman sensible book, the legendary James Ivory, whose movie are already timeless as well as this one will be.\nIt's a universal story about first love, empathy, family and coming of age that will blow away it's audiences when it meets it's audiences, which I think EVERYONE, no matter the agem gender, religious beliefs or sexual orientation. A cinematic classic that brings beatutiful shots in the northern Italy and outstanding cinematography. A story of a lifetime.",

            "review_title": "Ist es besser zu reden oder zu sterben? Is it better to speak or to die?",
            "content": "SPOILER: This question, quoted from a French novella (recited in German by his mother) will trigger something in Elio, the 17-year-old son of the Perlman family. This will be the first step towards growing up, at least as far as emotional things are concerned, of which he, he reveals at some point, knows nothing about .\nHe decides to speak. And by actually doing so, namely revealing his feelings to the man who hasn't left his mind since his arrival in his family's holiday villa, he raises the relationship between him and this man to a level that will change both lives. This man is Oliver: an American studen of Jewish faith, like the Perlman family itself, almost ten years older than Elio, beautiful like an ancient statue with a deep and very erotic voice. He spends the summer with the family \"somewhere in Northern Italy\" to help Elios father, a professor of ancient history and art, with his works and, incidentally, get to know the Italian \"Dolce Vita\".\nAbout half of the movie's play time passes until this happens (more than an hour). Until then, the film seduces us with a summer feeling that drips out of all pores in every scene and then breaks our hearts very, very slowly from the second half on. The special thing about this film is that it never puts the love between the two men and also between Elio and his childhood friend Marzia into perspective or makes a comedy about them. The feelings of all these people are taken very seriously. This is not a romantic comedy, even if there are funny moments of course. And it's not a plot-driven drama in the usual sense with dozens of twists and turns! It does not follow the usual hollywood-like pattern: reception, conflict and resolution. None of that here! This is an impressionistic film without much plot except for this very simple love story. We dive into this world at a certain point, live together with the characters. Just lay back and enjoy! A less attentive viewer will probably miss it that something is developping between Elio and Oliver but it happens. A lot is communicated via codes. Nothing is spoken directly. I imagine that some people find that boring over the long distance. I think it\u00b4s great.The whole first part is a single foreplay, seemingly without a goal at first. Both boys also flirt with girls and even after their first kiss, they don't immediately throw themselves into each other's arms. The whole push-and-pull game goes on for quite a while. There is a very nice scene in which Elio Oliver plays various variations of Bach's \"Capriccio (about the departure of his beloved brother)\", which he has assumingly dedicated to his brother. Here Elio dedicates it to his heartthrob. This whole film is full of eroticism, tenderness and symbolism, as the title: \"Call me by your name\" suggests. A kiss in the grass, a hand that touches another, a peach (and no apple!) that gets special attention from both of them. All this is played so beautifully and completely without kitsch, because it has been fought hard for by Elio against his own reason and speechlessness. Everything simply feels right and compelling. Oliver takes Elio under his wing as he doesn't let up. During her first sex he shows a very tender consideration for the younger one, nothing is pushed, both may show their insecurities and nervousness, a very great scene.\nSimply everything about this film is beautiful. But it doesn't seem unnatural or artificial either: The house seems a bit run-down but not spick and span. There are no exaggerated sunsets but nevertheless a beautiful light in every scene. The landscape of Lombardy is beautiful but not spectacular. The family is wealthy, but they don't drive expensive cars or wear extraordinary clothes. They belong to an academic elite, but they also watch idiotic Italian music shows together. Women used to wear sweaty blouses here.\nThe great music, by the way, is always fitting, piano pieces by Bach or Ravel, 80s Italopop music, and three modern pieces by Sufjan Stevens. Really great the song \"Love My Way\" by the Psychedelic Furs: \"...Love my way, it's a new road, follow where my mind goes\" That's the main theme here! But there are also many scenes without music, but only silence and cricket chirping.The actors Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the love-hungry Elio and Armie Hammer as the reluctant Oliver are great. The movie doesn't really give much away what they usually do, where they come from or what they think. Little is said, but looks, gestures and body language say everything what is important at this very moment. The film just lives in the present (summer of 1983). When both are together on screen, there are mainly totals and only rarely close-ups to capture their body language.\nI find Oliver even more interesting than young Elio. In the book of the same name you really learn almost nothing about him. Here he is a real person, who may also show vulnerability and affection in the second half, after he remained rather an erotic projection surface first, although also a few of his characteristics are shown rather casually. Pay attention here to: overflowing egg yolk, gulped down apricot juice and an iconic dance performance in a village disco to the Psychedelic Furs, where Elio can\u00b4t get his eyes off of him.\nThe film also creates something special here: it brings together the universality of a \"first love\" and the pain associated with it, and then also the peculiarities of a gay / queer relationship. As paradisiacal as the whole setting appears, at a second glance it is not at all. Despite all liberality: both boys have internalized that they can express their love only indirectly and cannot live it openly. In public spaces they can hardly hold each other's hands, let alone kiss each other. When Elio shows up with Marzia, who seems to be pretty clear about what's going on in Elio, making out with her, it can happen completely openly. Elio actually boasts about it.\nThere are differences to the book, but many essential elements and scenes have remained the same, especially the melancholic mood. Some things can't be filmed for the cinema at all. The novel is quite graphic about sex. I recommend to read the book to anyone who liked the film. It is told entirely from the first person's perspective by Elio and is more of an introspective and a memory. For me it was even more heartbreaking than the film: Here Elio and Oliver meet again after 15 and 20 years. Here Elio finally realizes that Oliver was the love of his life: \"We had the stars you and I. and this is given once only.\"\nCall Me By Your Name celebrates the beauty of love and above all the beauty of pain without which one has not really lived. It is an ode to our rich European culture back to antiquity, whose ideals resonate here again and again.\nI also had such a summer in Tuscany in 1985 with a youth group, when I was 18: In an old farmhouse run by Germans: Orchards and vineyards, an open kitchen with cooks from the next village, who could be watched preparing the food. We joined a village festival and a local girl asked me to dance with her under the lanterns and everyone could see it. There was a small reservoir neaby where you could go swimming. Someone had a guitar with him and always played when he was in the mood. Once on arrival we phoned our parents, otherwise not any more, there were no mobile phones yet. Everything from Italy that can be seen in the film is real. And I once had an \"Oliver\" who I shared exactly the same first name as myself. So we didn't even had to change it. But all that not at the same time, of course. This film has brought up all these memories. I could empathize with everything.\nI also want to mention another film I saw last year that I love as much as CMBYN: God's Own Country. Also this movie is very sensual and erotic but the setting couldn't be more different. And yet these two films do something that is still quite new in the film: they portray gay love as something natural and beautiful and ennobling. Something that is not controversially discussed, questioned or relativized. This is the ideal where we want to get to in real life",

The script's genius is in its simplicity. The way it encroaches on you. There's no buy in required, no big dramatic moments. It's pure craft. I've read the script. Scripts are to be performed, so its worthy Oscar win for Best Adapted Screenplay is a tribute to the actors and director Luca Guadagnino as much as writer James Ivory, for in other hands it wouldn't have come off as good, and we would have been left without a gem of a film. I can't tell you how much I admire the actors for their note-perfect deliveries. Chalamet is a star.Achingly beautiful, searingly emotive, disarmingly subtle. Outstanding. 9.5/10.",

It didn't convince me about their love and certainly left no mark (even on a gay man). Armie Hammer is cute and all but not the best choice for this role perhaps.The first half when the story was depicted from Eliot's point it was somehow exciting. Took me to my youth very briefly. But later things got kinda messed up and I really lost interest. Particularly the peach scene. I mean seriously wtf? Wish I watched Bridget Jones' diary again. Total waste of 2 hours with nothing really impressive.Sorry but I don't understand all the \"masterpiece\" comments either. Have you seen any other gay romance films at all?

While it may be an independent lower-budget (by today's standards), it never falls short in any area. The cinematography is breathtaking, the locations beautiful, and the music perfection. That being said, the acting is of a caliber seldom seen in cinema. Timothee Chalamet is destined to become the next Laurence Olivier. His talent knowns no bounds and one can only surmise the potential ahead for this stunningly beautiful and multi-talented young man. Armie Hammer proves once again, his matinee idol good looks are only surpassed by his ability to own a character. He embodies this character in mind, body, and soul. The chemistry between these two actors is never forced, but completely believable and natural. This film is destined to be a classic as it is absolute perfection. The viewer becomes lost in this world of 1980's Italy and in the pure emotions of these beautifully written, directed, and acted characters. This is the type of film that deserves to win every award at every competition and is one you certainly do not want to miss.

Summertime as a boy is fleeting, and memories are stored as moments in the mind, open for interpretation and often revisionist. \"Call Me by Your Name\" manages to put you in the film as a spectator, but at the same time, like you can make a difference for the leads in this film and change their history. Although the stars are memorable, it is the tone of the environment that sets the mood, often setting off emotions through careful cinematography and a series of engaging colors with the backdrop of an Italian landscape, mixed with the simplicity of a peach farm. The film focuses on the artistry of classic sculptures and the complex shape of man, but manages to marry those ideas with the fleeting simplicity and harshness of falling in love. The pain follows thereafter, and the \"fly on the wall\" perspective is felt from beginning to end, intentionally, this is a film that will slam you to the ground. I think that as great as the film is, it leaves too many questions about the future of the characters, as being set in 1983, the AIDS epidemic had not yet gone into full swing, and the more sickness you saw within Elio, the more you realized he was the one that was dying. The historical significance of this film far outweighs either acting performance and it should be viewed with an open mind, bigots need not apply. The film shows us that love is love and comes in many forms, and that Elio is confused as to who he actually is, often using females (and fruit) to fulfill his carnal needs at times. The film is hypnotic, emotionally draining, and tragic. Don't expect a happy ending.",

Michael Stuhlbarg's monologue. During which I sobbed so much I had to pause afterwards and I rewound the movie 2-3 times and cried some more.4. The dreamy, wistful way this was shot. It felt like a summer's dream.\nI am not sure I'm sold on Armie Hammer and I'm not sure he was *the best* choice for this movie. I thought maybe he was a bit too old. A bit too straight. He was good, though. His acting is always good. He embodied Oliver and brought him to life. His subtle confidence helped things stay grounded. However, Elio was the star and the journey we took was his, ours, because of what he brought to every scene with Oliver. His uncertainty and insecurity and his purity of feeling was evident in every look and touch and word.To some this might be another love story. And a good one at that. I've seen some say that the praise had much to do with the novelty of it being a gay love story. I disagree. To me, it wasn't just a gay love story but a love story, period. It was two people sharing something beautiful and rare. Finding a soulmate, even if for a short time. It was two beautiful boys with beautiful souls finding beauty in each other and sharing something that will be carried for a lifetime.This movie was written, shot, and acted with care. It's evident that the characters and story were important and treated as such. That is something I wholeheartedly appreciate.I would like to take one last moment to heap every praise known to mankind on Timoth\u00e9e as Olio. He really was that good and could have easily won the Oscar over Gary Oldman imo. And I think Gary Oldman is brilliant, like, who doesn't? I still think that this is a once in a lifetime performance and if he had won, he would've deserved it. Watching his performance was a privilege and I'm so glad he shared it with us. I know I probably seem like I'm heaping superfluous praise on the kid but he really was that good and you won't regret watching this film. You may not love it as much as I do but I don't think you'll be disappointed. It's a simple love story but one that, I think, will strike a chord with so many of us.I'm going to be thinking about this one for a while, I think.",

As a dane I think the locations it was shot really gets the northern Italy vibes in a great way.Would the movie be as touching as it was if Sufjan Stevens music wasn't apart of it?? No absolutely not. \"Mystery of love\" and \"Visions of Gideon\" are two mood setting songs whom basically give you a look into the plot... just listen to the lyrics. They are so great written and composed.Overall please watch this movie it will really change you.",

            "content": "Firstly, I read the book as a result of a bad review it had been given and was intrigued to see why it was getting so many divided opinions. Obsessed with it, I then watched the movie keeping my expectations low as I knew there were parts of the story that wouldn't translate well on screen (Most of the book is told through Elio's thoughts & fantasies), especially as it is a small independent film.However, I was sat stunned for several minutes after the end credits rolled, crying uncontrollably, yet happy and left feeing like this movie cast a spell on me, esp the final moments. This is the best depiction of love and nostalgia I've seen on screen that I felt throughout. There is nothing corny, there is no silly villian. It is at times incredibly poignant, erotic and the chemistry seemed so real that I forgot I was watching a movie. The scenery is stunning and sets the tone to the story. Timothy and Armie really do bring these characters to life in a way I never thought possible, they deserve all the recognition. Some complain there wasn't enough sexuality explored, others complain there was just too much of it. Bore off. Yes it's slow at times, but I can deal with that. As for the lack of solid plot, the characters compensate for that by giving the performances of a lifetime. It's no surprise that Luca wants to make a sequel (of which I'm still in two opinions on).The only other thing I'll add on the apparently controversial age gap is that just because you disagree with some national laws on consent, doesn't make it immoral on all levels. This is one of those things that will always have divided opinions but it's not Luca and Andre's responsibility to provide everyone an idea of what is or isn't right in everyone's eyes.Whether people enjoyed this or not, it seems that almost everyone agreed that the father's monologue makes the story the masterpiece that it is. Do yourself a favour and watch it. This is far better than what actually won the best picture. Way better. Thank goodness someone gave it a bad review otherwise I would never have discovered it. I watched it twice in two days. See it for yourself.",

            "content": "I do not think I have ever enjoyed a film so much! Being a 17 year old myself, the character of Elio really inspired me; he inspired me that it very well is better to speak than to die. This film beautifully portrayed the slow burning of a love between teenager Elio, and graduate student Oliver. I love that it was slow at first, it really went into depth of their lives in Northern Italy, it made me feel like I was right there, living with them. The film was shot so nicely, it focused on the small details of everything, nothing was just left in the background; everything added to the atmosphere of the story. I now feel like I have been to Italy, and I now want to visit again, but for real this time.The way everything happens in the film, I just adore so much. I love their relationship, they care so much for one another, as to why when they part at the train station, it is so utterly heart-wrenching. The cracking of Elio's voice while he is on the phone with his mother gets me every time- I have watched the film three times now, and I do not plan on stopping there. Overall, I have to say, the book was perfectly adapted into this film. There may have been some things not included from the novel, but some of those things are just hard to include in a movie, which I understand. One of the things I loved most, as did everyone else I am sure, was Mr. Perlman's speech towards the ending, to Elio. It really opened my eyes up, so wide, that I started crying because everything that he was saying was so beautifully said and it inspired me to already start living my life differently. I have never felt this much emotion from a film, ever, and that is what I love most about it.",

The two other guys thought it was just ok. My wife said it was ok, but was very disappointed based on the hype surrounding it. I thought the movie absolutely sucked and I would have left the theatre if I could have. At least four of us would have switched the film to something else if we were watching it at home simply out of sheer boredom. Everyone agreed that Armie Hammer looked too old, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet too young not to be creeped out by pedophilia issues. Chalamet's character is supposed to be 17, which would make Hammer's actions illegal in some places, and just plain creepy in others. I guess that's why the story takes place in Italy. The film is a pretty picture that combines child sex/romance with very slow pacing, interminable still art shots and the very long run time. I would avoid unless you like slow moving European arthouse flicks with a Lolita like storyline. In fairness, I would give this movie a zero while my wife and friends would give it a 6, hence the 3. I have no idea how it's getting so many 10's. It's probably just because of the gay romance theme. If the child character were a girl, people would probably be giving it much lower scores.",

I had goosebumps after watching a super sensible conversation between the father and son, dialogues were written artistically perfect, performance by Timothee aka Elio was astonishing, it was one of the bests drama I've enjoyed lately.Love, romance and agony between two homosexual men were depicted superbly. Pre intercourse moment between two men, ohhh hoo hoo ... I doubt I've seen a better version before.Score and two songs - 'Mystery of Love' and 'Vision of Gideon' just awesome composition.And, I cannot end without praising the supporting role, by 'Armie Hammer' perhaps, it's the most perfect support ever an actor supported I think \ud83d\ude0a. His body language and dialogue delivery were outstanding. He's the second star of the film, I read somewhere that, there are three stars in Luca Guadignino's beautiful new film: Armie Hammer, Timothee Chalamet and the northern Italian city of Crema.\nAbsolutely \ud83d\udc4d.I do not want to spoil by telling a moment when Armie aka Oliver asked Elio ... ... ...

However, I was so disappointed when I finally watched this film. The film extremely bored me. I was focused on the visuals of the film for a while but I was not invested within the story, at all. I can't say the film is awful, because it's not. The acting is great which I thought would pull me through the film, however this didn't happen. I actually started to check how long the film had left so I could watch something else. Maybe if I watched the film as soon as it came out (without hearing all the hype) maybe I would of liked it more. Just hearing all about the Oscar nominations and positive reviews got me excited and I was so disappointed. As I said the film looks amazing, but the storylines of the film couldn't save it for me.",

There are some really blessed people or at least born under the lucky star. I have in mind director of this movie Luca Guadagnino. Sincerely thank you for a piece of art. This film is a pure poetry - highest of the highest art form/ literature possible. Acting, music, locations, story and how live it is - astonishing. There\u00b4s no feeling it\u00b4s acting, or something staged. Nope. It feels like documentary or like observing all scenes through a CCTV. So incredibly good quality of my time! I\u00b4m so happy true art is coming back to Hollywood. It was long long time ago I wrote review here. And probably negative one. And now I want to read the book even after watching this remarkable film. Good job! And the actors so convincing - I was glued those 2 hours to the screen! Splendid! In the end I just wanted to get up and applause. It\u00b4s really something. Touching and opening some new topics to think about though the topic itself is very old and discussed in all kind of media million times. The way father talks with son. The way mom closes eyes. The way story goes. The way it touches all the strings. It\u00b4s a cinematic poem about the true human being - of what we all consist. Thank you again for a wonderful moment of truth in this busy everyday world.",

            "content": "\"Call Me By Your Name\" is a marvelous meditation on first true love on a gay theme. The director, Luca Guadagnino, has created a film that simply refuses to force anything upon the viewer. The film is a masterful study of direction as observation-of letting things be as they are. Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet is a joy to behold on screen as a coming of age youth in the throws of self-identification and self-legitimization. His late-pubescent struggles with societal constraints and self-inflicted moral dilemmas permeate his nascent feelings for a mid-20s scholar who has come to assist his father at the family's Northern Italy summer retreat. It is an Oscar worthy performance-at once charming, evocative and tender. Armie Hammer's brusque and intelligent performance as the American scholar is also noteworthy. HIs scenes take us by ambush. As hawt as he is to look at, one can't help but be reminded of a rhinoceros charging out of underbrush when his character enters a room. A rare new experience unfolds for these tentative lovers who find themselves in an era (the 80s) of overall non-acceptance. One gets the feeling, too, that this experience as it develops will never again be repeated. Interestingly, the AIDS epidemic does not touch this film. In my opinion, a wise decision by the director who transports us to a place of transcendent beauty, as first love ought to be. Love here is remote, fragile, un-worldly, and yet all-knowing, brave, undeniable. It is difficult to create a film so clear and direct in its depiction of life's ambiguities. I didn't want the film to end. A pleasure through and through.",

It's love with all of that goes with it. The obsession, the crazy joy, the hurt, the first kiss, the last kiss, the sweet touch of a hand on a shoulder, the other people who intrude, or give respite, and all else that goes with it. Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet are the key as to why this film is able to reach its beautiful, emotional, highs and lows. Both are so natural, it almost seems like the viewer is a voyeur, watching their relationship evolve from irritation to irresistible .

And as someone who was a heteroflexible dude who understands perfectly how to like another of my own gender, it's almost inevitable not to have a connection with both of the main characters: Elio & Oliver. What surpised me most was how the film was set on somewhere in the early 1980's or late 1970's... regardles, with that in mind, I was baffled by how good the phasing was! It's not that typical immediate mutual understanding, but a rather twisted overthinking of both sides if they wanted it or not, let alone if they know it or not. And I would like to commend the director and the writers for the flow was thoroughly patient. I felt like there were none of those 'hurry up and be together already' moments, rather, it was shown to the viewers to think what would happen next.Now going to the characters. I love them! Elio, a charming wittyful young lad who has a knack for subtle competition. Oliver, an uncanny unpredictable man who worries for others than his own good. A perfect combination. The intelligent lad trying to figure out the mysterious man who keeps everything under his nose. What about that?!As for the relationship. I'm glad to see it built up from nothing and constantly, slowly, softly and gradualy growing. I thought for sure that they would only do some kissing before Oliver finally goes back to where he came from, but no, an even more bizzare scenarios happened. The euphoria and how two people can have so much fun only by themselves. Yet, in the end, as most similar relationships to them, do end up in a heartbreaking farewell.And then there's the ending, Elio finally gets to talk to Oliver when winter fell but learns that he is already betrothed to another who he has been going on and off for three years. The look on his face, knowing that he is mad, angry, frustrated, all emotions blue, yet he must keep it on the down low. At first he was just that, then as the credits roll, we can see his expression getting more calm by the minute and finally a smile appeared, as if he was ready to accept the fact that it is what it is. He tumbled unto his thoughts and tears until his mother called him up back to the reality, facing away from the camera as if telling the audience that it is over.Call Me by Your Name (And I'll Call You by Yours) is ridiculously well written and is a marvelous film indeed. Rating it 8.5/10 in my book. I can say I would watch this film again if given a chance.",

I walked out of this film feeling a lot of emotions, both sadness and happiness. Thanks to both the actors and its production, its remains authentic in nature and never goes off into unrealistic tangents. Its production is minimal, allowing for the emotional portrayals of the characters to speak loud and in great depth. Armie and Timothee were both brilliant, so good that you can feel that strong lust between them and the utter anguish when that is taken away. It is really captivating to watch for its lengthy runtime.However my favourite scene was when Elio's father speaks to him on the couch, sharing a poignant lesson he'd learnt from his own life after baring witness to his own son's 'close friendship' with Oliver. This echoes into Elio's phone call to Oliver at the film's conclusion. Theres a real sense of desire and heartache. It speaks in a lot of truths, the great loss of innocence and realisations at the hands of a man with such maturity and brilliant-knowingness, and the strength to lust through restricted circumstances.Beautiful film!",

The scenery and aesthetics are more than captivating- they are so beautiful that every shot is worth taking in. This film transported me to Northern Italy in 1983, it truly made me feel like I was there. Another aspect of this movie that is spot on is the soundtrack. The upbeat piano that plays in the background of many of the scenes also creates a feeling of nostalgia for a time that we, as the viewer, may or may not have even experienced. As someone who hadn't seen the trailer, from the beginning of the movie, I was continually wondering if anything would actually happen between Elio and Oliver. The way this movie is filmed and the script given to it builds the tension between the two characters with a lot of care and attention to detail. The performance of Elio by Timothee Chamalet is breathtaking- the viewer can feel his inner struggle with the idea of wanting something so bad, yet wondering whether it's okay to desire what he does. The conversation between Elio and his father at the end is also one that stays with the viewer. It is heart wrenching, and reminds us how important it is to treasure a love like this when we have it, because we don't know how long it will last, or if we will ever come across love like it again. The last few minutes of the film and into the credits is, to me, one of the most heart wrenching parts of the whole movie. \"Visions of Gideon\" by Sufjan Stevens plays in the background as we see Elio sobbing by the fireplace. Chalamet's performance here is stunning, the emotion in his eyes and his face is so real that the viewer feels it too. My only reservation with this film is that the main character is 17, while Oliver is 24. The age difference here, along with the fact that Elio is a minor, is unsettling. Otherwise, this movie is a must-see.",

A 24-year-old can love a 17-year-old, but he should love the minor in an adult way, instead of sleeping with him when he knows exactly he would get married at the end.

            "content": "'Call Me By Your Name', a film about first love and heartbreak. The cinema where it was showing was packed for a festival that this was a part of. This film is tipped for the Oscars and I can well see why. It is a mature film set in 1983 in Italy and perfectly captures a boy's first love and heartbreak in losing that love. It does it without mushy sentimentality, just truth. The final scene were the credits role and the camera concentrates on the boy's face for 6 minutes as you see the heartbreak set into his features will surely go down as one of the great cinematic moments ever captured on film. In many ways this film is challenging, in that it portrays a love affair between an older man (mid to late 20s) and a teenage boy of 17. But the emotion expressed in such an honest way could apply to anyone gay or straight and audiences are flocking to see it. Both of their lives are messy and it's not straight forward, the older man is quite unlikable and arrogant and it's only as their affair starts that you see the real person blossom. The boy has his first sexual encounter with a girl from his town. But the empathy of his father and acceptance of his son's great love, a love that the father says he never had nor never will, pushes this film beyond mere stereotypes and clich\u00e9. The final sequence will leave you emotional, if you have ever had your heart broken at a young age you will see the truth in the boy's face and be grateful that the boy takes his father's message of 'feel the pain, don't bury it, treasure it'. If it wins an Oscar it is well deserved.",

A 17-year-old named Elio played by Timothee Chalamet begins to find himself becoming more interested over his father's assistant Oliver. The movie is absolutely beautiful as you see Elio and his character development in this movie. The soundtrack to the movie is insane, everything goes in harmony. This is a very emotional, heart fluttering, raw, and genuine movie. The actors are absolutely amazing in the movie, You can really feel deeply for each character in the movie. There are very few to words to none that does justice to describe this piece of art. It is beautiful, divine, and the scenery of northern Italy is surreal.

            "content": "Even though it's filmed where I live, I waited a long time to watch this because I usually don't like romantic movies. I have to say it surprised me. Someone would say it's really slow and nothing really happens, but I found it a movie full of heart and care for details. The love story is finally a credible one, where people have quirks and a natural way to get close. It's rare to see a movie where a love story and dialogues don't seem artificial. In every detail you can see that the director and everyone involved wanted to create something special. There is a scene in which they wake up at dawn with an open window, and you can hear exactly what I hear from my window at dawn, the cuckoo and the bells and the light, that made me feel so nostalgic and so immersed in the rainy atmosphere that it was like being there. The speech at the end by Elio's father is beautiful too. It's not rhetoric or banal like most movies do these things when they want to be dramatic, it's absolutely moving and smart and exactly what an amazing parent should be. The delicate love of the parents is one of the nicest ever seen in movies, a true model for every parent out there. The only thing I can say, is that Armie hammer looks a bit too old for 24, I would have preferred a younger-looking actor, but then everything is so well made you don't notice it anymore. Timothee chalamet is sensational in this one, my favorite performance from him till now. For the people saying that everyone can make a nice picture with Italy, maybe it's true, but as someone from here I want to say that most of the movies set in Italy completely miss the atmosphere, making everything seem artificial and fake. Mind you, this happens with many if not most Italian movies too. Not in this one, everything is special because it feels so real and exactly the atmosphere of summer around here.",

I didn't give 10 stars only for two reasons. There were some parts or episodes or moments that i fund unexplained or unnecessary or meaningless or not connected well in editing or the continuity of film. other reason is the coming of Oliver. He looked arrogant. It looks like he knew that in the house was a guy, gay, who wanted his attention etc etc. He was acting all the time with so much confidence about these gay feelings between them. The confidence was mixed with his knowledges about his profession and gay feelings. All the time he was treating Elio not in normal way that somebody would treat someone in these positions. It was a big exaggerated his attitude toward to this teenager Elio who knew almost nothing about sex and Elio was also exploring and facing a lot with opposite sex and thats too much for both roles.",

Not only is this movie cinematically beautiful, but finally, a movie where the main idea is the depiction of a great love story between two people who are attracted to each other and have such a fiery passion for one another that anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, can either long for or relate without it being cliche and overportrayed in the entertainment industry.\nSecondly, i really liked the subtle way it dealt with topics related to being homosexual, from the discovery of ones sexuality to the choice of (for lack of better words) \"staying in the closet or getting out of it\" as well as the immense role family support plays in it.\nFinally, I liked how organic the ending was, especially considering that the movie does take place in 1983. No tragedy, no exagerations like many movies that represent the community do; just an ending full of feelings and emotions that each and everyone ought to feel at some point in their life.",

Initially, it was unclear to me why Oliver (Armie Hammer) was visiting Elio's (Timothee Chalamet's) family for the summer. That became somewhat clearer as the movie progressed.What strikes me is the gentleness of this film. Oliver is sincerely concerned that he has not offended Elio. It is apparent Oliver fears he has crossed a line; but, he has not. The emotion of concern, anxiety and some element of fear is portrayed superbly. There is a level of magnificent innocence and precociousness in Elio that is precious; and, so adolescent! Where Oliver clearly had \"dabbled' in his past, this was a whole new experience for Elio.The most impactful moments for me were at the very end, where Elio's father says without saying it that he \"knows\" Elio had an affair with Oliver. The sheer compassion and love, the absolute absence of judgmentalism, is astonishingly portrayed. Many a gay youth would be greatly blessed to have as a father one who is so understanding; even, somewhat jealous of what his son has experienced with another man. For me, this is not a one view only movie. The music scores are absolutely supreme! Truly GREAT!",

He was a solid character, and a solid dad figure that was very kind to his son and to others as well. Though his last speech to elio made no sense.

The feeling of desire of the main characters is so pure and gentle which made me pretty satisfied to watch it. It comes naturally, step by step. By exploring the area they live in and spending time for talking about art and life they start getting to know each other. It works like a binder, but they're not sure what every and each of them really wants. There's a time when they did and that's what really matter about their relationship. It had better to be remembered about times the plot takes place - it's 80s and it's a hard period for an unconventional love. The end of the movie is sorrowful and tough for, I think, both of them. Oliver is older and seems to get used to reality of the world he lives in, but he still has a hope. On the other hand, Elio is much younger and inexperienced. He's full of hope as well, but his hope is related with naiveness what turns out exacatly at the end. \"Call me by your name\" is an one of these movies which deeply moved by its form and gentleness. The history of those men urge me to think straight, but also remember who we really are. I couldn't forget about the soundtrack which fits as a glove to the movie. The film director - Luca Guadagnino - has done a great job and so have the actors. Thank you for such a poignant piece of art!",

Oliver will get married and may or may not live happily ever after, depending on whether or not he is caught cheating on his wife with some pubescent lad he has decided to call by his name. There was too much here that for me didn't ring true. Elio wasn't particularly likeable. I had the feeling that his intelligence and talent were necessary in order that Oliver not come across as borderline pedophile.

I don\u00b4t know what adjectives should i use to describe this, it is so sensual, erotic and beatiful. The cinematography is gorgeous, with some beatiful landscapes of Italy (and also a lot of culture!). The sondtrack is really great and worth listening more than once, including the Sufjan Steven\u00b4s songs. What can i say about the acting? Timothee Chalamet was just perfect as Elio, he is outstanding and is probably getting many awards; i can\u00b4t wait to see him in other movies. Armie Hammer as Oliver was great too! They both have excellent chemistry and the dialogues between them are perfect. I haven\u00b4t read the book yet but Luca Guadagnino made an excellent job, and i am sure that is greatly adapted. What i liked the most about this film is that it doesn\u00b4t bring up the typical homophobia or AIDS plot, is just the romantic story we deserved, and every single minute is worth the watch. It will probably become a classic in the future. I won\u00b4t spoil the ending, but i gotta say that is just so overwhelming and heartbreaking at the same time.

            "content": "I am sorry to dry somebodys well-earned tears but I didn't find this especially touching. I usually like these artsy gayfilms e.g Maurice, Brideshead, Brokeback Mountain etc. but this is not very good on portraying characters. The actors all look like passive onlookers not active partisipants on their own life! This is especially true on character of Oliver. We really don't know anything about him. His past, his hopes, dreams or his imner feelings. What makes him tick?\n And Elio. He is just a sullen teenager with a boring life. Walks around in his boxers looking for something. Usually at 17 you know If you are homo or hetero or something in between. Besides, in 1983 guys were wearing briefs.\n And this peach scene... Every man knows that you can not do this to a peach. You only end up with sticky mush. Unless you have a very small penis - the size of a matchstick. And why is Oliver eating the peach? Is this one way of saying I Love Thee Always? There are more subtle ways of saying that. Now it is something out of Ed Wood,jr's imagination. \n These two lovers are never actually in love. They are just having sex and fooling around. Only little tenderness but mostly Oliver is giving Elio a cold shoulder. And he is sometimes even putting him down, like in the interrupted oral sex scene. I hope he is treating his girlfriend better or their marriage won't last.\n It is hard to find the last crying scene touching. What is Elio missing? His cold-hearted lover or his virginity? Or his lovely peach? Words of his father are good but they belong to a different movie, where we end up caring about the characters.\n One thing that could have made this movie is If they had the balls to make Elio a 15 year old. Boys of that age usually try everything for a size, including peaches. But had they done it, the cryers would start roaring and crucifying everybody connected with this film. That is how we have evolved, sadly.",

The scene that most surprised me is their flirting by playing piano. I don't really know classic music, so I can't imagine that scene when I read it. And another scene I loved is the final scene: Elio stared at the fire and wept. And I also love the scene that Elio expressed his love to Oliver. Anyway, Timoth\u00e9e has really good acting skill, and I truly wish he can win the Oscar. I think the directing is pretty good, but what dissatisfied me is the screenplay. Actually, my favorite scene is gone, the scene that Elio gave Oliver a book as a gift. For you in silence. But I really enjoyed the soundtrack, although it didn't be nominated for the Golden Globe.",

This summer romance between teenager Elio and grown up Oliver happens so smooth, beautiful, and relax. When thousands of movies is about straight teenagers' adolescence experience, \"Call Me By Your Name\" portrays the perfect childhood of Elio. Comparing to Brokeback Mountain, this movie focus more on the happiness to the struggle. In fact, the sweetness and romance of this movie redefine the concept of gay movie, since gay movie always focus on the pressure of the outside world and love between the two. The fact that Elio lives in open minded family that supports his feelings is surprisingly different from other gay movies. The presence of \"Call Me By Your Name\" also proves that people nowadays have a new level of understanding or homosexual relationship, and proves that it be just relax and sweet as any other relationship. Oliver and Elio is beyond sexulity, age, and experience, and significantly indicates that love is above everything. Even though Oliver eventually leaves Elio and gets married, this experience is still lasting forever,",

            "content": "I enjoyed the movie, but found myself unmoved by it. I am a gay man, and cried in real life at the loss of a love as a young man, similarly to the way Timothee Chalamet does at the end of the movie. When the lights came up, the friend I saw it with, also gay, was in tears. For him, the movie dredged up powerful emotions connected to similar events from his life. So what didn't work for me?As the movie progressed, I found the permission granted to grad student Oliver by Elio's parents to be just too precious to be believed. Everything seems to conspire to relieve Oliver of responsibility for indulging his passion for a vulnerable younger man, including Elio taking the first (and several) overt courtship steps. The story seemed to be clumsily and observably removing any potentially taboo elements in order to give Oliver permission for the romance. By doing so, it flattened the tension for me, and reduced the romance to a clich\u00e9. Even though the age of consent is lower in Italy, Elio is depicted with all the badges of minority; a student, living with his parents, inexperienced in his feelings toward men. Oliver is older, practiced at seduction with women at least, a grad student/ guest in the home. So a taboo relationship, or at least some unethical guest behavior is set up. But the parents' permission, broadcast long before the \"father-son\" talk scene, removes all the gates, flattening any dramatic tension. So the relationship could have been between two 17 year olds, or two 24 year olds, without the feint at taboo. I found myself laughing at the story as it unfolded. It wants to be both naughty and PC at the same time. Similarly to how I thought about \"Carol\" with Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara after seeing it; I wondered if this wasn't a same-sex romance and otherwise showed me two characters dealing with love and loss, would I care about these characters? Or I they only interesting because of the still-novel twist of same-sex love in a mainstream movie? On that score, I found Timothee Chalamet to be a good actor, channeling desire and loss, but Elio is not that interesting a character. And both Armie Hammer and Oliver struck me a pieces of preppie furniture with no inner life detectable.Finally, even Michael Schulberg's father-son talk at the end struck me as the ending of an afterschool special or \"a very special episode of Blossom.\" Of course, I wish someone had spoken to me that way when I was a teenager. maybe I'm resentful no one did. But I'm back to the word \"precious\".  The Italian scenery was lovely, however.",

Additionally the Musical choices and songs made for this movie are beautiful and perfectly fitting to the story.After watching this film I was questioning reality as this image of such a beautiful moment which seemed so real was yet not.

            "content": "I heard about 'Call Me By Your Name' two years ago, when it was making its rounds at the festivals, garnering some serious praise. For some reason, though, I never watched it. Until now. And all I have to say, is I wish I would have seen it sooner.This film is a near masterpiece. It's set pieces, the cinematography, the acting, the soundtrack, the dialogue - it all pours together to make you feel not like you are watching it, but like you are living it. Feeling it. It seems less as if you are watching Elio and Oliver, and more as if you are Elio and Oliver. You feel all the emotions they are feeling. You go through this exploration with them, through this deep, passionate, all too short love affair, with them. And you experience it all as if you were feeling it yourself.The pacing and structure of this film is so far unlike \"the norm\" and I believe that is why it feels so real, and so surreal at the same time. Things move slowly and then quickly - because for Elio and Oliver, their relationship froze the world around them, but at the same time, was over before it truly began.I believe the third act of this film is without flaw. We finally witness the two lovers embrace who they are, and are able to have their own getaway together, a part of the film which actually breezes by. I think the small amount of footage we actually get from their trip is resembling of how fleeting it feels to them. The final act contains 5 of the most emotional and heart wrenching scenes I have seen in recent memory.The first is Elio and Oliver's goodbye.\nThere is really no dialogue here, and no need for it. Their embrace conveys all their emotions. And when Oliver goes to walk away and Elio pulls him in, it perfectly communicates his desire to hold on to what they have.\nThe second is when Elio calls and asks his mother to pick him up, and on their car ride home there is no dialogue, not even music, just the sound of the road. Yet the emotion screams in this simple scene. A heartbroken boy fighting back tears, and his mother consoles him with a simple stretched out hand.\nThe third is when Elio arrives home and speaks to his father. Michael Stuhlbarg delivers the best supporting cast monologue of 2017. He subtly informs Elio he knows about his relationship with Oliver and that he is thankful his son could experience such emotions and such friendship. He then confides in his son that he, too once had someone to call him by his name, but was too scared, and unable to act on his feelings. He then encourages his son not to kill his pain, because in doing so, it would kill the joy he also felt.\nThe fourth is after a time jump where it fast forwards to a winter day, and Elio receives a phone call from Oliver.\nOliver calls Elio to break the news that he has been engaged. And you can hear the heartbreak in his voice. Elio suspects this is why Oliver calls, but Oliver sounds devastated to have to tell him this. \"Elio. Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio\" whispers Elio. And after a long pause Oliver whispers back \"Oliver..... I remember everything.\"\nThe fifth and most gut wrenching scene is also the final scene of the film.\nAs soon as their conversation ends, Elio walks into the dining room and squats by the fire. He stares blankly into the flames - as Visions of Gideon by Sufjan Stevens plays in the background - with tears forming in his eyes.\nHe stays this way as the end title card appears. He remains unmoved, except to wipe his tears away, as his family prepares for dinner. The lyrics \"I have loved you for the last time\" \"was it a video? was it a video?\" Repeat themselves. You can all but see Elio replaying every encounter, every laugh, every embrace, every memory he had with Oliver. As a fly lands on him, he does not break his gaze, in this very moment, you are Elio, and you truly feel his pain. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is agonizingly perfect in this sequence.In conclusion, I loved this film. And perhaps my favorite thing about it is that I assumed it was a movie about love, or about a secret affair, I kept waiting for something to go wrong, for them to be found by Elio's parents. But I was wrong. This film is not about love, but about heartbreak, and you don't even see it coming until the last 25 minutes. And in those last 25 minutes there is enough emotion to last an entire lifetime of films.",

Love - in this case - not desperate and torturing, but light and beautiful. Beautiful. I think this is the key word to describe the film.

There was hardly any worth while character building and by the end of it I felt like I hardly knew the characters. The movie was mostly about the sexual relationship between a 17 year old boy and a middle aged man maybe in his 30's. Romantic fluffy scenes were short, awkward and felt forced. There was little worthwhile plot to it. \nThe whole movie left me questioning how much longer there was left and the only part I enjoyed was the end, not just because it meant the movie was over but because it gave us the most amount of plot we'd been given throughout the whole thing. The ending would've been better in the middle of the movie and based it off of there. \nI felt very bad for the girls in the movie who had been lead on.\nCould've done a lot more in the time it took to watch this movie, but felt like I couldn't bail on my friends, they didn't like it either I found out at the end. I also feel like it wasn't a very good interpretation of gay characters especially with the 0 dysphoria even though the movie was supposed to be about finding himself. Thought it might be good because of the extremely high ratings, very very disappointed.",

            "content": "Call Me By Your Name directed by Luca Guadagnino was a very interesting film to me. The general plot is that Oliver (Armie Hammer) goes to stay at a northern Italian villa owned by professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his wife Annella (Amira Casar) to work on his doctorate for the summer. While he is there, he meets Elio (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), the 17 year old son of Mr. & Mrs. Perlman. At the beginning, Elio isn't very fond of Oliver and finds him 'arrogant', but soon comes to find that his initial dislike for Oliver is rooted in something much more complex; something that both Elio and Oliver struggle to admit. The settings are completely gorgeous. I loved the 'feel' of their sets for northern Italy, and it has actually inspired me to potentially visit there some day. There's just something about their quiet and secluded town that I found extremely beautiful.The acting and script were decent, sometimes average. I wouldn't say the film's acting is horrible, but I wouldn't call it superb either. However, I felt the chemistry and emotion was there when it counted. I thought Timothee Chalamet as Elio was the stand-out performance, and he really made the film for me. Also, this film didn't need superb acting in order to for it to capture my attention. Once I started watching the film, I fell in love with the characters, regardless of acting. If it was BAD acting, THEN I wouldn't be able to get over it. But at the same time, there are so many things in acting, that I would say it is more of the verbal acting that was average, where as the facial expressions, body movement, pacing, etc. was all very good, and it kept me interested in the two main characters, Elio and Oliver.There wasn't much to the plot ... two men, exploring their sexuality under a shroud of secrecy. I don't think this movie is really one you watch for an intriguing and complex plotline ... it's pretty straight forward, and it's more about the development of a relationship as it pertains to its characters rather than the development of its characters in relation to its plot. I don't know if that really makes sense ... for example, instead of the movie being focused on developing characters independently, this film felt as though we were meant to focus on the growth of the relationship wherein the characters developed with one another. I felt like that direction was correct. It's not like there is NO character development, just that it's not the main focus of the film. Maybe some of you consider their relationship as the plot, which is true, so hopefully you can still understand me. Overall, I really liked the film. To the point where I shed a single tear - I hardly ever cry, and not even concerning just movies, but life in general. I felt a lot for these characters, especially for Elio. If I wanted to rate the film personally, I would give it a 9/10. But I wanted to rate it somewhat objectively. I read some of the other reviews, and a lot of people didn't really like it. I can understand that. If you don't feel a connection between Elio and Oliver, I don't think you will like the film that much. But if you can find that connection, and if you enjoy looking into the complexities of intimacy and sexuality, you will probably enjoy this film. I already plan to see it again. It reminded me of Maurice, the novel by E.M Forster, which I adore. This movie is definitely going to be one that I will re-watch over and over again.",

Given the 45 minute drive each way to find a cinema playing this, that's a total of 4 hours of my life I cannot get back.If you've seen more than three art house films (all of which will be better than this) you'll be bored out of your mind. The only people who would give this a 10/10 would be \"I've just seen my first art house film\" newbs, the director's parents, or the director himself, Luca Gaudagnino, who I'm sure spent every moment between takes practising his Oscar acceptance speech. Pretentious (another reviewer here nailed it - \"smug and self congratulatory\"), dull, aimless, confused, no stakes, no conflict, no structure... I could go on. And I will.The director was so painfully in awe of how avant garde his film was - yet it really wasn't. All this talk of how \"sensual\" and \"sumptuous\" the film was - it's just not there. It really isn't. So the kid jizzed into a peach. Is that it? American Pie did that fifteen years ago, and it wasn't pretending to be avant garde.There is an expression in poker - don't fall in love with your cards - meaning, don't fall so in love with how amazing you think your hand is that you stop paying attention to what the other players have. And in this case the director fell so in love with his film he forgot to think of the audience, and crafting well turned story points for them.Zero chemistry between the two male leads - Armie looked nervous as hell and the kid was dull. The only person I cared about was the female love interest, played by Esther Garrel - excellent acting on her part. Another classic rookie mistake - not knowing when to end! There were three different endings. And this was after a 5 minute eulogy on heartbreak from the father, who made the same point in about 6 different ways - WE GET IT, \"feel the pain of heartbreak\". I could see Luca behind the lens at this point, mouthing out the words to his Oscar speech.Speaking of the parents - they were cool with this? \"Oh hey Armie Hammer, giant late 20s man staying in our house in a professional context... please have our tiny 17 year old son as your sexual plaything for the summer\". What?If this was indeed an Imdb campaign to hype up the score and sell tickets, please think about the people on the other end - who gave up hours of their precious life to have you take to their brain cells with a rubber mallet.If you want \"sumptuous\" and \"sensual\" go eat a mango. It'll save you fifteen bucks.",

For me, CMbYN reminds me of first love and exploring and discovering your partner. As many have said this isn't a gay love story, rather a love story. When it comes to coming of age films, this is the top of the line. Films like \"Boyhood\" many can connect with, but not all. CMbYN is a coming of age movie that we can all connect with. It reminds of us of our first love and those feelings that you never want to leave, and the pain that you feel when they do. It brings on the emotion of knowing that you couldn't feel so unhappy if you had not been so happy, showing us true emotion. Call Me by Your Name is a film that will stick with my for a long time and I will think of it everyday as I have already since I saw it days ago.",

He brought the character alive and perfectly interacted with other casts.There are also problems with the scripts. Several important plots were crossed off in this film, such as, the most crucial and conspicuous one, the peach eating scene. Even if I didn't read the novel, I would consider this plot indispensable, for it signifies the sublimation of the relation between Elio and Oliver. Without this scene, it is like that the film failed to reach the vertex while it was supposed to.Nevertheless, the file itself is still brilliant and touching by successfully protraying the beautiful Italian countryside and the minutia of the life of a 17 boy falling in love the first time in his life.",

            "content": "This movie is bound to resonate with many young people struggling with adolescent crushes and identity questions--as well as with adults reflecting on their own identity development.Timothy Chalamet is convincing, with androgynous charm that melds innocence and yearning and passionate intensity. Setting aside the vapid expectation that a movie directly correspond to a book, I think we can overlook the apparent age discrepancy between Armie Hammer and the character he portrays. Hammer's more mature Oliver suits and shapes the movie. And he does it well, with the kind of insouciant regard for young Ellio that might be expected for an adult indulging himself in a ripe peach or an unexpected tryst with a young man slightly more than half his age.Some bits stand out. Would that we all had fathers like Ellio's, played by the estimable Michael Stuhlbarg, who give us room to explore our identities without judgement. Yet it cannot be overlooked that Ellio's identity struggle, his fear of being caught, his yearning to be with (and belong to) Oliver happens despite his father's calm acceptance. Perhaps we are to learn that the deep existential angst of adolescence is inevitable, even if we have supportive families--though how much harder it would have been had Ellio's father responded with rage and violence, as so many young people continue to experience.It is in this context of Ellio's adolescent ego development that the title of the movie raises complex questions. What are we to make of such a highly intelligent adult, with his own well-established identity, who tells his young lover to \"call me by your name\"? Is Oliver seeking to reclaim some part of his own youthful identity by switching identities? Or is he knowingly stroking the younger man's natural predisposition to see himself at the center of the universe? Perhaps both. Either way, life--and ego development--go on for Ellio, and the pain of Oliver's ultimate betrothal to a woman marks an inflection point in his path to adulthood.",

The acting by Armie Hammer (Oliver) was awful, wooden, absolutely Shatner-like. Plot and character development were virtually non-existent. The two protagonists were thrown together arbitrarily and for no apparent reason just start acting awkwardly and then for some reason pawing at each other. I never for a moment bought into the attraction between the two. You could see them acting a mile away. I literally could not sit thru the whole movie. This is in direct contrast to Being 17, the epitome of this genre. The photography was simply sublime. The character development was lovingly drawn out in exquisite detail - Thomas' love of the mountains and his defensive loneliness, Damien's scholastic ambition and his growing feelings for Thomas. You could feel the tension and attraction developing naturally between the two. The progression of their relationship made perfect sense. It deserved many more awards.",

He was absolutely the wrong actor, mostly it just bugged me he was way too old for the part of Oliver. I also read somewhere that he refused to do certain explicit scenes and I think in this kind of film where the main plot point is romance.. you kinda need it? I think a better actor (and one that looked the part) would've done a better job overall.I was surprised they kept a certain scene in - if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about - since it didn't add anything really to either the book or film (except a lot of reviews from people who were creeped out) but I guess well done to Timothe\u00e9 for not backing out.Cinematography, gorgeous.

He played the piano, his behavior was so fun to watch, and everything that he talked about was so smart. All of these traits made him an interesting character, a character worth to watch.\nAs much as I adored his personality , I fell in love with his development throughout the movie also. Timothee Chalamet's performance was stunning. As a teenager that discovered himself and his sexual desires, Timothee showed the struggles of growing up and learning about \nhis own personality powerfully. His break down because of the shame he felt, the peach scene (and his conversation with Oliver afterwards), and him crying at the end... All of his emotions were so genuine and real that he made me feel the same way as he did.\n(Also his chemistry with Oliver was so good- the sex scenes had a moving dynamism that we don't usually see in love movies so often, and the intensity of the emotions that they managed to convey had a big impact on the success of the movie in my opinion)\nThere weren't several set designs, rather the scenes were shot simply. From only one angle, I saw what I had to, and the simplicity with the angles made the character's performances stand out .\nI think the movie was both emotional and moving. It was real, bittersweet and genuine. It wasn't like a fairytale, it was like a mirror of life, and the way that it showed us the truths about life was so powerful.

Emotions and raw love and sensuality and sexual tension are so strong and powerful and conveyed in such a playful, humorous, delicate way that it took my breath away.There is nothing I can say about this film other than the fact that everyone should watch this. Absolutely everyone. You will never see anything like this again.",

Timothee's performance throughout was just so natural and convincing that I'm tempted to say it was flawless (he should have received the Oscar!). I loved him, and can't wait to see him in The King. I thought Aimee Hammer two rungs below Timothee - somewhat less convincing (in my humble opinion). Just not so natural in the role (maybe intentionally, and he's certainly cute). Michael Stuhlbarg's advice to his son near the end was one of the more surprising aspects of the film - didactic in form, and all the more welcome for that (after all, some good solid instruction in tolerance never goes amiss among our species). What a lucky boy to have such a generous, sensible, plainly loving father! Finally, Michael's smiles, facial expressions and intonations reminded me so much of the great Robin Williams (they could so easily be brothers!) and added even more to the pleasure of the film).",

The two main characters (I think they might both be bisexual), discover throughout the course of the movie that they have a romantic connection. Then one of them leaves. Then the other cries about it. Then his dad says he knew about their relationship and is ok with it. There was no conflict, save the girlfriend breaking up with Elio because he didn't see her for three days. Why is that a reason for breaking up, and why is that the most conflict the movie has? Although, I will say that Elio is very scared to come on to Oliver, and that's part of his character arc. But that's not enough to warrant my interest in the story.2. A couple of shots that were too disgusting. Why were they there? That was silly.3. Nothing much happens in the movie. Many scenes have no effect on the plot. Sadly, I will probably never watch this film again. That this got a Best Picture Nomination over I, Tonya and Blade Runner 2049 is beyond me. Mostly completely BORING Oscar Bait. However, the cinematography and acting is superb. 7/10.",

But Armie Hammer is not convincing as a summer love. For some reason it feels like he is not right for the part. His play is too cold and he lacks a rough edge. On top of that, he seems too old to play this role. \nThe father's scene near the end of the movie made impression on me but the scenes that follow are too cliche to rate this movie high.

The avante garde-ness derives from the fact that it portrays a gay relationship.The two leads struck me as having very little chemistry, but then I'm not a gay male myself, so what do I know? In particular, the impossibly Anglo-handsome Armie Hammer - who, I take it, is related to the baking soda - is a really terrible actor.The Dionysian-curled but weak-chinned Timothee Chalamet is a _better_ actor. We know this because he was in every single movie made last year! (Chalamet also just effectively ended Woody Allen's directing career by making a public announcement yesterday. (Woody Allen hasn't made a good movie for at least a decade, so regardless of how you come down on the Dylan Molestation Issue, this is no great loss.)Towards the end of \"Call Me By Your Name\", there's a completely hilarious scene - though it wasn't actually played for laughs - in which Timothee Chalamet's distinguished archeologist father tells Timothee that the relationship he had with the baking soda heir was a - smirk, smirk! - \"_special_ friendship\", and that he - _Dad_ - had also had a \"_special_ friendship,\" but that alas! it had not been allowed to flower, presumably because of repressive attitudes toward sex in the 1960s.I'm sorry, but attitudes toward sex were _so_ much _less_ repressive in the 1960s than they were in the 1980s when \"Call Me By Your Name\" is supposed to take place.Also, what teenager - gay or straight - really wants to hear old Dad blithering about his sex life?Teenagers _hate_ any intimation of the fact that their parents may be sexual creatures!I mean, they may concede that their parents had to do it _once_ in order to conceive _them_, but they're sure their parents did not enjoy it. And they definitely _don't_ want to hear about it.So, lots and lots of false notes in this movie!On the other hand, _great_ status detail! Tortelli cremaschi! Apricot trees.

Firstly, the positives. It looks pretty and I like the last song. Now on to EVERYTHING I HATED.\nWhat the hell was that transition song? We would watch a whole 2 minute clip of them cycling away with no music but as soon as elio was walking from one point to the other they would play the song for like two seconds. It doesn't fit at all! It wouldn't fit in any movie it's so strange.What confused me most was when Elio was admitting he liked Armies character (don't even remember his name? Oliver?). It came out of nowhere and I didn't even know what was happening. Then they started being romantic and it was like WHAT???? Elio was trying to AVOID armie but then suddenly loves him? And the age difference is whack.Why didn't this movie come with subtitles? Half the people speak multiple languages and I couldn't even tell if I was listening to French, Italian or German by the end. Obviously I don't want subtitles throughout the whole film, but I had to keep clicking them on and off just to understand the plot. It's not that hard to have them come with the film. It's like mr beans holiday, WHY DOESNT THAT HAVE AUTOMATIC SUBTITLES???The peach scene... Yes its iconic but what the hell. Elio stars crying for no reason? He acts like he has a childhood history of being abused and that's why he cries when fighting Armie. WHO UNDERSTANDS THIS???And the ending with the Dad... When he said \"I wish I had done that when I was younger\" or something similar, Elio replies with \"does mum know?\" I thought that Dad was coming out as gay, but apparently not.A movie should only be two hours if it needs two hours and this easily could be a twenty minute short film. The ending made the whole two hours feel useless and OF COURSE the gays get the bad ending once again. \"It's true to real life\" uh yeah in the 80's? I don't care about their dumb asses I just want a happy ending and a PROPER STORY. This movie is completely useless.",

            "review_title": "A Truly Breathtaking Piece Of Cinema",
            "content": "Set during a summer in 1980's Northern Italy. Elio Perlman (Timothee Chalamet) a 17-year-old who spends his days in his family's 17th century villa transcribing music, reading and flirting with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel). One day, Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old American college graduate student. Arrives as the annual summer intern tasked with helping Elio's father (Michael Stuhlbarg). Although initially irritated by Oliver's presence. Elio soon forms a connection with Oliver and they both soon discover the heady beauty of awakening that will change their lives forever.\nFirst of all James Ivory's script is spectacular. It's wonderfully adapted from Andre Aciman's novel and really captures the sensual feeling and setting of the story. From the opening credits I was simply transfixed and it hooked me in to the story instantly. I immediately became interested and wanted to learn more about the characters and setting which is due to the excellent script.\nTimothee Chalamet is incredible. This is his breakout performance and his first major lead role in a film and he does not disappoint. You can almost tell what he is thinking just from his facial expressions, he doesn't even have to open his mouth and he conveys so much emotion. His character in the story is discovering things about himself and trying to come to terms with these things. He gives such an emotionally resonant performance and it grew on me throughout the film. \nArmie Hammer Portrays Oliver. Its a great performance. He is so entertaining to watch because of his mannerisms, and the quotable lines he delivers throughout the film which made me laugh out loud in some scenes. He again also conveys a lot of emotion without even opening his mouth. His character is also trying to come to terms with things which makes his character vulnerable in some parts of the film. The chemistry between Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet is also mesmerising to watch on screen.\nThe rest of the supporting cast were equally amazing. Michael Stuhlbarg portrays Elio's Father. Who is absolutely phenomenal in this film. He is a very open Father to Elio and he is also very intelligent. Towards the end of the film he gives a powerful monologue about acceptance to Elio which almost brought me to tears. Unfortunately his performance will be sadly overlooked due to the main two actors. Also Elio's Mother Annella (Amira Caser) and his friend Marzia (Esher Garrel) were also great additions to the supporting cast.\nWith this film being a smaller independent production it's hard to know what to expect from the production design. Thankfully it's excellent. The 17th century villa and the sculptures all around the house are glorious to look at. There's a timeless quality to this story and to the film overall which is marvellous. That is a very rare feat for any film to achieve. \nThe music in this film is truly incredible. Sufjan Stevens wrote two original songs for this film. Mystery Of Love and Visions Of Gideon. He also included his previously written song Futile Devices but with a (Doveman Remix) this time. As all three songs played over the film I got goosebumps because of the affect and emotion it added to the film, it was extraordinary. The lyrics for each song are wonderful and perfectly fit the theme and purpose of the story. Also the already produced music used in the film was perfectly selected by music supervisor Robin Urdang. \nLuca Guadagnino's direction is truly splendid. The way in which he captured the source material and the sensual setting of the environment is fantastic. There is a scene in particular where the camera slowly follows the main two characters moving around a statue and it was just breathtaking to look at. This film is truly a work of art and is a shining example of filmmaking at it's absolute finest. I have decided it's his best film yet although he hasn't directed much, this should hopefully get him much more exposure as a director.\nCall Me By Your Name is truly a breathtaking piece of cinema. The performances from all the actors especially the main two are outstanding. The music is beautiful and heartbreaking. The chemistry between Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet is fantastic. The films message of acceptance is so powerful and relevant to our time. Every single frame of this film has stuck with me ever since the credits rolled and I will never forget it.",

For me, two of the most fantastically real, heartbreaking, moments from Chalamet were, when he sobbed in Hammer's arms before telling him, I don't want you to go, and when he called his mother to come get him from the station. He makes your heart ache. Armie Hammer is one of the most beautiful men on this planet. He and Chalamet SHINE. Armie was a surprise for me because of the ease with which he fell into this role.

            "content": "I know: the filmmakers were adapting a book and couldn't depart from its core. But you and I can have a thought experiment with two alternate plots, can't we? Here goes. Alternate plot #1: In northern Italy in the 1980s, seventeen-year old Elia begins a relationship with Oliver, her art professor father's twenty-four year old cis-gender research assistant for the summer, with whom she bonds over her budding sexuality, their shared Jewish identity, and the charming north Italian landscape. At first Oliver is reluctant to respond to Elia's approaches but, as the age of consent in Italy is fourteen (because Juliet Capulet), he yields, to their mutual satisfaction. After their first sex, when Oliver is away, Elia, overcome with desire for Oliver, satisfies her passion with a zucchini from her family's kitchen garden (a motif borrowed from the \"Ther\u00e8se Philosophe\" scene in the 1973 masterpiece Immoral Tales), beautifully illustrating how natural and wholesome their love is. Later, at her progressive sorta-Jewish parents' positive urging, Elia and Oliver travel together to Bergamo, get drunk, have lots of sex, and run around under gushing waterfalls calling each other by their own names, a courageous experiment in transexuality. Six months later, after Oliver has returned to the U. S. and Elia has had an abortion, Elia's mother consoles her tearful daughter with wise words about the summertime sex romp as something \"very special.\"Alternate plot #2: In northern Italy in the 1980s, seventeen-year old Elio feels sexually attracted to Oliver, his art professor father's twenty-four year old bisexual research assistant for the summer, with whom he slowly forms a relationship over his budding sexuality, their shared Jewish identity, and the charming north Italian landscape. At first Oliver is strongly tempted to yield to Elio's advances, but manfully resists, explaining to Elio the reasons why it would be wrong for them to have sex together: their obvious age difference (despite the fact that the age of consent in Italy is fourteen); the betrayal of Elio's parents' trust; the moral confusion that might be caused to a still-developing young man; and the deep emotional damage caused by reducing sex to meaningless and casual hedonistic gratification. They travel together to Bergamo, where Oliver teaches Elio about Greek and Roman sculpture and they form a lasting friendship worthy of the name. Years later they meet in New York, each married with children and happy lives. They look each other square in the eye and share a firm handshake. Elio thanks Oliver for his moral courage and self-control all those years ago.The woke film industry just cannot help itself from nagging and lecturing us about how hip homosexuality is and how most of us are bigoted clodhoppers for not getting their message no matter how often they send it. Well, this message is pretty clear. Did you miss the allusions to the Greek myth of Narcissus, what with all the ponds and swimming pools, not to mention the silly \"call my by your name\" thing? Elio: \"I love you, Elio!!\" Oliver: \"I love you, Oliver!\" In another scene Oliver is reviewing images of classical Greek sculpture with his professor host and all he has to say about the Charioteer of Delphi is \"So sensual,\" as if the viewer's hard-on is the true test of an immortal artwork's beauty. If you value your time on this earth, do not waste two and a half precious hours in the theater enduring this thing.",

However, as I said with that project, Call me by Your Name gets a great relevance for this, not necessarily for being a great movie.The script, in my opinion, is shown as the strong pillar of this film. In this case, the internal conflict that the protagonist suffers when experiencing infatuation towards a person of the same sex. The most interesting thing, and that is where I think the mastery of this script rests, is the fact of managing the main conflict of gay love no longer having society or conservatism as the main antagonist (Although a key era is used to deal with with taboo), but to self-established barriers and self-absorption. In particular, this aspect is accentuated when the adolescent repeats on several occasions the phrase: \"Is it better to confess, or to die?\". Personally, that scene near the end of the film in which Elio talks to his father about the adventure he had with Oliver is the central point. Deep and moving scene. Good dialogue and a soundtrack that perfectly embellishes the story.The development of the characters, however, is not something we can applaud. Except for Elio (emphasizing the work of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, even if Gary Oldman proved to be a better contender for the award) and perhaps his father, the other characters lack a real purpose, except Oliver, who still think that only appears in the film to play the conflicting lover ... nothing more. In his character, an attempt was made to insert a bit of resistance to the idea of same-sex romance, but in the end it only occupies a role that, although necessary to tell the story, lacks real depth, unless Elio is next to him. The film in general responds to all the actions of the protagonist: his female lover, his mother, the Armie Hammer's character, the housekeeper. Although Elio is an incredibly complex character and a reflection of many people who live through the changes he goes through, the rest of the cast seems to have no real interference in the plot and in the way it develops.It is evident that Call me by your Name pretends to be seen as part of a new phase of Hollywood work. And, in my opinion, it accomplishes that task. It is another romantic film and to a certain extent honeyed. Like an authentic Chick Flick, it is full of literary references, live music, cheesy phrases and over much longer than history could merit. If we do the mental exercise of extracting the LGBT+ theme, we will notice that it is like any other romantic foreign film, with an interesting plot, extraordinary landscapes and characters that cause tenderness, but without going any further. Therefore, I believe that it is precisely the theme of love between people of the same sex that is so relevant to this production. And, in my opinion, a good film is the one that is capable of introducing this theme at the same time that it tells a story of masterly plot and at least optimal filming quality. While the intention behind Call me by your Name may be considered admirable, I do not think that the same can be said for its filmographic quality.",

Just from those 3 seconds alone it made me want to watch the movie and I had never ever heard of it. I watched on January 12th, 2018 after a while that it came out and within the past month after watching this movie multiple times I even read the book. They were both such beautiful pieces of work that I still have not stopped loving this piece of art after a whole year. I don't think I'd be able to get over his movie ever, just everything that this has to offer is so loving. It shows you how a person truly desires someone and it shows what love means to people. I want someone to love me the same way Elio loved Oliver. Just knowing that this type of love exists for somone is just so heart warming.

It's like he's playing himself.The romance comes up very suddenly because, after reading the screenplay, its evident that in many of the scenes in the start of the movie in which Elio shows open dislike for Oliver are supposed to be hiding an attraction. This is not shown at all. From the acting we are given, it more or less seems like Elio is mistrusting and slightly jealous of Oliver until halfway when they become friends and then lovers.The thing that really makes me dislike this movie more is the way that all these teenage girls have begun to obsess over it and have made it their favorite movie of all time, thinking themselves the next blessing to gay rights.",

Scenery was amazing, vibe was good, and it was interesting.Once their romance picked up I thought the movie got a lot better but it kind of just came out of nowhere. At first Elio seemed annoyed with Oliver and they would kind of just randomly spend time together, but there wasn't a deep connection forming. You could sense the lust between the two but then all of a sudden they both knew it somehow and then they were in love. The buildup wasn't what it could've been. Once they finally started hooking up, I loved their connection and it was beautiful. The ending had me almost crying.I have to emphasize how SEXY the movie was. Timoth\u00e9e was in looking hot af in minimal clothing most of the movie and it was done in an erotic fashion. No wonder he's considered a \"sex symbol\" now. Armie was as well but not as much. And their intimate scenes were both sexy and beautiful.It was very slow paced and there was a lot of just lounging around, so if that isn't your thing I don't recommend. I didn't mind it though. It was relaxing. One thing I don't see people talking about is the philosophy talk of the two academics which was really interesting actually.I am biased being gay, because there aren't many movies like this out there for us so idk if I'd have given it an 8 if it wasn't 2 very attractive men.Timoth\u00e9e played Elio wonderfully and he was definitely pulling my heartstrings. I thought all the acting was pretty good. It wasn't the best movie, but it was really good and I'd definitely recommend it. The finish was really strong too, between the dad/son conversation and even the credits with Elio looking into the fire.",

It is hard to explain why it can affect people so much, but one can try to list out the reasons one can think of.Because it is created by a group of genius, including the writers (novel and screenplay), director, actors, musician, etc.\nBecause it is filmed in the beautiful city of Crema, Italy.\nBecause it depicts desire, one of the fundamental essence of human, so well.\nBecause it is about love is love is love, regardless of form or gender.\nBecause.There is really no need to explain to be honest. If you watch it, you would love it.Never has a movie touched me so deeply, in the soul, and left me speechless and lost in thoughts. After the first viewing, I read the book, watched the movie for the second time, listened to the audio book, read/watched countless essays/reviews/interviews about the movie, and now am preparing to read the script as well. I am still constantly in awe of the new details discovered from the book or the movie. The insights from the creators also help adding so many layers to the movie which I am excited to watch many more times.Here are a few things I particularly love, among the overall unique infatuation I have with this piece of art:While there is no doubt that the Perlmans depicted in the book is very warm and loving, the center theme of the book itself is still much focused on Elio and his coming-of-age discovery of himself. On the other hand, the director of the movie, Luca Guadagnino, made certain changes in the movie to better fit his description of the project - \"This is a movie about a family, compassion, transmission of knowledge, of being better people because someone's otherness changes you,\" Guadagnino told The Guardian in 2017. For instance, some scenes originally only involved Elio and/or Oliver in the book, but Luca included the Perlmans parents as well which showed beautiful exchanges between the generations.The movie is also all about intimacy, distance, and the chase and catch game between characters. It has the perfect depiction of a passionate relationship between two people from the beginning, and sadly to the end. Testing water in the beginning and wondering if the other person is indeed interested or everything is just a fantasy and projection of your own affections. One moment you are so close to each other, then separation can come disruptively just seconds later. The abrupt 'later' is a perfect example. We watch Elio and Oliver's friendship blossoms, and there are so many beautiful moments which just leave us more heartbroken than ever at the end (spoiler alert).Let's also talk about the perfect casting. It is hard to believe that Luca found the perfect Elio and Oliver without any audition or reading. Armie Hammer had a more elaborated profile but no character was as emotionally demanding and vulnerable as Oliver. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet was relatively new as a young star. Who would have known he could make Elio so alive and complex? Don't even get me started on the scenes where they demonstrated master class of acting, I can make a list. Just one example for each: the last night they spent together for Oliver, and the last scene with credits rolling for Elio. It is truly because of their generosity in sharing their heart and soul as the characters, the movie can be so heart touching and successful.It is so obvious how much Elio and Oliver were in love even though they never said \"I love you\", not even once. The closest we got is the ambiguous \"I love this\", spoken by Elio to Oliver on Monet's berm. I am definitely not exaggerating when I say this is one of the most poetic movies I have ever watched.I can only say this is truly a masterpiece and timeless and will be admired by generations. My deepest gratitude to Andr\u00e9 Aciman for the beautiful words he created, to Luca Guadagnino for his brilliant illustration on screen, and to all the actors for their authentic performances. This is going to be my favourite movie for years (or forever).",

            "content": "Not read the book, not gay (but equally not homophobic), just wanting to see a good movie; those were my starting conditions as I saw this movie.First, the technical part. I could not disagree more on many people calling this movie \"beautiful\".I mean the camera work is not awful, but showcasing a foot in water for about 10 seconds (with no reason whatsoever behind it), just to name one example, is not sth. I would call \"good camera work\". Furthermore the picture looks a little desaturated and grainy at times.But the full extend of that low budget 4 Mio Euros movie is what you get to hear. That is, if you even hear anything except for that annoying bird twittering.Seriously, I watched this movie in Dolby Surround and the Mixing was the worst, I have ever heard in a movie. It was so bad actually, the entire thing sounded like a cheap TV-Production, as the recorded micro-sound always came from the center-speaker. They did not even dare trying to split voices or other Sounds recorded on set onto other channels. The only thing you get to hear from those other channels is that stupid annoying twittering (and sometimes the even more unfitting Music.)\nIt had nothing to do with the Plot, which I will come to later on.The only good thing, that I think this movie has, is its performances. Mr. Chamalet performed excellently and also Mrs Garrel and Mr. Stuhlbarg did their job well. But even those were not able to show emotions or anything of interest until the very end of that movie.Mr. Hammer tried really hard, but eventually I did not believe him completely.The Plot: /\nThats right, this movie has none. At least none worth mentioning. But for those of you who need it, have it: (I will not call them by their names, that is stupid)\nThe one like mid 30s guy, I will call him \"A\" comes to Italian town where 17 year-old guy \"B\" lives with his family. They both like each other, but cannot tell anyone, not even themselves. They both have a beautiful girl lying around (that just so happens to happen in Italy, even if you are really, I mean really weird, come to that later), which puts B in the situation of having to choose. He finally chooses in favor of A over the girl, which is not big of a deal for her (she loves him and is fine with staying friends with him - jup that is part of the movie). A has to go away again, which makes B sad. His father tells him sth. About how special the relationship of the two is (somehow everybody knows about them) and B cries in front of a fire.END OF THE MOVIE.That is all that happens in OVER TWO HOURS! I can make up a story myself in that time that has more complexity to it.Well there are some weird non-fitting put-ins that I left out like the other gay couple that just flys by for a few seconds or that weird hiking scene, but lets just forget about those for a second.WAIT!Almost forgot about the not-ending sex scenes of B sleeping with the girl, himself and A. Those are very unpleasant to watch and make up half of the movie. And no, I do not prefer to watch heterosexual people having sex at all, I just find it very unpleasant to watch two other people having sex in general, no matter the sexuality. Furthermore, there are enough scenes of them doing weird stuff, like sniffing at another ones worn underpants. I mean What The Hell? Who does that?So... What is the hidden meaning of this \"movie\"?THERE IS NONE! This movie tells a boring, way too far stretched story that has no meaning whatsoever other than the one that - at least in my opinion - is omnipresent in modern day culture and nothing new or exciting to be discussed. The technical aspects of this film are underwhelming and the only thing preventing me from giving this one a 1/10 is the good acting by some of the actors (seemingly the only thing that those 4 Mio Euros have been used for).Seriously, why the praise?",

Maybe not a wall but glass; it gave the allusion they had chemistry but there was something in the way. Casting wise however, I think the directors/producers did fantastic.If Im having a bad day, I'll watch this movie. If I'm having a good day, I'll watch this movie.

            "content": "Call me by your name is made out to be an amazing romantic/coming of age film. And while the film does deliver, it is in neither of those areas. The lead actors have little to no chemistry, and it is unclear they even have an attraction until it is explicitly stated by the characters. One could argue that the relatively large age gap between the two is responsible for and lack of chemistry, however several films have pulled off much more compelling stories with an even more significant difference in age. The film and actors attempt to create an unspoken, slow burn attraction between the two characters-which is always compelling- but fails to do so successfully. As a result, the minimal dialogue and other lack of interaction between Oliver and Elio becomes less a way to draw the audience into their romance and more a confusing choice that makes their relationship seem like an afterthought instead of the focal point of the story. With that being said, the film is beautifully shot, and does an amazing job of setting the scene of a 1983 Italian villa. The story of Elio on it's own is compelling, however mostly due to the supporting characters and the way the film portrays subtleties of being 17 and free for a summer. The father's monologue is written and delivered beautifully, and communicates a message so good it makes you wish it had been present in the film the whole time.",

            "content": "Truly masterful art work as seen here is very rare in film nowadays. Despite my great excitement as I settled down to watch this, I didn't anticipate how much a film, this film, could affect me, and wasn't prepared for the emotional awakening upon the first and repeat viewings. It may be a cliche to say a film can change your life, yet Call Me By Your Name effortlessly and effectively twinges at your nostalgia through exhibiting a freedom in the perfect idyllic setting to explore yourself as a human being. It introduces you to the Northern Italian home of Greek professor Sam Perlman and his wife and teenage son, who welcome in a student every summer to assist him. This year the confident American Oliver has come to stay, his arrival opening the film and the door to this tranquil oasis where he blunders in with his natural charm and vigour, completely entrancing the Perlman's 17 year old son Elio. What develops between them over the summer is a pure and unfiltered romance, with time as their only enemy. It's hard to tell which performance shines brightest here. The whole ensemble of the cast is perfectly orchestrated, with characters presented so vibrantly and free that they fully capture the scene, almost as if you are watching real life unfold before you. Michael Stuhlbarg and Amira Casar are so effortless as the relaxed intellectual parents with a rich and eclectic social circle, though it is in Mr Perlman's final speech to his heartbroken son that truly captures the films sorrowful joy and it's ode to first stomach-wrenching heart-racing knee-quaking love and the bottomless despair when it ends. Yet the real beauty of this film comes in Elio's growing reluctant infatuation for the older man and the passion that blossoms when his attraction is reciprocated. It is impossible to untangle the performances of Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Oliver and Elio respectively. Oliver's greatest moments lie in the quiet removal of his barriers as he and Elio grow closer, the freedom he exhibits, both in his experience of the summer and his romance with Elio, and also in his quieter despair when the reality of time catches up to them. Armie captures Oliver's freedom masking a deeper longing, so eloquently and naturally, and you feel his inhibitions lower with Oliver's as he gives himself so openly and honestly to the role. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, meanwhile, delivers such a masterful and mature performance that it is hard to believe that Elio is not a real person whose life you are capturing a glimpse of. So very infrequently can an actor capture the inner turmoil going on in his characters thoughts, but Timmy breathes Elio's thoughts and desires; he wears them on his skin so exposed and unfiltered with his emotions, and whilst the end of the film should be celebrated from such a young and up and coming performer, it is in his earlier scenes of his growing intense irritation by and infatuation of Oliver that I enjoyed the most, from his fidgety restlessness, to his lingering gazes, to his embarrassment and insecurity around the more self assured Oliver, to most especially the disappointed, jealous thoughtful glare at Oliver on the dance floor as he realises the depth of his desire for the first time.\n \nThe nostalgia the film conjures up within you is life-defining; Call Me By Your Name transports you to a time and a place where life was unfiltered; whether for the characters in the film or the cast and crew who made the film, it captures a moment, a memory; a kiss you will never have again; a touch you will never feel again; an experience that comes and goes with a blink of the eye, but leaves you irreversibly transformed. As a viewer, the film lingers within you, like first loves, past romances and unrequited attractions, bringing you much anguish and hope in equal measure that, like Mr Perlman softly advises, you should embrace and rejoice in rather than kill the pain of the heartbreak. Call Me By Your Name is timeless; it is proof that masterpieces of art don't just appear on canvas or carved it stone; they can be in an actor's gaze, an actor's expressions, the raw relenting submission to a character's mind frame, and to the idyllic experience of the perfect summer with the perfect person.",

It's a nice film which you can relate to (if you're gay) like fondling the other man's bulge, the sadness of saying goodbye to your man at a train station etc. The father should have acted straighter. Two gay men in the same family is a crowd. Oliver, as being older, should have acted straighter and mature to protect his young love. Oliver is a bit willowy. As a well read woman, how come the mother does not realise what is going on between her son and their male guest? Oliver and Elio' trip to Rome is not very romantic - shouting, leaving Elio on his own, dancing, vomiting on the pavement - not very romantic. In the book, Oliver stands naked on the balcony of their Rome hotel room, Elio comes out and hugs him from behind and proceeds to make love to Oliver. They should show they have more sex as they are madly in love at that time. As Elio glances at Oliver (he's starting to have his feelings for Oliver), the old gardener stops by and shows Elio a massive fish he has just caught - it's like Elio has been caught by Oliver, like Elio has fallen for Oliver hook, line and sinker. This is like the scene in \"For a lost soldier\" where 2 young boys sit in a barn, one says he can't wait to go back home in the city, the other says he prefers to stay in the countryside (as he has fallen in love with a Canadian soldier, WW II, 1945) and he puts a piece of fishing net over him as if to say he's a caught fish now.

Small details of this film just made me smile (the Invicta backpack, the old woman \"cleaning\" green vegetables outside in the Sun, the old men at the bar...). Oliver/Armie Hammer's admiration of ancient Greek statues parallels the ephebic, classical beauty of Elio/Timothee Chalamet. It just made me cry when Elio notices Oliver was wearing the same shirt as the first day he got there, and asks if he can keep it when Oliver leaves. There are some striking similarities with Eric Rohmer's \"Conte d'\u00e9t\u00e9\", in some scenes the influence of this movie seems especially obvious... like a tribute from a way to interpret love, to another way to interpret love.\nIt's such a deep, sensitive story on the delicate, but ultimately cruel nature of longing...",

It is the kind of scenery that everyone could picture a beautiful -first love story. \nHowever, what makes this romance special is that it comes from a emotion of fear. But where is there fear, there is also a desire, and breaking through it together it is like making a pact.\nA lovely celebration of sensory pleasure has started since then, be it in the form of food, flesh or music. They surrendered themselves to the best what a moment can bring, just by being present and feeling.\nThere was something so natural in how this relationship unfolded that it seems as if remaining in secret front others judgment allowed them to be whoever they want. Is like having finding freedom in a prison. The couple is lost in a space of enjoyment and we are also together, being driven by wide shots to close ups of pleasure. \nCall me by your name is labelled by many as gay film, which confirms how people's mindsets are still boxed.

Touching on subjects of same sex love and relations and more so disliked the age gap between the lead characters Elio and Oliver.With what I found, the age gap is definitely inappropriate - much like thousands of first loves are. Which is why it translated to me as brutally honest and heartbreaking.The rawness and realness of Elio and Olivers relationship as it slowly pans out leaves us sad and hopeful for Elio. We root for him as he tackles his own identity and feelings and want to see him come out on the other side triumphant. Though we learn that things don't go his way similar yet again to most first loves.The film tells a painfully relatable story through beautiful locations and shots, colorful music and words and brilliant acting.It's impossible for me to watch this movie without feeling like I too am somewhere in northern Italy and for that I think the makers created a success.",

It contains many emotional conflicts when Elio, the main guy, begins recongising his love to Oliver, her father's student. The most fanstatic thing is the analysing Elio's emotion.It is so sensitive and the young actor successfully performed it. I would vote him a star and a star for Oliver too.I love the film for it is performed in sensitive scenes, beautiful and tranquil lanscape. Another is the script is abstract and thought-provoking. the camera angle at the Palvie( or sth) circular war monument when two guys talk is good at digging into a analysing character's feelings. Finally, the Elio eyes are tearful, which makes me remember the film well after it ends.I would recommend this for those who have sensitive souls and those who have an open-minded view.",

I am a straight guy, so have no affinity for what some suppose to be the pornographic aspects of the film, but isolating one protagonist as a character seems to me to make it very personal, as if seen through his eyes. The sex scenes came across to me as reasonable, awkwardness in coming-of-age sex is completely realistic.It is nicely shot, both the cinematography and soundtrack are complimentary rather than obtrusive.If a gritty romance set in the streets of Chicago or London is what you are looking for, you will be horribly disappointed, but if you are fed up with reading Camus or McEwan, and fancy a pocket romance, it may be for you.

Also the chemistry that Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet have has Oliver and Elio is incredible. Sometimes I feel like they've been dating for months and asked to do a movie together! Secondly the work of Luca Guadagnino and James Ivory makes the film a masterpiece. The story itself isn't the thing but the way it's told is. After watching it for the first time, I wanted to have what they had. I wanted to go to Crema in Italy and have a summer romance just like they did. It also made me look back to my first love and I think that's wonderful! Call me by your name is about interpretation because it's not labeled. In fact in no way we know Elio's sexual orientation. He was a girlfriend and he is also in love with Oliver but the movie doesn't tell you if he's gay or bisexual or bi-curious or pansexual. It doesn't force you to see the movie a certain way. It's a slow movie so if you prefer action movie it may not be your fav. Some people talked about the age gap between Elio and Oliver. The thing is: the consent age in Italy is 16. Also the parents approves their relationship. Elio is the one who is trying to \"convince\" Oliver to love him. To conclude the space and time will make you fall in love with the movie. It's this hot italian summer in the 80s where everybody is in swimsuit and plays volleyball. The greek statues and the nature embellish the film. The unbelievable colours and camera angles are boom.

The chemistry between the characters was lovely. I felt the closeness between Elio and his parents, and what a safe, warm life he lived on the villa. I also felt the passion between Elio and Oliver, when they kissed and even when Oliver sat rubbing Elio's feet on the kitchen floor. Call Me By Your Name is a movie filled with love, and although the end is sad, as Elio's father tells him, Elio is better off having experienced such a relationship as the one he shared with Oliver.",

In particular, the ending was made up of some of the most profound dialogues -- for example, the dialogue between the main character and his father -- I've seen on film, which would not have made sense without the slow, realised progression of the main characters' love. Similarly, the main character wasn't very expressive of his inner emotions throughout the beginning and the middle of the film; however, the very last scene showed the acting chops of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet - he, without any words, only in his eyes, reflected on the events of the entire film, which gave the audience an opportunity to connect the cautious beginning and middle of the movie to this profound ending.

The New York Times called it a \"ravishment of the senses,\" which is so well said - the lighting, the sounds of the house, smells you might imagine, hot summer air- every sensory element creates a backdrop you feel as if you have experienced. The development of the relationship between Elio and Oliver is captured beautifully and recreates moments we've all experienced, fostering a familiarity that makes this not a gay love story, but a classic love story.In the final scene of the film, the audience will feel the intense melancholy Elio is experiencing, while life continues around him. We are reminded in his fathers monologue that this type of sadness can only exist after feeling unimaginable happiness - \"Right now there is sorrow and pain, don't kill it, and with it the joy you've felt.\" Heartbreak is incredibly painful but is also a beautiful reminder of the love we experienced - it is something that deserves to be felt and not repressed, much like this movie, which very much deserves to be felt rather than watched.",

            "content": "Call Me by Your Name is one of the most visually appealing films I have ever seen. Despite the controversy surrounding the relationship between Elio and Oliver, I could watch this over and over due to the sheer beauty of it. Luca Guadagnino is such an incredible director that has brought Andre Aciman's novel to life so beautifully and sensually and I admire him for that. The way he brings so much emotion into scenes is fantastic, and Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer show so much passion and understanding for their characters, playing the roles of Elio and Oliver incredibly. The soundtrack brings so much to the film, Sufjan Stevens absolutely elevated the emotion in Call Me by Your Name to a new level with his music. I would say that if this review was focused only on the cinematography then I would have to give it a 10 as it is simply one of the most visually beautiful films I have ever seen. However, the story lets us down just slightly.The story of Call Me by Your Name is good, even very good. It's not bad, not even average- but it's not great. I think the main issue people find with this film is Elio and Oliver's age gap. And while people try and make excuses such as Elio being over the age of consent in Italy, this doesn't change the 7 year age and maturity gap between the two. Elio was 17, still American high school age, while Oliver was 24, a grown adult man, who was simply more mature than Elio in almost every way. It's debatable on whether this is as big of an issue as some people say it is, but I'm not going to get into that. Other than that, there aren't many outright issues with the story. Some people believe that there are plot holes, but the film is really being portrayed as a collection of Elio's memories, and so they are going to be slightly unreliable and such.Call Me by Your Name is romantic, it's sensual, it's passionate and it's moving, but overall, it's beautiful. Everyone should watch this.",

It was a beautiful adaptation of the book, which I've gone through more times than I care to admit. Some people here say it's slow, boring or lacks depth - that's far from the truth. You have to get that this is Italy in the 80s, it isn't a world of social media, instant content and whatnot. It's \"slow\" only because it's supposed to be, because it aims to take you on the journey of a serene summer when everything and nothing happen at once. And no way it is boring or shallow if you don't need things to be spelt out for you in explicit words. Understand the meaning of silence too.\nHowever, I do concede that my opinion may be different because I read the novel beforehand. It must have given me an insight into the scenes that those who didn't read the book couldn't grasp.

The cinematography is stunning, and the camera languishes in its beautiful setting, allowing us to watch a beautiful love story develop. It indulges us by taking us on a journey so that we might enjoy the scenery, the long shots and time, above all the time it allows us to linger and watch rather than flitting here and there impatiently as many films do. The beautiful old crumbling house, in a small village in Northern Italy, is wonderful, a character in itself, it is a place of relaxation for the family who spend their summers and Christmas there whilst welcoming friends and family constantly as denotes their generosity of spirit. It is a place of faded grandeur, full of hospitality and love.The acting is superb, and do not believe anyone who says it isn't. The chemistry between the two main characters is electric and so believable and so beautiful to watch, it reminds us all of the intensity of love.For the people who say this film is too long, or boring, I guess they just don't get it. This film is about subtle nuances, the growth of the characters developmentally, their gradual realisation of their feelings for one another. It is a celebration of love in its many forms: of the parents for their son; of Elio and Oliver; of the Perlamans; of Marzia. It reminds me of French and British films which often focus on dialogue and in-depth studies of characters. In this film we are studying human nature and fathoming the decsiions and actions of the protagonists, rather than focusing on dramatic action, loud volume and special effects - those factors which excite some film fans. This film is a triumph for people who enjoy watching people. Loved it and it will remain in my memory for a very long time, probably always. Thank you Luca.",

This movie is a complete masterpiece, and the fact that Luca Guadagnino was not nominated for a directing Oscar is just a travesty. This film is as much perfection in filmmaking that is possible: the music, the cinematography, the amazing, seamless flow of all of the performances blended together all create art on the screen. Every second of this film MEANS something, and scenes layer symbolism on top of symbolism.The acting is astoundingly good. From the two leads down to the smallest of supporting characters, the performance quality is first-rate, and all of the characters help build each other into being more complex and sympathetic. Timothee Chalamet is a revelation, and someone that will be garnering more awards nominations in the future. Every move he makes, his tones of voice, every little movement or gesture puts Elio's character on display; intelligent, curious, cautious, uncertain....every emotion he is feeling, as he is feeling it, is on full view. Armie Hammer's performance is stunning. I have been a fan of his for some time now, and never have I seen such an emotionally restrained and subtle performance. Hammer performs Oliver as both cocky and confident, and sensitive and hesitant, all with equal skill. Michael Stulbarg's monologue at the end of the movie is quietly powerful, brilliantly written and performed, and presents the epitome of what parent we all would like to have.The pacing of the film, and the lingering way in which many scenes are shot just accentuate the langour of summer. The soundtrack is a beautiful and emotional backdrop for the film. Is it a \"slow\" movie? Yes, absolutely, and by design. It allows the viewer to luxuriate in it even more. A movie that has lasted with me in the week since initially seeing it, and proves itself to be an emotional masterpiece.",

Here goes...James Ivory's Oscar winning screenplay follows seventeen-year-old Elio and his father's twenty-something-year-old assistant, Oliver as they fall in love over the summer of 1983 in Northern Italy. It's a coming-of-age love story centered around Elio and Oliver's deep connection and the consequences of embracing their desires. Luca Guadagnino directs with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer as the two leading men in this masterpiece of modern cinema.The film is beautifully shot and expertly directed whilst also featuring some truly incredible performances. Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were both simply outstanding. Their awkward chemistry perfectly compliments the slow developing relationship between Elio and Oliver in the film. Initially, I struggled to see them together, but by the end I couldn't imagine them apart.Call Me by Your Name's most powerful moment comes during the film's conclusion in the form of a three and a half minute shot of Elio by the fire. As Sufjan Stevens' 'Visions of Gideon' plays, Elio experiences a myriad of emotions in what is one of the most moving scenes I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. Everyone remembers the first time they had their heart broken. You stop and feel every emotion with Elio as the world around him carries on. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, I have no words.As the credits rolled I couldn't help but wonder how long it will be until something beautiful arrives on our screens again.",

            "review_title": "Soem Thoughts",
            "content": "A story about young love; that's how a friend described it to me. I guess that, to a certain extent, it is. Young love. Messy love. Infatuation. Your first love. Conflicting feelings. Feeling certain things for the first time.\nA tightly contained love story, with a steep spiral of feelings up and a sudden crash down. Before you know it you're caught up in an emotional rollercoaster resulting in the most intense experience of your life. And before you know it you're left with an empty void in the shape of an Oliver (also goes by the name of Elio).The first thing I noticed about the film was the aesthetic and the feel. I liked the cinematography. The softness of the image. The setting in rural Italy, where teenagers seem to live somewhat secluded lives. Their world feels very small, adding a very cozy element to the world. The little village seems isolated from the troubles in the rest of the world and the likes of social media. A life of wine, cigarettes and loose blouses in hot summer weather.As the movie progresses and the story unfolds, I begin to realise there's probably not much of a plot. Everything about this film feels very slice of life. It allows you to take your time watching the scenes, the characters, and to take in the music and sounds very well.\nEventually the love story unfolds. I don't have much to say about it. It's a slice of life. The story arc is not the main focus. You just watch. So I watch the characters.\nI don't know what the writer intended for you to think of Elio and Oliver, or what most people think of them. I don't like them.Elio. It feels to me like he has no regard for Marzia's feelings. Maybe even like he's using her. He's very caught up in his own feelings. He's young, stupid, conflicted and very much in love (the latter which I only truly grasped towards the end of the film).\nIt's understandable. But still. I can't not think of it while watching the main story unfold. It withholds me from getting immersed in Elio's character and the love story. He is either extremely naive when it comes to what his behaviour might do to Marzia, or is aware of what he's inevitably doing to her, but refuses to acknowledge and process those thoughts.\nHe's in love. She's in love. You'd guess he'd have the theory of mind ability to place himself in her shoes, especially since he now knows how intense and important love can be. I guess love makes you blind in more ways than one. Stupid Elio.Marzia is most definitely best girl. She tells Elio that she loves him. It came as kind of a shock to me, but now that I think about it it kind of fits. I feel like she's not in love with Elio in an infatuation kind of way. She actually loves him. Why, I don't know. She probably has her reasons. Anyway, she tells him she's not mad at him. She communicated her feelings and fears. Elio disregards those feelings and turns her fear into reality. He very explicitly hurts her... and she still loves him and truly wants to be his friend. She's too pure for this world.Note: Not to say that you can necessarily choose the way you love someone or don't. If you fall for someone and become infatuated and obsessed with that person, it's not like it's a choice. I mean with this that Elio isn't necessarily a worse person than Marzia. Although his actions regarding Marzia are hard to look past and ignore. I'm saying Marzia is the more likeable person. (because I judge people based on their actions?)I felt neutral towards Oliver in the beginning. He's not my type of guy, but I also didn't dislike him. He kept to himself. I warmed up to him when Elio and him got together and he showed his sensitive and understanding side. I'm not sure how I feel about the phone call at the end. I feel like Elio was being very sexual by saying whispering, almost moaning, his name over and over again. Oliver's breathing increased. That's not something your fiancee is gonna like.I'm not sure what to make of the monologue by Elio's dad at the end. I feel like he captures the essence of the movie. Feeling your feelings. Don't put them away, don't wish you never had them. I'm not sure what he meant by: most people go bankrupt by 30.Your heart is worn out and people don't look at your body anymore.He himself has never experienced that. He came close. Does he mean love? Or a love story? An infatuation love story. Like I wanted with her. Maybe.Had to fill in a lot from own experience.",

The movie starts showing Oliver arriving at elio's house where he would stay for the summer,even though it is not a scene of much interaction between the two I felt a certain connection a vibe between the two,and marzia, ah marzia the second option both in the movie and in the book who loved elio intensely but it was not totally reciprocal,when the two began to have an affair I exploded with rage, it seemed that she was only in the movie to mess up the couple and further mess up the mind of elio,I felt that he liked her, yes he did! But it wasn't that \"I want to live my life by your side\" love, it was \"I like you but I don't see myself with you\", she was blinded by love but I always thought that she felt that he liked Oliver. When they got together for the first time it was a dream come true, a goal fulfilled for the spectators, that kiss was beautiful, one of the best scenes in the movie I would say, the will and the insistence of Elio and the reluctance and the will of Oliver were two things that completed each other, their kiss didn't even seem fake, it was something staged, it was something pure and intense with a great acting of the actors, there was the beginning of their affair, the beginning of the deepest possible summer love. The peach scene, the dreaded peach scene that at the same time shocks us and also gives us a \"WOW\", I believe that there is some message through this scene, it can be interpreted in many ways, I like to think that Oliver wanted to prove his love and that's why he ate that peach, or he's just a pervert, and I believe that it was a moment of reflection for Elio, you know, that was a kind of way for him to discover himself, to express himself, and a disgusting and sensational scene. The trip, oh my, the trip Romantics that made me smile and worry,there I thought it wouldn't be just any summer love there I thought they would drop everything and live together forever,but then there was the goodbye,the dreaded and painful goodbye,I felt an emptiness in that scene,an immense sadness,elio comes back home Without Oliver and there you realize that there is no longer the summer love of the two but still have hope,until the connection scene.... The news that Oliver gives the crying face of elio and the feeling that Oliver just used elio to satisfy himself from the anger sadness hate all feeling,elio starting to cry and the last scene of the movie of him crying and the credits going up and something spectacular and something beautiful and sad to see,surely call me by your name and one of the best movies so much that won nothing less than an Oscar.",

And to be honest, this wasn't often; the acting just felt off occasionally. Otherwise, the story floated along as if in a fantasy setting while being very grounded in reality; the setting and cinematography were perfectly aligned; the acting was often amazing; and, the soundtrack was a beautiful accompaniment.

Perhaps this is what Hollywood thinks a European (gay) holiday romance should be like.On the plus side I liked the music and It didn't have the usual (disappointing) Hollywood ending.The parents also were excruciating and cringe worthy.

And if Elio was so into Oliver, then why would he slag Oliver behind his back? The film didn't make sense.

They tell the story in a romantic way that won't make you feel uncomfortable.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer, aka Elio and Oliver, did a great job in this film.

Get to show that we should all have the opportunity to live the first mad passion of a summer love.And that is why there could not be a better place for this story than in a town in northern Italy in the summer of 1983. (Curiously, at the stage where the first AIDS infections and their different forms of transmission began to be known. ) Elio, an intelligent young man of 17 years, played by a great Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who knows how to play the piano with great mastery among a lot of other things, is in full discovery of his sexuality when he meets Oliver, played by Armie Hammer, that embodies the most authentic attitude of confidence and American boldness.\nSuddenly those sunny days and to a certain extent, boring of a common summer change for the attention that Elio awakens the perfect American. Soon a love story is created without judgments, without scandals or polemics, in the sexual encounter of two people who fall in love. So natural, as if it were a story of the present, the characters do not enter into conflicts for their tastes and desires and embark on a relationship that in 83 was not as assimilable as it can be today.\nThe director gets a true intimacy between the protagonists. Almost all physical contact is an electrifying process that transforms the protagonist from a shy child to a bold young man, to achieve the self-confidence he found in Oliver.The bright sun reflected in the pond, the sunsets that fall through the rooms of the great house, the intellectual atmosphere that the parents of Elio give off, with the freshness of the fruit of the season, passing through the apricots, and the beauty that surrounds all the natural space where the story unfolds are the elements that have a great natural parallelism with the protagonists.\nSince the previous films by Guadarnino (\"Yo soy el amor\" 2009 and \"Blinded by the Sun\" 2015) he has shown that he knows how to appreciate the beauty of the actors and turns them into something more than aesthetic objects.

            "content": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet portrays youthful sexual passion powerfully in the Call Me by Your Name. For a heterosexual male to assume that role so seamlessly is, for me, akin to Gwyneth Paltrow's Oscar winning role in Shakespeare in Love. Crossing gender or crossing sexuality is not easy and requires great depth of acting ability. Chalamet's portrayal required a sexual courage most of us presumably don't have.\nA young person viewing the film might not recognize the force of the father's last speech since it values the boy's love relationship and subsequent pain from an older person's point of view. That those moments of pain could be a precious part of a first passionate love is perhaps more apparent to those of us who have aged considerably. The setting and pace of a summer's leisure may also appeal most to those in the same economic bracket as the classically educated family described. How many of us can while away summer months in such a lofty cultural manner?\nThe film's emotional reverberations are deep in the universal valuing of passionate young love, where neither boy nor man reveals to the other what this love might mean. In 1983, Oliver's choice to marry a woman is probably a necessary one from his point of view. Elio, at age seventeen, has no adult thought of a future as a gay male in an inhospitable social climate. He simply desires. Hence his pain is inconsolable as he grieves into the flames of a dining room fire place. Yet his face eventually shows resolve, strength. He will learn in time, we are told.",

However, there were a few quibbles that I wished had been addressed a little more clearly. The age gap seemed larger than it actually was given the actor's appearances. I was a little uncomfortable with how \"young\" Elio looked (and sometimes acted) compared to a much more \"mature\" looking Oliver. I was a little concerned about some rather unsettling pedo-vibes that may have unintentionally resulted from this. I think this may have been exacerbated by Elio's obvious infatuation with Oliver and a much less defined attraction on Oliver's part.And I was a little dismayed that the girls in this film were treated and used with such disdained -- basically experiments and/or beards as the two gay characters came to terms with their own sexuality. It impacted how much I liked the main characters -- particularly towards the end of the movie when Oliver had that smug scene on the bus leaving town. I cannot help but feel for all these heartbroken women who get run over by the sad/terrible forces in this movie and who are victims in their own right. All are collateral damage (including Oliver's future wife) and that makes me even more sad for the characters in this movie. I wished that aspect was addressed a little more thoroughly and less flippantly. Still, I loved this movie ... found it incredibly moving, poignantly beautiful and just lovely (despite its flaws).

By the way, when Elio asked his father whether his mother knows, he means whether she knows about his father having homosexual tendencies in the past, not whether she knows about him and Oliver.4. I liked the detail with the fly.Cons:1. Oliver does NOT look mid 20s, more like mid 30s. This made a lot of scenes have a different tone than intended.2. There isn't enough communication between the 2 characters in the beginning of the film so that they can communicate that well near the monument. The monument talk was ridiculous and not clear at all (imagine, it's not clear to the viewer what they're talking about!). The most apparent explanation to the viewer is that Elio admits to Oliver that he is inexperienced sexually, in a general way. Nothing to do with homosexuality. They somehow understand each other.3. We are being spoon-fed the movie in needless moments. The mother reading to the father and son having a 1-on-1 correspondence with what's happening in the movie made me feel that my intelligence is being underestimated. On the other hand, in other moments the movie is less understandable than needed (see point 2)4. Oliver is very unlikable from Elio at the beginning of the film. It's not made clear how he came to like him after all. All of his spontaneous reactions towards Oliver are negative. When you feel a specific way you show it via microexpressions, even if you want to hide it because you don't want to admit it. This was not shown at all. The transition from \"I don't like him at all\" to \"I am head over heels for him\" didn't feel natural, like at all. The fact that Oliver was objectively obnoxious the first half of the film, did not help with this.5. We are asked to sympathize with the 2 main male characters, but the are being very rude to the girls they have been attracting. Elio's flirt approaches HIM after all he has done to her and asks to remain friends. Yeah, it doesn't work this way in real life.",

I thought the romance was lovely, subtle, and really honest because it portrays aspects of love that aren't usually depicted in films. It also doesn't feel like a \"gay film,\" but rather like a natural story about love. Timmy's acting in this movie is just perfect, he charms in this movie, but Armie so-so really doesn't hit the spot as I found them lacking in chemistry, I had to rewatch some scenes just to understand what he was doing, also caught me off guard as nothing up until that point showed that something was going on between them, the build up for relationship wasn't done that well to me, but of course it was far from what I expected reading imdb reviews coming to this as the movie feels quite long. The film's highlights, in my opinion, are the performance score and cinematography. It also doesn't feel like you're seeing a typical movie; rather, it feels like you're watching a documentary. Except for a few scenes, the film was calm and enjoyable. However, it is overrated yet still a nice film.",

In keeping with his previous films, this latest chapter is imbued with the same kind of visual aesthetic and cerebral exchanges. Everyone here is smart, everyone has important work to do and the drama is framed inside the ambitions (or the lack of) of its characters....laced with subtle subtexts that ultimately puncture each character's meaning.Time moves slowly. Hard baked in the Italian sunshine, the film's pace mirrors the balmy environment of its story. That said, in the experienced hands of 'A Passage To India's James Ivory the dialogue is both believable and laced with subtle subtexts that ultimately puncture each character's meaning.In the role of Elio, actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet embodies the precociousness of youth caught on the cusp of adulthood. By turn louche and languid, his stick-thin frame peppered with penetrating eyes dart out at his house guest. As Oliver, Armie Hammer also impresses. Playing against type and building upon his recent run of credible performances (as evidenced in 'Final Portrait') Hammer again convinces in all regards. A notably graceful dance between both men, neither actor leads the other and the gears of their relationship change so imperceptibly that, by its close, 'Call Me By Your Name' immediately warrants a second viewing.In fact Guadagnino's movie is a film that saves its very best for last. In a beautifully judged piece of both acting and scriptwriting, the final twenty minutes serve up a scene so deeply affecting that it nearly eclipses the finale. -You'll know when you see it. Coupled with an extended end section that bleeds right through the credits, this is also film that will leave you in no doubt as to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's talent or his much deserved Best Actor nomination. Cherish these closing embers as they hold the key to a smouldering, thoughtful drama that will ultimately take your breath away.",

I think that was the intention though and it worked. At times, I was bored too. Armie Hammer, who played Oliver is a handsome man but he looks much older than the 24 year old Oliver. I agree with another reviewer who though a younger looking actor might've been better. I loved the scene where Elio's father gives him a father to son talk that was really sweet and loving and a beautiful example of parenting. I loved the rolling credits screen at the end as it was a beautiful moment and the music that was playing could not have been more perfect. A single tear fell. As a whole the movie will not be for most audiences because it was a bit boring but it was probably supposed to be that way to engage the audience to feel what summers were like in Italy for Elio.

Minimal dialogue and long shots of wind in trees is supposed to mean \"award worthy\". The characters seems to jump from one motivation and personality type to another from scene to scene. Oliver changes from serious adult to childish youth so quickly it feels difficult to watch. the dad's speech is unrealistic. Oliver is Way older than the character's 24.

            "content": "Not to single out this particular premise, but films revolving around gay couples have been terrific over the last decade or so. There was a spark when 2005's Brokeback Mountain was released, which eventually brought us to foreign films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour being nominated for a Golden Globe or Moonlight winning best picture at the Oscars. Call Me by Your Name is the latest film to probably receive many nominations in the coming months, and believe me, the praise is not false. Being a fan of 2015's A Bigger Splash, I was looking forward to Luca Guadagnino's follow-up feature film, and I believe this to be an improvement in the best ways. Exploring the hardships of life and what it means to just kick back and relax every now and then, Call Me by Your Name is a film that's been sticking with me since my viewing of it. While it admittedly won't be able to draw in everyone to the theatres, here is why I believe this to be a fantastic, award-worthy picture.\n\nWritten by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, Call Me by Your Name follows a family that lets Oliver, an older graduate student, live in their home for the summer. While this is a common thing, what's not too common is that Elio, their son, will eventually grow romantic feelings toward this man, convincing him to become his lover for the summer. From the age gap between them and having to hide it from the family, their situation isn't an easy one, nor will it be for some audience members, but it really is a wonderful story. This is easily a story that could've stirred up controversy if it hadn't been done with taste, and because of how it was made, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This was made entirely possible by the incredibly devoted performances by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer.\n\nHammer has had his ups and downs through the years, appearing in Oscar-winning films as well as some of the worst films of the year, so his performance here was the most shocking to me. Yes, he's been talent in nearly everything he's been in, but he really gave his all in this performance and I honestly don't think he'll ever be better than he was in Call Me by Your Name. On the other hand, young Chalamet has a very bright future ahead of him. Being a relatively new actor, his chemistry with Hammer was impeccably astounding. Their relationship took a while to grow on me, but once it completely won me over, I found myself wondering if there was anything to really complain about.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything, it would be in its extreme pressure to try your patience. There are very long sequences of silence, making you relax and take in either a romantic moment or the scenery around them, which I also found poetic at the same time, so I actually have trouble coming up with issues, but I have to admit that I did find the movie slow at times. Yes, it's meant to be slow, which is why that complaint isn't exactly valid, but I just have to be honest.\n\nIn the end, this is a truly remarkable piece of dramatic filmmaking and there are some very memorable scenes that keep replaying themselves in my head. One scene in particular that involves Elio and his father Mr. Perlman (played magnificently by Michael Stuhlbarg) toward the end had me in tears. From the brilliantly written screenplay, to the poetic cinematography, to the terrifically calm direction, Call Me by Your Name isn't a movie that I would send the average moviegoer out to see, but if you're a hardcore film fan, I think you'll end up loving this movie.",

            "content": "Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet and Armie Hammer star in Luca Guadagnino's moving adaptation of Andre Aciman's bestselling novel. Dazzling performances and ravishing visuals propel \u2018Call Me by Your Name' into its place as one of 2017's best films.\n\nTimothe\u00e9 Chalamet stars as Elio, an artistic 17-year-old who spends his summer in the picturesque landscapes of Northern Italy, transcribing music and hanging out with his friends. Being on the cusp of adulthood, Elio also spends his days flirting with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel) and experiencing love for the first time. His mundane routine is interrupted when American student Oliver (played by Armie Hammer) arrives to work with Elio's father (\u2018A Serious Man star Michael Stuhlbarg). As the summer progresses, Elio and Oliver form a fervent love, developing a passionate bond that will forever impact their lives.\n\nAmerican singer/songwriter Sufjan Stevens composed two original songs (\u2018Mystery of Love' and \u2018Visions of Gideon') and provides a remix of his own song \u2018Futile Devices'. Stevens' music accompanies a variety of songs ranging from classical music pieces to 80s pop songs. The mix of musical genres effortlessly compliments Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's cinematography that echoes the visuals of Joe Wright's 2007 drama \u2018Atonement'. Luca Guadagnino miraculously brings together first-class filmmaking to create a delicate, yet heart-breaking story with a poetic story at its centre.\n\nTimothe\u00e9 Chalamet and Armie Hammer bring their A games to \u2018Call Me by Your Name', both providing Oscar-worthy performances fuelled by intense chemistry between them. Chalamet's performance encompasses Elio's intelligence and artistic flair, while Hammer brings Oliver's suave and breezy persona to the screen. Michael Stuhlbarg gives a wonderful performance as does Amira Casar and Esther Garrel. Stuhlbarg's standout moment comes when he gives a touching monologue to Elio after Oliver's departure and \u2018to make yourself feel nothing so as to not feel anything' is a waste. However, Chalamet proves himself as a talented performer during the final scene as the credits roll beside him. His performance is a mix of discovering yourself and being a teenager, while also discovering love and how it feels. Both of which tie into some of \u2018Call Me by Your Name's complex themes of heartbreak, identity and coming-of-age.\n\n\u2018Call Me by Your Name' delves into intricate themes like the joy of love and with it the pain of loneliness that comes when you are without your significant other. The film also quite obviously explores themes of sexuality, and covers Elio's journey of self-discovery, an example being the infamous peach scene. Most likely unbeknownst to most of the film's audience is the fact that \u2018Call Me by Your Name' is the final instalment in Luca Guadagnino's Desire trilogy. The triad of films is also comprised of 2009's \u2018I Am Love', starring Tilda Swinton and 2015's \u2018A Bigger Splash', starring Ralph Fiennes, Dakota Johnson, and Matthias Schoenaerts alongside Swinton.\n\nLuca Guadagnino brings a passionate love story to the screen bound alongside a delicate coming of age tale. Brilliant craftmanship and a remarkable screenplay by James Ivory, come together to create a mesmerising viewing experience. The film is an elegant adaptation of Andre Aciman's novel, and it's uncommon to find a film as delicate as this one. Chalamet and Hammer give career-defining performances, never faltering across the 130-minute runtime.",

If I have to remark something is the Timothee Chalamet actig skills, he is really good, and he makes good efforts but weren't enough: the other actor was really bad, there's no even a good chemistry between them. Other things to remark are the locatons and photography and the art pieces that are shown. But then...what? The script was simple, the rithm of the movie, the situations presented, the romance(?) in the end, the secondary actors playing to nothing, just more objects around the couple, a couple that don't have nothing more than TC fighting in his role.",

With a different actor, I would have given 5 stars.\nHaving said that, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is exquisite. The ending scene with the close-up on his face while the music of Sufjan Stevens goes on is just sheer perfection. \nNote for the American audience: don't be shocked by the lack of moral disapproval from Italian movie-goers: in Italy the age of consent is 14.",

The setting is lovely - it's only described as 'somewhere in Northern Italy' and there's some relatively thoughtful dialogue present, although there are some scenes when the characters don't talk too often. I also enjoyed the classical/instrumental music often played in the background, which gives it a somewhat dream-like/floaty feel or sense. I particularly liked the light piano tunes, which had a bit of an ethereal sense to them at times. The characters seem very thoughtful and it's quite an atmospheric film. I would recommend it, yes.",

So much of it feels surreal, but in the right ways. Timothee Chalomet and Armie Hammer both are naturally actors that are tough to like for me (for VERY different reasons mind you), but their work in Call Me By Your Name is pretty undeniably great. Much of the conflict in the movie is implied. It's legitimate conflict at that - acceptance of homosexuality in the 80s was obviously very different than it is now - but the amount to which this is only implied had sort of had a reverse effect on me where it seemed like the movie was overconsumed with what boiled down to \"rich white people problems.\" That coupled with Elio's (Chalomet) surprisingly indulgent and accepting family simply turns this into a summer romance movie. A very good summer romance movie...but something I truly only have so much patience for. Sufjan Stevens' music that's included is a great analog for the movie. Sufjan's music is great albeit being fairly twee. So unless I'm really there for it in the moment, there's only so much I can endure without grumbling to myself \"Okay, come on guy.\"",
