This film could have been ended just in 1 and half hour, but the directors extended the film I think just for audience. CGI was a bit low over all, Amitabh was not suitable for the role he played. Katrina Should learn how to deliver dialogue. Fatima can become a good acting sensation just not yet. Her role in Dangal and then watching her like this is not helping just yet.",

            "content": "Hindi Films have often been guilty of plagiarism and with 2018's biggest box-office disappointment 'Thugs of Hindostan', the idea of originality in the Mumbai-Based industry was in question, once again. This action-adventure period-piece, is undoubtedly adapted from the Hollywood Blockbuster franchise of 'Pirates of the Carribbean'. But, is the film as bad as the critics and the general audience thought it is? My answer - is a NO.Sure, 'Thugs' was slaughtered ever since it's trailer released and the comparisons to Pirates, and it's setting, were of course obvious. So for originality and also for smartness, Director Vijay Krishna Acharya scores less. But is his misfire a terrible film? Absolutely not. 'Thugs' is a predictable ride, but never an unwatchable film. Its got its moments, for sure.Set in the late 1700's, 'Thugs' follows a group of Rebels known as Azaad, led by the commanding Khudabakash (Amitabh Bachchan), who must take down a vicious British Leader (Lloyd Owen). In their pursuit to defeat the British, the rebels are faced with a friend/foe in the form of Firangi Mallah (A delightful Aamir Khan), a rogue who cannot be trusted.'Thugs' is a predictable film, and sadly, barring Firangi's colourful character who changes sides every time and now, there are no surprises here. Even the character of Zafira (Fatima Sana Sheikh)\nand her personal vendetta against the Villain, for having killed her family in front of her eyes, is so 1980's. However, the moments between Firangi and Khudabaksh are engaging and the joy of watching two of Indian Cinema's most respected actors coming together for the first time, cannot be denied.The biggest plus of the enterprise is Aamir's enjoyable portrayal of the anti-hero, who hits all the right-notes, be it Comedic or Sly. The action-sequences are nicely staged, but they aren't exceptional overall. Ajay-Atul's Score is superb and the Production Design is absolutely lavish. The art and costume design are top-notch, as well.The Writing by Acharya could've be stronger, for sure. Considering the amount of talent and money that has been associated with this biggie, Acharya should've made the narrative more arresting and tried on something novel. The Writing isn't bad at all though, it's by the books and works well in some parts. Acharya's Direction is decent. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is fine, but the film feels a little too long at a 160-minutes.Of the cast, barring Aamir, no one really stands out, as they aren't given much to do. Bachchan gets a brilliant intro, but is later given limited lines and scenes, Fatima is just about okay, Katrina Kaif has just 2 songs and 3 scenes throughout the film and Owen does well. In supporting roles, Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub does a sincere job as Firangi's friend and Ronit Roy is wasted as Zahira's father.On the whole, 'Thugs of Hindostan' isn't as bad you have heard it is, but it isn't even as good as it should've been. It's, at best, a fair watch!",

            "content": "Once I saw the massive number of negative reviews, I was ready to cancel my booking but then we couldn't find another movie worth watching (the other was a horror movie and we are not fans of the genre) so we decided to give it a try.The movie was almost three hours long and we did not feel bored even for a second (ok except during the songs to be honest).Common, 3.7 rating??? Worst movie ever?!! The movie is so undeserving of this negativity. It was a highly entertaining movie. We enjoyed the pace, the humor, the setting and the overall feel of the movie. Yes some stunts were obvious and weak but overall it worked. Also, I loved the bird-shots which for some reason people find laughable.\nI do understand that the movie was disappointing to some, as a movie with this high budget and which for the first time ever has two of the biggest Bollywood stars meet in one movie, comes with very high expectations. I do admit that the movie was not deep enough, as I know Indians are very capable of creating complex and emotionally deep movies and plot. As I mentioned, this movie was not deep enough, it was a light adventure movie. The characters as well, were not deep or complex. That did not mean they were unlikable, no. I did like them but we did not feel emotional attachment to any of them. For example, when a major character \"dies\", I felt sad to see him go but not very sad. We did not shed any tears or get goosebumps during any scene in the movie. Also, at no point during the movie I felt the desire to leave. The world the movie created was great/ one that I wanted to be part of. As I said, it was a light adventure and action movie that was entertaining and fun. All three of us left the theater with a smile. The movie achieved its purpose, it entertained.\nAll in all, great entertainment and highly enjoyable movie. Highly Recommended. 8/10.",

            "review_title": "Thugs of Hindostan REVIEW",
            "content": "A great concept needs an equally skillful execution, but not every good story gets the treatment it deserves. Zero has a story with an interesting and inspiring concept that doesn't hold back with its outrageousness. This Meerut-to-Mars romance dabbles with ideas of science, interplanetary travel and closer to home, conventional themes like unrequited and undying love. In doing so, the film tries to put forth too many ideas and doesn't quite do justice to any one. Some of the visuals and romantic moments are striking, but most of them disappear as quickly as a shooting star.\nThe story starts off in Meerut, where Bauua Singh squanders his father's (Tigmanshu Dhulia) money while being besotted with Bollywood superstar Babita Kumari (Katrina Kaif) at all times. He is impulsive and self-absorbed, but his height hardly ever dampens his confidence. Things change dramatically when Bauua stumbles into the highly qualified scientist, Aafia's life. He's vertically-challenged and she suffers from cerebral palsy, so their shortcomings become a common ground and that creates a new space for a relationship between equals. The physical challenges aside, their personalities are also worlds apart and that eventually heightens the drama in the plot. Somewhere along, Bollywood diva Babita Kumari makes an entry into Bauua's life, adding to the drama. The film's first half is spent on setting up this unconventional romance. While the ideas are unique and appreciable, the narrative doesn't connect all the proverbial dots in the arc of the story. The plot of Zero, neither engages you, nor does it offend you.\nThe ideas get a lot more audacious in the second half. Bauua's love story travels to Mumbai for a fantastic tryst with Bollywood. It's here that cameos of B-town's stars surprise you and one of the obvious highlights being the coming together of the two Khans - Salman and Shah Rukh - in the song Issaqbaazi. Moving on, the story travels to the US and goes on a Mars-inspired mission, too. It's here that the graph of the movie and the characters just does not add up. The writing by Himanshu Sharma, has its moments, but it does not translate into the larger-than-life love story that it aspires to be. It swiftly goes hurtling out of orbit and at 2 hours and 25 minutes, the film definitely feels too long drawn.\nThe good part is that director Aanand L Rai's characters never let their physical challenges overpower their spirit and resilience. There's no rocket science to the fact that Shah Rukh pulls off romantic moments and he does that here with charm and intensity. He is excellent as the short but charismatic Bauua in a story that relies highly on special effects. Katrina Kaif appears in a smaller part, but she totally impresses in the performance of a conflicted Bollywood star, who is also heartbroken. Sadly, while Anushka Sharma's character had wonderful potential, the mannerisms employed by the actress to portray the handicap, don't always look consistent or convincing.\nThe same inconsistency plagues the movie, too. At one point, Zero dazzles with moments of colour and vibrancy, but then it also follows up with dull scenes that fail to launch the drama in the zone that it's supposed to be in. Some of the comedy moments between SRK and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub stand out, so does the song Mere Naam Tu with SRK dancing in a storm of colours. While the film has a wealth of references to Bollywood and its stars, these details don't compensate for a story that starts with a beautiful plot, but takes off on a bizarre ride. At first go, the film makes you light and easy, which is good, but the problem is that it doesn't really take you on that flight of entertainment, which you set out for.",

Pay no heed to negative reviews as plenty of them are baseless and they have not watched the movie at all.No, its not like Pirates at all. It may look like coz of the look and feel of the set. But thats the only similarity. I had mixed feelings bcoz of so many negative reviews when I started to watch the movie and just 5 minutes into the movie, I was in complete awe of it.

            "content": "I really don't understand why this movie has gotten so much hate. Just because it features a few ships, it is not a Pirates of Carribean rip-off as some people have said. It does have a few problems but they're not enough to completely derail the film and give it a 3.5/10.PROS: Aamir Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, and Fatima Sana Shaikh. While Amitabh and Fatima did not have much material, every time they were on screen, they were extremely bad-ass and extremely impressive with the stunts in their fight sequences. The two of them also have a nice character arc that I wont spoil. And Aamir Khan is always the best. Just because he acts cheerful and full of energy, doesn't mean he is Jack Sparrow as some people believe. The fight sequences are really, really well-done, especially for a Bollywood movie with amazing fight choreography, realistic looking ships (They were actually built from scratch in Malta) and outstanding visual effects. The VFX were nowhere near as bad as some people have so harshly dismissed so kudos to Vijay Krishna Acharya and DOP Manush Nandan. The background score is great. The songs could have used some work, but the background score is epic and pumps you up with adrenaline. Its generally a feel-good film. If you've had a tough or stressful week, this is the perfect popcorn entertainer that will make you laugh and keep your spirits high with terrific action sequences and good acting.CONS: The story could have been a little more complex. It is a bit generic and something we have seen before, but that does not ruin the film as some people have said. Some of the editing in the fight sequences, at times was a little choppy, but again not enough to tank and ruin the entire film. The fights were great! The characters could have been a bit more complex but the interactions between said characters and their relationships was enough to forgive the mediocre characterization. Katrina Kaif. Kind of have a feeling that the director doesnt like her too much, especially after Dhoom 3. She was pretty good with the material given, except the material was too less. The movie could have been a little shorter.All in all, it is a simple, straightforward story that feels like a summer blockbuster entertainer. Their hard-work should not be dismissed so easily and I feel that people have become very disrespectful when talking about this film. Yes, the story is not the best and there are a few character and editing problems. But the positives of this film most definitely outweigh the negatives and offers a good time in the cinema. And did I mention the stunning action sequences?",

            "content": "I'm certainly no expert of Bollywood films, I'm not familiar with the actresses, actors and director involved and can't compare this movie to any others of this kind. I simply watched the film at the cinema because I like epic pirate movies. The plot summary sounded intriguing, so I watched the trailer which was decent enough for me to give this film a try. I expected a good average entertaining film but what I finally got is one of the best films of the year. I neither understand nor support the numerous exaggeratedly negative reviews for this movie. Watch the trailer instead and decide whether it's decent enough for you to give this film a chance just like I did.The film starts in 1795 when the Indian subcontinent is progressively controlled by British invaders. One of the last few independent, powerful and wealthy kings gets tricked, humiliated and murdered by a ruthless British East India Company officer. His daughter survives the massacre and escapes with a veteran officer. Many years later the daughter has become a skilled fighter and the general has become the leader of a group of thugs who specialize in sea-based warfare and expose a serious challenge to the expanding British East India company. The officer in command who once killed the king wants to find the hiding place of the thugs and kill all of them. Charming, cunning and selfish criminal Firangi Mallah gets caught in this conflict and decides to take advantage of the situation by betraying both sides until his conscience finally comes into play.There are numerous elements I liked about the movie. First of all, the opening sequence is surprisingly brutal, intense and suspenseful and sets the mood for an epic tale of vengeance. Secondly, the locations look absolutely stunning throughout the entire film. Thirdly, the sound and special effects are decent and not as bad as claimed by numerous reviewers. Fourthly, the story comes around with numerous twists and turns without ever getting too exaggerated. Fifthly, the film finds the right balance between facts and fancy with its historical references and supports values such as independence, liberty and loyalty. Sixthly, the movie takes the time it needs to tell its story of epic proportions instead of rushing it and you truly get value for money if you buy a movie ticket. Seventhly, the diversified characters are particularly intriguing, especially the philosophical former veteran officer and leader of the thugs, the cold-blooded company officer and the expressive criminal. Eighthly, the acting performances are great and especially Aamir Khan is as versatile as it gets and reminds me of Johnny Depp in his best years. Ninethly, the film has several similarities to the Pirates of the Carribean franchise but is not only better than that franchise that overstayed its welcome but also adds its very own twist to it in form of the costumes, dances and locations. Tenthly and finally, I'm usually not a fan of dance and song choreographies in movies but since this element is only present on three occasions in a film with a running time of nearly three hours and gives the film its unique Bollywood identity, I actually appreciated it for once.Some people might rate my review down, not because it's badly written or because its content is useless but because they might disagree with my opinion and reasoning which only discredits these critics that already gave this film a bad name it didn't deserve. If you like epic pirate movies, you can't get around watching Thugs of Hindostan which turns out being one of the best films of its kind and one of the most entertaining movies of the year. Grab some popcorn, invite a few friends and enjoy this epic experience to the fullest.",

That's perhaps the only saving grace. Still, not his best work at all. The opening was fairly decent. Some parts were visually appealing. .\n.\nBad : This movie is just absolutely bad. The role of Khudabaksh could've been given to any B grade actor. Bachchan was wasted as Khudabaksh. It was a shameless ripoff of Pirates of the Caribbean. Okay, I can tolerate that. But, that's not all. It has the same old Indian rebels vs Angrez storyline which has grown stale over the years, and it doesn't even try to make it more interesting. Instead, it gives us lamer version of that storyline. It also jinxed some promising characters, but like in almost every Bollywood mainstream film, it makes a parody out of it and books it completely over the top, if the initial characterization wasn't much of something called \"over the top\". The action scenes look super fake. There are sword fights, and not a single drop of blood. We can clearly see the swords going under the armpits (THAT'S VIJAY KRISHNA ACHARYA FOR YOU). It is too laughably bad. The character of Amir Khan feels like too much. He continues to trade sides between Angrez and Indians, to the point where it feels absolutely nauseating and to every point beyond that. You would want to scream \"pleaaase, stop\". There is one gigantic \"twist\" in the film. But, if you have seen any of these stupid masala entertainers, you can predict it. Since they won't kill of a major character, the twist becomes trivially predictable. That's how lame this is. There is no character development to understand why some characters get their mind changed, except for the fact that they wanted to include a cheap shock value. Katrina Kaif serves her usual purpose of showing her skin for some sexually appealing scenes and dancing in a semi nude costume. Other than that, she is a plot device. And her acting is too good. Even a mannequin gives more expressions than her. The story is crazy and lame. It looks too big, but is the same old stupidity. If you want to see an Angrez vs Indian film, watch \"Kranti\" (1981), not this garbage.Conclusion : If you are a fan of Amitabh or Amir, check out this film, because it may be the only film in which they both are together. But except for their mere presence, do not expect anything. It sucks big time. Otherwise, do anything productive. Spend your time locking yourself in the bathroom doing nothing, rather than watching this movie.Rating.Score : 0/10Grade : F",

            "content": "Before I watched this movie, all I heard and saw were negative reviews - which made it hard to sit on the padded sea of the cinema without prejudice for an apparently bad movie.But, I kept waiting for the movie to get slow/ stale/ boring - but it never happened!!! Thugs of Hindostan is a fantastic action flick with a production and direction team that has not been scared to take bold steps to direct the Bollywood industry to a newer, more conceptual artform.To make it really simple, I will summarize this movie in a series of highlights (pros) and dampeners (cons):Highlights:Note: First things first - this movie is nothing like Pirates of Carribean and follows it's own original theme and storyline, So, I encourage all those thinking this is a remake of Pirate of the Carrieban to please go to the cinema and o be proven wrong.1. Amitabh Bachchan has outdone himself in this role. His character is strong, uncompromising and very convincing. His acting has matured majestically with age. His role was very reminiscent of Optimus Prime in this movie in all the good ways.2. Aamir Khan always exceeds expectations in any role he is given - so much so that if a film fails, it as never because of him, but due to other factors surrounding the movie. It is hard to imagine anyone else doing this role with the ease and charisma that Aamir has done it. His coyness and personality is the base for all suspense of this movie an he portrays his uncharacteristic nature of being unpredictable beautifully in this movie.3. Background Score - The movie's background score is a perfect complement to the vibe and look of the movie. It is a sort of a beautiful amalgamation of SHerlock Holmes meets POTC meets Lagaan. It is melodic, it is engrossing and it is perfect.Dampeners (cons):1. Katrina Kaif - I feel bad that a wonderful actress who has done her part beautifully in the movie was let down by the nubile character of her role that just seems to exist to be an item number in the movie and pave the way for some racy songs.That being said, her dance was mind blowing where she was able to exhibit the levels of which he had trained for the movie. She handled some particularly daring steps an techniques with such grace and ease. But - though it was impressive, it wasn't mind blowing as it was supposed to be. It has nothing to do with Katrina's dancing or acting - but poor costume choice/ choreography that just seemed to distance itself from the music and to exhibit more skin. The songs she was in felt like such a deviation from the rest of the movie.2. Stunts involving high/ long leaps : Bollywood has reached a level of amazing graphical capabilities and this movie is one of the testaments to it. The sea, sailing, ships and action sequences were believable and did not seem too artificial like the usual Bollywood norm. But =, the industry still seems lacking to manage long and high leaps of the actors and the editing shifting into multiple shots from the time a person starts the jump to when he lands and gets up seems artificial and interfered with the flow of an otherwise good action sequence throughout the movie.Summary: ToH is a movie that is designed to entertain all the emotional aspects of the spectrum and not to be taken too seriously. It is fun for all ages and has a little bit of everything. It is a movie that will give you goosebumps at the right moments and actually manages some decent laughs due to it's sense of humor that is carried around Aamir's character.Go without expectations to the cinema and wear a sweater (as it is around 3 hours long) and you will come out with that good feeling you get when you do only one of 3 things - watching a good movie/ after having a good meal/ after emptying a full bladder.CHeers.\n22 out of 40 found this helpful",

Yes, Amir Khan's character has shades of Jack Sparrow, but they are completely different characters. Hats off to Mr. Bachchan for physically going thru the stunts he did at his age, phenomenal effort from him. Building two ships and actually having solid fights choreographed needs to be appreciated. The canvas for this movie is big. Overall I think this movie, even though the plot is predictable, is a fun watch if it is watched for what it is supposed to be - a masala entertainer.",

It is an honest attempt at a real, authentic film. People are complaining because it's not \"original\" and that's reasonable... I will admit it's a little generic. But it's not a horrible film and there's a lot to admire. The visual FX, the sets, the acting, and visible passion in the films making uplifted me.Although this film is not Aamir Khan's best, it is unfair to call it \"crap\". Crap is pretty much most of Indian Cinema (Race, Dhoom 3, Bang Bang, Housefull, are some examples of Bollywood's many abominations). But every now and then Indian filmmakers make an honest attempt to catch up with their Hollywood counterparts. This is what this is. More Indian filmmakers need to take this route. I swear if I see another \"Son or Sardar\" or \"Singh is Bling\" I'm going to boycott Bollywood. We need to see more honest and rich films like this.",

Then my wife & I thought lets bear this flick for an hour or till intermission & leave.At intermission we asked each other \"where are those unbearable demons in this movie\". We found the first half engaging & decent. Second half wasnt as smooth as the first half. Especially the sequence of Manzoor-e-khuda. They were trying to create a Rajiv Rai moment of tridev & vishwatma where the lead lady dances in front of the villain & builds up the climax but that doesn't happen here hence that song & esp Kat's role was one thing that the movie could have done without. It would have helped in trimming the overall length.Aamir was flawless, his role is brilliant so is Fatima & Big B. The other flaw i felt is the Gora actors speaking hindi among themselves now had this been a Bhai movie i guess everyone would have overlooked, but Thugs being an Aamir Khan movie lets you down there coz of the standard of narration of rationality shown in Lagaan & Mangal Pandey. Music is BAD. The background score & VFX are decent.Overall Thugs is a decent movie. I wouldn't say its a must watch. You can watch it or miss it, but It surely isn't the one that deserves so much of bashing.",

            "content": "2018 was a fantastic year for Bollywood thanks to movies like Padman, Padmaavat, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, Stree, Parmanu, Raid, Tumbbad, AndhDhun , Badhaai Ho etc. Unfortunate part is that we do have movies like Race 3, Namastey England which are repeated and outdone while the essence of the flavor is dying. Thugs Of Hindostan belongs to the second list which tries hard to entertain you but falls flat on the face.Thugs Of Hindostan tells the story of Khudabaksh (Amitabh Bachchan ), who fights against British empire for a free independent India. He is supported by his adopted daughter, Zafira (Fatima Sana Shaikh). Being opposed by strong army of Khudabaksh, the British Empire hires Firangi (Aamir Khan), to fight for them and defeat Khudabaksh.From the director of terrible films like Tashan and Dhoom 3, Vijay Krishna Achrya gives you yet another disappointing film. So much was expected from Thugs Of Hindostan but the lousy direction , insensible screenplay and terrible editing gives you a headache which you never asked especially from a star like Aamir Khan. The good news is that Thugs Of Hindostan is better than craps like Dhoom 3 and Tashan as it has visually appealing CGI with some amazing action sequences. I loved the background score which gels well with the mood of the film. The entry scene of Amitabh Bachchan is classy while Aamir Khan does well in the first half. However, his frequent change of party, though was nice to some extent , was leading to boredom eventually. I wanted to ask him after working hard so much for Dangal in 2016, what made him choose this script which required to prepare for 2 years.The plot is weak while the length of the film spoils the entire mood of the film. Music is another complete letdown. Art direction and cinematography is mind blowing. Amitabh Bachchan does well but does not get much scope to show his skills. Aamir Khan does raise few laughs but much was expected from the actor of his stature. Fatima Sana Shaikh does well in her role as Zafira. Katrina Kaif as usual is used for glamour purpose and is wasted.Overall, Thugs Of Hindostan is loud, lousy and unconvincing. Not recommended. 2/5",

There are far\nWorse movies out there that deserve the 3/10 score much more than this one. Aamir Khans acting for one was very refreshing. It was a difficult role to play, and despite some really lousy direction and dialogue, he did a fantastic job. I thought the overall story wasn't bad, the period/pirate setting was good as well (could've done without the Jack Sparrow inspiration and slaps though). But it was the direction and execution that just was of very very low quality. On top of that they were way too ambitious with CGI and action sequences given their skills, and that backfired.Overall a decent story line, fantastic acting by Aamir, but let down by terrible direction and dialogue. Aamir and the audience should probably stay away from this director as a general rule.",

All other supporting actors did really good work especially the british ruler Clive and his general and Zeeshan Ayub too as always.\nThe big setback is the same old known story used in the movie so nothing in it to make you feel excited. All the songs are boring to watch honestly and not related too much to the movie. Still i give it a 6 star in order to do justice to the actors who have done well in the movie. I can understand the frustration of the viewers as they expected too much from the movie and hence the underrated star ratings more out of frustration.",

From the storyline to acting(both by Amir and Amitabh) and visuals( not look like dominated by CGI, it's digestible), costumes everything was good enough. I have liked the movie for the entire period, from starting to end, for a single moment haven't felt bored. And please don't compare it with \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\". It has nothing to do with that movie, primary storyline is completely different (except you yourself try to recall that movie while watching this!!! that's your problem, it's kiddish).

Entertained because the set and sound design were epic, at least by Bollywood standards, the somewhat corny but emotional scenes and dialogues were satisfying and the action sequences were convincingly choreographed.Having said this, the movie has it's flaws and takes a bit of a nose dive in the second half. Character development, in such a lengthy movie, is lacking and the sloppy editing in the second half of the movie takes a toll on the viewers. Some inexplicable annoyances such as the Britisher's torturous accents, the Falcon's refusal to once land on Big B's forearm (lol) and the casting director's decision to include a very dull and unlikable actor such as Zeeshan Ayyub take away from an otherwise entertaining package. Katrina, who ain't no Smita Patil when it comes to actings chops, plays the eye candy role well, in all but the 2.5 times we get to see her. Big B, while too wooden most of the times, bar when he abruptly becomes light-footed after a drink, carries his role with aplomb and is believable as a loyal battle worn, very very very old angry man. Aamir Khan, while overshadowed by Big B many a times, grows on you and is both likeable and charming. I personally did not find Fatima impressive. She could not pull off the dilemma of having to portray the role of a young revenge-seeking, perma-seething warrior and the potential love interest of Aamir Khan. Could not shake off the feeling that something aint right about this pairing, right after Dangal.Hyper bashing big budget movies, especially Khan movies, is a recent trend amongst critics and social media pundits. Keeping in mind the cast and the budget, yes it could have been a lot better, perhaps were it helmed by a more adept director. But do yourself a favour and go watch this movie with lowered expectations and there are good chances that you too will come out entertained and slightly baffled at the negative reviews plaguing this movie.",

            "content": "The huge anticipation with this movie now finally comes to an end. Although there are a whole lot of negative reviews, it is just absurd to spread this whole negativity about this movie. Maybe because people have watched too much of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" series and would have expected this film to be better than that, or to beat it and other highly action-adventure \"Hollywood Movies\" with it, or to even compare it with the \"Baahubali Franchise\" is just bizarre. Every film has its own fate and it's unfair to compare such movies and thereby undermining the efforts of the people behind this movie.Of course, it may not be that \"Ground-Breaking\" or \"Marvellous\" as one would expect from an \"Aamir Khan Movie\" all the time but just because he's given some amazing films in the recent past which were \"socially relevant\". But that doesn't mean that every film of his would have a social stigma or a message attached to it. He's an actor after all at the end of the day and he carries his profession well i.e. to \"entertain\" the audience to the fullest.Coming to the film now, its a \"fictional story\" which depicts the history of India and their journey of rebellion from the rulers during the \"Colonial Era\". Although the plot of the film may not be \"novel\" or \"unique\", which again, is expected from an \"Aamir Khan film\" and if people had expected that, then it isn't the case this time. It is an \"action-adventure\" movie which delivers \"pure entertainment\".There is nothing extra in terms of \"Storyline\" as it revolves around the rebellion for \"Freedom\" but what makes the movie engaging is the high-octane drama, intense action sequences and wonderful performances!!And coming to the performances, \"Aamir Khan\" is just charming as always!! I think he has played his most \"complex character\" to date. He is just ruthless and conniving. He surprises you and even shocks you in most of the sequences but also manages to deliver chuckles and laughs simultaneously and that is the \"biggest strength\" of his character. \"Mr.Perfectionist\" perfectly dwells in his character, yet again, as always, no two opinions on that!!\"Amitabh Bachchan\" was, is, and will always remain a \"LEGEND\" for generations to come!! And he proves it to a large, large extent with this film!! Your jaw would simply drop when you would see him in action, which is just superb!! Especially the \"face-off\" between Aamir Khan and Amitabh Bachchan takes the movie to another level altogether!! Their chemistry is fantastic and would be remembered for a long time!! Sir, you are phenomenal!!\"Katrina Kaif\" has again(like \"Dhoom 3\") a smaller role in this film. But she is \"highly effective\" and a force to reckon with when it comes to \"Dancing\". I think she has simply \"Mastered\" the field of \"Dancing\" to another level and it's yet to be seen if any other actress would be able to match up to her dancing skills!! Kudos to her effective portrayal!!\"Fatima Sana Shaikh\" has an equally effective on-screen presence!! She manages to stand on her own feet in some of the sequences which is admirable!!\"Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub\" comes as a wonderful surprise!!\"Lloyd Owen\" is decent as the \"antagonist\".Direction is really good when it comes to action-adventure scenes and the visual effects just enhances it further!!As far as \"Soundtrack\" is concerned, it doesn't have many songs but I loved \"Manzoor-E-Khuda\" and \"Suraiyya\" after that.Although the movie gets predictable at some points but it also gets unpredictable at the other. Its a good entertaining film which would be loved by the masses. Even families can enjoy it.Keeping aside the \"Box-office\" and \"Criticism\", this film has its own charm and flavour which is meant to be enjoyed and perhaps \"Diwali\" was the \"Best Occasion\" in which it got released.It may not be that good compared to other movies of \"Aamir Khan\" but one should remember that movies are for entertainment, and this movie delivers that!!Way better than most of the other movies which have underperformed. Hoping that it becomes a success!",

            "content": "Before I watched this movie, all I heard and saw were negative reviews - which made it hard to sit on the padded sea of the cinema without prejudice for an apparently bad movie.But, I kept waiting for the movie to get slow/ stale/ boring - but it never happened!!! Thugs of Hindostan is a fantastic action flick with a production and direction team that has not been scared to take bold steps to direct the Bollywood industry to a newer, more conceptual artform.To make it really simple, I will summarize this movie in a series of highlights (pros) and dampeners (cons):Highlights:Note: First things first - this movie is nothing like Pirates of Carribean and follows it's own original theme and storyline, So, I encourage all those thinking this is a remake of Pirate of the Carrieban to please go to the cinema and o be proven wrong.1. Amitabh Bachchan has outdone himself in this role. His character is strong, uncompromising and very convincing. His acting has matured majestically with age. His role was very reminiscent of Optimus Prime in this movie in all the good ways.2. Aamir Khan always exceeds expectations in any role he is given - so much so that if a film fails, it as never because of him, but due to other factors surrounding the movie. It is hard to imagine anyone else doing this role with the ease and charisma that Aamir has done it. His coyness and personality is the base for all suspense of this movie an he portrays his uncharacteristic nature of being unpredictable beautifully in this movie.3. Background Score - The movie's background score is a perfect complement to the vibe and look of the movie. It is a sort of a beautiful amalgamation of SHerlock Holmes meets POTC meets Lagaan. It is melodic, it is engrossing and it is perfect.Dampeners (cons):1. Katrina Kaif - I feel bad that a wonderful actress who has done her part beautifully in the movie was let down by the nubile character of her role that just seems to exist to be an item number in the movie and pave the way for some racy songs.That being said, her dance was mind blowing where she was able to exhibit the levels of which he had trained for the movie. She handled some particularly daring steps an techniques with such grace and ease. But - though it was impressive, it wasn't mind blowing as it was supposed to be. It has nothing to do with Katrina's dancing or acting - but poor costume choice/ choreography that just seemed to distance itself from the music and to exhibit more skin. The songs she was in felt like such a deviation from the rest of the movie.2. Stunts involving high/ long leaps : Bollywood has reached a level of amazing graphical capabilities and this movie is one of the testaments to it. The sea, sailing, ships and action sequences were believable and did not seem too artificial like the usual Bollywood norm. But =, the industry still seems lacking to manage long and high leaps of the actors and the editing shifting into multiple shots from the time a person starts the jump to when he lands and gets up seems artificial and interfered with the flow of an otherwise good action sequence throughout the movie.Summary: ToH is a movie that is designed to entertain all the emotional aspects of the spectrum and not to be taken too seriously. It is fun for all ages and has a little bit of everything. It is a movie that will give you goosebumps at the right moments and actually manages some decent laughs due to it's sense of humor that is carried around Aamir's character.Go without expectations to the cinema and wear a sweater (as it is around 3 hours long) and you will come out with that good feeling you get when you do only one of 3 things - watching a good movie/ after having a good meal/ after emptying a full bladder.CHeers.",

This movie truly deserves to b seen on a big screen.\nIt was very obvious from the trailer that this film is more of a popcorn entertainment n nothing more nothing less.\nThe most impressive part of the movie is\nthe slimy character, Firangi Malla n Aamir nailed it with perfection.\nThey shud make a prequel on the character Firangi n a sequel based on the adventures of Firangi in England.\nAamir is great in the role, playing it with a lot of fun n energy.\nMr Bachan's screen presence is towering man. His voice, his dialogue delivery n his acting n energy level is powerful.\nIs this guy on testosterone shots or creatine monohydrate?\nKatrina was looking bad with her bad lip job.\nFatima cudnt deliver the dialogues properly.\nThe song Vashmalle is fun n the dance style n hand movements r too good.

And thanks to awfully generic musical score and skill-less camera work, not a very good one.Didn't (couldn't) watch the whole movie, but I can't remember the last time where I thought Aamir Khan was difficult to watch. Amitabh Bachchan's role could have literally been replaced with a cardboard cutout. Ronit Roy's performance felt a little better, but still nothing compared to what he's capable of.In short, it didn't seem like anyone put any heart into the movie.",

To start with, the movie is extremely long, slow, boring & lacks a good storyline. The cinematography looks like a cheap copy of Pirates of the Caribbean. Aamir Khan's himself looks like trying to pull off a Johnny Depp from the Hollywood hit. Amitabh Bachchan performance is dull and nothing you would remember the next day. Fatima Sana Shaikh is bad & I have no clue what was Katrina Kaif doing in the movie. Even her dance numbers look like a copy of the moves she had in the song Kamli. The performance of the support cast is not worth mentioning. Direction is absolutely ordinary. Songs are horrible!\nThe only decent thing about the movie are the last 30 minutes. The twist & turns are interesting but slowly becomes predictable. Certain dialogues are also funny.\nHowever, the bottom line is, give this one a skip. No point spending your money on this one.\nTips for the director: India is not an Island nation! What are so many ships doing in the movie \ud83e\udd14? Whatever it is, boats & ships are not & was never the primary mode of transportation within our country. Crazy!!!",

Two Legends of Bollywood Cinema comes together for Never Seen Before Action Adventure, i didn't mind with the tagline but Legends should come together for a Project which deserves to be the Valid reason of thier collaboration. Director should have thought about it, if he was bringing two legends together for the first time which is a Huge Responsibility or burden would be a good word, then he should worked carefully on Writing and Direction rather than just focussing on Action Spectacles.Thugs Of Hindostan starts on a dull note then Amitabh's entry fills the enthusiasm. Aamir's character Firangi is well written but not well executed. Action scenes are Brilliant and Grand, masses Will surely love it. Even the Background music is Excellent but it was used at some wrong moments which might irritate. The biggest problem with TOH is the pace and fashion of Storytelling where Vijay Krishna Acharya has always failed whether it is Tashan or Dhoom 3. Acting wise Aamir tries too much but the execution doesn't let him reach that height, Amitabh Bachchan has one of the best entry scene for any actor with 60+ age but again bad writing of character in 2nd half doesn't leave an impact. Fatima as Zafira fulfills the requirements of the genre. Katrina hardly has 10-12 Minutes screenspace and even those are covered by Songs. You might feel like is Katrina lost or what, does she have a Guest Appearance in this long 164 minutes screenplay? Music of the film is situational so the Video of the songs works better than audio. 'Suraiyya' is Funny and Kiddish, 'Vashmalle' and 'Manzoor E Khuda' have real situations to be watched. Cinematography is Very Good, watch out for the Action scenes from every different angle. Director Vijay Krishna Acharya repeats the same mistake again with the narrative, more than content and execution he cared about Large scale. There was no need of giving BGM to almost every scene after action finishes, there was no need of stretching the narrative to 165 minutes which could have been told in 120 minutesh with much more tight grip and impact.Overall, Thugs Of Hindostan is just made to please the mad masses and stays far away from quality. Keeping expectations on lower side has actually helped me to review this film otherwise if i look from Aamir's standard then this one is his 2nd mistake after Dhoom 3 in this decade. At Box Office it might enjoy good rushes till the festival period gets over but afterwards it will struggle big time. In Final Words, Thugs Of Hindostan is just another mass film in Bollywood to watch once, enjoy action and forget it quickly before you reach home. I am going with 4/10* same as Dhoom 3.",

After watching a movie I thought to check ratings here and what I read here is totally different than what the movie is all about.First of all let me clear that here I am NOT to show sympathy to stars or director of movie.Why I gave 9:-Guys, it is not a Pirates of Caribbean so people/characters in this movie are not born for just one type of movie series.I am a big big fan of hollywood movies but I know that I should not compare Animation, VFX and effect of bollywood with hollywood. I don't know how much other reviewers here knows about VFX and all and it's technical terms.Whatever I saw in trailer it got all covered before intermission So I was really excited for second half and it was really good.Here our khudabaksh is though 76 years and his moves, expressions, feelings to plotted character is really jaw dropping. Fatima Sana Shaikh an action lady is not at all standing back of her performance. A perfect cast for her place no doubt. She was not my favourite till today. Katrina, an item for movie- play & leave. Amir Khan (not Johnny Depp). Once a Mr.Perfect always a Mr.Perfect. No need to say anything else.\nWhy not 10:-\n1. High level story could be better instead of Old Style \"taking revenge of lost family\" type storyline.2. Firangi's Dialogues could be improved instead of repeating only one style of sentence.That's it from my side.Go and watch Amitabh Bachchan seen never before.

Aamir Khan's character is the Indian version of Jack Sparrow and he has put in effort for it but due to bad writing or direction, his character tries to be unpredictable but end up predictable. Rest of the characters are the stereotypical mentor(Amitabh Bachchan), Vengeful Daughter (Fatima Shaikh), Comedy relief sidekick, and Katrina Kaif is just there. The movie may pass as entertaining for many( And it does have some moments) but for people who are only going to watch this movie on Aamir Khan's previous body of work may not enjoy this movie. As some one who has seen Pirates of the Caribbean and the much better movies of Aamir Khan I did not enjoy this movie and have wasted my money on it. So I do not recommend this movie for theater, you can watch on TV and judge for yourself then and save that money for other better movies.

If you did, then you're at fault since it's meant to entertain and exhilarate the viewer with its action sequences, visuals, music, comedy and fun apart from memorable characters. Thugs is a light hearted action adventure with no vulgarity or obscenity and is a film families will relish. Don't expect it to be dark or extremely serious because it never was meant to be.Among the cast, Amitabh Bachchan deserves a huge round of applause for his action hero role written efficiently. I really had goosebumps the moment he entered. His energy shows up in the action sequences and parts where he gets some of the best lines in the film. Aamir Khan has played his part very effectively. His character is surprisingly complex and his comic timing is fun. He also excels in the action sequences, and so does Fatima Sana Shaikh, who gets a lot of white knuckle action scenes to perform. Katrina is just there, but is decent. Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub evokes great laughs.Screenplay is neatly written and editing is top notch. Music is good. Action sequences are electrifying. Cinematography and visual effects are splendid.Thugs of Hindostan is meant to entertain, and it succeeds in doing that. It's a fun, colorful action-adventure epic which will not let you down.

He simply stole the show and breathed life into its character despite the fact it was a ripoff of Jack Sparrow.There is no doubt that VKA is a visionary director and has the guts to pull of projects like TOH, however original story and character are vital to separate Bollywood from Hollywood and to rake in fair reviews from critics and audiencesIn a nutshell this movie is a entertainer and nothing more and let me clarify this is not the worst movie of Aamir Khan.

This might go into one of the worst Bollywood films in 2018 with Race 3. I didn't expect Mr. Perfectionist plays in this film. with a budget of more than 200 Crores, I think this film is very bad, and doesn't feature interesting stories.

If you did, then you're at fault since it's meant to entertain and exhilarate the viewer with its action sequences, visuals, music, comedy and fun apart from memorable characters. Thugs is a light hearted action adventure with no vulgarity or obscenity and is a film families will relish. Don't expect it to be dark or extremely serious because it never was meant to be.Among the cast, Amitabh Bachchan deserves a huge round if applause for his action hero role written efficiently. I really had goosebumps the moment he entered. His energy shows up in the action sequences and parts where he gets some of the best lines in the film. Aamir Khan has played his part very effectively. His character is surprisingly complex and his comic timing is fun. He also excels in the action sequences, and so does Fatima Sana Shaikh, who gets a lot of white knuckle action scenes to perform. Katrina is just there, but is decent. Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub evokes great laughs.Screenplay is neatly written and editing is top notch. Music is good. Action sequences are electrifying. Cinematography and visual effects are splendid.Thugs of Hindostan is meant to entertain, and it succeeds in doing that. It's a fun, colorful action-adventure epic which will not let you down.

And as for the movie, it has a good first half with some awesome scenes, pre-interval scene was very good. Second half is about decent. The negatives in the film is the length, usually I like lengthy films but if they are long for no reason then it becomes a problem. Some scenes are way too stretched and has too many dialogues. The action, VFX, cinematography and the scale of the film is amazing. Aamir Khan is the one who mostly carries the film with his entertaining character. Amitabh Bachchan is as usual very good, his entry will give you goosebumps. Katrina Kaif is horrible. She's just there in two songs which were good songs but other than that she has 3 scenes in the whole movie and her acting is so bad in those scenes. Her lips look too big here, her mouth looked weird when she spoke. Fatima Sana Sheikh is good in the action scenes but her dialogue delivery wasn't good, was expecting a good performance after I saw her in Dangal. The background music of the film is awesome. And now coming to the direction, Vijay Krishna Acharya has made two films before this - Tashan and Dhoom 3. Now I personally didn't mind Tashan as I thought it was a good entertainer, however the film didn't do well. And I loved Dhoom 3, yes it has illogical scenes and a lot of people had issues with that film but I really liked it. Especially my first viewing of the film was an awesome experience. Now I've realised that Victor (director) is a very commercial director, he makes movies that are for entertainment. And Thugs is no different, though the film does drop pace in places, but overall it is a good time pass which can be enjoyed with family. Critics are being way too harsh on this one. Watch it for yourself and you might enjoy it. I'd give it 7/10.",

Unlike what many may think, this movie did not have any similarities to Pirates of the Caribbean. At least not intentionally. It was set in a time period where clothing and attire, were similar to PotC.Another negative would be the role of Katrina Kaif. Can't wait for the day when the need for Bollywood to continue to celebrate or depict the objectification of women. The songs itself (with Katrina) were unnecessary and didn't fit with the movie at all. I was cringing.Fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives.The character of Zafira required the confidence of a warrior coupled with the poise of a royal. Fatima Sheik effortlessly emulated utter grace and panache in her acting skills as Zafira. Amir Khan as Firangi did wonders as always and managed to stand shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Bachchan's legendary personna. Although watching Mr. Bachchan (who is over 70 years of age) taking on a physically challenging role such as that of \"Azaad\", makes one want to hit the gym stat!The visual stunts looked as real as they could be and the editing was well timed. To seal the deal, the costumes and makeup were stunning.If someone were to delve into the accounts this movie is inspired from, it would help understand the filmmakers vision and creators' execution. A definite must watch.",

The ship sequences are stunning.\nIf you forgive and forget this, there is a treat waiting in the form of 'Firangi', a character which is very well written with dollops of humour and genuinely funny moments, with various plot twists-n-turns (which work to a certain extent). I went with low expectations, but found myself laughing on many occasions and Aamir is just brilliant in this act, something I had not expected. Watch it only for him !\nKatrina is mainly there for the song-n-dance sequences (although she dances and acts fab, hers is more of a Guest-appearance and her fans will be disappointed, as there should have been more of her), Amitabh is a treat to watch and Fatima's performance is good but functional. Zeeshan Ayub was good, although we wanted more.\nThe actions sequences are good however get repetitive, music sounds jaded and faded, screenplay lengthy (people took breaks during songs), non-existent storyline and direction should have been more 'spot-on' given the scale (hence budget) of film, credibility of having a stellar cast and due to the fact that YRF backing this film.It is a movie that \"could\" have been a game-changer. Inspite of the criticism, one must give credit to the makers to attempt something grand in Bollywood and the effort is to be lauded. It is a one-time watch and does entertain in many parts !",

            "content": "I saw this film abroad with an English friend. And we both enjoyed. It is an action film from first scene to the end continously, very hollywood style for that reason. It is also realistic to 18th century, and with wonderful visuals and poetic at times.Action plots were good as you never know what is going on in the mind of character played by Aamir in the movie. The usual bollywood emotional overdone melodrama wasn't there and usual boy singing to girl wasn't there so people need to be open to an action film set in a historic time.Katrina had not much to do other than ydance which suits the story, and the main actress is Fatima I would say. Fatima is superb and a fresh breath of energy in today's bollywood as her action sequences were amazing and suits the character who is trained just for that since childhood in the movie. She is almost in all scenes with Aamir and Amitabh. And Aamir and Amitabh played roles very well.Each scene is with action and is gripping. It is a different kind of film in bollywood. I particularly liked the introduction scene for Fatima when she along with Amitabh were pretending to be a huge statue and they start action sequence.Aamir's inner fight between being the good guy or bad guy keeps everyone guessing every moment what he would do next.And the visuals and effects were perfect as should be realistically in 18th century. It's not some fantasy movie like Pirates of Carribean or Bahuballi where things need to be larger than life as story demands that there. People should go with an open mind and appreciate for what this film is and how fun action packed sequences they have created. Amir's character may be inspired from Johny Depp, but it fits this character of film well where he is always confused about being a good guy or bad guy. When you watch the film, you see if differently.I am glad I watched the film. I just hope everyone stops following what some people started saying, and give credit to alot of hardwork put in by actors as Amitabh too, who was a pleasure to watch as you hardly get to see him do action and roles like in the younger days. I usually don't write reviews but I felt compelled to write, as a few people in media seem to have started the trend for negative feedbacks and everyone is just looking at movie with that mindset. Keep an open mind, and you will enjoy. This movie certainly doesn't deserve such backlash from public. It is very entertaining.",

            "content": "Thugs of Hindostan is a 2018 Indian Hindi-language epic action-adventure film, written and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, and produced by Aditya Chopra under his banner Yash Raj Films.\nThugs of Hindostan was released during the week of the Diwali festival, on 8 November 2018. Upon release, the film received generally negative reviews; while critics praised the performances of Bachchan and Khan, Acharya's direction and screenplay were criticized. The film recorded the highest first-day collection and highest two-day collection for any Hindi film in India, and the fourth biggest opening weekend in India. As of 13 November 2018, Thugs of Hindostan has grossed 220.19 crore($33.49 million) at the worldwide box office. It has also recovered approximately 170 crore ($26.11 million) from satellite, digital and music rights.\nAction, adventure and fantasy is a genre that you associate with Hollywood's big-ticket movies. So to watch India's answer to films like Pirates Of The Caribbean, at the onset, seemed like a novel experience. While Thugs Of Hindostan has the aspirations to be a big-budget entertainer, it can't quite emulate the same thrills of a Johnny Depp swashbuckler. The film has the look and feel.of a top grade adventure film but the lacklustre writing and the tedious narrative dampens the whole experience.\nThe story begins in the late 1700s, where a conniving British officer named Clive deceives the honest king Mirza and dupes him off his family, life and kingdom. The young princess Zafira is the only one who escapes, along with the king's trusted guard Khudabaksh, and many years later they form a gang of pirates who are basically a bunch of goodfellas. Their only mission is to get their kingdom free from Clive and his Company rule. Thugs Of Hindostan is based during the British rule in India, when the English used their trading position to dominate India's princely states. But the fact that the heroes of this tale are pirates, doesn't quite fit into the Indian context, given that Indians never gained notoriety as pirates. The Maratha navy under leaders like Kanhoji Angre did gain bandit status during the 1700s, but Thugs Of Hindostan (TOH) doesn't quite look like it's a story emerging from the coastal regions of the country. Historical inaccuracy aside, TOH is an adventure movie and you need cinematic liberty to setup a swashbuckling story. While the production design by Sumit Basu and cinematography by Manush Nandan are excellent, the predictable nature of the writing by writer / director Vijay Krishna Acharya doesn't help the movie at all. You can guess every plot development and the fact that the movie doesn't throw up a single good surprise or twist, just rocks the boat. The tiresome screenplay features scenes that are too prolonged and overtly dramatised, as a result the story hits choppy waters. What's also funny is that the British officers speak in fluent Hindi, even when they're talking to each other.\nAnother disappointing aspect of the movie is the music by Ajay-Atul, that doesn't add to the narrative. While the individual performances by Aamir Khan and Amitabh Bachchan are noteworthy, the rest of the cast just never comes together. Aamir is good with the physical comedy and banter, however an Aamir Khan film generally comes with mammoth expectations, so will the disappointment of this movie leave his fans high and dry and impact his brand value, only time will tell. Mr Bachchan pulls-off the heroics and the intense dialogues well, but the rest of the cast isn't able to rally up any serious effort. Katrina Kaif is limited to two songs and a few lines of dialogue, while Fatima Sana Shaikh is left at the mercy of some badly choreographed action sequences.\nApart from the stray funny moments and consistently good visuals (thanks to decent CGI efforts), TOH doesn't really have the punch or the thrill that is required to pull off a film of this scale. At 2 hours and 45 minutes, the film feels a little too long, blame it on weak editing. The grand canvas of the film does hold sway in terms of the visual experience, but at the end, this one is all show and shallow in substance. If you are expecting TOH to give you a dose of entertainment this festive season, this one will leave you all at sea.",

Any excitement or tension that is created in a scene does not last.\nThe slowmotion releases every feeling that you have at that moment.\nBecause there is too much of it, any scene that contains tension, your sub conscience expects the slowmotion to happen, so you don't feel the tension at all.The background music did not make the scenes work,\nWhen there was playfulness or funniness in the scene, the music was dramatic.\nWhen there was tension in the scene or fighting, the music did not convey excitement but drama. Decisions as to where place drama filled boom notes, were very odd and almost in every scene. Suspension scenes felt like an uplifting moment. Scenes between two major character who have a tension filled dialog between them, were nullified by the music.Background music is as important as the main songs in the movie.\nJust look at your favourite action scene of some movie and put a sad music below it, it does not work. The background music must help the audience get unnoticeably immersed into the story. In this movie, every scene felt like a dramatic one instead of adventurous playful, silliness tension, happy or sad one. Throughout the whole movie I can only remember dramatic background music.It is hard to belief that John Stewart Eduri and Vijay Krishna Acharya made these decisions as artists. I don't understand it.Because of the acting and cinematic shots a 5 rating.",

I might have expected more from Mr.Perfect.But now when I rewatched it, I realized that this was a decent enough movie. I guess the major flaw in the movie was, as is the general curse of bollywood, the song sequences. Most, if not all, of the song sequence were unwanted and inconsequential. The climatic song even if was not inconsequential could have been exchanged for some other sequence. While we are at the topic of music, the background music also needed some work, especially those for Amitabh Bachan's Khudabaksh.Other than the previously mentioned, the movie was a fairly enjoyable one. Aamir Khan's character of Firangi was an obvious rip-off of Jack Sparrow. But the character had his own charm. Firangi's deceitful character kept us second guessing. Add to that Amitabh Bacchan's screen presence.This movie is not a ground breaking movie, but with a decent enough plot and genuinely well made action sequences - this movie deserve much more credit.I don't understand why filmmakers keep on casting Katrina Kaif, apart from being eye-candy, she had zero contribution to the movie.",

You forget that I created Dhoom!\nEOVKA: 'Agree, and a brilliant screenplay and story for both Dhoom and Dhoom 2. But the director was different, remember? Don't you remember your first tryst with direction- Tashan? That was almost a disaster.'\nIOVKA: (Shaking his head in disagreement). 'That was because Tashan was a stylish movie before its time.'\nEOVKA: '...just as TOH is after its time. It's anachronistic. I mean who is interested in swashbuckling lavish stage mounted, disjointed, surreal, in-your-face theatrics of Manmohan Desai (lord bless his soul)? And I believe that the story is based on Philip Meadows Taylor's 1839 novel, \"Confessions of a Thug?\"'\nIOVKA: 'Nonsense. I don't even know this Meadows fellow. This is MY story. This is a period film. Remember Lagaan? It was a blockbuster! And since you do have some faith in my writing if not my direction, let me assure you that I have written this one too!'\nEOVKA: 'Good Lord! Exactly and Exactly!!'\nIOVKA: 'Eh?!!'\nEOVKA: Exactly. Lagaan was an uprising against the British. As is this. So, what's new? In fact, this is confusing as the motives for TOH is muddled. A bit on that later. The second exactly is that I fear how your screenplay will translate on the screen....'\nIOVKA: 'Eh?!!! Why?'\nEOVKA: 'First, whose story is it? Is it the story of revenge of Zafira Baig (Sana Shaikh)? Or the story of Khudabaksh (Bachhan)? Or the story of Firangi? Why are you confusing the audience? Zafira wants to avenge her father's death, so her uprising is against Clive of the British. Khudabaksh seems to have a larger agenda and calls himself Azad as he purportedly wishes to free Hindostan from the clutches of the British rule. Yet your close to three-hour meandering narrative concludes with the death of Clive, without securing freedom of any kind. You didn't have to create a lofty platitude and then fail to deliver on it.\nIOVKA: (Smirks). 'You have left out the story of Suraiya (Katrina).'\nEOVKA: (beside itself with rage). 'Don't even get me started on the colossal waste of Katrina. She has less screen time than that damn eagle or hawk of Azad's. That was a copy from Coolie, right? What's your grouse with two perfectly capable actors anyway? Katrina is in three blink-and -you-miss me scenes, (which is highly plausible as the audience would be snoring for most of the movie) and Sana gets to speak her first dialogue forty minutes into the film! And what's with your caricatures? Amir is a poor imitation of Depp from Pirates of the Caribbean and you have, for some strange reason chosen to fashion Sana as Legolas the Elf from Tolkien's creation, with the result that she does not bloom right through the movie, unlike that fellow Orlando Bloom who played Legolas. And what's Khudabaksh's trip? Your angry old man who is smouldering rage and breathing fire right through the movie, suddenly without rhyme or reason breaks into a jig with the song Vashmalle. Was it your guilt pang that your Firangi had a lot more of colour in his character than Khudabaksh? And you didn't want to slight one thespian in favour of another? Other than Firangi to a degree, none of the other characters have been fleshed out at all despite a three-hour run of the movie! Your story is a poor potpourri of ancient plots, overused props, a dish served stale and cold.'\nIOVKA: (Losing composure for the first time). 'P...people don't really care about reality, do they? And if they had such an elephantine memory, we wouldn't be able to make half the movies that we do!'\nEOVKA: 'Wait, I am not done yet. You say it is a period film. The \"Thug of war\" between the British and the Thugs was somewhere in the 1800s. Yet you chose to plant that fellow Clive plumb in 1806, when he has died in 1774. And why do you make Englishmen speak in Hindi between themselves? Not happy with butchering history, you massacre Geography as well. Your story starts with Raunakpur which is shown as a land-locked place and yet you show an elaborate coastline and most of your action is in the waters, in the oceans in specially created ships, which have taken you what, two years to build? Yes.... Why? Why!! Who is bankrolling this excrescence, anyway?\nIOVKA: (Fearfully): 'YR Films. The budget has crossed 300 crores...'\nEOVKA: 'Good grief! YRF would have recovered their investment from sale of various rights...I feel sorry for the players lower down in the food chain...I am sure they will be calling you all 'Thugs of Bollywood!!'\nIOVKA: 'You mean there is nothing good about the movie?'\nEOVKA: 'Oh no! The movie is good looking, the background score is a hit, the players despite the flawed etching of their parts, essay them well...but it's a three hundred crore extravaganza without a soul- a colossal waste of time and resources of the industry and expectations of movie goers. Remember, it will be unleashed upon them when they would already be sated with wonderful scripts of 'Andhadhun', 'Badhai Ho' and even 'Bazaar'. It will hit them like sledgehammer and knock them cold. Pray that they recover their faith in Bollywood and the movie recovers its costs for the theatre owners and distributors before the bad publicity does it in. Shakespeare must have had TOH in mind when he described Life in 'Macbeth'.\nIOVKA: 'Eh?'\nEOVKA: '... Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.'IOVKA: Id of VKA\nEOVKA: Ego of VKA\nSEOVKA: Super Ego of VKA appears to be in a long hibernation.\n(With due apologies to Sigmund Freud and Shakespeare...)",

However, people hated on it because it was not the typical Star Wars movie, and it was different than they expected. This also occurred with Thugs of Hindostan. People went in expecting the greatest Bollywood film in the last decade, with an explosive collaboration with Aamir Khan and Amitabh Bachan. This movie was just a different type of movie. It is not your regular Aamir Khan movie, with a cunning story, breathtaking acting and universal acclaim. Rather, it is an exciting summer film with great acting and gripping action. So, a word from the wise, go into this movie with low expectations, and expect a summer film. That said, it was a pretty fun and funny movie. The definite highlight was Aamir Khan as Firangi Mallah.

Usually when I go see Bollywood films, they are straight up action movies with the manliest of men doing feats of strength to save the world and his woman (And in-between they do a song and dance which always puts me out of the mood).The only difference between those and Thugs of Hindostan is the fact that it takes place in a Pirates of the Caribbean backdrop. It's a pretty well laid out rip off: The main protagonist is just like Jack Sparrow, he's suppose to be the hero, but you never know which side he's actually on. Although he's not as entertaining as Johnny Depp he does have his own theme music (Which actually becomes a bad running gag after a while).So this guy Firangi is a con artist hired by a British company to spy on a group of Rebels looking to overturn the empire that took over their country.The film even has it's own Elizabeth Swan in a though as nails princess who does some pretty cool movies. There's also another woman in the movie, Suraiyya who looks like she was just inserted to make up for the lack of eye candy.I am impress with the effort the film is doing. It tries hard to be an epic action adventure. Although in comparison of Pirates of the Caribbean it feels cheap, or rather closed in. It feels like it was filmed on a movie set that did not have enough space. The action scenes were not loose enough, not extravagant enough. Every one was boxed in and they really couldn't let go in the area they were filming.Despite that, I die enjoy it. something different from the Bollywood genre, but I guess it will take more money than Bollywood is willing to give to do that.",

Yes there are a few obvious comparisons to some Hollywood characters as Aamir Khan's weirdly re-imagined larrikin stupidly renamed FIRANGI MALLAH - I must say Ameer Ali was a better choice of character name was a cross between Sherlock Holmes & Jack Sparrow. Even the music when FIRANGI enters remotely sounds like a mashup of music by Hans Zimmer, if one has a keen ear for these things. LET'S JUST call him \"Sherly Sparrow\" for humor's sake!!!!!! Another priceless comedy moment is the introduction of Firangi who chooses to ride on his pet donkey rather than a regal horse. Firangi's middle name should have been DHOKEBAAZ for DECEPTION is his game & AK fools the audience perfectly with his constant betrayals - at one point it becomes pretty obvious what his Modus Operandi really is. The film traces the period of 1795 to 1806 AD. One thing that was seriously misleading the audience is that from the very beginning it was Katrina Kaif who was touted as lead role #3 instead she has been relegated to some booty shaking floozy who is only good enough to sex it up for the audience and keep them wanton for lust in some fake fantasy. It seems the casting director has done KK a vast injustice simply by using her as eye candy so that nearly a billion Indian men (most with the sexual maturity of a 14 YO) will look upon this beauty with undignified lust as is the norm. In place of KK is the unknown and truthfully speaking highly unattractive actress FSS despite her being given major screen time she is nothing but a ham actor and did not do justice to her role besides screaming like some raging feminazi going through her periods. The other downside is a slightly weak plot in terms of action. The REAL ending was sadly very piss poor and it's obvious that the promoter was looking to cash in on a sequel. However the perfect ending would have been this: Lord Clive and Powell are left to fight the 3 main characters via a vicious martial arts style sword fight. Powell dies instantly at the hand of Ameer Ali aka Firangi however he finds in Clive a conniving adversary. Despite being cut by the swordsmanship of Kareem Ali and about to die; Clive brings out a pistol and shoots Ameer Ali in the heart with 3 bullets tainted with \"THE POISON OF MADNESS\". Its aim is to induce a mass psychosis in the victim before death. AMEER gets hit and due to his ongoing switching sides and uber-treachery learns that he has in fact redeemed himself in the eyes of Kareem Ali who he confesses with his last breath that he is Kareem Ali's only son kidnapped and enslaved by Clive n Co. Seeing his son dying in a hallucinatory vision/premonition before it ultimately happens Kareem removes the combat knife that Clive had used to kill his king aka Mirza Ali Baig (played by Ronit Roy) 11 years earlier. As soon as the bullets leave Clive's gun; Kareem in one swift martial art move let's loose the knife that goes flying in the air slow motion style and ends up decapitating Clive. THE REAL ENDING was indeed WEAK & PISS POOR. Another few pros of this masterpiece are the original score from a little known composer called John Stewart Eduri - whose music is one main positive of this film as well as the lush colors, thanks to cinematographer Manush Nandan for a flawless job done. The elaborate sets in the film make it stand like Hollywood's TROY & 300. The cinematography is faultless as are the sets. I do not know what came over me during one key scene where Khudhabhaksh aka Kareem Ali looks into the eyes of Firangi and reads his soul advising him \"I SENSE THERE IS GOOD IN YOU ALTHOUGH THERE IS CONFLICT WITHIN YOUR SOUL\". I found myself getting unconsciously misty eyed. That is the magic of film. Furthermore another strong point in the film are it's strong supporting cast rounded by Bollywood veteran Sharat Saxena as Maharaja Sangram Singh as well as newcomers Ronit Roy as Mirza Sikander Baig & MD Zeeshan Ayyub as the crazy sidekick Shanichar; who once again shines in a supporting role akin to his performance in last year's comedy TUBELIGHT. I give this masterpiece 9/10 for the fact that the entire team including director VKA has made a stellar effort at giving the audience something a little different. The Eagle in the film has also been conveniently nicked from another Hollywood film of repute namely KING ARTHUR. What audiences fail to see is the hard work done by actors and the entire creative team. One particular reason this film got savaged at the Indian Box Office is because the media wrongly called for opinion of AK & AB on the ME-TOO Movement, and because of their silence on the matter, Indian audience started to disrespect these 2 stalwarts and thereby causing the films potential gross to come to a halt - it matters not as Aamir's fans in China and overseas will definitely love this film. In addition there were very strong performances from Lloyd Owen as conniving Lord Clive (A tongue-in-cheek reference to actor CLIVE OWEN) and Gavin Marshall as James Powell were commanding albeit at times drastically comical with their BHINDI speak - ie British Hindi......I couldn't help but guffawing when they came onscreen as any minute they could burst into using the infamous BHINDI tagline that brits are so fond of \"SUVAAR KAY BACCHAY\" except the brits pronounce the first word as SOOHAR which is inherently wrong. Hahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! A well thought out film with a few flaws, but hey, no film is PERFECT. Though it's sad that Indian audiences did not warm up to the film does not take away the hard work done by all involved in the making of this masterpiece. I am hoping that Aamirji and AB saab both reunite for a sequel some time in the future for their chemistry is totally badass!!!! Just one film alone does not do justice to their chemistry. There's gotta be more as this is definitely not the end of the story. Sad to see AK now commit himself to a MAHABHARATA epic for another 10 years. A sequel cannot come soon enough. Readers, do not heed the negative reviews as some of the negative reviewers have purely boycotted the film over the me-too nonsense without giving it a chance. Gotta see this blockbuster at least once. And yes as I end this review - the end credits were awesome but once again reminded me of the film 300 - perhaps it was the animation style. Well done VKA and team. TOH2 needs to be made and if AK doesn't return, then please get SRK or ARSSK. Or even Akkibhaai Kumar will do. I, for one, was truly impressed with this film - however the film makers must be diligent and state that they have been influenced by Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of SHERLOCK HOLMES and also credit HANS ZIMMER as inspiration behind the music. A cinematographic feast for the eyes and the soul. Bollywood can be as good as Hollywood and HK Cinema, but they must remember to credit any inspirations from the past!!!!",

            "content": "Thugs of Hindostan is an all-out entertainer that left me hooked throughout its running time. The narrative well-paced, sets grandeur, action sequences slick and the performance by the principal cast top notch. What else one expects from a film that has Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan?As the movie progressed, I was impatiently waiting for Amitabh and Aamir to cross paths for the first time onscreen. And when they did, I had goosebumps. It was truly a moment to behold. Knowing the nature of both their characters in the movie and the situation when they meet, the heart-pounding tension I felt was a bonus. The cross talk they exchanged whenever they meet was pure magic. Kudos to writer-director Vijay Krishna for the brilliant screenplay.The well-staged action and above par art direction only play second fiddle to the masterful acting by both Amitabh and Aamir. I would like to throw Fatima Sana into the mix too. While Amitabh gives a poised performance as Khudabaksh, a freedom fighter who is well focused on his objectives, Aamir Khan has fun with Firangi, a devious, chameleon-like character who always kept me guessing. He twists and turns the table at the most unexpected instances. Fatima as Zafira, an expert with bows and arrows, who is hell-bent on freeing herself from her inner wounds also gives a noteworthy performance.Sadly, the only weakest link in this movie is Suraiya played by Katrina Kaif. She's only there to perform a few item songs. But every other aspect in this movie makes up for it.Englishman, Lloyd Owen as Clive, the main villain talking to his fellow Englishmen in Hindi is a real downer. If only director Vijay came up with a creative device like shifting their lingo from English to Hindi within one shot. But overall Vijay handles this historical epic steadily steering it to a rousing finale.I have a feeling this film will break records easily. Highly recommended.",

Director and casting ppl should shoulder responsibility equally.Trojan statue copy was something novel, in spite of poor context setting. Needed more of that. With better context. Screenplay needed many more rewrites. I think ppl were in a hurry to get this made.Great end titles. Needed it in the beginning. Great art too.Weak CGI, surprisingly.\nBoring action choreography.

            "content": "That's the statement which can explain the movie (from my side).\nBefore release, it was having such great expectations (thanks to the two leads actors) and the release of trailer gave us an idea how it will be. Avid Hollywood aficionados could spot on that it's a rip off of the great great Pirates of the Carribbean but isn't. It seems instead of India, it's a Venetian story as barely there is any land visible in the movie. Always fighting on the ships, nothing else.\nTwo big actors collaborating for the first time became a colossal mess. Have been wasted in their roles due to a pathetic script by the great great director, Vijay Krishna Acharya who doesn't boast of any noteworthy movie. I wonder how he gets soo much money to spend and then get such huge stars to act in it. It's like misusing of one's resources.\nKatrina Kaif got nothing else than dancing way worse than how she used to do in the recent past, finally she's become a poor man's Nora Fatehi (poor man in terms of talent whereas her renumeration touches the sky).\nFatima Sana Shaikh also tried her best, but when the script itself is so worst, then how can she salvage when Aamir Khan and Amitabh Bachchan themselves couldn't do.Songs? Neither worth remembering nor hummable.\nDirection? Pathetic, atrociousSuggestion : do not even dare to watch this if this comes on TV. It doesn't deserve that.PS - Thank you, Mr. Vijay Krishna Acharya for such a great Diwali gift and sorry Aamir Khan you gotta taste a far worse flop than Mangal Pandey.",

Vistas of 1982 when Shakti released helming Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan marking a watershed film bloomed at the thought of being treated to pure magic.Alas, no such thing happened, thanks to the wizard called Vijay Krishna Acharya, who has given us cult classics called Tashan and Dhoom 3 in the past, we should have just known better. An expensive production of epic proportions replete with world class VFX, gloss and action sequences that are a frame to frame reproduction of Pirates of the Caribbean is what you get - but it lacks honesty, intensity and a soul. The story appears to be an afterthought being the mashup of a number of old films, and is poorly researched. Aamir Khan overacts and hams indescribably, his humour misfires. Amitabh Bachchan has a sombre role and does justice but his screen time is limited. Fatima Sana Shaikh is passable. Katrina Kaif irritates no end and her choreography and costumes (not her fault really) don't quite match the period of the setting. Only Ronit Roy makes a brilliant impact in his 10 minute role. The progress is excruciatingly slow and predictable, editing is poor and music by Ajay-Atul is forgettable. 3 STARS!!So should you give it a pass? Not at all. You shall perhaps never get to see the Big B and Aamir Khan together again - you may want to savour the experience for once, so what if the experiment by Yashraj Films fails to get critical acclaim, commercial success is a given.",

My all time favorite singers Shreya Ghoshal, Sunidhi Chauhan, Sukhwinder Singh, Vishal Dadlani gives their voice to the songs and Mr. Amitabh Sir gives their voice to Lori in this movie..... Mr. Amitabh Bachahan Sir wonderfully play the role of Khudabaksh Aazad, a commander of the Thugs..... Mr. Aamir Khan Sir amazing as Firangi Mallah, a small time thug from Awadh..... Fatima Sana Sheikh as Zafira Baig, a warrior - archer Thug is fantastic, she is mind-blowing..... Katrina kaif as Suraiyya, a dancer and performer..... Lloyd owen as John Clive, a ruthless British East India Company Officer. Entire the team effort is appreciated..... The best part is watching all together Amitabh Sir, Aamir Sir and Fatima Sana Shaikh with great action scenes and their suspenseful turns.....

It feel some time it was rushed and some other time it was too lengthy. Sometime too many emotions with screaming and sometimes very less, but I felt the same problem with bahubali (another Indian blockbuster).Overall if you go to watch this movie just for entertainment and two reasons, you wont get disappointed\n1) Amir's acting and Amitabh presence (yes, just even his presence was a good enough reason, he didn't tried too hard in this movie but still it works superbly)\n2) Some nice action sequences (it's definitely behind Hollywood standards, but still much better than the main Indian action films you might have watched in recent times) and visual effects is a big step up from whatever you have seen in recent Indian films.",

            "content": "The long awaited movie turns out to be Utter nonsense and disappointing. It's unbelievably bad movie. These are the words that come to mind when you are walking out of cinema after long 2 hours and 40 minutes of watching Thugs of Hindustan. When the expectations are too high the level of dissatisfaction is even deeper and that is exactly what happens with TOH, though it was visually astounding.The writer and director, Vijay Krishna Acharya did exactly what he does in Dhoom 3, mixing ThePrestige and Now You See Me, to create an Indian mixer of film.Thugs of Hindustan is the story of a rebellious group fighting against the British East India Company. The film set in the year 1795 AD is about a Kingdom called Suraj Nagar which is ruled by generous king (Ronit Roy), who secretly try to build up an army against the East India Company rule in India. Using deceitful mean Clive, the villain (Lloyd Owen) takes over the kingdom by killing the king and queen and their son, only Zafira (Fatima Sheikh) rescued by their obedient and brave servant Khudabukhsh (Amitabh Bacchan). After 11 years, Khudabakash, Zafira with their gang (now considered thugs) started an uprising against the East India Company rule and manage to create significant unrest in the lives of the Britishers. Running short of options, Clive seeks help of Firangi Malla (Aamir Khan) to trace the whereabouts of Khudabaksh and his rebellious army. Dressed in Chameleon colour coat, that tells his devious nature Firangi is a character who is almost impossible to trust,as per his own opinion.From there it is about the chameleon trait of Aamir and whose side he actually is.To start with, the story has not much to offer, if you are a Bollywood fan and have seen movies of 80s and 90s, it can bring you nostalgia but with a sense of remix, just like the one suffered in case of Ko Ko Korina.The characters are borrowed from different films not only Hollywood but from Bollywood as well.Amitabh Bacchan character of Khudabukhsh was an amalgamation of Katappa from Bahu Bali, his own films Khuda Gawah etc. Even the name Azaad will remind you of his film Mard, in which his father's name was Azaad because the looks were quite similar. Fatima Sana Sheikh character Zafira's was borrowed from Hunger Games Katnis Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Amir Khan character itself was highly inspired from Jack Sparrow of Pirates of the Caribbean.Aamir ostentatious performance is shackled by weak, script as he tries to be funny but he was obviously trying too hard. Amitabh Bachchan delivers what is expected from him, a powerful performance transcends. Fatima Sana Shaikh fails to leave any significant mark.And Katrina Kaif's character was more like of a cameo with two songs and a few sequences. However, she can still pull quite a large crowd for her 2 hot, sassy item songs, and voluptuous entry.Ronit Roy cameo is just so and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub fails to impress perhaps because of bad script. To be a great hero you need a big villain, and unfortunately, Lloyd Owen as John Clive was unable to give the big villainous feel.In another words Thugs of Hindustan, is a very average film, however just like Dhoom 3 it may do well in India not because of acting but because an English General Clive who is defeated by the Indians, the hyper unrealistic portrayal certainly shows the hidden desires of the people of subcontinent.In the end Amir Khan was sailing to England to take revenge also hints a sequel.",

Amir Khan once said that before signing a film he pays huge attention to story and screen play of the movies as these are the initial steps behind the success of every movie and I am not sure which method did he apply before signing Thugs of Hindustan. Though the two legends did their best to bring the charisma in the movie however Thugs of Hindustan proves that if you brings the legends together in the cast with the poor direction and poor story still it doesn't bring you the success.

            "content": "I love period/fantasy movies. Despite the trailer of TOH not being very interesting, I gave this movie a chance. It turned out to be a very dull one. There are action scenes but they are so repetitive after a point. It's the same- characters jumping off a cliff/rope in style with loud background music and turning in slo-mo. It's all style, no substance.Amitabh B has done a good job as expected from an actor of his caliber. But everytime he is on screen, a loud background score plays out. Everytime! Like the makers know no moderation. Fatima has been given a good role- of a princess on exile. But she somehow fails to deliver. Her expressions are very one-toned. Aamir's character, his styling will instantly remind you of POTC's Capn' Jack Sparrow. His character Firangi tries to be funny but to me, it fell flat.Katrina Kaif's role and her acting is a joke. In her item numbers she dances with an incredibly flexible body but the steps are so silly that instead of looking good, it's funny. I kid you not. Surraiya (her character) is supposed to be a seductress but her dance lacks grace. It's a lot of super-flexible jumping.Zeeshan Ayub's character is introduced in a very mystic way (as someone who can \"talk\" to nature) but then nothing happens wrt it. In a post-interval scene, when Aamir's character does a thing to get rid of the villain's army, it will remind you of what used to happen in 70s films.The writing, the ideas are that back-dated. The writing, the flow, the consistency is so bad. The script is super lazy. It seems like hardly any effort was put. With a budget of 300 crore INR, the CGI was not good. The entire film was a major disappointment.Also- anyone notice that majority of the 10/10 reviews for TOH here on IMDB are from new users who just joined and has reviewed only this? Same happened with Veere di Wedding. IMDB is one site who's ratings influence my watching decisions. I don't approve of this tacky strategy of Production houses to bump up/manipulate the ratings.",

The British commander John Clive (Lloyd Owen) sends a small-time confidence trickster, Firangi Mallah (Aamir Khan), to infiltrate the band and betray them. (Katrina Kaif also stars, as dancer Suraiyya)The film has a great premise, and the first thirty minutes were quite good; sadly, the next 134 minutes were not. Instead of being exciting, funny, and enjoyable as shown in the trailer, it was mostly deadly dull. The \"surprise\" changes of allegiance became increasingly predictable and annoying. The action scenes are too long, as were the (average and below) musical numbers. Kaif's first number was embarrassingly ridiculous and not worthy of either her talent or dignity. Her performance, and that of Shaikh, were stiff and not natural. Owen made an exceptional villain, however. Bachchan and Khan gave strong performances, but that was not enough to redeem the entire movie. I would suggest watching the trailer, as it has all the good parts, and skipping the movie entirely.",

He is simply overrated as he thrives on talent of good director and great scripts.\nAmitabh Bacchhan is good as Azad and completely overshadowed Amir Khan.\nFatima Sana sheikh is ok but seems to be a bad casting choice.\nAnd what to say about Katrina Kaif, she is wasted in this extended guest appearance. But she has looked gorgeous whenever she is on screen.\nFinally coming to the main culprit and i.e director, direction is simply bad and editing is worst. Victor has made 3 films as director and all 3 are pathetic and boring (tashan, dhoom3 and TOH). Why is Yash Raj wasting so much money on him not sure.\nAction scenes are good and cgi/vfx is quiet good in some places but nothing original.\nFinal verdict: Disappointed, these thugs do not deserve our money.",

The villains are English and their leader is really very mean. Indian nationalism, against the English colonizers.The colonizer hunts the Indian thugs (highwaymen). For this he gets help from Aamir Khan who helps to capture the thugs. And when he is with the Indians, he helps them to avoid the English. But by a misunderstanding he finds himself in the band of Amitabh Bachchan, charismatic leader of a band that plans to bring down the English. Aamir Khan finds himself obliged to help them (he cannot tell them, of course, that he is working for the British); but he will rally to the cause of free India, of course.Katrina Kaif stamps for the dancing and singing numbers, the first of which is pretty thanks to a deliciously vulgar choreography.The fights are very spectacular once the tethers are removed and embellished with CGI porn.The direction of the actors is without finesse: each actor and actress makes tons in his own way: first of all Aamir Khan who ensures a performance in a buffoon character who turns his jacket permanently, who is in almost every shot and makes a high-flying number (without finesse, but there is talent). But also Amitabh Bachchan in the role of a charismatic, exaggeratedly made up and with an exaggeratedly tight jaw. Fatima Sana Shaikh is monolithic (it is true that the British killed her entire family). Katrina Kaif is delicious (already mentioned) in her first choreography and her character without interest (he appears only three times, including the sequence of the epilogue): she is clearly present only for her body.But all in all this Bollywood made adventure film is spectacular, entertaining and curious.",

Vistas of 1982 when Shakti released helming Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan marking a watershed film bloomed at the thought of being treated to pure magic.Alas, no such thing happened, thanks to the wizard called Vijay Krishna Acharya, who has given us cult classics called Tashan and Dhoom 3 in the past, we should have just known better. An expensive production of epic proportions replete with world class VFX, gloss and action sequences that are a frame to frame reproduction of Pirates of the Caribbean is what you get - but it lacks honesty, intensity and a soul. The story appears to be an afterthought being the mashup of a number of old films, and is poorly researched. Aamir Khan overacts and hams indescribably, his humour misfires. Amitabh Bachchan has a sombre role and does justice but his screen time is limited. Fatima Sana Shaikh is passable. Katrina Kaif irritates no end and her choreography and costumes (not her fault really) don't quite match the period of the setting. Only Ronit Roy makes a brilliant impact in his 10 minute role. The progress is excruciatingly slow and predictable, editing is poor and music by Ajay-Atul is forgettable. Three STARS!!So should you give it a pass? Not at all. You shall perhaps never get to see the Big B and Aamir Khan together again - you may want to savour the experience for once, so what if the experiment by Yashraj Films fails to get critical acclaim, commercial success is a given.",

            "content": "Thugs of Hindostan has many firsts to its credit. It is the first to feature Aamir and Amitabh together (if you do not consider anthology movies and voice acting). It is the first Bollywood sea adventure movie shot in extravagant outdoor locales. It is the first \"Thugee\" centric movie this century. It is also the first Pirates of the Caribbean rip-off from Bollwood.Much like like Inglourious Basterds, Thugs of Hindostan is alternate history. Set in late 18th century, it is a tale of a gang of patriotic Indian pirates/bandits standing up to the ever-expanding British East India Company. The thugs are led by Khudabaksh (Amitabh Bachchan), who conveniently calls himself Azaad. His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is Zafira (Fatima Sana Sheikh), a princess who he rescued from the evil clutches of Clive (John mind you, not Robert) when she was a child. Clive sends small time thug Firangi Mallah (Aamir Khan) as a spy to capture Khudabaksh.It is a swashbuckler all right, and I love the genre, period. The visual effects are perhaps the best Bollywood has seen, and the action sequences are great. Aamir and Amitabh are excellent. Everything else though is abysmal.\nFirst- the characters. Khudabaksh is also a mishmash of epic Amitabh characters- Badshah Khan, Shahenshah, Toofan. Even Allah Rakha, the eagle from Coolie is there. What is new though is a dash of Deadpool- twin swords, and epic longevity. He is a rebel leader whose motto is that he trusts everyone. I am still scratching my head trying to understand how has he survived so long as a rebel with that belief.Firangi Mallah is the modern day double agent, and to be honest Aamir does justice to the character, balancing the dominating survival instinct with the nobler cause. However, like he did in 3 Idiots and most of his movies, he made Thugs of Hindostan all about himself. None of the other actors get much to do, all 2 hour 45 mins of the movie.The lesser said about the female characters the better. Katrina as Suraiyya is there only for 2 item numbers, and since it is the season of rip-offs, there is Fatima Sana Sheikh as a Katniss Everdeen. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub is the comedian in the mix, but he rarely gets a line though, and the white actors ham their way through as expected.Vijay Krishna Acharya's resume will tell you that he is no auteur. However, with the talent and budgets at his disposal, I had high hopes. He kept the overall pace bearable, that's about it. Too much of Firangi, too little of everyone else was a big mistake. Too much of action with very little character development, along with a cliched and unfunny script is his other big fault. The most important piece though is probably the tone of the movie- merging high stakes patriotic intensity with Jack Sparrow inspired irreverence.Except for the background theme, music in the movie is extremely average, and that too coming from a banner that gave us blockbuster albums Kabhi Kabhi, Silsila, Chandni, Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, Dil Toh Pagal Hai, Dhoom, Band Baaja Baaraat, and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi.My advice- for swashbuckling fun, go ahead and watch the first Pirates of the Caribbean, and for similar alternate history patriotic glory, go ahead and watch the far better Manoj Kumar starrer Kranti.5/10 - a couple of points just for the love of Amitabh Bachchan!",

            "content": "Direction: After failure of Tashan and Dhoom 3, finally Vijay Krishana Acharya has completed the hat-trick of Torturous cinema. When he roped in as director, cinema lovers were so restless due his presence in this movie. First half went little bit ok but second half was totally out of track and so much predictable. He failed to encash golden opportunity like Remo in Race 3.Performance: Only one guy impressed the audience with his acting skill-None other than Amitabh Bachchan. He has done impressive action sequences in this age with heavy Armour. Another Dhoom 3 type performance from Aamir Khan as he was constantly trying to copy Captain Jack Sparrow but failed miserably. Fatima Sana Shaikh was good as Archer but not in mood of acting. Katrina Kaif was Item girl for this movie with 2 item songs. Feel sorry for Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as he remained under utilized as per his capability. Sharat Saxena and Ronit Roy were good in cameo role. Lloyd Owen failed as villain.Script: For any cinema, script is the soul but TOH is soul-less art work which boast about Strong star cast and Big Canvas for adventurous ride but nothing works accordingly. There is so much adaptation from Hollywood flicks e.g Pirates of Caribbean, Troy so there is lack of smooth execution of script as no originality.Dialogue: After failure of Script, Dialogue was another week point of TOH. Some dialogue delivered by Amitabh Sahab was really good. Aamir's dialogues written for making audience laugh , in which he partially successful. Fatima was really not in mood to deliver dialogue as she was enjoying her angry look.Music: Atul-Ajay's music is another flop show for this movie. Not a single song make some good impression on ears. Thanks for hot performance of Katrina Kaif in two songs otherwise these two songs went unnoticed by audience. John Stewart Eduri done some wonderful job with background music.Box-Office: After making highest opening day collection of 52.75 crores, TOH earned 100 crores in 3 days. By end of first Week, 150-175 Crores will be box-office collection. As they have already gain highest Satellite rights for 150 crores. So after first week, they will start adding profit. At the end of run, it will earn the tag as Disaster from Box-office as totally production cost was 300 crores.Last Words: Wait for announcement for Lucky coupon or Offers from Yashraj Camp or multiplexes for watching this torture in cinema halls.",

There's been many worse films and in fact Aamir Khan has a few which would trump this!The film has too many cliches, awkward dialogues and cringe worthy moments. Too much is placed on the Aamir v Amitabh line up but in the end, neither really match up. The direction is super poor. The major positive is the action sequences. The film does have some funny and exciting moments which does make it a 'watch it once' type film but yes don't waste your money and watch it in the cinema for sure!Aamir does his best and his character comes off well at times but the majority of the time it does feel a little forceful. He is comfortable in the role, but the comedy element was lacking, especially when trying to speak English. Amitabh also does his best in a pretty flawed character but one does think why he would take such a role? Perhaps because Aamir was in it? Fatima Sana Sheikh was awful - God knows why she was casted (Aamir's recommendation no doubt) but she had no expressions whatsoever in what could've been a really career defining role. I don't see her as a leading actress that's going to do that well. Katrina does her job well - dance and look good, but she is pretty much there for eye candy and that's it.",

            "content": "Picture this: the British army, surrounded and under attack, decide that it is better to watch Katrina Kaif dance than retaliate. It's an absurd and laughable moment, much like most of the movie. It pains me to say it but what should've been an epic entertainer turns out to be an epic disappointment. What hype. What a cast. What scale. And what a grand mess. Aamir Khan's first release as a leading man after 'Dangal' is a wasted opportunity through and through. Of course, the blame lies with the writer and director but we expect the world from Mr. Khan and trust his instincts. Dhoka saubhav hai mera. It didn't need to be literal.The year is 1795. The British are slowly taking over Hindostan. A few rebels, aka Thugs, aren't having it and fight back. Another thug is brought, or rather bought, in to fight those thugs. Con upon con. Battle upon battle. Time is wasted, plot holes are dug deeper, and my patience continued to be tested. The film takes a solid start. Character introductions are well thought out and Firangi (Aamir Khan) is a real treat for the first few minutes. Suraiyya is an enjoyable song and things were looking good. I was starting to believe that the story would go to great heights but it all came to a screeching halt 15 minutes before the interval. You know exactly when things go wrong and it's a sinking ship from that moment on.As I mentioned, the blame lies completely with the writer and director, Vijay Krishna Acharya. This is the same man that made 'Tashan' and 'Dhoom 3' for Yash Raj Films. Why was he allowed to lead this project? I'm looking at you, Aditya Chopra. Dhoom 3, the weakest of the Dhooms, was still a fun ride. Plagued with childish and uneven writing, this one is definitely not fun. Every twist is unconvincing and, after a point, exhausting. And other than Firangi the characters are one tone. Post interval I kept wondering how the script was okayed...by Aamir Khan of all people.Amitabh Bachchan's Khudabaksh is irritating. Even Mr. Bachchan can't save him and, honestly, it doesn't seem like he tries. His acting is surface level and when he's missing for a chunk of the movie I shrugged and said 'meh'. Fatima Sana Shaikh has only a few moments to show emotions and she's all right. I genuinely cringed at the thought of Firangi romancing Zafira. Yes, I know they're actors but give us a break! Dangal is still fresh on our minds. Do you remember Katrina Kaif's role in Dhoom 3? No? Oh because she didn't have one. She danced to a few songs and said maybe 3 sentences. Here, she doesn't even do that much. It should've been called a special appearance. The deceit keeps getting worse. Katrina looks lovely and dances like a dream in two songs but that's it. Ugh, I can't believe I am actually upset at the length of her role.Naturally the sole saving grace is Aamir Khan. He breathes life into Firangi's many layers and makes you laugh even when you want to cry from boredom. Aamir gets the tone right most of the time and is thankfully used without shame in the movie. But why does the accent slip in the confrontation scene with Khudabaksh? Surely Mr. Bachchan isn't that intimidating. In 18 years, since 'Mela', Aamir Khan hasn't faulted. He hasn't taken one step wrong hence the immense trust the audience has in him. I guess you're allowed this one mistake, Mr. Khan. But please don't repeat it.We have Hindi cinema's answer to 'Baahubali', they said. Ha! Keep trying, Bollywood. This ain't it. Annoyed, disappointed, and frankly a little pissed off. 'Thugs of Hindostan' made me feel a lot. Sitting there in the theatre, aware that the thugs were robbing us blind, we willingly let it happen. Much like the Brits I called out earlier. Can you say irony?",

Thugs of Hindustan is a total disaster. Movie direction, special effects, edits and sequences went awfully wrong. In the beginning of the movie Rohit roy gives instructions to kill on his nod, and somehow that sequence close loop never happens and instead the entire family gets tragically killed ! This very first scene looses audience. Secondly it is so so awful at all levels to see Aamir and Fatima being paired or some amount of flirting in that light ! Its bleeding bad, mostly cause Dangal created that kind of solid impact and perception. Also the way the Dangal star cast conducted themselves in shows like koffee with karan etc almost makes Aamir a fatherly figure for the girls. One more reason why this movie thugs lost my respect totally, muddled roles of Katrina and Fatima, and poor sequencing again with Katrina as well !",

But why ? There is not only Aamir khan but also Amitabh Bacchan ! People are that Mad on Aamir as he is a Perfectionist that they would have Voted for more than 200 cr as Aamir did in his Movie Dangal.But why people were greatly Disappointed including me ?Simple, He Copies Hollywood - And Yes , people Don't more familiar with Hollywood as they have great stories and Aamir used to copy ideas , yeah he has made several great movies those are (probably) no copied and were greatest in the Bollywood history and in top 250 imdb list like LAGAAN ,3 IDIOTS, PK and may others...But Memento , The Prestige and not Pirates of the Caribbean ?He does fool us .But yes , He is the Great actor in Bollywood I can say in Now generation...Now Review :Movie Starts with some Discussions in Britishers about East India Company. With some ideas that the Movie will have some story... and In 10 minutes Aazad ( Amitabh Bacchan) give his great entry...And after 20 min or about Firangi Mallah (Aamir Khan) gives his first Frame... A different one ... no background music and no any other effects he enters simply in the movie but it was different because - 'Heros Should not Always Enter with \"Dhamakedar\" music'.And we can that moment recall the scene in Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Perl ... when Jack Sparrow fools two guards with his own Acting but here Firangi does the Same !In the whole movie Couple of scenes are directly inherited from Pirates of the Caribbean.-> Suraiyya slaps Firangi again and again -> Liquor Addict (A Style) -> The Flexible attitude of Firangi ->Wears Cap (Sometimes) -> Two 'Jahaj' fights in the Same way -> Blue overlay screen-> He Fools everyone .Yes, this idea they have not totally copied but they have nourished it and made it his the main Characteristic in whole movie.But, Amitabh Bacchan does really great job, He really speaks his dialogue in his way, His voice gives the really Power in the Movie. He really proves that no one can beat in his Acting in Bollywood .But we expected the Battle of Dialogues between the Two most praised actors not expected the Battle of Sword !If you haven't seen movie Sodagar watch it . This movie needed that theme.No related music , No related dance, The worst supporting actor of Firangiand Expecable movie story makes it even worse.Can't expect to Watch it's second part if they make ( Englishtan)",

If could think of anything good about the movie, it was just the background score and thats itttttt...!!!Lazy writing, Dependency over starcast, Overconfidence on the big banner with all these factors Mr. Vijay Krishna Acharya had created such a dullest movie.

They had a dream casting of Amir Khan, Amitabh Bachchan & Kartina Kaif but they should know in this new era of bollywood story is the real hero. His previous project 'Dhoom 3' was partially copied from a phenomenal movie 'The Prestige' and Thugs of Hindostan was a wanna be 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. First time it was the Dhoom franchise so it worked, you cannot get lucky all the time. Just come up with some original stuff!! or if u like a movie just make a remake of it.Screenplay was poor, Songs & dance numbers were misplaced, untimed & seemed unnecessary. A 300 Crore Disaster.

After starting nicely, the narrative soon goes around in circles with no surprises and hardly any interesting twists. The dialogues are good especially those between ZEESHAN AYYUB and AAMIR which induce laughter. The songs serve no purpose other than effectively breaking whatever little momentum the film manages to gather from time to time.Yash Raj Films probably thought they had struck gold by bringing AMITABH and AAMIR together for the first time. But alas, the pairing is lacklustre. In fact, it is the chemistry between AAMIR and ZEESHAN AYYUB which turns out to be the highpoint of the film.Director VIJAY KRISHNA ACHARYA tries his best but it seems he has bitten off more than he could chew. The running time at 164 minutes is way too long. In fact, it would have been a good idea to end the movie at the interval and release the second half as a sequel. The last song harks back to the Bollywood masala movies of the 80s and 90s which always had the customary climax group song/dance in the villain's lair. It is so cheesy, it is embarrassing to even watch.THUGS OF HINDOSTAN works in bits and pieces but mostly, it is akin to those faulty Diwali rockets; the ones which (once lit) whiz off anywhere with scant sense of direction and control and fizzle out in the end. Ironically, its biggest draw i.e., AAMIR KHAN is also its biggest flaw because with AAMIR, one has got used to expect the unexpected....an engrossing, almost magical experience (courtesy his brand of meaningful yet entertaining cinema).Now, we can overlook this one as an aberration but still, after coming out of the theatre, we can't help but feel THUGged (cheated)!",

They have little respect for the audience and often time we deserve that. But if TOH financially not do well (i.e. not earn more than 200cr) then it will send a strong msg to the Bollywood and perhaps will change this tradition finally. I am specially angry because they r representing us in the world on a large scale; they r supposed to b the best 'actor/s' of our country. Oh sorry, they r not 'Actors' they r 'Hero' (alom)lol. May b Hero Aamir doesn't deserved that kind of harsh criticism, but there is no excuse for making another film with the same notorious director VKA after making Dhoom3; (well this is Doom4).

As a whole, you got to watch some beautiful scenes, unseen before in Indian movies, Big B's solid acting, some fascinating sequences, very eye pleasing views and a complete package of entertainment.

Supporting actors have played well. Good humour. Fatima has done justice with her character. Katrina has danced amazingly breaking her previous records with the moves. Story line is the one fetching lower reviews perhaps. If I were to rate the actors only, I would 10 on 10.... somehow the chemistry of the story fails to gel well... not enough meat in the story line.

Writer/director Vijay Acharya- fails to give the audience an engaging story line and the twists and turns are very predictable. The writer has also taken many cinematic liberty to make this 300 Cr masala VFX movie!Amir khan as Firangi Mallah - (apna desi Jack Sparrow!) has portrayed the character very well and so has Amitabh bachchan as Khudabaksh. They both got a good opening sequence (typical Bollywood formula) and most of the dialogue and punchlines.Fatima Shaikh (Zarira Baig) is fine but has hardly any limelight scene to her credits. Katrina Kaif (Suraiyya) has nothing to do but sing and dance - her role could have been well crafted (but thanks to shoddy editing and many slow motion action sequence the movie is already 3 hours long!)Music by Ajay-Atul - is below par considering there calibre and past records (Famous for Sairat). Even choreography by Prabudeva is pitiable (Amir and Amitabh looks uncomfortable and Katrina's dancing unfortunately looks out of place).Background score by John Stewart Eduri is noteworthy (the end credit has the Guy Ritche's 2009 movie 'Shrelock holmes' kinda look and feel which is awesome)The Visual effects are very good. If Aditya Chorpa had put little moolah on the story line (basis requirement) also then this movie could have been a blockbuster.Final Verdict- Can give this movie a miss (catch it on the idiot box later!). Anyways, the producers will recover the money by the mammoth amount of prints and satellite distribution. Also Amir Khan's new Chinese territory will be explored later on- and who knows- Yash raj films might be able to Thug (deceive) them too!",

The story was average. There were some logical holes where you say \"Why did he do that when he could have just did that?\" or \"Is he stupid?\" or \"What else do they expect?\"\nThe animation effects did not seem realistic at times but they were pretty tolerable.\nOverall i did not feel bored at all but i don't count it as 170 minutes of my life traded off for total worth.",

            "content": "Just an overall entertaining movie about some scallywag pirates. What's not to like? People need to stop with their negative critiques and enjoy a few hours with the family. I was scared given the dismal 10% positive reviews on rotten tomatoes but those are overstated and perplexing. Not sure why the reviews make this sound like it's a terrible movie. Yes, It's not supposed to be an Oscar worthy picture but rather fun and a break from life, a farcical-fantasy, if you will. Lots of people took a lot of time and pains to create this.Acting is surprisingly decent. Aamir Khan has put in his all. Big B was both mysterious and had some good dialogues. It has some nice artistic scenes, which you can tell they spend a lot of money on, and great cinematography and costumes were also good. The background score is excellent. If nothing else, you can laugh at Katrina Kaif and her undulations. The fight scenes, although not always believable, were entertaining and you could tell they practiced and worked hard with the sword and arrows because they actually used them properly (unlike Padmawaat). The heroes of the film, who \"save\" Hindostan, are Muslim characters, maybe that had something to do with the bad reviews-after all India is weird like that.My non desi husband enjoyed the movie. Live a little and go see it. Spending a few hours and a few bucks with your family and friends won't ruin your life. All in all it was better than most of the crap Bollywood produces and it's great seeing an anti colonial movies. I think it does a great justice to Bollywood to move AWAY from the love stories. Maybe that's why desis didn't like it? No other reason why it got such bad reviews. All south Asians should be on board for that. I agree with Azaad when he says in the movie, \"sometimes Indians are their worse enemy.\"Grab some popcorn \ud83c\udf7f and enjoy.",

The movie is well balanced and keeps one thinking if Amir khan aka farangi balla is a good guy or bad? He is no Jack Sparrow and its not fair to co.pare these two characters.Agreed that Amitabh has few dialogues and some of them being powerful once, but remember its a movie of many characters and each character is supporting the other.I read people saying Fatima was blank, I think she did justice to her character. I saw excellent facial expressions and they were not blank. I see a good actress in making. ALL THE BEST.Please go and watch the movie and then decide if critics did justice to this movie or not!!.",

To be a great hero you need a big villain, and unfortunately, Lloyd Owen as John Clive was unable to give the big villainous feel.In another words Thugs of Hindostan, is a very average film, however just like Dhoom 3 it may do well in India not because of acting but because an English General Clive is defeated by the Indians, the hyper unrealistic portrayal certainly shows the hidden desires of the people of subcontinent.In the end Amir Khan was sailing to England to take revenge also hints a sequel.",

Amir khan's role make this movie too slow and boring as there are a lots of silly twist that are unnecessary. It also shows how bad the story writing of this film is. As the movie go on, you will witness a lots of scene that you are very much familiar in old bollywood movies like there was a scene where amir khan make every bodyguard faint in the jail by feeding them poisonous sweets and also there was a scene where Amitabh bacchan was tied infront of English Man and every cast member was dancing infront of them and at the end they tried to do trick to escape amitabh bacchan from them.

You like this movie or not does not matter at all, this movie is going to get a mammoth run at the box office.The best thing about this movie is that everything is so grand about it. The songs, the set designs, the cinematography, the dialogues are all 'paisa - wasool'. A perfect family entertainer, go and watch TOH in your nearby theaters (only if you are lucky enough to book a ticket).Edit:Let's see the pros and cons of the movie:Pros:(1) Amitabh Bacchan sir's stellar performance and high octane stunts.\n(2) Exquisite sets.\n(3) Aamir Khan's comic timing which works at times.\nCons:(1) \"Adding too much masala to a food destroys it's taste\"\n(2) The songs,except \"Manzoor - e - Khuda\" are forgettable\n(3) The story feels a bit strechted at times.\n(4) The dialogues and set designs feel way too modern for 1795.\nRating:Story: 3 out of 5\nActing: 2.5 out of 5\nVisual Appeal: 3.5 out of 5\nMusic: 2.5 out of 5\nScreenplay: 2 out of 5Overall: 2.5 out of 5Business prediction: 240 - 260 crores at the domestic box office\n(Overall: 400 crores)TOH will taste better with a bucket of \"MASALA\" popcorn. : )",

Perfect entertainer for tge kinds and yes one of the kinds. I like how it was similar to pirates of carribean but yet Indian. It is definitely a turning point in cinematography. Don't go with any expectations just with flow and you would truly enjoyed it. I think girls could have acted better.",

Even when amitabh dies i didnot feel a ripple of emotion and actually i jumped with joy that at least one guy is out of this worlds biggest disastrous royal rumble. But alas he resurrects in the end alongwith his eagle which is another source of pain and chinese torture.Aamir khan has deployed his andaz apna apna kind of acting which doesnot work this time.AT ALL.There is annyoing sounds in the background \"ayuuuu ayuuu\" which makes you scream and run out of the cinema.Katrina with her new buttox/lip job done doesnot help either to save the movie.

Because its not a story as the story was quite amazing.But the action sequence which were shot on multiple angles and different frame rates and ended up being mixed togethere in the same sequence,which in the end made the whole CGI flat plates to fall apart while within the sequences.the last thing is The Editor really failed in the editing.as when u take a closer look and attention,you will notice much action sequence were shot on multiple focul lengths and also different angles,but this means while in the post production you have to stick on the rule of third editing law and keep 4 or 4 shots in the 10 shots which were taken which wereCloser take\nMedium take\nWide take\nAerial takeBut the Editor tried to keep much action scenes angles so as to give the film a rising hyper look but ended up looking crap and destroy the action look.The 3rd part,the CGI team tried its level best to match the CGI ships and houses with the real world footages,that was quite amazing,but the CGI ships were not correctly lightned as some of the part was really showing the ship was a CGI and also the textures and edges was quite a bit Rough.when you take a closer look on closup scenes you could actualy see the Outer strokes on subjects end marks as after mating them out from Greenscreens,the CGI should really take their game step ahead as to pay closer attention while mating out subjects and polish the stroke likes and small details.also when u look at the explosions scenes of the Ship,you will notice the same explosion as before,But thats not a big prob..!!The 4th part was.the colour correction/Grading team,also failed as many part of this movie never had same colour grade.mostly when you keep closer attentin on close shot and wide shot the colour in some Scenes were really different as it was showing Teal orange look but with Much Contrast,Then changes to Cold blue with high Green intensity,Then also changed to high contrast and shadows peaks.but in Clarity and sharpness wise,the team did perfect,but they have to process an overall same colour grade design.",

Oh and did I mention, a very superficial script riddled with cinematic plot liberties and very predictable twists.\nThis is not Bollywood 2018. We need to stop supporting such big banner films just to make 'them' realize that what we really want is intelligent cinema, or at least something truly entertaining.All I could find myself doing throughout the movie is trying to pick up some fun lines to fit terrible scenes, for eg when katrina dances for the gora officers, I kept saying to myself ' Basanti...in kutto ke saamne mat naachna'\nOh Bollywood. I'm nostalgic for the 60s and 70s. That's timeless classic masala.

There is nothing wrong with any of the choices. People never should be judged by their decisions; having a free mind is not only the right but privilege that everyone deserves.\nThe movie indeed resembles the Pirates of the Caribbean a lot but I don't agree it is cheaper version of it. Even though there are some nonsense scenes, same things apply to POC. In my personal opinion, it is a better version of POC, the settings and customs are more beautiful and delicate. The message from the movie is much deeper than POC.\nIt reveals the common struggle of human nature; we always want to get ourselves full-handed but when there are too much to hold on to, we lose things here and there; when we finally let go the obsessions, the true freedom will come.\nHowever, I don't quite like the ending that people are worshiping someone, another \"ruler\". But as long as they believe that is their best choice, I have no right to judge their decision.",

Now a brief introduction about me, am a tough ass movie critic and I enjoy slagging off a movie... full stop ... I love it.We walked In an 3/4 empty cinema hall.and we watched the movie.... WHAT A BUNCH OF LYING CRITICS... pure crap and non sense... doesn't matter what the big newspapers write.. it's an Amir Khan,s production end of story..For those who loved the Pirates of the Caribbean, we all understand the central Character played a major role and the story line mattered... for those who wish to watch a movie were you have Pirates of the Caribbean swung in with an older days story tale casted by Amitab Bachan which chucks you back in history and adds a bag of action then this is it.. Now please understand for those seeking an average Bollywood movie with lots of booty shaking this may not be for you.. or those seeking the pretty hair styles and dresses this might not be for you. Those seeking so.e adventure go ahead you won't regret it.Amir Khan as always centralises his Character, on him self. Yes there are elements of Jack Sparrow, but Amir Khans up grade of this Character leaves you wondering what's he up to now the whole way..and leaves you applauding his cunning clever witt. Amir Khan ups the level with his Character and on only certain parts.. relating to him being slapped do the audience relate to jack sparrow.For those slightly senior citizen .. he plays an excellent role..and we'll worth the watch..it almost felt his Character was taken out of the 1990s movie and given an energy boost... what really Indian movies was about...At then end I can only say the 1/4 cinema applauded..my 4 year old loved it...and I would be happy to go again...But yes the trailer is a symbolic shamble that did no justice to the movie.. and that's why I don't wats h trailers on any movie..because they either hyper a crap movie or make a good movie look like crap..",

So, before starting the review I also feel I should agree with the sentiments of the crowd and tone down the ratings as its a human tendency that if some strong voices create some perception about anything then generally that becomes a universal perception.\nStarting my review : its a periodic and a fictional film inspired from a novel, which is again a work of fiction. The plot has nothing to do with Pirates of Caribbean, but yet some scenes have the similar look and feel. Periodic setup and Action sequences are fabulous, not matching the level of Bahubali but arguably the second best till date coming out from a Bollywood movie. Movie has many shades also from Bahubali.\nAmitabh Bacchhan's work is just fine and what he does best, he did in this movie. Dialog delivery was a typical Amitabh Bachchan style.\nAamir khan captured most of the screen space and his comic timing was good and as always superb acting, towards the end his character became quite predictable and where I found this movie to bit flawed.\nFatima sana sheikh was just OK and is the lead actress of the film, suprisingly taking 95% screen space from katrina Kaif, who is there only for 2 songs and some scenes to setup these songs. In some scenes, Fatima looks a bit over excited and need to work on controlling her acting, otherwise overall she was OK.\nKatrina Kaif was for 2 songs and she danced great.Action was great, Cinematography was world class. Movie could have been edited better as in second half some scenes were stretched too long.Climax of the film was very weak and again due to redundancy in Aamir's character and weak Climax, this film is getting bashed up. But honestly when you are in theatre there will be some dull moments, but barring the climax and couple of dull moments you will enjoy your time in theatre. Movie is a one time watch and a time pass and hence giving 7/10 for the enjoyable time spent, 1 point cut for not editing the movie mostly in second half, 1 for weak climax and 1 for trying to agree with generic sentiment. But frankly it's a far better than many Bollywood movies.\nIn the end don't fall for perception trap, watch the movie and then decide for yourself. I have seen many people trolling and bashing the movie, without even watching it, just to conform to the generic sentiment.",

            "content": "This movie will gather different opinion from different viewers.My ratings will be 2.9/5.Why?\nMovie is extremely long. Unnecessarily songs are inserted which are not even required just to add masala like Indian Television.My recommendation to all is to take pillow with you for first 40 minutes. Extremely boring part, The movie starts after 40 minutes, you will see drama and action for next 15 minutes, after 55 minutes again movie will slow down for 20 minutes, again go to \ud83d\ude34 lol, just 10 minutes before intermission, movie will excites you.Dialogues delivery - somewhat comic. Sometimes it makes you laugh, sometimes feel boring.VFX - lol don't want to speak about it. Can't compare to international standards.One can watch it for - Amir Khan and Amitabh Bachchan acting or Fatima's effort or Maybe Belly Dance of Katrina or Indian movie masala or average story lineup. Story line is also predictable some times and ending is again stretched forcefully by 10 minutes.Movie is actually of 1 hr. 20 minutes and stretched to 2 hr. 45 minutes.Its the second attempt by Indian cinema after bahuballi so its worth One Time only watch.Only thing which one will not able to watch it again is Amitabh Bachchan action at this age which will take you to theatre.",

AB's and Aamir's introductions are top notch and surprisingly liked the hindi of the character Clive (wish Katrina could speak as good hindi)\nSuraiyya song could have been choreographed much better (It was below average)Second half starts well and holds on until another song Manzoor E khuda where again the wardrobe of Katrina is a let down and the dance too. Climax is very good (except the sweet serving part), conversation scene between Aamir and Big B is quite good.Acting:: Amitabh doing action at his age is commendable and looks his character to the T.\nAamir Khan with his performance has taken this movie to the level where you are glued to the seat throughout, His chameleon like act is flawless. One of his great performances if not the best as there are too many of those from him.\nFatima has come out as natural and true to her character. She is unbelievable in the action sequences.\nKatrina didn't had much to do, she could have left an impact if the writer could have made her role a bit longer.

Actually review of any movie decided the height of its popularity like \"BAHUBALI\" but after watching 'THO\" ,I though that it is the best movie then comparison to BAHUBALI-I & BAHUBALI-II which gaves so many rubbish actions or stunt that have no sence in real ground but in comparison of 'THO\" it make sense of thinking and real action/stunt that can be picturised or practically proved on ground.\nSecond thing is that if you are get entertained your self in future, when it cames with second part that is \"thug of hindustan in england\" then go and watch because Movie was entertaining till end and may be entertained in future if you want fully entertained with repeated part-II. I am a fan of Jack Sparrow and to be honest they did try to copy potc and certain characters from the movie were inspired by the same. Songs and dances was awesome .",

Like scheming villains they must be celebrating for pulling down this grand spectacle which would have otherwise collected atleast 400-500 crores.\nThe sheer joy of watching Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan together is an unforgettable experience for any Bollywood lover. While individually both these actors are known for towering screen presence where all else just dwarfs in their presence, when they are together here they seem to complement each other and one can clearly see their mutual respect oozing out. One scene in the vashmalle dance number where both perform differently a step makes it difficult for you on where to focus your eyes...both giving perfect yet so different renditions.\nThe movie is indeed a visual spectacle as it tries to create a new genre of adventure/fantasy in bollywood cinema. The scale on which it is mounted is a celebration of where Bollywood movies have now reached. The action sequences are a treat to watch.\nAamir as usual is flawless as he carries the movie with his superb comic timing.\nAmitabh is grand and imposing and fits the grandiose and scale of this movie perfectly.\nFatima is superb in her pivotal role and carries the action sequences with credibility and elan.\nKatrina is scintillating albeit we wish she had more screen time.\nThe only let down one feels is that the story and screenplay does not do enough justice to the coming together of the two greatest icons of Bollywood cinema. If only Acharya had given half the time on the story to that he did for the styling, this would have been amongst the grandest Bollywood movies ever.\nBut surely worth a watch as is.\nHave given it a 10 in reaction to the unfair/harsh criticism of spineless critics. My genuine rating is a 6.5.",

Mr. Bachchan is a legend and he's in that stage of his career by my opinion , in which it is enough for him just to be in the movie. Fatima was a delight to watch. Someone I really liked is the girl playing young Zafira (Deshna Dugad). She's done pretty well for the small role she had and for her young age.\n\n\nPROS: Aamir Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, and Fatima Sana Shaikh. While Amitabh and Fatima did not have much material, every time they were on screen, they were extremely impressive with the stunts in their fight sequences. The two of them also have a nice character arc that I wont spoil. And Aamir Khan is always the best. Just because he acts cheerful and full of energy, doesn't mean he is Jack Sparrow as some people believe. The fight sequences are really, really well-done, especially for a Bollywood movie with amazing fight choreography, realistic looking ships and outstanding visual effects. The VFX were nowhere near as bad as some people have so harshly dismissed. The background score is great. Its generally a feel-good film. This is the perfect popcorn entertainer that will make you laugh and keep your spirits high with terrific action sequences and good acting.\n\nCONS: The story could have been a little more complex. Some of the editing in the fight sequences, at times was a little choppy, although  were great!  The movie could have been a little shorter.\n\nAll in all, it is a simple, straightforward story that feels like a summer blockbuster entertainer. So , in conclusion, if you are in a mood for an entertaining action , the movie will leave you with a good feeling. Give it a try..",

Thugs of Hindostan is a fresh 'light bulb' and theme in Bollywood cinema, consisted of great acting throughout, how the story unfolded was also appreciated, as it was very enjoyable and 'you' might be surprised note this but the story was good. However, before delving into the perks of the story, Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan are in pivotal roles, but as to the story, Fatima Sana Shaikh is more at centre than you think. \n\nWith a very simple story; two thugs want to overthrow 'Clive' and his group. Since they can't because 'Clive's' army is very strong, 'Clive' hires another thug to simply brush them off. After the thug realises that one cannot just simply brush off Amitabh and Fatima (because of their relationship and strength). As a solution he decided to first falsely join forces with them and later overthrow them as an infiltrator. Continuing on with the solution the thug decided to actually join forces with Amitabh and Fatima to overthrow the 'Clive' together. \n\nAlthough each character had thier motivation, the direction should have emerged that stronger.  Duration is a big part of a movie, especially Hindi cinema, this movie was prolonged for a bit too much.",

            "content": "Before I watched this movie, all I heard and saw were negative reviews - which made it hard to sit on the padded sea of the cinema without prejudice for an apparently bad movie.\n\nBut, I kept waiting for the movie to get slow/ stale/ boring - but it never happened!!! Thugs of Hindostan is a fantastic action flick with a production and direction team that has not been scared to take bold steps to direct the Bollywood industry to a newer, more conceptual artform.\n\nTo make it really simple, I will summarize this movie in a series of highlights (pros) and dampeners (cons):\n\nHighlights:\n\nNote: First things first - this movie is nothing like Pirates of Carribean and follows it's own original theme and storyline, So, I encourage all those thinking this is a remake of Pirate of the Carrieban to please go to the cinema and o be proven wrong.\n\n1. Amitabh Bachchan has outdone himself in this role. His character is strong, uncompromising and very convincing. His acting has matured majestically with age. His role was very reminiscent of Optimus Prime in this movie in all the good ways.\n\n2. Aamir Khan always exceeds expectations in any role he is given - so much so that if a film fails, it as never because of him, but due to other factors surrounding the movie. It is hard to imagine anyone else doing this role with the ease and charisma that Aamir has done it. His coyness and personality is the base for all suspense of this movie an he portrays his uncharacteristic nature of being unpredictable beautifully in this movie.\n\n3. Background Score - The movie's background score is a perfect complement to the vibe and look of the movie. It is a sort of a beautiful amalgamation of SHerlock Holmes meets POTC meets Lagaan. It is melodic, it is engrossing and it is perfect.\n\nDampeners (cons):\n\n1. Katrina Kaif - I feel bad that a wonderful actress who has done her part beautifully in the movie was let down by the nubile character of her role that just seems to exist to be an item number in the movie and pave the way for some racy songs.\n\nThat being said, her dance was mind blowing where she was able to exhibit the levels of which he had trained for the movie. She handled some particularly daring steps an techniques with such grace and ease. But - though it was impressive, it wasn't mind blowing as it was supposed to be. It has nothing to do with Katrina's dancing or acting - but poor costume choice/ choreography that just seemed to distance itself from the music and to exhibit more skin. The songs she was in felt like such a deviation from the rest of the movie.\n\n2. Stunts involving high/ long leaps : Bollywood has reached a level of amazing graphical capabilities and this movie is one of the testaments to it. The sea, sailing, ships and action sequences were believable and did not seem too artificial like the usual Bollywood norm. But =, the industry still seems lacking to manage long and high leaps of the actors and the editing shifting into multiple shots from the time a person starts the jump to when he lands and gets up seems artificial and interfered with the flow of an otherwise good action sequence throughout the movie.\n\nSummary: ToH is a movie that is designed to entertain all the emotional aspects of the spectrum and not to be taken too seriously. It is fun for all ages and has a little bit of everything. It is a movie that will give you goosebumps at the right moments and actually manages some decent laughs due to it's sense of humor that is carried around Aamir's character.\n\nGo without expectations to the cinema and wear a sweater (as it is around 3 hours long) and you will come out with that good feeling you get when you do only one of 3 things - watching a good movie/ after having a good meal/ after emptying a full bladder.\n\nCHeers.",

Imagine, HEAT with Al Pacino and Robert Dinero, and that was a classic masterpiece. This movie gets a ZERO out of 5 stars. I went to see this with so much excitement, and it was just a giant waste of time. This is 100% the director's fault. The director, Vijay Krishna Acharya is so bad, I can't believe it. I can't believe this is the same guy that directed DHOOM !! This guy should never be allowed to direct another movie again. You have two of the BEST ACTORS to ever come out of India, and you turn one into a clown, and another ...the legendary Amitabh Bachchan was shown in slow motion over and over, with no substance or great dialogue, nothing. I mean come on man!! We all wanted to see him act...not move in slow motion. What is wrong with India's director's and their obsession with slow motion, in repeat?? Who told you this is cool?? The plot is horrible...and at one point, I felt like I was watching a movie from the 80's. Katrina Kaif pretty much wears skimpy outfits, shows off her well-defined body, in vulgar dance movies which take away from the movie. The trailer makes it look like she is a lead actress, but she is basically an item number girl with two songs and very skimpy clothes with nothing of substance. I mean I could go on and on, but DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME PAYING TO WATCH THIS CRAP. Very soon this will be on TV for Free, trust me. I am sure after watching himself on screen, Amitabh Bachchan is regretting doing this movie. What a waste of a huge opportunity...two icons on India cinema on screen...and ZERO memorable scenes or dialogues. This director should never direct again. INDIAN DIRECTORS; PLEASE STOP Showing every freaken shot in slow motion....it's outdated, and not cool. TV serials all over again!!! Ok,...rant over. Go watch A STAR IS BORN or BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY Instead...you will love it. Vijay Krishna Acharya...I normally never do this, but man you wasted an opportunity of a lifetime. I guess that is what I am upset about most. AB and AK together....could have been such a huge movie!!!",

            "content": "\"Thugs of Hindostan\" isn't quite as unwatchably bad as you may have heard, but I wouldn't call it a good movie either. I feel the movie has a few decent action scenes but the character development is very one dimensional. The movie comes off as a disappointment because it showcases two great actors, Aamir Khan, and Amitabh Bachchan. In their defense, I think their performances are probably the best part of this movie but it's not enough to save a messily paced story. It's far from the worst movie of 2018 but it is also far from the best, and its definitely one of the biggest let downs in recent Bollywood.",

That's perhaps the only saving grace. Still, not his best work at all. The openingThis was the worst possible movie for Amitabh and Amir to share the screen for the first time. They deserved a lot better. ..Good : Amir Khan's performance. That's perhaps the only saving grace. Still, not his best work at all. The opening was fairly decent. Some parts were visually appealing. ..Bad : This movie is just f**king bad. The role of Khudabaksh could've been given to any B grade actor. Bachchan was wasted as Khudabaksh. It was a shameless ripoff of Pirates of the Caribbean. Okay, I can tolerate that. But, that's not all. It has the same old Indian rebels vs Angrez storyline which has grown stale over the years, and it doesn't even try to make it more interesting. Instead, it gives us lamer version of that storyline. It also jinxed some promising characters, but like in almost every Bollywood mainstream film, it makes a parody out of it and books it completely over the top, if the initial characterization wasn't much of something called \"over the top\". The action scenes look super fake. There are sword fights, and not a single drop of blood. We can clearly see the swords going under the armpits (THAT'S VIJAY KRISHNA ACHARYA FOR YOU). It is too laughably bad. The character of Amir Khan feels like too much. He continues to trade sides between Angrez and Indians, to the point where it feels absolutely nauseating and to every point beyond that. You would want to scream \"pleaaase, stop\". There is one gigantic \"twist\" in the film. But, if you have seen any of these stupid masala entertainers, you can predict it. Since they won't kill of a major character, the twist becomes trivially predictable. That's how lame this piece of s**t is. There is no character development to understand why some characters get their mind changed, except for the fact that they wanted to include a cheap shock value. Katrina Kaif serves her usual purpose of showing her skin for some sexually appealing scenes and dancing in a semi nude costume. Other than that, she is a plot device. And her acting is too good. Even a mannequin gives more expressions than her. The story is crazy and lame. It looks too big, but is the same old s**t. If you want to see an Angrez vs Indian film, watch \"Kranti\" (1981), not this garbage. ..Conclusion : If you are a fan of Amitabh or Amir, check out this film, because it may be the only film in which they both are together. But except for their mere presence, do not expect anything. It sucks big time. Otherwise, do anything productive. Spend your time locking yourself in the bathroom doing nothing, rather than watching this rat's a$$ of a movie. ..Rating. ..Score : 0/10Grade : F",
