            "content": "In the city of Megasaki, Japan, Mayor Kobayashi has banished all dogs to Trash Island fearing an outbreak of dog flu. Scientist Watanabe insists that he will soon have a cure but he is ignored. Atari Kobayashi flies to the island to search for his dog Spots. The boy is an orphan and is a ward of distant uncle Mayor Kobayashi. He is assisted by 5 dogs who voted to help him find Spots. Tough street dog Chief refuses to have a master and is the only to vote no. They go on a journey while the cat loving mayor is planning a final solution.Director Wes Anderson returns to stop-motion animation after Fantastic Mr Fox. While I've loved his movies, his stop-motion stuff is problematic personally. His deadpan structured filming style leaves me feeling tired from repetition. In live action, I can get involved with the actors but I'm less connected with these artificial figures. I did laugh several times for the first half but like before, the style does wear down on me slightly. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable and darn it, I laughed. It's fun while it lasts.",

It is a demented, unsympathetic and uniquely different film that is completely and utterly stunning! The stop-motion animation is great. The script and dialogue is very good, and you gotta love the (dog) characters!The film featured some moments that had me belly-laughing and moments that just melted my heart. It never became sentimental or overly comical. The comedic moments were seriously funny. Wes Anderson pays great attention to detail and he obviously had a clear vision of what he wanted to portray. We don't always understand what the Japanese are saying, as they are not accompanied by subtitles, but that never mattered and - in fact - made it even more interesting, funny and unique.'Isle of Dogs' will go down as one of my all-time favorite movies.",

            "content": "As is almost par for the course with Wes Anderson, at least nowadays, 'Isle Of Dogs (2018)' is far more style over substance, presenting its fairly simple story straightforwardly and with plenty of on-the-nose exposition. Thankfully, the visuals we get are splendid, aside from the annoying and too frequently used 'to-camera' framing that sees characters mug for the fame for no reason other than a repetitive and only occasionally satisfying composition. The amazing stop-motion animation and a general aesthetic balances a real tangibility with a slight absurdist cartoon feel to wonderful effect, though. The way it looks, and moves, is unique and definitely its strong point. The film, much like 'Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)', isn't really aimed at kids. I think most of the allegory and dry wit would go over their heads, and that's not even considering the non-conventional storytelling and slightly 'edgy' elements. But it didn't ever claim to be directed at them and nor should it have, though it does beg the question as to why the narrative seems so diluted and bizarrely expositional (as I've mentioned) - and no it isn't just Anderson's 'style', which can't be an excuse for lazy storytelling - if it didn't have to aim for the youngest of its possible audience. It's the fact that the experience is a passive one, no matter how well crafted or 'quirky', that isn't particularly funny or engaging, that stops it from being any better than it ultimately is. 6/10",

I wasn't sure how he would do with a non-Western setting but he managed well.He keeps his unique style and it works very well with the futuristic, but still traditional Japanese art. It also incorporates some cartooning along with interesting ideas - the Japanese dialogue is not always translated and when it is, it's by interpreters or foreign exchange students. Anderson manages to merge his style with the Japanese and it works seamlessly.It's a very quirky film with an all too relatable story. I enjoyed the visuals more than the plot, I'll admit, but it was still a good movie, with the usual quick dialogues, jokes, strange characters - Tilda Swinton being the weirdest, no surprise there - and altogether it's a great experience.Without spoilers, if you like Wes Anderson, you will like this movie. If you don't, buckle up, because this is jam-packed with everything that is his style, the quirky music works now fused with Japanese, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and the usual cast having very well fitting characters (watch out for the credits Anjelica Huston is there as a Mute Poodle) and the cinematography being interesting and stunning.P.S. It's still not a children's movie, don't let the format fool you.",

            "review_title": "How could you NOT love it?",
            "content": "In my experience, Wes Anderson films have always made great date films.Not even joking. My first proper movie date was with my girlfriend was when we saw The Grand Budapest Hotel. We instantly fell in love with it, and it's a night I still remember fondly for the experience we had in a theater that consisted mainly of us and one other couple. It was simply magical.And that, perhaps, is what makes me love Wes Anderson's work so much; it's simply movie magic. The man can take any setup he pleases and turn it into a whimsical, silly, but somehow all the same \"Important\" piece of film that holds its own weight. In short, Wes Anderson has made himself an icon when it comes to the quirky and whimsy in film. His films are a warm blanket that I love to wrap myself in.In 'Isle of Dogs', the immediate strengths of Wes Anderson are apparent: the worlds he builds. The world of Megasaki and Trash Island are all realized in vivid detail, complete with a massive array of characters on both human and animal ends that one can recall and adore. Rather than the recent disappointment of 'Black Panther', where characterization took a backseat, this film OOZES character and a rich world you can feel. You can show me images of characters from this film and from their appearance ALONE I can tell you a story about them and what I enjoyed about them. The colorful and vast array of characters is something I think I loved most about this film, and still sticks with me even as I write this review.What else has to be admired regarding this film is its respectful and quite incredible treatment of Japanese culture and art. Right from the get-go, Anderson makes it apparent he WANTS the culture to envelope us. All Japanese characters speak Japanese. Only 1-2 humans speak English. The dogs only speak \"English\" for the benefit of our understanding of their dialogue. Megasaki LOOKS like Japan. Japanese text is constantly displayed and is translated in subtitles for only our benefit. There is clear respect paid to the culture Wes wishes to show us, and for having that courage to not simplify it out of sheer convenience, I admire his work here.Additionally, the homages to Japanese cinema, specifically Kurosawa, were welcome beyond all belief in this film. This film is hardly a zany and swift-moving animated film that one sees in this day and age. Heck, it is not even in the same league of movement and speed as Fantastic Mr. Fox was. Rather, this is a film that runs on its own pace, derived from Japanese cinema, and finds its footing in that delivery. It is a crisp, complete-feeling film that FEELS like a 2-hour film, but in the end, it barely coasts over 100 minute total...but it feels absolutely perfect in the time we are given in this rich world. In fact, by the time the film ended, I wanted MORE of the world I had seen.The animation, as if you are even remotely surprised, is GORGEOUS. Every frame, and I mean EVERY FRAME, is just magnificent to look at. Where Fantastic Mr. Fox had the warm cinematography on its side, Isle of Dogs sports a bleaker texture, though it manages to create its own charm that way. You feel the characters' emotions through their well-animated faces, you can see every hair on the dogs' bodies move, you feel every movement of this film and adore it for how charming and Wes Anderson-y it is. Thankfully, the only thing you can NOT feel is the scent of Trash Island...The only thing that has bugged me since seeing this film, however, is how little time the film has to really have FUN. The film is surprisingly played straight in most regards when it comes to conflict, and its tone is whimsy in some regards, but the laughs are surprisingly not as common as you would suspect them to be in a Wes Anderson product. This is not a case of a cultural barrier, but perhaps simply that the story Anderson chose to tell was far more important than including all the laughs he could. The tone of this film is \"different\" than most of his films, which is perhaps a good thing. It works for the film...but for most, I imagine \"different Wes Anderson\" won't click with everyone.The lack of too much \"fun\" is noticeable, however, in that we do not see too much of the silly side of this world Wes Anderson has built. We get occasional glimpses and gags that are classic Anderson and certainly hit, but by the end, it is a surprisingly serious tone the film chooses to maintain in its climax. Again, this WORKS, but I wonder how much more I would have loved the film if it were as child-like and fun as Fantastic Mr. Fox or Grand Budapest Hotel tended to be.The sometimes-noticeable lack of \"fun\", however, does not detract entirely from the enjoyment of the film itself. It is just as quirky and out-there in the best ways possible as any other Wes Anderson film, and thanks to that, the film simply beams with charm. Whether it be its animation style, Anderson's unique direction, or the fantastically unique score by Alexandre Desplate, this film sticks-out as any good Wes Anderson film should.That said, the strongest thing (Aside from the animation) about this film is its subtle message it attempts to strike. This film is one about companionship and love, which is a feeling that often goes hand-in-paw with the subject of dogs and pets. If you have ever been a dog owner, this film WILL strike a chord with you, as it has some very important things to say about our relationship with them that I think often goes understated.Dogs are a connection. Dogs are a beacon of loyalty and family. \"Dogs\" don't need to be dogs. Dogs are man's best friend.How could you not love dogs?How could you not love a Wes Anderson film ABOUT dogs?",

            "content": "I had very high expectations going into Isle of Dogs, being a great admirer of Wes Anderson's work, and especially off the fumes of his previous film, The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). If you look at Wes' filmography, you will notice that each of his films progressively become more focused, detailed, and \"Wes Anderson-ey\". It feels as if his films have been building to a culmination of sorts, which can be represented with Isle of Dogs.The story revolves around a young boy, Atari, who is seeking his lost dog with help from a pack of dogs on Trash Island, right outside of Megasaki City (word-play on Nagasaki), a fictional future city of Japan that is exiling dogs due to a \"canine flu\" outbreak.From a filmmaking viewpoint, Isle of Dogs has it all in spades, and more. The characters are well rounded and relatable, even though the majority of them are dogs. The presentation of the story is very fresh and unique, and the humor is always smoothly intertwined with the narrative and visuals. With a runtime of an hour and 40 minutes, it flies by, always keeping your attention and further engaging you. The stop-motion animation is very well done, and the way it is contrasted with beautiful Japanese imagery is stunning. The soundtrack is also excellent, and aids in telling the story. There are many nods towards Japanese cinema, chiefly Akira Kurosawa's films, which you can tell that Wes has a passion for. The voice cast is star-studded and wonderful as always. There are plenty of twists and surprises, and the film leaves the viewers with some important messages/themes to ponder over. It is best to go into the movie knowing as little about the story as possible, and let it take you on its journey.This film will greatly reward repeat viewings. The attention to detail in every frame is incredible, and there is always so much on the screen to absorb and process, in the best way possible. I believe that Wes Anderson has the most distinct and easily discernible style of any filmmaker to ever live, and this quality alone is something to be praised very highly.If you love dogs, Japanese cinema/culture, stop-motion, and animation in general, then you will love this film all the more so. Isle of Dogs, shows Wes at his full unfiltered creative power, stretching his capabilities, and giving us something truly remarkable.Ineffable Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls052767730/",

            "content": "The Japanese had company. Hayao Miyazaki was not the only iconoclast of cel. Martin Rosen, a relatively unsung British filmmaker, just like the Ghibli founder, rehabilitated the perception of animated films as being solely a child's preoccupation, following up \"Watership Down\", adapted from the Richard Adams young adult novel with \"The Plague Dogs\", whose lab animal storyline provided Wes Anderson with a template for \"Isle of Dogs\". Actually, Anderson utilizes both films: From \"Watership Down\", the one about rabbits, he replicates its storytelling device, the prologue, in which a narrator tells the story of The Great Frith, a JC figure who is at the center of the hare's religion. El-ahrirah is Adam. It's their creation myth. The animation style(best described as moving children book illustrations) differs from the impressionistic watercolor look that follows. The rabbit creation myth gives the burrowing mammals an interior life. In \"Isle of Dogs\", the prologue is named as such, titled \"The Boy and the Headless Ancestor\", it recounts a history of cats and dogs, a history that has more in common with folklore than scripture, told through Japanese woodblock paintings. The ancient art form, indigenous to Japan, gives way to stop motion animation, indigenous to 19th century America. Although there is no transfigured creation myth in \"Isle of Dogs\", the filmmaker reinvents the human form of the carpenter into a warrior who challenged the hegemony that cats held over dogs by slaying Mayor Kenji's forefather, founder of the cat worship-based religion. The renegade Kobayashi defector was immortalized as The Boy Samurai of Legend. Cats and dogs don't need to look toward the stars. They have masters. It's people who need a higher love. And in this alternate universe, instead of a text, a consecrated book that connects mankind to the spiritual world, the dog is the text, or cat, depending on what the pet advocate believes. Such are the properties of the canonical in this domesticated animal-centric world that Anderson lays out. Petting a dog brings you closer to God. Petting a cat brings you closer to God, too.The lay of the land, home of the brave, Anderson replicates then displaces, our current political climate, moving the partisan fighting to an island nation. Two factions exists, pro-dog and anti-dog, and both sides, not just the latter, take on the personification of a social activist group, more so than a religion. The two sides, brainwashed by state propaganda, don't seem to understand that their mutual enemy is Mayor Kenji, the current dictator of the cat-loving Kobayashi dynasty. Before the wood blocks, there is a diorama, and the objects within this diorama convey more than a passing resemblance to eastern faith. The formally dressed man, a high priest of sorts, moves ritual-like precision inside the tableau adorned with cats; he hits a gong, lights candles, bows, and claps his hands together twice in reverence of the sacred feline. The cat worship is government-sanctioned, the dominant religion whose leaders of an apocryphal Japan devised a campaign against dogs by expropriating the chemical industry to cleanse the country of man's best friend. At a town hall meeting, Professor Watanabe, the Science Party candidate, introduces a cure in the works for snout fever, a dog serum that would stave off the planned deportation of dogs from Megasaki City to an adjunct island. But the people reject science; the people turn into an angry mob; the anti-dog demonstrators, once former dog lovers are now cat lovers, a conversion to the fictionalized native eastern religion propagated by propaganda. They throw things at Watanabe, setting his female assistant into action. Yoko Ono stares down the anti-Science crowd as she moves the professor away from the lectern. Yes, that Yoko Ono.In his lifetime, John Lennon wanted Ono to get credit for co-writing \"Imagine\", a song that takes gentle aim at belief systems as the intervening hitch whenever peace talks are attempted and inevitably fail. In 2017, Lennon, posthumously, finally got his wish when the National Music Publishers Association(NMPA) added Ono's name alongside her late husband as the co-author of \"Imagine\". The temptation is there to posit Watanabe as a stand-in for Lennon, since in \"God\", a track off the ex-Beatles first solo album \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", he renounces his past association with the Maharishi. The professor dies, but there is ambiguity in the cause of his death. Under house arrest, Watanabe eats a boxed lunch comprised of sushi, then stops to inspect the final piece, suspecting poison. He tastes the laced wasabi, but the filmmaker cuts away before we learn if that tentative lick was enough to kill him. Did the professor ingest the whole of the wasabi? Does he want his assistant to get full credit for the dog serum? The cure for snout fever is finished after his passing. At the sake bar, Tracy Walker, a student activist, confronts Ono about the dog serum. The bartender slides down a bottle of blue liquid. Look at how close Ono moves her face up to the glass. Like in real life, she remained silent about the truth.It's hers.",

            "content": "Isle of Dogs is Wes Anderson's love letter to Dogs and Japan, her aesthetic, her archetypes, and her culture. And it's in those respects where the movie flourishes, as Anderson lovingly and meticulously breathes life into his imagined Nippon of the future. If you love Wes Anderson and Dogs, you'll probably dig this movie. Furthermore, if you have an appreciation of Japan and its culture you might like it too...just don't expect anything more than a superficial treatment and you won't be disappointed. I would also add that this superficiality, the elevation of style over substance, is what keeps this from being a great film, as the human characters were all flat. They were one-dimensional archetypes, and the lead, a boy named Atari felt more like a conglomeration of archetypes and quirks than anything else.\nAnderson didn't let me spend enough time with them, and Anderson didn't spend enough time developing them, for those characters and storylines to come together in a satisfying way.Now the story involving the dogs was quite enjoyable, and had a pleasant enough conclusion, but it wasn't good enough to make up for the un-engaging humans we had to follow for much of the screen-time. They weighed the picture down, and it dragged...specifically the second act (a guy in my showing fell asleep about forty five minute in, and I must admit that my eye lids got heavy too).Basically with Isle of Dogs, what you see is what you get. If you dig Wes Anderson, and his muses, you'll probably like this movie. It's a lovely looking movie with real moments of visual and atmospheric inspiration. Just keep your expectations low and don't expect any real depth.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this wonderful little film that was such a departure in a way for director Wes Anderson, yet his style is still readily obvious. I saw this at a midnight showing and I can tell you, everyone walking out of the theater was raving and talking about how great it was, And it was, such a charming a cute adventure of a story that was a total surprise, in the sense of a surprise to see Anderson making an animated film. I was so exited for the film and it really was in no way a disappointment, I thoroughly enjoyed his latest work, in fact, I might go see it twice, which is rare for me. In the second paragraph I will discuss a little more about what exactly I liked about it, but in general this was a damn good film that demands a viewing.Wes Anderson's style is so honed in this film despite it being animated. The use of colors and symmetry are still plainly obvious, the color and design of things very consistent giving a believable world for the film to be set in. Each one of the characters was deeply developed and fascinating while also working off many of the other characters. The writing is sharp, intelligent, and very well written in the style of many of the other Anderson classics. So basically if you are a fan of his style, then you will be delighted to see this movie that is the personification of Wes Anderson's style.",

All of your classic Wes Anderson tropes of lingering still shots, zany dialogue, and an outlandish take on underdogs (pun intended) rebelling against the system are present. The Japanese themes were artistically delivered as well as one could expect, and felt respectful to the culture. The quality is as good as Fantastic Mr Fox, though the heavy use of untranslated Japanese leaves the viewer somewhat emotionally estranged from human characters.Setting is modern Japan, where a dog flu epidemic has turned a city against its furry friends. The evil dog hating mayor has rounded up all dogs and exiled them to trash island, where they live in filth and suffering. Atari, the adopted son of the Mayor, flies a plane onto the island to rescue his dog. Hilarity and poignant moments ensue.Don't miss this one if you are a Wes Anderson fan, or simply want a great comedy. Certain scenes may bother kids below the age of 5. The subtle allegory on an evil leader stirring the pot against the most helpless in our society is timely and well wrought. There is a legitimate criticism on the \"white savior\" plot device that plagues nearly all Western movies based in Asia, and I hope future directors take heed.",

A wonderful and inspired animation comedy that lives from the typical Wes Anderson wit. The stop motion was perfect and it was created with many beautiful details.

Bryan Cranston was terrific and so was Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Greta Gerwig, Jeff Goldblum and Tilda Swinton (tho her character deserved way more screen time. \nThe soundtrack was fantastic, especially the score was perfectly created. The screenplay is among Wes Anderson's best work to date. I loved the editing and general look of it. There are nice and funny twists throughout the whole film. And in the end it has an important message to tell. Its a winner film and I am sure it will make its mark at the box office, with the critics and also at next years Oscars (especially in the best animation feature category).

There is an air of self awareness about the story that, rather than disengaging, is used to draw the viewer more into the inherently ridiculous story. There is an artistry to suspending disbelief, and this is an endlessly creative way to get the audience to do so. To make them aware they're getting conventional information or that certain things are ridiculous plot details, even tropes, and highlighting such details to actually enhance the storytelling rather than distance the viewer.

I LOVED IT!, this is even better then Fantastic Mr. Fox, this could arguably be one of the best films of this year, so what's it about?.In the city of Megasaki, Mayor Kobayashi banishes all flu infected dogs to a island called \"Trash Island\" where all dogs live in a grey, unpleasant, rotten and dangerous island where junk food is thrown away and other props that have now turn into junk, however a 12-Year-Old boy named Atari Kobayashi travels to the island to look for his loyal bodyguard dog named Spots (voiced by Liev Schreiber) with the help of five other dogs, Chief (Bryon Cranston), Rex (Edward Norton), Boss (Bill Murray), Duke (Jeff Goldblum) and King (Bob Balaban).So from what I just said, you'll know what will happen, in just the most basic way possible and it will be just as generic as any other animated film, but not this one, Wes Anderson put in so much elements in to one and for some strange reason it.... actually works, comedy, drama, suspense, adventure, fantasy and sci-if, all of these elements in this movie work off each other with every unique turn, it all stays on point with It elements and doesn't feel out of place, it creates atmosphere and different moods, the film also have genuine emotion that anyone who has dogs can relate to and can pull off really funny moments at the same time can be quite mature, the film also have moments that I didn't see coming and quite graphic and a bit sweary for a PG which shows Wes is taking risks, seeing the film as more of a adult film then a harmless family movie, I never thought I would say this but this is not only a original idea with it's fantastic direction, writing and a powerful moral about Dogs should be treated equally and old things shouldn't be replaced with new things to change the future, in all honesty this much effort feels so.... groundbreaking.The animation is fantastic, I know it's expected for a stop-motion film like this but you can't help but be impressed by it, comparing it to Fantastic Mr. Fox, this animation has ideas, for example the different styles used when a character is seen on CCTV cameras or when characters are seen in a far distance is used in different art styles and it works unbelievably well, the characters have a down to earth and real look to it, the dogs are all each identified by their types, you can tell who's who from Chief to Nutmeg to Jupiter, their fur moves normally like wind is blowing through it, which is such a unique small detail that is just creates realism and believability, the humans look fantastic, looking almost realistic with very expressive faces, they all have a unique look that stands out as well, the backgrounds are so well-crafted like the city is a place full of colour and makes you feel welcomed while Trash Island has a grey, dirty, nasty, unpleasant and sad look to it that again creates a mood of misery and fear, the animation truly knows how to make stop-motion animation look impressive, extraordinary and beautiful fall at the same time.The characters are all unforgettable and so likeable that people will have at least one favourite, They all play a part in the plot that gets it going and they all have a moment to shine to show who they are and what their goals are, my favourite characters are Chief, Spots, Atari, Rex, Tracy, Nutmeg and Jupiter, they all have personality and some memorable about them, same with the villains, they create fear and conflict with our heroes and they can be quite intimidating, the voice acting is top-notch, with big names like Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Scarlet Johansson, Bill Murray and Jeff Goldblum and the rest of cast as well, everyone put in great voice performances, Bryan Cranston, Scarlet Johansson, Liev Schreiber and Greta Gerwig all stand out for me and just put so much emotion and effort into their performances, I'm happy that the major character have development and all the rest have a purpose with wonderful voice acting.And on a side note, the score by Alexandre Desplat is one of the best movie scores I have ever heard, seriously, check it out, it's so fascinating, but after the movie of course.So yeah as you can tell I love this movie so much, need I say more?, an originally plot, groundbreaking and brilliant animation, characters that have development while others all have screen time with a moment to shine with wonderful voice-acting and an amazing score, people if you love Fantastic Mr. Fox and/or Wes Anderson, you'll love this, take the kids to see this one if they can handle blood and swears, it's a mature and adult film that everyone must watch, please see it while it's still in cinemas because we need more stop-motion films to prove that they can still make money and bring us something timeless, but Wes Anderson, you did me proud, cannot wait to see the next stop-motion you make next.I'm at delighted to give Isle of Dogs a solid 10/10.",

            "content": "\"Isle of Dogs\" (PG-13, 1:41) is a stop-motion animated adventure comedy directed and written by multiple Oscar-nominated auteur Wes Anderson and realized in his distinctive quirky style and with his usual stable of all-star talent. Anderson is best known for films like \"Rushmore\" (1998), \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" (2001), \"Moonrise Kingdom\" (2012) and his Best Picture Oscar-nominated \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" (2014), but this isn't Anderson's first animated project. 2009's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" (also a stop-motion animated comedy) received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature. Typically unusual and eclectic, Anderson has said that \"Isle of Dogs\" is inspired both by the 1960s and 70s holiday specials produced by Rankin/Bass - and the films of legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa.In the near future, Japan's people are concerned about an overabundance of stray dogs - and the possibility of a rampant canine flu affecting humans. The leader of Megasaki City, Mayor Kobayashi (voiced by Kunichi Nomura), who comes from a long line of cat lovers, signs an order banishing all dogs to Trash Island, starting with Spots (Liev Schreiber), the pet and guardian of the Mayor's orphaned nephew and ward, 12-year-old Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin). Atari then steals an airplane and crash lands (with only minor injuries) on Trash Island when he is discovered and helped by a self-proclaimed \"pack of scary, indestructible alpha dogs\", led by the human-averse Chief (Bryan Cranston) and including the more timid Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Boss (Bill Murray) and Duke (Jeff Goldblum). As those five dogs fight off other dogs for territory - and some humans sent to retrieve Atari - and then lead him on a dangerous and uncertain cross-island odyssey trying to find Spots (if he's even still alive), there's a lot happening back in Megasaki City. A scientist called Professor Watanabe (Arika Ito), who has an assistant named Yoko Ono (voiced by Yoko Ono), claims that he's perfecting a cure for the dog flu, but the powers-that-be aren't interested (to say the least). Meanwhile, an American exchange student named Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig), who stands with the city's dog lovers, develops a fascination with Atari's story (as reported on the news) - and an obsession with uncovering what's really going on.\"Isle of Dogs\" is creative and attractive, but not very enjoyable. It has Anderson's trademark adorable quirkiness, but the plot is so far-fetched (no pun intended) and irrelevant to anything going on in the world that the whole thing feels like a pretty pointless exercise. Limited cuteness - and quirkiness just for quirkiness' sake - is of limited entertainment value. \"C-\"",

            "review_title": "Didn't work. Pick a genre for your narrative.",
            "content": "OVERALL: I feel like this film suffered by trying to be too many things. I'm no cook, but I know that a cook can't just take a bunch of random ingredients they like, throw them together, and expect a good result. Isle of Dog is this type of mashup. For the Record, I'm capable of liking dogs, liking a post dystopia type environment, liking a heartwarming narratives about kids and their friendships with pets. I often like irreverent comedies. I like narratives that highlight political corruption when done well. This film tried to be all these things plus celebrate Japanese culture. No 100 minute film can very well pull off so many conflicting things. I think many people want to like this film because they like and care about all or many of these things. And people can relate to the passion of the filmmaking of Wes Anderson. And they like his individualism. But that doesn't make the substance of a movie good. It just gives one reason to want it to be good. I'm not a troll, but I expect down the line this film will lose a star or two, because at some point people will realize that this film doesn't effectively tell a good story. The Good: The film does have some great animation and great voice acting. The timing, the cuts, and quirkiness are likable. Many of the jokes are entertaining. There is a joy and passion in this film. It's trying to be unlike any other movie. And it succeeds in this regard. And I really do respect that. THE BAD: I don't know the genre of this movie, or could say in 20 words what this movie is about. I don't know a successful movie that can't describe itself by such basic parameters. If there's too much, one can't delve into some issues or some characters. And then, what is the audience left to care about? In 2 or so hours, you can only do so much. The two strongest descriptions for Isle of Dogs were that it was a quirky irreverent dystopic comedy, and it was a heart-warming drama about the love between people and their pets and their fight to reunite. Both are great. But if a film tries to go all-out in celebrating both, in this case, one doesn't compliment the other but instead contradicts and cripples the other. These styles are at odds with each other no matter how much an individual may like both. And such contradictions make it difficult to be invested in the story. I'm not saying that there can be no comedy in a drama or vice versa, but they need to feel like they exist within the overall comedic or dramatic foundation for the story which is being told. Dr. Strangelove makes a lot of dramatic political points. But it's clearly within it's comedic environment. Casablanca has some great humorous exchanges, but it never gives one the impression that there aren't still huge dramatic stakes. Isle of Dogs never establishes an environment that has some rules or consequences or meaning because it's always switching between two conflicting styles. This makes the film seem long especially the last 30 minutes or so. I was wondering when it would end. The interest in masterful visual and auditory aesthetics can only last so long. Eventually, I think about the substance. And this substance is always being rewritten, which makes it hard to feel much is at stake and worth caring about. CONCLUSION: Style alone can't save this film, or I'd argue, any feature length film. I'd say Wes Anderson would be better off minimizing his ambitions for a future feature project so he can effectively give attention to a few things he really cares about, instead of undermining himself. Or he could just make a short quirky art film which highlights the joy of film-making and what can be done with art. He clearly has a talent for executing a vision, and has a unique spirt which should be appreciated. He just needs to be sure that his narrative vision is consistent, so it can be understood and fully appreciated from a story-telling perspective.",

It's like Anderson makes movies for the sole purpose of existing inside his own head. And I'm tiring of his stylistic quirks -- the toneless line deliveries, the dead pan mugging directly at the camera, the awkward pauses as if the characters in the film are waiting for a laugh track that the audience watching the movie can't hear.The animation in \"Isle of Dogs\" is breathtaking, but I couldn't get into it at all.Grade: B-",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" didn't feature one shot of the Hungarian capital, so it was much to my further annoyance at the director's geographical ignorance that his latest animated feature, \"Isle of Dogs\", didn't go anywhere near E14. In fact, it's set in a fictional city of the other side of the planet!Resulting from an age-old family feud, Mayor Kobayashi (voiced by co-writer Kunichi Nomura) of Megasaki, a cat-lover, paints dogs out to be a diseased species and banishes them all to Trash Island; an island as its name suggests. The Mayor's nephew Atari, a dog-lover, seeks his pet dog and bodyguard Spots and flies to Trash Island. The islands new natives do not trust humans and their English is incompatible with Atari's Japanese. The Mayor angered, he sends in the troops to bring Atari back. Though with a band of newly found \"man's best friend\" voiced by a list of star names, Atari flees and locates Spots, but finds he has started a new life on the island as its mythical leader. Back in Megasaki, Kobayashi seeks to destroy evidence of dog serums created by dedicated scientists to bring all canines back; to much protest from a group of student activists. Returning, Atari delivers a rousing speech to shame his uncle, releasing the serum and reviving the dormant dog-lover in the citizens of Megasaki. The end. One word to describe \"Isle of Dogs\" is \"nice.\" The animation is well-executed, though you don't feel it anything too innovative; it looks very nice, but is far from delivering anything too dramatic; a nicely put together, extensive ensemble cast creates a lot of draws, though the delivery at times can be a little flat, perhaps due to actors taking on voice acting roles. The film is not greater than the sum of its parts, with the aesthetics giving a feel of style over substance, with no real depth when you wash away the level of trash. In an interview at Berlinale, the writing team suggested that a dog trash island was the starting point for the film; the Japanese setting coming later. The decision to set the film in Japan seems aesthetic as much as anything. References to the films of Akira Kurosawa are made throughout and acknowledged by Anderson. But it could easily have been set in France.\"Isle of Dogs\", therefore, would appear a more Tarantino-style homage piece than cultural appropriation that has caused debate. The incorporation of a Japanese to the writing team gives some additional authenticity in cultural reference points, as well as a Japanese cast delivering Nihon-go, giving a Japanese audience a little something extra. However, much like last year's \"Ghost in the Shell\", the intended target audience means that American voices still dominate. The student protest is driven by foreign exchange student Tracy (Greta Gerwig); and while a stylistic choice, simultaneous translators talk over much of the Japanese dialogue. The inconsistency of the direct translation of text versus none for dialogue could perhaps irk some viewers also. Though, in general, the film feels good-natured and too light-hearted to intentionally create the controversial debate which arose - though this is perhaps an unconscious given in Hollywood in this day and age. In fact, that is perhaps where the film falls short: Perhaps aimed at a younger audience, the storyline is a little too light and breezes through with ease and little in the way of real bite.politic1983.blogspot.co.uk",

            "content": "When those who whip the populace up into fear and hatred have a greater voice than those who use reason and science, man will do unspeakable, heartless things. What could be worse than turning on his most faithful, innocent friend, the dog? Of course, the film actually has as little to do with dogs as the original Godzilla had to do with monsters. With fantastic artistry, light touches of humor, and an homage to Japanese culture, Wes Anderson delivers a message film that is every bit as beautiful as it is touching.While the film has the worldwide rise of populism clearly in its sites, my favorite moment was when the troubled stray Chief (voiced by Bryan Cranston) talks about a mistake he made after being adopted:\"Anyway, one morning a week later, the youngest boy, his name was Toshiro, woke me up at 6:15, bright-eyed, wide-awake, and he tried to pet me. He didn't mean anything by it. He was just being friendly. Apparently, I bit him so hard, I nearly chewed his hand off. Blood all over the kitchen floor. They rushed him to the emergency room and I got padlocked out in the tool shed with the lights out. It gave me some time to think. What happened? Why did I do that? To this day, I have no idea. I guess he scared me. I bite.\"It's a painful, soul-searching moment, and those who have damaged in some way in their lives will identify. He doesn't know why he bites, but we do. He's never been shown any kindness. It's a parable in empathy and understanding that really resonated with me.It was also telling that the hope in the film is with youth, and with the appealing to the hearts of the people. In another brilliant moment, the boy says:\"I have spent much of my time in recent weeks traveling in the company of the very kind of animals our mayor refers to as \"bad-dogs.\" They are the finest living beings I have ever come to know in all my dozen years on this earth. To your readers, the good people of Megasaki, I say: the cycle of life always hangs in a delicate balance. Who are we, and who do we want to be?\"Who are we, indeed. What the world needs now, Anderson is telling us, is love and understanding. Simply fantastic.",

Along with Anderson regulars Bill Murray, Anjelica Huston, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Jeff Goldblum (and occasional cast members F.

This film clearly under-performs. Its technical aspects -- the visuals, voices, all the production values -- to my untrained eye are quite good. It's quirky and original. The plot is decent, albeit that there's little tension. What dark, tense moments do exist don't last and don't grab us. In other words, it's rather superficial.There's little character development, save for one dog, where we can see some character trajectory, but, again, it fails to go deeper. That is to say, the movie plays it quite safe; it engages us enough to keep on watching, but it doesn't want to stir up anything deeper inside of us.

There are examples of great films that mix comedy, drama and allegory. The concept really intrigued me. And Wes Anderson has an unmistakable, unique and very interesting style that appeals to me.'Isle of Dogs' looked incredible from how it was advertised and it is generally one of the best received films of the year, one of the highest rated on here as well. So along with the things mentioned in the above paragraph, it quickly became one of my most anticipated films to watch and high up on my need to watch list. Watching it, 'Isle of Dogs' became high up in my favourites of the year so far and towards the top as far as Anderson's work goes.Perhaps 'Isle of Dogs' is a little too exposition heavy (mostly very interesting but sometimes a little rambling) at times, with it not getting going straight away. Also found some of the female characters underused and not explored enough. A primary example being Nutmeg.However the animation is truly splendid, full of rich detail in the backgrounds and little things, quirky and nuanced character design and vibrant colours. The music score is beautiful, energetic and whimsical, while the direction is full of Anderson's creative, distinctive and unique trademarks. Writing is full of dry wit and has emotion and charm, probing thought too. The story is unconventional but always involving, with its fair share of entertaining moments, poignant drama (the emotional core of the story is truly touching and with a lot of charm), its affectionate and tender portrayal of dogs and intriguing political elements without it being preachy. The Japanese elements are charmingly and creatively handled, not in a biased way. Even with the quirks, there's also a maturity to how everything is done and told. Characters are cute and offbeat while all of the voice acting is spot from the likes of Bryan Cranston, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum and Frances McDormand.Overall, great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Second, its animation and the trailer looked great (including the dogs). Third, it's set in Japan, a country I love for its culture, including the passion for film, animation and manga. Fourth it's a movie by Wes Anderson and I liked his previous work. And yet, I was quite disappointed. 'Isle of Dogs' was much less than what I had expected.It's a film by Wes Anderson and it comprises many of the qualities that you can expect from the stylish director. It is amazing in it's visual part which combines a dystopic image of the close visuals of Japan with animation descending from the Japanese manga style and from the Disney dog lovers division. It gathers in the distribution a unique collection of stars which borrow their voices to the animated characters. It lacks however one important component - a compelling and original story. All the talent invested in the movie seems wasted in an exuberant aesthetic show supporting a rather childish and expected story about a teens and children helping good dogs in their fight against bad men. Too simple, too linear.Dogs seldom fail us in real life. This is one exception. Luckily, it happens on screen.",

            "content": "'Isle of Dogs' is another animated/puppet Wes Anderson film, a la 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' and his 9th film overall. Needless to say, it's quirky and offbeat. The plot is quite simple: Megasaki in Japan is divided into dog-haters and dog-lovers, and the mayor exiles all dogs to an island/dump across the bay. Atari (Rankin), a 12-year-old boy, then sets off to rescue his dog, Spots (Schreiber). The main characters are a pack of talking dogs - Chief (Cranston), Rex (Norton), Boss (Murray), Duke (Goldblum) and King (Balaban).Even though it's stop-motion animation/puppetry, it's not really a kids film. It must have just scraped a PG instead of an M. There's certainly some rather grim moments and gallows humour. It takes a while to build momentum and fully immerse you in the story - the final third is much better than the rest of the film. There's probably too much drumming in the score - it becomes distracting, as does the lack of subtitles for the bits spoken in Japanese. It's certainly not a bad film, but nowhere near as fun as 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' or 'Moonrise Kingdom'. The puppetry is pretty amazing, even though they sometimes look like action figures in close up, but the animation and some of the landscape shots are expertly done. There's a million cuts, as is Anderson's style, and too many characters, so no one gets a true chance to shire.",

            "content": "Very enjoyable movie - downright hilarious, and it's good for kids, too. Seems that in Megasaki City, Japan, the dogs have come down with a bad case of the flu and have been forcibly evacuated to the appropriately named Trash Island, which housed factories, trash facilities, and so on. The first dog sent over to the island belongs to the young ward and nephew of the city's mayor; years later, the boy hijacks a small plane and heads to the island to find his pal. Aided by five other dogs, he must deal with the machinations of his distant uncle, robot dogs, the dog flu, and other obstacles in order to find Spots the dog. Wes Anderson's imaginative, beautiful movie employs stop-action animation with excellent detail to wonderful effect. I mean, you can see the individual fur strands move. The life of an untethered dog is exquisitely expressed, and as usual Anderson employs fine actors to provide the dogs' voices, such as Bill Murray, Liev Schrieber, Bob Balaban, Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton, and Bryan Cranston. As an added bonus, the entire movie is presented as a Japanese film that's been, shall we say, modified for an American audience. When the mayor gives one of his many speeches, for example, a translator sits off in the wings, speaking his words in English. A note tells us that the dogs' barks have been automatically translated to English, too. But lest you think this is a culture appropriation issue, the original Japanese written language is employed throughout. In short, great entertainment no matter who you are.",

It is quirky, charming, original and refreshing. And it has a lot of heart.\nThe stop-motion animation is a sight for sore eyes, especially with all the flashy computer-generated animation out there, Sometimes less is more. Each frame, Each scene while stunning is soothing at the same time, which is the trademark of the director.\nIt is one of those rare movies where the technical craft is on par with the emotional craft. While it has great direction, cinematography, music, voice acting (Perfect casting), The story is what struck a deep chord with me.\nDogs love their humans unconditionally and it is great to see a story which shows this love and has a human protagonist who reciprocates that love and does everything he can to get his best friend back. Atari Kobayashi talks less but his actions speak volumes, As a protagonist, he is a breath of fresh air. The dogs Rex, Duke, King, Boss and Chief are hilarious (Throughout the movie, I kept wondering just how does Duke know everything?? I am really glad they answered that question, lol).\nThe movie has a lot of themes such as propaganda, conspiracy, animal-cruelty and unjustified hatred but at its heart is the bond between a dog and it's human. I recommend this movie to any dog lover out there. It will make you appreciate your dog and dogs in general, a bit more.\nP.S: My favourite scene in the entire movie is that of a chef preparing a sushi platter, it is pure perfection. The craft on display here is outstanding.",

It wasn't at all respectful to the Japanese and it definitely wasn't an homage to anything related to that culture. Haiku jokes, samurai references everywhere, people dressing and acting like they're from WW2 imperial Japan, sumo wrestlers, the list goes on. When someone speaks Japanese, because they're using yelling talk without any subtitles, and that's supposed to be 'funny'.\nMost of the jokes in the movie would not work if it was set in, say, the US. \nAnd if this backward looking Japanese city set in the future was so Japanese centric (no english signs anywhere), why are their dogs named 'Spots', 'Chief', 'King'?!\nSome earlier reviews have complained that the movie was 'whitewashing', by placing the english-speaking actors names at the top, and the japanese at the bottom. I don't find that offensive, since it is a hollywood movie, and the voices are of well-known hollywood actors. It doesn't make sense to put a lesser known actor at the top, regardless of their ethnic background.\nIt's just a shame that culturally-specific jokes are still acceptable today. Come on, Hollywood, I thought you were supposed to be progressive, and all this metoo stuff. I'm just thankful they didn't have a godzilla or a scene of harakiri in the movie.\nUnfortunately, I can't really comment much on the story itself. Was it interesting? Not really. Were the characters enjoyable? They were okay. But overall, the stereotypes depicting the Japanese culture and people ruined the enjoyment of the film.",

            "content": "An outburst of wild, untamed creativity. That's the best way to describe 'Isle of Dogs'. You would almost think that director Wes Anderson's imagination is spinning out of control, judging from the number of ideas, storylines, gimmicks and visual treats in the film. Let's face it: at first sight the story sounds like something crazy. It is set in a Japanese city where the mayor decides to evacuate all dogs to a garbage island. His twelve year old nephew decides to rescue his favourite pet from the island, and hijacks a sputtering jet fighter. This leads to a series of wild adventures and weird developments. In a way it is indeed completely crazy - but just leave it to Anderson to make it work. In 'The Fantastic Mr Fox' Anderson showed how he could use stop motion animation to create animals who talked and acted like humans. In 'Ilse of Dogs' he brings this process to perfection. Helped by a top cast providing the voices, the dogs are great characters. Their personalities are much more developed than the humans in the story. This is accentuated by the Japanese dialogue of the humans, which is largely left untranslated. This puts the viewer in the position of the dogs, who can't understand humans either. Visually, 'Isle of Dogs' is wonderful. It's full of nice aesthetics, original viewpoints, and funny running gags. An example is the way Anderson shows the many dog fights: a large cloud of dust, with the fighting dogs largely invisible, apart from some body parts sticking out of the cloud.Sometimes there is almost too much going on at the same time. I had trouble paying attention to all the little visual details, while at the same time concentrating on the story (with some flashbacks adding complexity) and trying to recognize the voices of Frances McDormand, Harvey Keitel, Tilda Swinton and Scarlett Johansson (hers was easy). So if you go and see the movie, be warned: you can't lean back and relax, you have to stay alert at all times!",

His imagination and style amazes me like no other filmmaker has and Isle of Dogs is another beautifully crafted film by him.Isle of Dogs takes place in the city of Megasaki where an outbreak of dog flu leads to Mayor Kobayashi demanding every dog to be sent to Trash Island. On the island, a group of five dogs try to help a young boy named Atari find his lost dog, Spots.I have a real special place for stop motion animation. It's an art style that requires so much time and effort but if done right, the result can be dazzling. This is the second stop motion film Wes Anderson has made with the first being Fantastic Mr. Fox. I don't think this film is as good as Fantastic Mr. Fox but the one thing I believes it improves on is the animation. This is some of the best stop motion I've ever seen and I truly cannot imagine how much time went into creating the world of Megasaki. Anderson does such an incredible job building this world for us through the variety of set locations, rich colours and camera techniques. I loved the varying design of every dog we see in the film. They all look so different and are unique in their own right. Wes Anderson and the entire team of animators deserve a lot of praise for the amount of effort they put into creating this world as Isle of Dogs is a feast for the eyes.What also added to the worldbuilding was the treatment of Japanese culture. Anderson goes all out in the representation of the culture to make the world feel as authentic as possible to the audience. All the Japanese characters speak Japanese and the sets are very reminiscent of Japan. There is also a fantastic sushi making sequence where the animation is not only perfect but also adds to the immersion into this fictional world. The script is also delightful with many funny lines and whimsical moments whilst maintaining a level of seriousness. Despite being an animation, Isle of Dogs isn't strictly a kids movie. It deals with mature themes and involves politics into its story quite a bit but there are still parts of it that I can see kids enjoying. The voice acting by the ensemble is also fantastic. Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Frances McDormand, Greta Gerwig, Bob Balaban, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton and the Japanese cast all do a terrific job with their roles. My favourite performance has to be the one given by Bryan Cranston as Chief.The only thing that bothered me was the lack of translation for the Japanese dialogue. Some of them are done either by subtitles or a translator in the film but a lot of them don't get a translation which does create a barrier between the audience and the Japanese characters especially the young boy Atari, whom we're supposed to care about.In spite of this, Isle of Dogs is an absolute joy to watch. I feel Wes Anderson has perfected his skill in stop motion animation here and has managed to create yet another imaginative and unique film.",

Yes the hero of this story is not the little Atari Kobayashi, but the white American student with Afro hair, named Tracy Walker. Of course you could not make a movie with American money, without appearing certain mannerisms or mechanisms. The dumbest minds will say that it is to lure people to the box office, but why the Japanese people, who are hustling in the history of this movie are idiots who can not communicate without screaming, and schizophrenics that can not socialize with other individuals from other countries. The clearest example is when Tracy Walker tries to \"pull\" a information from a japanese scientist over a sore to heal dogs. Seriously, Hollywood, why the filmmakers do not try to first change their mentality, before writing these scripts for these films.Yes, this movie has the same stereotype ideas about Japanese people that Hollywood thinks that is true, but I doubt many Hollywood guys had left their jobs or homes to live in Japan, and they would see a totally different life and people.Not to mention that the story of the film is totally chich\u00e9 and predictable, despite the excellent animation (stop animation animated movie) out of ordinary. But good animation is not enough to save a movie. A good script, story and characters are the main reason, because when the animation effect passed away (the Wow reaction of the audience), it is the story that stays in the memory.The Wow effect on the audience due to the excellent animation only lasts the first 10 minutes of the movie, after this the audience becomes more interested about the story and characters rather the beautiful animation. The most important thing is how the story of the movie is told, not in what way it is told (special effects, animation or music, etc...).",

Young Atari travels there in pursuit of his missing dog Spots, in which he is assisted by a group of the dogs who live there.You can often break a movie down into the story, and how it is executed on screen. I try to imagine how the story here would have been dealt with by someone rather more conventional than Wes Anderson, and I can see it being a straightforward dog-centric narrative if undertaken by Disney, Pixar, Ghibli, Sony Animation etc.So the Wes Anderson factor - and the execution is pure Wes Anderson - is what marks this out as unique. Which doesn't necessarily mean good, although this film does seem to have found a moderate amount of public goodwill. Just not from me.I love animation, but Anderson has adopted a similar style to what he did with Fantastic Mr Fox, which looks ugly. I didn't find this a film which I enjoyed looking it.The quirky humour was, to me, just quirky. Anderson, too often, seems to be having his own private jokes, not unlike the Coen brothers.\nI loved the star-studded and wildly eclectic voice cast, but I often didn't like how they were directed - there was far too much deadpanning.For me, this film was made by Wes Anderson for an audience consisting of Wes Anderson.",

            "content": "If you are expecting symmetrical compositions, deadpan humor and the occasional sudden bursts of uncomfortable violence with some emotion throw in then you know you have stepped into a Wes Anderson film. And that's what Isle of Dogs but a lot more political and serious then you might expect.Isle of Dogs is set in an alternate future Japan where Mayor Kobayashi uses fear and paranoia to manipulate the people of Megasaki City to banish his family's ancient mortal enemy: dogs. With the dog population carrying a contagious flu, Kobayashi tricks the citizens into believing Trash Island (literally an island made of trash) is the only place the infected canines can be quarantined. But through the actions of his distant adopted nephew Atari to rescue his bodyguard dog Spots, he gains the aid from a pack of Alpha dogs Rex, Boss, Duke, King and reluctantly the stray Chief.At first it may seem like it's a boy and his dog storyline but Anderson goes deeper then that. It is truly about the stray Chief finding his place in a xenophobic world. Because of his status as a wild stray, Chief isn't trustful of human society and sees the civilized democratic voting method by the other Alpha pack members as being more problematic then progressive. Chief's hatred for civilized politics becomes justified when we see how the people of Megasaki's decision-making process is very much influenced by the latest rumour and propaganda to portray the dogs as the threat to society. Its there that Anderson's political points become very clear that reflect on what is going within the political system today.\nBy making most of the Japanese characters speak in their natural language while dogs are translated into English, it creates a language barrier that shows Atari as an outsider. This displays the divide that has been made between dog and mankind. But when Atari's noble actions speak louder then his own words, his kindness and sympathy changes Chief's view and he finds a greater purpose in life beyond just trying to survive. There it becomes more of a classic tale of a group of underdogs (no pun intended) fighting against people in power.Where Isle of Dogs really succeeds beyond its politics is its world-building. Anderson creates so much history around Trash Island. His attention to detail makes each layer and cube of garbage feels so real and tactile. As the characters travel across the island, more is revealed of its tragic history to reflect on the dog population's own blight. Megasaki City is a bright shinning utopia that is in political disarray that has divided the people between the corrupted Kobayashi clan and the dog-supporting protesters.Where Isle of Dogs I think does struggle with is that the Japanese characters outside Atari don't get as much characterizations and are more painted as broad archetypes. And since Anderson does not use that much subtitles for the Japanese dialogue, it can feel a bit disconnecting since I only speak English. It feels even more awkward the character that gets the most depth in Megasaki is the white American English-speaking foreign-exchange student Tracy Walker.Not sure if it's a negative but Anderson, with lack of subtly and maybe its intentional, makes cats or at least cat people as the obvious villains. The fact that every evil member of the Kobayashi family has a devlish-looking cat as a pet to the mayor himself revealing to have a huge back tattoo of cats, it could shrugged the cat people community the wrong way.While it does not top his previous film Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs is more spectacular, smarter and richer in detail then Wes Anderson's previous stop-motion film Fantastic Mr. Fox. It's a movie that I think adults will take more in then kids because of the heavy subject matter and dark themes.",

The main issue with this movie is the setting, and the mocking of the culture as the basis for the humor. There are so many instances in this film where the jokes are only about making light of a certain aspect of the culture, like having sumo wrestler bodyguards; using haikus as a common form of speech; having the mayor sport a gangster tattoo; and every scene is depicted as though it was set in the 1950s Japan, even though it was set in the future. The visuals were obviously designed by someone who's only access to Japanese culture was through watching old Japanese films. And what is really bad is that Wes Anderson chooses not to subtitle any of the Japanese spoken, further making the Japanese people less 'like us'. And of course all the heroes in the movie (with the exception of the boy) are voiced in English or represent western culture. \nWes Anderson has stated that this movie could have been set anywhere, and yet how would half of the jokes in the film work if it wasn't set in Japan? I think if this movie had featured live actors, the uproar would have been greater. \nAnd when you strip away all of the cultural jokes, you really don't have much to work with.

            "content": "Wes Anderson's best work seems behind him. I loved The Royal Tenenbaums and Fantastic Mr. Fox, an animated movie very similar in style to Isle of Dogs. Anderson's films however have taken a downturn, like The Grand Budapest Hotel, which was disappointing farce. \"Dogs\" is no less disappointing.I think the problem Anderson's last few movies have is that the plot is too thin for the run time. \"Hotel\" was 100 minutes but felt like it should have been 80. Isle of Dogs is 97 minutes, but it takes a long, long, long time for it to get going. Wes Anderson sacrifices \"artsy shots\" and style for storytelling; that is, plot and pacing. The numerous pull away and flat establishing shots drag the movie down so much watching \"Dogs\" is a chore. \"Dogs\" also features a tedious amount of people speaking, at length, in Japanese, and then having a character translate it for us. Is it meant to be a joke? It's quirky, sure, but isn't it also, I don't know... tedious? Since when is quirkiness a joke? Since when is listening to people speaking Japanese a joke?The whimsical \"quirk factor\" of this movie is compounded by how the (English speaking) characters all talk; as if they're all trying to do a Jeff Goldblum impression (which is funny as he is also in this movie). But people don't talk like this, not unless it's late at night and you have to talk to your spouse about something bothering you but you don't want to wake the kids.I can't shoot the movie down completely, however: this style of animation is charming and filled with character, but it's not enough to save the movie. Fantastic Mr. Fox had the same kind of animation but \"Fox\" also had stronger storytelling, acting, and humour. Animation alone isn't enough to save a movie.",

            "content": "It's not hard, after watching Isle of Dogs, to imagine the moment when Wes Anderson decided to set this movie in his imaginary Japan. You can see him nodding excitedly (if he ever gets excited) and then... googling \"Japanese tropes\".Isle of Dogs (IoD) is a rather cringe-inducing look at a Westerner's idea of what Japan is all about. Haiku's, Samurai, Cherry Blossoms... you name it. If you've ever associated something with Japan, Wes Anderson has put it in this film.Now, I'm not one to get offended on behalf of others, but when every on-screen explosion is a tiny mushroom cloud, you have to ask yourself what the hell is going on? Not that IoD is offensive, but it does make you cringe. A lot.Outside of the Japanese depiction, is the film any good?Well, it is...serviceable, at best. What lets it down are the trademarks of Anderson's movies... dull dialogue delivery, pointless dialogue, and a focus on things other than the story itself.Worse still was the usual poor marketing of the movie. In this case, I get the reason for the deception foisted off in its trailers. How else are you going to get people to go watch a 100 minute movie where the most excitement you will have will be going to the bathroom. So they painted it as a fun adventure, perhaps even suitable for kids. Suffice to say, if you bring any small children to this film you will have issues. This is a movie not designed for kids. Not unless they are heavily sedated, at any rate.Then there is the music. Whilst it definitely evokes a Japanese theme throughout, it is at first dull, then later on annoying and intrusive. At no pint, however, does it really add anything to the movie. It is just... there.The combination of all these things leads to a movie that is as dull and lifeless as the stop-motion figures themselves. There are many good tellers of animated stories... Anderson is not one of them. A triumph of visual style over substance that will leave you wanting... to check your watch every few minutes to see how much longer it has left..SUMMARY: Usual Anderson tropes. Flat delivery. Pointless dialogue. Annoying music. Tiresomely trite Japanese portrayal. Story that is dull and unengaging. Avoid unless you are a fan of Anderson's work.",

            "content": "Performed at the Swan Theatre in July 1597, \"The Isle of Dogs,\" a satirical play (now lost) written by Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson was labeled \"seditious, slanderous, and lewd\" by the government and led to the arrest of the actors (including Jonson) and the closing of all London theaters for months. The nature of the satire is unknown but comparing court figures to mangy curs is not far from the realm of possibility. No such drastic punishment awaits Wes Anderson's (\"The Grand Budapest Hotel\") modern day Isle of Dogs, however, though there are some who would be inclined to banish it to movie purgatory for its many Japanese cultural references that tread a thin line between homage and appropriation.If sumo wrestlers, haiku poetry, Kabuki theater, sushi, taiko drums (courtesy of composer Alexandre Desplat (\"The Shape of Water), cherry blossoms, and symbolic mushroom clouds are your thing, however, you have come to the right place. Written by Anderson from a story by Roman Coppola (\"Moonrise Kingdom\"), Jason Schwartzman (\"The Darjeeling Limited\") and Kunichi Nomura, Isle of Dogs is a stop-motion animated adventure about a boy and his faithful pet out to prevent the genocide of the dog population of Megasaki City in Japan. Thanks to the superb work of cinematographer Tristan Oliver (\"Loving Vincent\"), it is beautiful to look at and is filled with the kind of offbeat, captivating energy of which Anderson is a master. Oh, yes, the Japanese voices are untranslated to add more authenticity or confusion as the case may be. Set in the fictional city of Megasaki twenty years in the future, Mayor Kobayashi (voiced by Nomura), a villainous Toshiro Mifune look-alike, has used the fear of possible contamination of humans by \"Dog Flu\" and \"Snout Fever\" to exile the city's canine population to a forbidding place called \"Trash Island,\" a disposal site filled with neatly compacted piles of garbage and inundated with rats. Ignoring the fact that political rival Professor Watanabe (Akira Ito, \"Birdman\") is working on a Dog Flu vaccine that will prevent the spread of the disease, Kobayashi first sends the household guard dog Spots (voiced by Liev Schrieber, \"Spotlight\") to the island, breaking the heart of Atari (voiced by Koyu Rankin), his 12-year-old nephew and ward, an orphan whose parents were killed in an accident. One is tempted to ask, along with Megasaki's news translator (voiced by Frances McDormand, \"Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri\"), \"Whatever happened to man's best friend?\" As the exiled dogs scrounge for food on the island, one pack forms a bond. These previously household pets include Rex (voiced by Edward Norton, \"Collateral Beauty\"), King (voiced by Bob Balaban, \"Wormwood,\" TV documentary), Boss (voiced by Bill Murray, \"Ghostbusters\"), and Duke (voiced by Jeff Goldblum, \"Thor: Rangarok\"). There is an additional dog in the group, however, an undomesticated stray named Chief (voiced by Bryan Cranston, \"Last Flag Flying\"). Chief is an outspoken black dog who decides that he is the leader of the pack even though decisions have been made democratically. Chief is not too fond of humans and, in a moment of introspection, tells his friends that he bites even though he claims that he is not a violent dog. These gossipy dogs are all believable characters who long for the comfort of their former life. Rex recalls huddling with his master by the fireside, Boss remembers being a mascot for a sports team, and King reminds everyone that he was once a commercial star who promoted Doggy Chop pet food. Even Scarlett Johansson (\"The Jungle Book\") shows up, voicing Nutmeg, a show dog who falls for Chief's gentle overtures, as well as Tilda Swinton (\"Okja\") as Oracle, a dog with the powers of precognition. Of course, these Japanese dogs all bark in English and do not understand one word of Japanese, even though they were raised in Japan. Meanwhile, Atari, who along with Spots, wears an earpiece that serves as a tracking device, crash lands his plane on Trash Island in an attempt to find his beloved pet. As Atari lands, he is greeted by our five enterprising dogs who do not know whether to eat him or comfort him. Eventually, they endearingly name him \"The Little Pilot\" and help him crisscross the island to find Spots. The search unleashes a twisty adventure that is so full of Andersonian moments of high strangeness that you may feel as if you've just entered a parallel universe. It is all great fun, however, even though there is one unnecessary subplot about an American exchange student Tracy Walker, (voiced by Greta Gerwig, \"20th Century Women\") who alerts the sleepy Megasakians about a conspiracy involving the corrupt Mayor. White savior, anyone? Wes Anderson's ninth feature and his second using stop-motion animation has a universal appeal, though it may be a little daunting for children untrained in the nuances of quirk. For those tuned into his style, however, it is Anderson at his subversive best. While some may read into it political implications about corrupt leaders using their skewed version of truth to achieve a dubious end, basically it is just a sweet children's adventure story about a little boy and his lost dog. It is - isn't it?",

Isle of Dogs is his latest offering and it sees the director return to the world of stop-motion animation.When a dog flu virus spreads through the canine population of Megasaki City in Japan, the mayor signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island. When 12 year old Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin) crash-lands on the island searching for his dog Spots (Live Schreiber), the first dog to be sent to Trash Island, he comes across a band of dogs; Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Boss (Bill Murray) and Chief (Bryan Cranston), and they set about a journey to find the boy's dog.Isle of Dogs is one hell of a breathtaking film to watch, with the fine detail in the stop-motion animation and the meticulous framing of every single shot making it feel as if you're staring at a piece of fine art hanging on the wall rather than a film. When a film like this comes along, you can't help but sit back and just admire it.The story is such a heartwarming one, Atari's determination and loyalty towards finding Spots together with the story behind Chief's coldness towards humans making for a film very hard not to take a liking to, the richness to both the narrative and characters will make you just fall in love with some of the dogs on show. The film is topped off with some of Anderson's signature dry humour that had the audience in raptures at times.Coming to the performances, Isle of Dogs features a fountain of talent lending their voices to proceedings. Vocal performances can often be forgotten in the midst of all of the year's performances however, some of the work here deserves to be remembered for a long, long time. Bryan Cranston's work on the voice of Chief is so spot on that he'll be close to bringing the audience to tears and Edward Norton is wonderfully funny as Rex, the dog in the group questioning Chief's leadership. Isle of Dogs shows a case of not being able to teach an old dog new tricks for Wes Anderson however, when he can repeat those tricks as well as he does, it becomes a film that entirely deserves all the praise it gets for being such a sheer bundle of joy to behold.",

The story and its message has emotive resonance found in The Incredibles (2004) and Inside Out (2015) and has a special poignancy as the singular focus is the connection between a boy and his dog.

Is it a literal description of his movie which features an archipelago where Japanese canine's are despatched offshore?Whatever it is Wes Anderson's latest minutiae-packed art form is a thing that inspires awe.You simply have to ADMIRE Wes Anderson's work because no-one (not even Guillermo Del Toro) approaches his craft with such precision, such forensic detail and because this latest epic is created in stop frame animation he has the opportunity to go microscopic; boy does he take it.I've never seen a stop frame animation so beautifully lit. Nick Park is no slouch but he prefers grand gestures, huge laughs and bold statement. Nothing like this detail. This art.That all makes it sound sterile, fussy perhaps, but it's not. Under the art lies a beating heart of humour and passion for our fine four legged friends that no-one else could get even CLOSE to emulating.It's a bit too long, I'll grant you that. And some think its Japanese-ist (I don't buy that). It's not a pastiche of Japan, as some say, it's an homage.The thrilling 'Taiko' drumming that sets the wheels in motion relentlessly underscores a movie that takes Japaneseness to thrilling heights of respect, with some humour of course - it's Wes.The, rather slight, story, is about a vile Japanese city-dictator, and cat-lover, banishing all of Megasaki's scabrous dogs to a toxic island of waste. Thereafter it follows the quest of a young boy trying to rescue his pet, Spots, from this hideous prison.The voices are great, but best by a mile is Bryan Cranston's as the lead stray, Chief.You can read the detail elsewhere. But a Wes Anderson movie is a Wes Anderson movie and for that reason it has to score highly.It's stunning, gorgeous, brilliant and nearly as good as Grand Budapest Hotel. But not quite.",

This has a heart that explodes into a giant white cloud of chaotic animation. It's also the most MOST of his films: most wonderous and frame-for-frame spectacilar animation, most enjoyable characters, most talented and going-above-and-beyond what's asked of voice actors (especially Cranston, as it's his film really at hear, plus Schreiber and Gerwig - even Yolo Ono works well in a small dose), most exquisite and poetic and both dark and light, sweet and ugly, highly comedic in dialog and physical work and tragic as Miyazaki could get, and also both varied colors, and most moving music. It's the dog with the mostest. It's a film where Wes Anderson dares to have imagery that isn't all nice and tidy and precise (though of course the shots all are - animation is the filmmaking sweet spot for a director who's dreams are likely storyboarded to a tee) - as the Trash Island is one of those immense locations that has varied designs as it's so large, but it shows the director, in a small way, challenging himself: can garbage and waste and filth be interesting? Hell yes it can, and the dogs fit in to it as these outcasts who are naturally... Dogs. And yet this is the kind of work that one viewing cant suffice - you can't take in everything on one fell swoop. Just one moment where the dogs are having a discussion about what to do next (pre one of their \"we're all the leader!\" votes) has thr backdrop of thousands of empty bottles. Look at that shot! Just LOOK at that shot! This movie is filled with a lot of that, but it doesn't repeat itself (or at least any more than it has to). Everything is of its piece, and while I'm not sure I can find it 100% *perfect* - the end kind of lacked some of the characters who were prominent earlier on, and this is after the action - but im sure after I see this another 3, 4, 10 times, more of the themes and little dogs will come more to light. isle of Dogs is the kind of film where you have the cutest little puppies in one scene and holocaust death camp imagery in another... And it isnt jarring in the slightest. Wow. I want to play the video game version of the bit where the dogs go into the death machine (not a spoiler dont get nervous). Count this as going to likely be HIGH on my top 10 at years end.(PS: I had a major geeking out when I recognized the guitar music from Kurosawa's Drunken Angel - that's my film hipster coming through)",

Highly original plot, from the word go, I was immediately drawn in by how different and clever it was. There's also a wonderful sweetness, innocence and charm about the movie, making it suitable for all ages. Add in the subtle, often tongue-in-cheek, quirky humour and you can clearly see his hand in this movie.Interesting animation. Not your perfect cartoon style, but a rougher sort of animation. Can be a bit jarring at times but it suits the story and Anderson's style of storytelling.Voice casting is spot-on and features a Hollywood who's-who of names. Most interesting casting: Yoko Ono as herself...sort of.Not perfect, however. The plot gets a bit loose and hard to follow in the second half.

            "content": "Wes Anderson's live action characters have always struck me as cartoonish puppets manipulated by a string-pulling Director (and force fed Wes' trademark arch dialogue). The most enjoyable of his movies so far has been FANTASTIC MR. FOX - why not just cut out the middle-man and actually make the characters puppets? Better yet, the cutesy dialogue seems less forced coming out of the mouths of cute animals (foxes there, and dogs, here).\n \nISLE OF DOGS is tailor made for Anderson's twee tinker-toy style of filmmaking with lots and lots of toys to play with. Set in future Japan (but, designed with 1960s retro-futurism as the model), the story concerns an outbreak of 'dog flu' which gets the mutts banished to the title wasteland by a corrupt power-hungry politician Kobayashi (voiced by Kunichi Nomura). Our plucky band of canines are voiced by the likes of Bryan Cranston, Bob Balaban, Scarlett Johannson and, of course, Wes fave Bill Murray. The Mayor's own dog Spots (Liev Schreiber) ends up on the Isle, and his son Atari (Koyu Rankin) follows to find him. Meanwhile, back on the mainland, plots and counter-plots ensue.\n \nAs in most Anderson movies, the 'plot' matters far less than the parade of set pieces and jokey bits. Again, the whole setting and animated nature of ISLE is ideal for the Writer-Director. The sets are fantastically designed and constructed to the minutest detail - the sushi scene alone is said to have taken weeks to perfect. The Production design by Paul Harrod & Adam Stockhausen is fabulous as is the score by Alexandre Desplat (with choice musical selections from Japanese classic cinema and more). If I liked ISLE a bit less than MR. FOX it's because the human characters are more integral here - they can grate like like their live action Anderson counterparts. \n \nIt's been a bit amusing to read that the most stinging attacks against ISLE are accusations of 'Cultural Appropriation'. Amusing, because Anderson's Entire Career has been nothing BUT appropriation! His whole approach is to beg, borrow and steal from other filmmakers, musicians, writers and visual artists of all types. So, it's ok to 'appropriate' from European cinema (for an example), but, one has to draw the line at the Japanese? Those critiques aside, a Wes Anderson movie is pretty much critic proof in the sense that you either dig his work or you don't. For myself, I look forward to his next 'real' movie - that is, his next animated feature.",

My problem with the story is that I have troubles to believe the premise, i.c. dogs that are transported to a garbage island because some Japanese mayor doesn't like dogs. I might even use the word lame here. The story has a good pace, but not enough drama or compelling characters. I stopped the movie twice, and thought of giving up, but the quality of the animation kept me going. This is art.The music is an essential part of the movie. Rhythmical, a lot of drums and sax...

Basically in a dystopian near-future Japan, a dog flu virus, known as \"snout fever\", has spread throughout the canine population. In Megasaki City, authoritarian and dictatorial Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura) signs a decree, banishing all dogs to Trash Island, despite scientist Professor Watanabe (Akira Ito) insisting he is close to finding a cure. The first dog to be transported to Trash Island is Spots (Liev Schreiber), who belonged to Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin), the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor. Six months later, hundreds of dogs are now living on Trash Island, going through the different stages of the virus symptoms, including deterioration, starvation, insomnia, tiredness, rage and much. Among the many dogs on the island, there is a pack of five dogs - Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Boss (Bill Murray), and their leader, Chief (Bryan Cranston). They are surprised by the crash-landing of a plane, it is Atari, who has run away from home, landing on Trash Island to find Spots, they decide to help Atari in his search, although former stray Chief is reluctant to fraternize with humans. Initially Atari and the dogs believe Spots is dead, seeing his cage lock failed to open upon arrival, in fact there was a mix-up, and Spots may be alive elsewhere on the island. After an altercation with a rescue team sent by Kobayashi to retrieve Atari, after meeting a female purebreed named Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson), Chief has a change of heart and decides to accompany Atari and company on their search. They seek advice from sage dogs Jupiter (F. Murray Abraham) and Oracle (Tilda Swinton), who claim to see visions, in fact they get their information from television, the two dogs inform the group there is a rumour of a tribe of cannibalistic dogs on an isolated part of the island. Meanwhile, Professor Watanabe has found the cure to the virus and all its main ailments, but he is poisoned by Mayor Kobayashi, so the dogs will remain on the island. Foreign exchange student Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig) suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate, confronting assistant scientist and Watanable's former cohort Yoko Ono (Yoko Ono), who confirms Tracy's suspicions and gives her the last remaining dose of the cure. During the journey, Atari and Chief are separated from the others, Atari washes Chief, turning from dirty black to his original white-coloured fur, he is the same breed as Spots, implying they may be brothers. Chief reveals he was once a house pet, forced out of his home after regretfully attacking his master out of fear, they reunite with the group and locate the isolated tribe, who are not actually cannibals, and they are ambushed by Kobayashi's men again. Spots arrives with a small army of dogs, they help them fend off the assailants, it is revealed in flashbacks that Spots was rescued on arrival by the tribe, and became their leader, Spots also confirms that he and Chief are brothers, and asks to transfer his protection duties for Atari to him. An owl arrives, revealing that Kobayashi plans to exterminate all dogs on Trash Island when he is imminently re-elected, Atari and the dog tribe decide to return to Megasaki City to attempt to prevent this. At Kobayashi's election ceremony, he prepares to give the order for the extermination, but Tracy presents her evidence of his corruption and the existence of the cure, Atari and the dogs arrive and confirm the cure works. Kobayashi has a change of heart, but his right-hand man Major Domo (Akira Takayama) insists the extermination should be seen through, a fight breaks out, during which the button is pressed, but the poison backfires on the captors instead, Tracy's friend helped. During the fight, Atari and Spots are gravely injured, Atari's only remaining kidney fails, but Kobayashi admits to his mistakes, he donates his own to save the boy's life. By election law, mayoral control of the city passes to Atari, he decrees that dogs be allowed to reintegrate into society, Tracy and Atari become a couple, and Chief reunites with Nutmeg and takes up the role of bodyguard for Atari. Spots is presumed dead, in fact he recovered from his injuries, and is secretly raising a family under the Kobayashi Manor. Also starring Frances McDormand as Interpreter Nelson, Harvey Keitel as Gondo, Ken Watanabe as Head Surgeon, Short Circuit's Fisher Stevens as Scrap, Anjelica Huston as Mute Poodle and Courtney B. Vance as The Narrator. The all-star voices are all chosen well for the malnourished mutts living on the rubbish-tip island, it is a very interesting story, filled with poignancy, there are some good laughs along the way, the style of the movie pays homage to dystopian vision like Akira, it serves as a celebration of Japanese culture, and has a great score by Alexandre Desplat. There are some surprisingly adult moments, including filleting a salmon for preparation of sushi, and a bloody operation, it may be slightly dark and disturbing for younger viewers, and there are snobby people that criticize the Western interpretation of Eastern civilisation, but it is a fantastically quirky and inventive animated comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Original Score for Alexandre Desplat, and Best Animated Feature Film, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Animated Featured Film, and Original Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Animated, and Best Original Score.

How can I describe how weird but wonderful you are, so even those who have never seen your stuff would know what you are about?The best I can describe the feeling of watching your movie - any one of them - is to compare it to accidentally wandering into warm and fuzzy fantasy land.Details are always more important than actual events - how you show something, how you frame things.

You have an amazingly sharp sense for depicting the essential \"dogness\" in dog's behavior, and you are able to mix it effectively with human attributes for added comedy.Having said that, as \"Isle of Dogs\" progresses, it starts to get... boring. It should be shorter - who cares about the human characters, anyway? - and the running jokes repeat too much and the story wears thin fast.All in all, \"Isle of Dog\" doesn't feel as potent as your works of previous decade. I've not actually truly admired any of your movie from 2010's.I still love your style... but maybe little less than before. It's just that the newer stories are not that striking and memorable.

Anderson peppers the film with his trademark deadpan, straight-to-camera sense of humour, and frames every shot with even more attention to detail than his 2014 masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel. Children may be put off by the film's idiosyncratic approach, but Anderson followers will indeed be appeased and then some.The planet is under threat from dog flu and snout fever, both timely reminders of the recent swine flu 'epidemic' and the dangers of fake news. The mayor of Megasaki City (voiced by co-writer Kunichi Nomura), who is part of a dynasty of long-time cat lovers, puts forward a decree to banish all dogs from the mainland and transport them to Trash Island, despite claims of a breakthrough to cure the animals' illness. His ward, a young boy named Atari (Koyu Rankin), is having none of his caregiver's authoritarian attitudes, and travels to the human-less island in order to find his beloved dog Spots (Liev Schreiber), the very first mutt to be dismissed. Atari steals a plane and crashes it into the wasteland, and comes across a pack of mostly former domesticated canines led by the incredibly democratic Rex (Edward Norton). The rest of the gang consists of Boss (Bill Murray), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), and the only stray in the group, Chief (Bryan Cranston).Chief is the beating heart of the film, and the character through which Anderson explores most of the film's themes. The black, scruffy dog is proud to be from the streets, and is quick to admit that he's a biter. He's the only one to refuse to sit for Atari, but nevertheless agrees to go with the majority vote and assist Atari in helping his track down his lost friend. From here on in, it's very much an A-to-B adventure, but Anderson and his co-writers (Nomura, Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman) ensure that the journey is anything but formulaic. Along the way, we meet the likes of Oracle (Tilda Swinton), Nutmeg (Scarlett Johnansson), Jupiter (F. Murray Abraham) and Gondo (Harvey Keitel), with even Yoko Ono thrown into the mix. Things aren't made easy by the fact that the Japanese actors speak in their native tongue without the assistance of subtitles (although Frances McDormand occasionally pops up as an enthusiastic translator), but this highlights the communication barrier between owner and pet, as well as falling in line with the film's themes of migration and social integration.Anderson packs in more shots than is usually expected from animation, particularly in the painfully slow process of stop-motion. Rather than accepting this as a limitation, he uses animation as a tool to bring his vision vividly to life with more freedom allowed by live action. The visuals are even more luscious that in Grand Budapest, with the animation retaining a rustic, old-fashioned quality that makes it feel as if you could reach out and actually touch the dog's hairs as they ripple in the wind. As soon as the Taiko drums start to thud on the film's glorious soundtrack, Anderson's love of Japanese cinema can be sensed immediately. The influence of Akira Kurosawa can be felt throughout (a status of Toshiro Mifune appears at one point), but the precision of the framing is pure Ozu, and Tristan Oliver's cinematography relishes exploring what was perhaps Japan's greatest period for cinema. The mediocrity of 2004's The Life Aquatic must have been a wake-up for the filmmaker, urging him away from his comfort zone and towards more unexplored territory. Anderson continues to amaze, amuse and baffle, and has emerged as one of the most important, original voices in American cinema. I fail to see how anyone could not be utterly enchanted by Isle of Dogs.",

            "content": "\"Isle of Dogs\" is a new American animated movie and the most recent work by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Wes Anderson. He is the sole director of these 100 minutes and for the script he collaborated with his regulars Coppola, Schwartzman and Nomura. A bit unusual for me to see Schwartzman credited here for once, but not voicing any of the characters. Anyway, to let you know what direction this review is heading, let me say that I felt this is by now among the very best films of 2018, animated or non-animated. Not sure it can make a big impact during awards season though, not just because of the release, but also because the animation and style and story could be something the Oscars will perhaps not warm up to. Nonetheless, it can be an underdog (no pun intended!) for a nomination in Best Animated Feature, but for the win, sadly I think it just won't happen and this film is not mainstream enough I am afraid, not that mainstream is bad by definition though There's many excellent mainstream animated films out there, also in recent years, like Frozen as the prime example. But back to IoD now. There is an incredible amount of depth and attention to detail in here. Early on, I was not entirely convinced, but the longer it went, the more I enjoyed the watch and appreciated the occasional strike of Anderson's genius. If you have seen some other works by him, you will be able to easily identify his approach, most of all of course his unique mix of set decoration and camera angles from way above, that is really visible all the time and he transitioned successfully from live action to animation and I have no doubts that his way back to live action will be a huge success too. But also the characters and their mannerisms and the way they act feel very Anderson constantly. Of course, one look at the cast list is enough to know that something really special is about to happen here too, perhaps the best cast of 2018 and I will not mention all the names now, you can see them yourselves, but of course the likes of Yoko One show how prestigious this project is like several others. It's a film about dogs. Yes and no. Dogs are at the center of the story here, but it could have been cats too with some alterations to the script of course. The dogs are really humanized on many occasions, to the extent that when they get little dog snacks or fetch sticks, they are back to their essence and these make a comedic impact already. But it's never about dogs entirely, more all about everything that surrounds them. Another thing I found interesting was the way the cats were depicted here: They are admired, but they are not loved or treated in a caring way, which would feel far more precious to them than spectacular statues or symbols on necklaces. There is no affection for cats, they are just symbols for power, nothing like the affection the little Japanese boy shows for the dogs in his life.Another scene I'd like to mention is the young American girl when we hear her talk about the boy's endeavor and how she starts speaking like an adult, but eventually returns back to children's speech. That is also from the trailer and just one of many moments that add an incredible amount of charm. Anderson is an outstanding writer and it constantly shows. This is especially impressive as this is a film about different cultures and how he catches the essence there in terms of how he elaborates on Japanese traditions, culture and lifestyle in general is nothing short of impressive. And one very specific example of good writing is that they may have included a plot twist that the dog at the center could actually be the one the boy is looking for, but this would have happened in a weaker movie, maybe a Disney movie, but instead they took the path of a very credible brother story. As for the last 40 minutes of the film perhaps, when the adventure reaches its peak, it is where the film is definitely at its best. Every scene is a winner basically and I could write a whole book about these. But I'll leave them to you instead and avoid any summaries and interpretations. Let me say that it's just incredibly smart and there's no way you are not gonna find anything new during a rewatch. I am pretty certain I will watch the film again at some point in the not so distant future, maybe with somebody who has a special fascination for that cultural context who is about to mean a lot to me. Completely aside from that, it is a film that is far more suitable for grown-ups than for young kids, a prime example of how this applies to animation on many occasions too, for example the Wasabi murder scene that has Anderson pull through with the drama, but also the scenes in which he is about to kill off all the other stray dogs, apart from the one in the center and how he gets them back in a manner that is as hilarious as realistic. Realism is one of the film's strongest components too I would say, a great success there given the subject of talking dogs and how far it is set in the future. Quite a challenge and Anderson once again delivers masterfully. The stop motion style is also executed close to perfection, it all fits so well together. And finally, the comedy is also a huge success with some brief but charming references like the girl interpreting near the end what she wants the boy to say and how he looks at her. Probably the cutest moment of the entire thing. And the best is really how the film manages to make an emotional impact without trying (hard) to do so at all. Yes there's pups, but that's not what it is about. So unless you really despise (stop motion) animation, go watch this film. It oozes creativity and wit and it's probably my favorite Wes Anderson film at this point from what I have seen. Competent execution in every area really, I applaud everybody who worked on it and thanks for bringing us theatrical experiences like this one here. Highly, highly recommended.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. It's referred to (sometimes affectionately, sometimes not) as Wes World. Many directors have their own style, though few are as immediately recognizable as a film by Wes Anderson. THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, MOONRISE KINGDOM, FANTASTIC MR FOX, THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS, and RUSHMORE all share a tone and style ... a cinematic personality, if you will, that places them squarely in Wes World. Beyond the similarities, there is also a level of innovation and creativity in each of his projects. He consistently delivers a \"Wow\" factor, or in the case of his latest, a \"bow-wow\" factor (my one and only pun, I promise).Expanding on the stop-action animation he used in FANTASTIC MR. FOX, director Anderson also plays homage to Japanese filmmaking - especially the animation of Hayao Miyazaki and the cinematic legend Akira Kurosawa. The film's prologue, \"The Boy Samurai\" is a Japanese fable and sets the stage for a futuristic Japan where the Mayor of Megasaki, Kobayashi (voiced by Kunichi Nomura), has decreed that all dogs should be banned from society due to dog flu, snout fever and canine saturation. Kobayashi (an embittered politician who looks eerily similar to Japanese acting legend Toshiro Mifune) even ships off his nephew's beloved Spots (Liev Schreiber) to Trash Island. In Part 1 \"The Little Pilot\", that nephew, Atari (Koyu Rankin) crash lands his plane on Trash Island while attempting to rescue Spots. Part 2 (\"The Search for Spots\"), Part 3 (\"The Rendez-Vous\"), and Part 4 (\"Atari's Lantern\") break the story into segments, but the real fun here is in the visual effects and the banter amongst the dogs. The five main dogs we follow are Chief (Bryan Cranston), Rex (Edward Norton), Boss (Bill Murray), and Duke (Jeff Goldblum). Chief is a stray dog who is the group skeptic and doesn't hesitate in greeting most anyone with \"I bite\". We know this because director Anderson explains \"Barks are rendered in English\". While assisting Atari with his search, the five dogs alternate between gossiping and decision-making by committee ... spouting one-liners that are consistently funny and incisive. Anderson co-wrote the script with Roman Coppola and his frequent collaborator Jason Schwartzman. Kunichi Nomura provided expertise to ensure the Japanese segments were accurately portrayed. The usual Wes-style droll humor is evident throughout, though viewers must make sure their hearing is fined tuned to catch some of the wise-cracks that almost seem like background noise at times. In addition to the humor, political corruption and conspiracies are at the core of what could be described as an animated rescue adventure comedy. Narrator Courtney B Vance ensures we are following along with the story, although the artistic beauty of Trash Island - a garbage strewn wasteland - is enough to hold our interest. Keeping track of the homages is challenging enough, but we also get Haikus, Puppy Snaps, and Yoko Ono as a scientist. Greta Gerwig voices Tracy, an idealistic Foreign Exchange student who recognizes a corrupt politician when she sees one, and there are a couple of brilliant noirish scenes between Chief and Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson). A recurring visual of dogfights in a cloud of dust harken back to the days of classic cartoons and the unbridled violence that we've always found so comical in animation.It's a dystopian tale ... well it is if you happen to be a dog. Cat lovers probably view this as paradise. An all-star cast of voice actors keeps us interested even when the story bogs down at times, although the look of the film always seems to be priority one. It's such an easy movie to respect, however, one that's a bit more difficult to speak passionately about. This review doesn't address the ever-present complaints from those looking to create a race or nationality based scandal. To me, the film is creative and appears to be against unkindness and discrimination and corruption. Perhaps that message overrides some easily ruffled feathers.",

All of the portrayals of his cats in this film are depicted as villains and stereotypes while the dogs all have fully fledged characters.

            "content": "A Family Friendly Tale of Friendship.For Wes Anderson's ninth film, the auteur director took what he learned while making \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\" and and expanded upon it to make his magnum opus. Mixing the mediums of Stop Motion, Puppetry, Miniatures, Still Image, Traditional Animation, and Tableau for this stunning homage to the Japanese 'Iki' Aesthetic. Taking place \"Twenty Years in the Future\" from whenever you're watching, in the fictional Megasaki City on the Japanese coast, \"Isle of Dogs\" on its face is the story of a boy, Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin) looking for his dog / bodyguard, Spots (voiced by Liev Schreiber) after Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura), Atari's uncle and guardian, passes a law that banishes all canines to the offshore \"Trash Island\" after an epidemic of \"Snout Fever\" has infected nearly all the dogs in the city, though the Mayor may have a more nefarious plot... While not the simplistic \"Cats Evil, Dogs Good\" of some other family friendly film fare, the pooches portrayed feel betrayed by their mislead masters. After six months, Atari steals a small plane and crashes on Trash Island to seek out his four legged companion, and is recused from the wreck by our hero pack, Rex; the leader of the pack (Edward Norton), Boss; the former mascot of a Little League team (Bill Murray), King; the face of a popular dog food (Bob Balaban), Duke; a gossip (Jeff Goldblum), and Chief; a stray (Bryan Cranston). Atari and the Pack also must fight off henchmen who work for the Mayor, in their search for Spots. Meanwhile on the Mainland, we learn of the evil plot set out by the Mayor, to replace all the dogs with robots, made by his company, and he is also responsible for spreading the puppy plague, and it is up to a small group of science minded students to defend the honor of man's best friend. While there is an All Star voice cast, including Ladybird scribe and director, Greta Gerwig as American Foreign Exchange Student, Tracy Walker, and Oscar Winner, Frances McDormand as an international wire service interpreter, the rest of the cast are Japanese, speaking in Japanese with no subtitles, their characters intentions and body language are enough to convey what they are saying despite a language barrier. The only subtitles are on Japanese text, and the film cleverly states at the beginning, all Barking is translated to English, as a way to respond to cultural appropriation critiques. \"Isle of Dogs\" is not a pastiche of an American Filmmaker wanting to make a movie set in Japan with American actors. This is as close to perfect as hybrid storytelling can get. A very Japanese film, told in Wes Anderson's personal way of whimsy. The Dogs love their masters and don't understand why they've been sent here, but when a \"master\" comes to Trash Island, they do what Good Dogs do, and protect their human. The way the corruption gets handled is also very Japanese as well, it is firstly in the name of business, and what is best for their bottom dollar, and the bad guys go about their plans legally, until the legality becomes their downfall, and rather than fight and lie, the bad guys accept their fate, as they acted dishonorably. Composer, Alexandre Desplat, brought his A-Game to Isle of Dogs as much as he did for Shape of Water and Anderson's last live action feature, The Grand Budapest Hotel (both films which Desplat won Oscars for), his haunting melodies will have you whistling Atari's little 3 note ditty on your way to your car after. Cinematographer Tristan Oliver, of Wallace and Grommet pedigree and Anderson's lenser for Fantastic Mr Fox outdoes himself, with how visually interesting with every frame of Isle of Dogs, partially due to Production Designers Paul Harrod and Adam Stockhausen, who won an Oscar for Grand Budapest Hotel as well. Harrod, an expert on the Japanese Aesthetic and Stockhausen, an expert at Wes Anderson's Aesthetic flawlessly fused the two styles. 10/10",

            "content": "Review:\nI'm usually a big fan of Wes Anderson movies but I really struggled with this one. The cast was amazing but the storyline was overcomplicated when it didn't have to be. He obviously didn't make this animated film about talking dogs, for a young market because I really can't see the political element being entertaining for kids. I did enjoy the emotional content, between the dog and the child, and the animation, which is the same as the Fantastic Mr. Fox, was unique but I did get a bit bored of the plot after a while. Anyway, the movie is set in the near future in Japan, were a canine flu virus spreads across the population, with a risk of crossing to humans. The mayor of Megasaki City, Kobayashi, signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, despite a scientist named Professor Watanabe insisting he is close to finding a cure for the dogs. The first to be exiled is Spots, who belonged to Atari Kobayashi, the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor. Six months later, Atari flies to trash island to try and find spots but his plane crashes, and a pack of dogs, led by Chief, rush to his rescue. When Atari tells the dogs about Spots, they agree to help him on his mission but Chief, a former stray, is reluctant to help humans. Chief decides to follow them on there journey and to seek advice from Jupiter and the Oracle. Meanwhile, Professor Watanabe finds a cure for the dog-flu but Kobayashi refuses to lift the dog ban. After criticizing Kobayashi's decision, Watanabe is put on house arrest and is killed by poisoned wasabi in sushi. A radical American exchange student, Tracy Walker, suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate. Kobayashi claims that Atari was kidnapped by the dogs and vows to kill them as punishment. During there journey, Chief and Atari are separated from the others, and they bond close together after Atari gives him a bath. When they finally rejoin the rest of the group, they come across a cannibal tribe of dogs but are ambushed by Kobayashi's men. Spot arrives with an army of dogs, and they fend off the assailants together. Spot reveals that he was rescued by the tribe, and he has become their leader. He has also mated with a female, who is pregnant, so he doesn't want to leave with Atari, even though he has risked his life to rescue him. He then reveals that Chief is his brother, so he transfers his protection duties for Atari, to Chief, even though Spot still loves Atari. The people of Megasaki believe that Atari is dead, and Kobayashi plans to exterminate all of the dogs in Trash Island, so when the dogs find out what is happening from a mysterious owl, they decide to make there way back to Megasaki. Meanwhile, Tracy is given the cure from Watanabe's ex-assistant, Yoko Ono, who confirms that her suspicions are correct about the corruption in office. When Tracy confronts Kobayashi with the evidence, he dismisses all of her information, and he orders her expulsion from Japan, back to the United States. When the dogs finally arrive at Megasaki, they prove that the cure works, which puts Kobayashi to shame in front of all of his supporters. He then revokes his decree but his right-hand man, Major Domo, insists on triggering the extermination. A fight then breaks out between Kobayashi and Domo in which the execute button is pressed but the poison backfires on the captors, thanks to some help from a hacker friend of Tracy's. Now you see what I mean about the movie being over complicated! With this amount of A Class actors, it didn't really smash the box office, and with the amount of hard work that goes into this type of animation, the movie should have been much better. The critics have given it high praise, and I personally haven't heard a bad word about it but it still wasn't my cup of tea. Dog lovers will be able to relate to the film in many ways, especially the relationship between Akira and Spot but I haven't got, or ever had a dog, which explains why I didn't get it. On the plus side, I did find some of the scenes funny, especially the smoked out fight scenes and some of the narrating but I expected more from this, somewhat warped minded director, who usually produces great work. Average!Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Wes Anderson, who also brought you Bottle Rocket in 1996, Rushmore, the great Royal Tenebaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, the enjoyable Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom and the brilliant Grand Budapest Hotel. He's not one to release movies often, so when he's working on a project, he really does give it his all. He has directed some of my favourite movies, which is why I was really looking forward to this film but it let me down, just like the Fantastic Mr. Fox did. Although his films don't smash the box office, he has the ability to get some of the best actors in the world, due to his unique and fun style, which will stand the test of time.

Naturally, the bad guys were devious and manipulative but the good guys persevered. I rooted for the good guys which were good without fail. The antagonists were predictably bad.",

            "content": "'ISLE OF DOGS': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new stop-motion animated comedy from writer/director Wes Anderson (Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and Kunichi Nomura also co-wrote the story). This is Anderson's second stop-motion animated film, following 2009's 'FATNASTIC MR. FOX'. The movie tells the story of a dystopian future Japan, where all dogs have been quarantined to a remote island, due to an extreme canine flu outbreak. A boy travels to the island to find his dog, and he gets help form a team of dogs there. The film stars the voice talents of Bryan Cranston, Koyu Rankin, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Bob Balaban, Scarlett Johansson, Kunichi Nomura, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Fisher Stevens, Tilda Swinton Harvey Keitel, Ken Watanabe and many others. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics (like nearly all of Anderson's movies), and it's playing in select cities now (like Portland). I enjoyed it, like I do all of Anderson's films. All of the dogs in Japan have become infected with a severe canine flu, and the human population fears they'll catch it from them. So against dog lovers' (and animal activists') wishes, the canines are all quarantined to a remote island full of garbage. A group of rebel activists want to change this decision, and a young male activist, named Atari (Rankin), travels to the island to find his beloved dog there. A team of tough canines decides to help him.The film is witty, funny and quirky (just like all of Anderson's movies). It's also got a great message about respecting dogs, and not taking them for granted. Being a vegan, I hope this message will translate to how we treat other animals as well (which is far worse), but I doubt it will. As a whole the movie is funny, and also bizarrely interesting (which is the same as all of Anderson's movies). I do like 'FANTASTIC MR. FOX' a little better though.",

            "content": "There is no need to say that this movie is visually stunning, beautifully stop-motion animated, or that it has imaginative, creative, and above all that a heart-warming story, nor it's necessary to praise it for its witty visual humor using the setting, the symmetric cinematography, etc. Simply, because it's a Wes Anderson movie!What should be mentioned are the pros of this very movie. And, of course, Isle of Dogs, as any Wes Anderson movie, has what distinguishes it from any other Wes Anderson movie. In fact, there are three new pluses here. First, and foremost, the visually storytelling. Yes, I know it's not a new thing to say about a Wes Anderson movie, but there is no Wes Anderson movie, nor any stop-motion animated movie that has used its visuals to tell its story in this way. Specially, when you know that this movie has many scenes where there is no dialogue in English, just in Japanese, or where there are just Japanese subtitles!The second great thing about Isle of Dogs is the voice cast. Sorry Fantastic Mr. Fox, I love you even more, but here the cast really adds up to the movie. The cast isn't star-studded just because it's a Wes Anderson movie, but every single actor, or actress, really made every character feels distinctive. Bryan Cranston, who voices Chief, is easily the best. His vocal performance here is undeniably one of the best in any animated movie from the last, say, five years. But really all the cast shines in this movie. Edward Norton is my second favorite.At last but not least, comes the music score from the Oscar winner, Alexandre Desplat. It has some Western touch in it, along with a traditional Japanese music. What a wonderful soundtrack! It really sticks in my mind long after watching the movie!.As I mentioned above, I prefer Fantastic Mr. Fox to Isle of Dogs. That's because Isle of Dogs, unlike any other Wes Anderson movie, is convoluted for its own good. That didn't hurt the movie as whole, except at the third act, which is quite rushed and messy. Also, I wanted the character of Atari to feel more life-like person. Because I felt he was overshadowed by the dogs. Nevertheless, Atari is a well-developed character.Isle of Dogs may didn't live up to my expectations, but still it is my favorite animated movie of 2018 so far!(8/10)",

            "content": "Wes Anderson is an acquired taste - a very popular acquired taste for sure, but one where those that don't like his films tend to really not like them. Isle of Dogs isn't immediately a Wes Anderson film, set as it is in a Japanese future where dogs are banished from a city into a separate island, however it is very much his work. From the familiar names in the cast through to the creative framing and visual design, and of course the wry/droll/whimsical/dry humor, this is his film and these are the things that will put people off. For myself I enjoy his work in the most part, but can understand why some don't - and this will be no exception.For me though, Isle of Dogs worked well on this very basis. The heart of the film wasn't really there, guarded as it was by the detached style, but the oddity of the story, the creativity of the design, and the dry but absurd humor all made it worth seeing. Visually it is a treat; the animation is superb throughout. Mostly stopmotion of a standard I've never seen, but plenty of other touches here and there. Aside from that technical strength, the framing of the film is engaging in the way it positions characters relative to the camera, and how it deals with the characters interacting with the viewer. The decision to play out the Japanese without subtitles at times is a good one, and one of many stylistic decisions that work really well.The voice work is strong throughout, and adds a lot of characters to the animated dogs. Cranston, Murray, Norton, Goldblum, McDormand, Keitel, Abraham, Gerwig, Schreiber, Swinton, Johansson, Watanabe - an impressive list of names, but just as good as it sounds when it comes to delivery. Whether it be the comedic or the dramatic, all of the performances are well pitched and marry up with their characters. Perhaps the film will annoy some for its archness and deliberate oddity, but I found it a delight; perhaps a bit slow, lacking zip at times, and not having a lot of emotional core, but there was plenty to carry those areas.",

I was a fan of his previous stop motion animated effort, The Fantastic Mr. Fox. So as soon as I heard about The Isle of Dogs I was excited to see it. I'm not sure if its better than Fantastic Mr. Fox or ranks among Anderson's best but Isle of Dogs is smart, funny, and quirky. That's what we've come to expect from Wes Anderson.The backdrop for the film is a dystopian Japan, where a dog flu virus has spread throughout dogs. The mayor has decided that the best course of action is to send all dogs to Trash Island. Meanwhile, a cure for dog flu is being tested and the nephew of the mayor travels to Trash Island to find his recently banished dog, Spots. The film has a bevy of voice actors, a few of who have previously worked with Wes Anderson.I'm not going to comment on the \"cultural appropriation\" that has taken wind recently. You be the judge on that and form your own opinion. The film's animation is great as expected. That was the strongest part of Fantastic Mr. Fox. The stop motion is beautiful as expected. The film keeps that general Wes Anderson charm and has that slight humor that is a staple in this type of work. The film has very memorable sequences and a tightly constructed story that is told creatively.Its hard not to love these dogs in the film. Its a good fun time, which is what was needed. I respect Wes Anderson for adopting a certain style of film and exploring different avenues of technique in film to explore his talent. While, I don't think Isle of Dogs is among his very best, it'll charm many people and delivers the goods as it should. I love dogs!7.5/10",

The visual presentation is consistently stunning with Anderson's trademark symmetrical compositions and storybook aesthetic. The propulsive, percussive score that clearly homages classic Japanese cinema (which the film is very much drawing from creatively overall) also really brings out Anderson's strong sense of rhythm. Everything from the editing to the beats of dialogue carries a sharp sense of timing that helps the film flow and infuses a playfulness that contrasts its decidedly dark themes. Political corruption, conspiracy, racism, and even genocide are among the many ideas floating around the film, and I felt it was able to strike a nice balance between the weight of these issues and Anderson's typical whimsy. Though I hate to fault the film given the incredible degree of artfulness and passion that clearly went into creating it, I do feel that perhaps the characters could've been a bit more fleshed-out. It's a very plot-driven film which is not necessarily a criticism in of itself, but the depth of the characters seems to have suffered a bit as a result. I also felt that it falls a little short of the cathartic conclusion it's striving for, though things do wrap up in a satisfying way befitting of its storybook quality. These amount to minor quibbles, as Isle of Dogs convincingly shines as a highly entertaining and visually spectacular film that is artful, witty, and ambitious.Light 4.5/5",

The overall premise is absurd--a city ruled by a cat mafia--but the ending is clear by about 15 minutes in. For example, the 'dramatic' fight scenes to move the story along are lackluster--the film probably would have been better without these 'obligatory' action scenes.

And this one is no different, to the point that I started to feel just a little concerned there were so many children in the cinema I saw it in, given that animal cruelty, sickness, genocide and death were so often the subjects at hand.Then there's the colours - the gorgeous yellows and reds and pinks and whatever else: sugary treats for the eye second to none.So that's two, but the greatest one is probably just endless attention to detail, always going the extra mile into the precise vision of composition he has. Watching this there are so many tiny, tiny details that anyone else would have left out or cheated on somehow. But everything here had to be first drawn up and then made by hand, and the time and love put into it is in the end what makes it so special.Where does it belong in the pantheon? I think I would place it over Fantastic Mr Fox, and maybe Bottle Rocket. It's certainly not the best thing Anderson has or will do, but I'm really glad it exists and that I got to see it.",

            "content": "If you've seen Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox, then you know his depiction of animals with sympathetic and accurate human traits is detailed and enduring. So, too, is his recent Isle of Dogs, a rich about a dystopian Japanese city, Megasaki, 20 years into the future, which banishes its dog population to Trash Island over Dog Flu and Snout Fever, fake-newsed by the power brokers, who love cats.Banter among the dogs reveals Anderson's tongue-in-cheek humor that fits snugly into the dog psyche: \"I only ask for what I've always had, a balanced diet, regular grooming, and a general physical once a year.\" Duke (Jeff Goldblum) Somehow the writer/director makes you believe the dogs could talk with deadpan humor and retain their doggedness.The central conflict is seen through 12-year old orphan Atari's (Koyu Rankin) search for his lost guard dog, Spots (Liev Schreiber), on the island, facilitating the story's childlike attachment to and search for meaningful love. Allegorically the larger picture fleshes out any totalitarian regime that would marginalize a segment, such as a minority or a race, for spurious reasons just to rid a country of dissent. Migration, as it is today, is the order of the day for the oppressed.The dog rebellion could reflect Anderson's interest in the poor and oppressed fighting the establishment as he did in Grand Budapest Hotel or Fantastic Mr. Fox for that matter.\n\"To the North, a long rickety causeway over a noxious sludge marsh, leading to a radioactive landfill polluted by toxic chemical garbage. That's our destination. Get ready to jump.\" Rex (Edward Norton) The landfill, of course, figuratively stands for the poverty of the minority and the criminal neglect of the majority. Yet, here is a story rich in love for canines (just say the title very slowly for hidden laugh), the goodness of human beings who are fighting for freedom and equality, and Japanese culture and cinema (the decayed statute of Toshiro Mifune reminds us of acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa). Dogs speaking in English while Japanese speak native is a typical Anderson quirk.This is Wes's beautifully stop-motioned story, a technique that allows for rich detail like a purple volcano and overhead shot of a kidney transplant. Japanese Taiko drummers punctuate the story for richly authentic detail.\nWhile the dialogue can be too cute at times and the voices not distinct enough, overall the island is a trove of canine-human delights, mostly that witty dialogue, and so fast that you'll want to visit the island again and again.  Isle of Dogs is about the longing of the human spirit to be free. The dogs refuse to be subordinated. No different today, no need to trump up the circumstances with wild comparisons. That's about what I said for Fantastic Mr. Fox. At least my affection for Anderson's genius is consistent.",

The movie itself is immediately recognizable as Wes Anderson's work, if only from the flat tones of the actors' voices, one of his signatures. I sometimes felt as if I were in a Moonrise Kingdom set in Japan, as the camera swept across the landscape.\nThere is a taste of John Hoffman's Good Boy!, another dog and boy story, to Isle of Dogs. I'd recommend Good Boy! for the younger children in the family: Isle of Dogs is not a kiddie flick.\nETA: I don't know how I misread Megasaki as Magasaki, but I did. Very Freudian. Maybe if Anderson were making the film this year it would be Magasaki.",

And so any movie that comes along, stop motion/animated or not, I will be one of the first to the theater. Fortunately, Isle of Dogs finally got a wider release this week and I was able to go see it. Funny, heartwarming, and visually spectacular, Isle of Dogs is a darling of an animated film. Of course, the voice talent is top notch and particularly effective, but the real heart and sincerity comes from Wes Anderson's direction and sharp script. It doesn't commit to an overly complex story nor one that is a dumb nonsensical animated flick, like a certain animated studio tends to put out (Illumination). But what Isle of Dogs does do is present the unbreakable bond that an owner and his or her dog has with each other. I would live on Trash Island if I had to go find my dog and for that alone, Isle of Dogs won my heart over by well-representing that relationship.8.3/10",

Months later, with dogs established on the island, fighting for whatever scraps they can, a plane piloted by the Mayor's ward Atari (Koyu Rankin) crashes on the island. Atari is looking for his former security dog Spots (Liev Schreiber) and with the help of Chief (Bryan Cranston) and his team of alpha dogs, sets on a quest to find him.It's impossible not to appreciate the amount of talented people's work that has gone into creating \"Isle Of Dogs\". It's a beautiful and detailed piece of work, with everything down to eyes glassing over recreated using puppet and stop motion techniques. I can imagine some people being turned off by the way the vocal performances link to the characters, as with \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\" they are low key realistic line deliveries, rather than typical voice over work. Personally, I love it, particularly when it's a distinctive voice like Jeff Goldblum or Harvey Keitel.The film, however, isn't perfect. The story could do with a few more beats to make it slightly more compelling. It would also benefit from being slightly more conventionally funny, as opposed to just offbeat funny. Don't get me wrong, I laughed a few times whilst watching it - it's just an area that I felt it could do more. I do think that \"Fantastic Mr Fox\" was slightly better in both those regards. I also didn't feel much of a connection to the human characters in the story.Visually arresting if a little narratively underwhelming, I look forward to the next time Anderson turns his mind to animation.",

Actually, it took me quite a while to get into this movie, maybe half an hour before the setup exposition was over, the plot started really rolling, and I finally got embedded in the goings-on. I'm a Wes Anderson fan -- Moonrise Kingdom is one of the finest things ever put on film, and Grand Budapest Hotel is a close second although it's SO stylish that it kind of collapses of its own lighter-than-air weight (if that makes any sense) -- and I did eventually like Isle of Dogs too but just not as much. The plot, such as it is, is remarkably intricate for the 1:41 run time, but once again for Wes Anderson, it's style that is the main attraction.The dogs are certainly the stars (voiced by an all-star cast, every one of whom is spot-on) and it's one of several subversively charming elements of the plot that the humans are relegated to the background even though on the surface, they should be the principals. They're endlessly charming, and daffy charm is Anderson's trademark. Rex, King, Boss, and Duke make an amiable quartet of mutts who decide to help 12-year-old Atari find his lost pet Spots. They're so good-natured and helpful that they have to vote on everything. The real (dog} center of the narrative, however, is Chief and his journey of discovery as he goes along for the ride. The villain Kobayashi, the dastardly Mayor of Megasaki, is I think supposed to be either Putinesque or Trumpian and I'm not sure which.So much of the action involves rides -- rusty tram cars, rickety airplanes, and amateurishly built boats -- so enjoy the ride. But after you've seen this, go back and watch Moonrise Kingdom again.",

Hard to dislike but arguably harder to love than the best of Anderson's offerings, Isle of Dogs ends up being further proof that Anderson is a unique and unpredictable talent, to be forever copied, but hardly ever bested based purely on imaginary outputs.3 black owls out of 5",

            "content": "\"Isle of Dogs\" (2018 release; 101 min.) brings the story of the canine population in Megasaki City. Japan. As the movie opens, we are told it is \"20 years into the future\", and a dog virus is sweeping the city. Mayor Kobayashi signs a dog ban, and Spots is the first dog deported to Trash Island. We then go to \"6 months later\", and Atari Kobayashi, the Mayor's nephew, sneaks onto Trash Island, determined to find his beloved Spots. Atari befriends a pack of dogs led by Chief. Will they find Spots? Will the dog virus be treated? At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-producer-director Wed Anderson, and his second stop-motion animated film, following the equally excellent \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" (2009). The big difference is that \"Isle of Dogs\" is set in Japan, and features Japanese dialogue and communications (all translated by either a translator or a device called \"Simul-Translate\"). The movie plays out in 4 parts, and I have to say that my favorite is Part II \"The Search for Spots\" (get it?). Anderson devotes careful attention to even the smallest details, and I'm sure that I missed quite q view in my first viewing of the film. The movie features an all-star voice cast, truly too many to name them all, but let me just point out Liev Schreiber as Spots, Greta Gerwig as foreign exchange student Tracy Walker (who later is revealed to hail from... \"Cincinnati, Ohio\", much to the delight--hooting an hollering--from the theater crowd where I saw this at), and Bryan Cranston as Chief. The animation itself is done exquisitely, truly a eye-candy from start to finish. The movie's dialogue brims with vigor and comedy (although I was surprised by the use of the term \"final and permanent solution\" when the Mayor contemplates killing all dogs). Last, but certainly not least, Anderson's house composer Alexandre Desplat returns once again (on the heels of his second Oscar win--his first Oscar was of course for Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel). Desplat brings a dazzling score, mixing Japanese elements with more traditional (Western) music. Can't wait to check out the movie's soundtrack.\"Isle of Dogs\" premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in February to immediate critical acclaim. It opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend (on not one, not two but THREE screens, something I have never seen before), and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely, and it was clear the crowd was loving it. \"Isle of Dogs\" is a funny and engaging movie, not the kind where you are rolling on the floor laughing hysterically but instead you have that certain smile on your face, chucking on and off, while taking in as much of the movie's details as you possibly can. If you enjoyed \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", I readily suggest you check out \"Isle of Dogs\", be it at the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. \"Isle of Dogs\" is a WINNER all the way.",

This sci-fi-comedy-adventure touches on topics like political corruption, media, oppression, and even the Holocaust. However, the Mad-Gab-esque title (\"I Love Dogs\") really lets you know what the film's aims are. A visually captivating and heartfelt stop-motion film, it's main goal and success is as an unabashed rub-on-the-belly for man's best friend. \nSet 20 years in the future, a young boy is goes searching for his beloved pet after all of Japan's dogs have been exiled to a garbage-dump-island. Full of deadpan humor and detailed history, the world-building is fantastic. As with many of Anderson's films, it's filled with small touches (hilarious haikus, surprisingly complex dog characters) that envelope an audience despite the intentional stiffness in the delivery. And of course, there's his signature visual style. Here we're given a technical adeptness in the animation styles that makes this even more aesthetically stunning than normal, along with the extreme symmetry and dry emotions.\nFor me, Anderson's style has always been one that I could never quite embrace the way others do. Where many see it as distinct and engaging, I often find it makes his films colder and more distant than they might otherwise feel. Those feelings still popped up here for me, an undeniable sense of cloying cuteness and self-parody. However, with Isle of Dogs those negatives only serve to highlight how great the visual achievements, subtle laughs and story constructs are here. Artfully attentive and original, this may not convert audiences either for or against Anderson, but it's still a cute entry into his unmistakable repertoire.",

It is abundantly clear that Anderson was inspired by the Land of the Rising Sun as he creates a futuristic reimagining of Japan whilst retaining their traditional culture. It's not racist in the slightest. The mayor of Megasaki signs an executive decree to banish all dogs to Trash Island due to viral outbreak. His young nephew flees home in an attempt to find his guard dog Spots on the quarantined island. Japanese, stop motion, ensemble voice cast, canines...safe to say I adored this animated adventure. Anderson's quirky utilisation of symmetry, character centralisation and swift camera panning makes for a deliberately odd style that is incredibly easy to succumb to. A darkly mature story that involves political agendas, propaganda, totalitarianism, obedience and death is surprisingly intertwined with an intelligently written script that is sure to have you laughing on several occasions. This is also a result from the outstanding voice ensemble consisting of Cranston, Norton, Murray, Johansson and more as they inject life into their puppet canines. The smart use of language and lack of subtitles ensures that linguistic authenticity flows throughout its runtime. The attentive detail put into each character (both physically and literary) makes for several heartwarming moments as you quickly become emotionally attached to these adorable dogs. The stop motion animation was gorgeous, just like 'Fantastic Mr Fox', with excellent use of fluffy wool to depict clouds and industrious rust to illustrate the abandonment of the environment. It's not just aesthetic appeal, it's world building. Desplat's musical score of booming taiko drums and other traditional instruments allows the Japanese culture to invade all of your senses, slowly entrancing you. I did find that the narrative segmentation and constant flashbacks made for a disjointed plot. Small gripe aside, it's very rare that we are presented with such originality, creativity and humanity in an animation. Stunning.",

            "review_title": "Classic Anderson filmmaking and storytelling in its most creative packaging yet",
            "content": "The union of Wes Anderson and stop-motion animation continues to be an ideal match. In 2009's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox,\" Anderson showed what he could create using a medium that gives its author total control over every detail and every tiny movement; it amplified his comedy and creativity. This proves true once more in \"Isle of Dogs,\" a completely original concept and story.The film takes place in a fictional Japanese Dystopia in which a canine disease has swept over the city of Megasaki, leading the mayor to order the banishing of all dogs to Trash Island. Flash forward a little to the mayor's nephew, Atari (Koyu Rankin), crash-landing a plane on the island and encountering a pack of Trash Island dogs led by Chief (Bryan Cranston). The pack discerns that Atari is looking for his dog and bodyguard Spots (Liev Schreiber), the first dog ever shipped off to the island. Despite Chief's reluctance to help a human, he is overruled by Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum) and Boss (Bill Murray).Their adventure becomes this fresh and interesting way of exploring the relationship between man and dog, embodied in the initially tenuous dynamic between Atari, an orphan in search of his best friend, and Chief, who has found new purpose on Trash Island because he doesn't have to be obedient.That story could've been told any number of ways, so in a sense the Japanese cultural aesthetic could be deemed arbitrary, yet it really adds a distinctive flavor. Various Kabuki/Noh theatre influences blend with Anderson's usual visual stylization and storytelling rhythm, and Alexandre Desplat gets a fresh musical palette to work with for his excellent score. It's clear that Anderson was destined to do something in a traditional Japanese style and it was probably easiest to do in a completely fictional adventure story.All this to say, \"Isle of Dogs\" is rife with Anderson trademarks that will undoubtedly satiate his most devoted fans. He only gets points for dressing up some of his most prolific themes -a protagonist with dead parents, estranged relationships and a meticulous plan gone wrong - in his most unique and creative way to date. The world-building he does in this film is unlike anything he's done before, from the visuals of a Dystopic Japan to telling a story in which only the animals speak English and there are no inorganic subtitles.The tender relationship moments that usually accompany his films also take a slightly different shape in man and his pet. Even though the plot is larger than life, it always boils down to that moment of emotional vulnerability that always helps catapult his films from good to great. \"Isle of Dogs\" is no exception, and there's plenty to marvel at too.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The Houston born Wes Anderson is the director and some of his other gems include The Grand Budapest Hotel, Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Darjeeling Limited. This is his second stop motion animated movie-Fantastic Mr. Fox being his first-and it is set in Japan, about 20 years into the future. The mayor of Japan has banned all dogs to an island where they dump their trash-In fact, it is called Trash Island. It seems there is a canine disease-not affecting the cats-that has people worried. The mayor's nephew just happens to have a dog-the mayor is a cat lover-and is one of the first dogs sent to the island. The 12 year old nephew goes to the island, in search of his beloved pet and that's when he meets Edward, Bill, Scarlett and Bryan, all abandoned dogs that agree to help him find his pet. All the people in the movie-with a couple of exceptions-speak Japanese and all the dogs speak English. There are lots of other voices you might recognize-I checked the credits on some that I wasn't sure of-including Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum and Yoko Ono. If you read the end credits like I do, there is one cast member that says, Anjelica Huston as Mute Poodle. It is a quirky movie, but if you like quirky.... I must mention, I don't think it would be quite suitable for smaller children. There is a pack of dogs that are known as cannibals because when they were starving, they decided to dine on a fellow dog. There are also dogs that have been experimented on and they are shown in different degrees of, well, experimentation-missing limbs, eyes, etc.\nIt's rated \"PG-13\" for violent images and thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes.\nI liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",

            "content": "I finally watched the hottest film, Isle of Dogs. And it made me confused and even so mad. Well, the film could be seen nicely directed with exotic images, if you don't have any background knowledge about imperialism period of the country, Japan.Although the movie explained its time setting as the future, it obviously borrowed the images from Japan in the imperialism and colonial period such as costumes, hair style, how the government controls the people and how they were controlled. And from the point of view as a Korean, a person from the colonial victim country, it's not just about the cute dogs.There is an isle called Gunkanjima which was called 'Isle of jail' by Korean people near a city of Japan, 'Nagasaki', just as there is the isle of dogs near a virtual city in the movie, 'Megasaki'. From 1940 to 1945, approximately 800 of Korean people were drafted into the coal mine which was filled with high temperature poisonous gas above 50C for compulsory labour. They were literally treated like 'dogs'. And 122 of them passed away in the 'isle of jail'. Moreover, Japanese government didn't inform most of the deaths even to their families.If you still can't understand why I feel so mad, I can explain it more easily by metaphor. Just imagine there's a movie which German people in the Nazis period style appear in, and they commit 'Dogs' to an isolated isle. It can't but remind of 'the place' where all we know.Freedom of expression should not be respected always but only when with responsibility. If Wes Anderson just picked the country and the city because it's his favorite as he said, he should have known enough and well. And I would blame on his ignorance. However, if not, I am really wondering what he wanted to say through the film.",

The higher scores tend to come from Anderson fan boys/girls but you make up your own mind.It's a really odd mix of Japanese animation about dogs but it's not anime. The dogs are 'nice' but not cute. Mot of the dialogue is in English but there are moments of Japanese which are not translated. Slightly irritating but no big deal as you can still follow the plot.Speaking of plot - it works fairly well, and is better for being in a cartoon. It probably wouldn't work as a live movie. It's engaging and there are a couple of characters you can empathise with.And it has a host of stars doing the voices - I won't list them all, check the list.It's rated a PG but I'd definitely not want younger children watching it so check it out before showing it to younger viewers.",

It takes a lot of Gaul or myopic fixation for an American to make a film about how the Japanese are rounding up the unfairly maligned minority. It is the same sort of blindness that allows a literal whitewashing of a character to be played off as a throw away gag. This sort of missing the forest from the tree ends up robbing Dogs of much emotional impact. With its White Savoir the film is close to obscene.Nonetheless, the film;s overall constructed feel is at once hysterically surreal and helps hides the narrative warts. The narrative goes places you wished it wouldn't go but boy does it go there in style. The animation is simply absorbing and deeply impressive to look at. Everything is has that just-so perfection that is Anderson's trademark.I am not really sure why the film was set Japan, apart from Anderson's various homages. There use of English for the dogs is rather off putting when you think about various implications of the narrative. But this film is very enjoyable to watch and it is quite funny.If only Anderson saw the big picture isn't just the tiny details being right.",

A boy Samurai appears and beheads the Baron and dogs are domesticated rather than destroyed.Forward to 2038, the malevolent Mayor of Megasaki City, Kobayashi signs a decree deporting dogs to Trash Island due to an outbreak of Dog Flu which results in Snout Fever. Professor Watanabe show's he is close to a cure for this virus but is ignored. The Mayor's 12 year old nephew Atari flies to the island in search of his beloved guard dog spots. He joins up with a pack of smart dogs who join him in his quest.Back in Megasaki City pupils involved in a school magazine investigate the whole affair including an ace hacker and a foreign exchange student from the US suspect a conspiracy is afoot regarding the whole affair. THis belief is strengthened when the Mayor claims his nephew has been kidnapped by the dogs.Good fun even if the school students get a bit too cutesie at times. The dogs are well imagined, most with back stories. Trash Island has been devastated by earthquakes, tsunami, volcanic explosions and power plant failures. It has deserted fun parks, factories, waste disposal plants and a dog experimental laboratory.It is rumoured that cannibalistic aboriginal dogs roam part of the island. This is the devastated landscape which Atari must traverse with his canine companions.An all star cast provides the voices for the dogs and humans. A stop-motion animated film by Wes Anderson for dogfans of all ages.

            "content": "Usually, I'm not a big fan of animation movies but Isle of Dogs certainly deserves the praise it gets. I would even consider it the best animation movie since the brilliant Wall-E ten years ago. I predict this movie is going to win at least one Academy Award next year.There are several elements that make this film stand out. First of all, the stop-motion animation manages both to honor influential animated films and series of the sixties and seventies and to develop some stylish retro-chic that makes the movie look fresh. The numerous references to Japanese culture in form of clothes and settings, drinks and foods as well as spoken and written language are quite charming. The story is interesting enough as well and follows a group of dogs who help the orphaned nephew of a tyrannic mayor who wants to exterminate dogs find his vanished guard dog. The film teaches values such as courage, democracy, freedom, friendship and resilience. Its messages are important for children but also apply for adults. Despite its intelligent plot and intriguing intentions, Isle of Dogs is a movie that remains entertaining and easy to digest. The dog characters complement one another in a humorous way and especially Chief is quite sympathetic as tough dog with a soft core. The human characters aren't as detailed but also rather charming, especially the resilient Atari and the courageous Tracy. The fates of dogs and humans will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.There isn't much to criticize about this beautiful movie. The plot could have been a little bit more creative and surprising. The movie might moralize a little bit too much here and there. There are a few too many flashbacks that break the movie's flow. It's debatable whether choosing an American exchange student as one of the protagonists in a story taking place exclusively in Japan was truly necessary. However, all those things are only minor details that won't take away from your enjoyment of this superb flick.If there is a movie for the whole family to watch this year, it has to be the beautiful yet profound Isle of Dogs. Wes Anderson's latest project is emotional, entertaining and intelligent and should please the brains and hearts of old and young cinephiles alike. If even someone who usually doesn't appreciate animation movies a lot like me likes this film quite a lot, I guess it must be something truly memorable.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs is a movie to be reckoned with. This incredibly unique piece of stop motion animation is totally different from the norm of today's films. Written and directed by Wes Anderson, it stars the voices of Bryan Cranston as Chief, Edward Norton as Rex, Bill Murray as Boss, Liev Schreiber as Spots, Bob Balaban as King, Scarlett Johansson as Nutmeg and Jeff Goldblum as Duke. It also stars Koyu Rankin as the young boy, Atari. It is the second animated film from Wes Anderson, after the wonderful Fantastic Mr. Fox.In future Japan, where dogs are viewed as savage and disease ridden creatures, a young boy, Atari, searches for his dog, Spots. This dystopian world, created by his guardian, Mayor Kobayashi, disparages dogs but worships cats. Atari defies his guardian and along the way befriends some loyal, passionate pooches who help him on his fateful journey of finding his lost dog. One thing I particularly adore about Wes Anderson's filmmaking is his irreverent humour and creativity. It's almost as if Anderson has a patent on an new genre of filmmaking, that's entirely his own. During the making of this film, Anderson was influenced by his love for Japanese cinema and two of the most monumental Japanese directors - Akira Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki. In an interview about his many influences for the film, he states \"with Miyazaki you get nature and you get moments of peace, a kind of rhythm that is not in the American animation tradition...\". Later on, Anderson explains that during the scoring of the film he and his composer, Alexandre Desplat, had to rethink their approach to the soundtrack because the movie longed to be quiet. He later specifies that this aspect of the film also comes from Miyazaki. The stop motion animation style pairs perfectly with the pure grittiness of its creativity. In most animated films you don't hear the roughness or coarseness of the actors' voices, but in Anderson's film you do and it is the most lifelike. Also, despite the humor, Anderson doesn't sugar coat the seriousness of the story. His films are always truthful and cut to the heart of the matter. I recommend Isle of Dogs for ages 12 to 18, due to its violence and sophisticated humour. Younger kids might not understand the ironic tone. I give it 5 out of 5 stars for bringing an incredibly unique vision to the mostly mundane animation of today. Reviewed by Clayton P. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

            "content": "Isle of Dogs (my latest review) is the best form of animation. Stop-motion animation that is. As a film about a young boy searching for his dog (via an island where illness outbreak pups are banished to), \"Isle\" is a technical triumph. It has director Wes Anderson using his required trademarks to make eye-popping grandeur a complete understatement. This is Anderson's ode to fictional Japan, his form of made-up dystopia that he was born to put out. In Isle of Dogs, Wes gives us a rinse, repeat cycle of wide-angle clips, close-ups, various title cards, random flashbacks, and whip pans. Sure his narrative is a little choppy, his storytelling way overzealous, and his plot points too aplenty for a flick rounding out to 101 minutes. Still, \"Isle\" is a midnight stoner's dream, a feast of lushly framed scenes so detailed and itemized that you can't help but demand a second viewing. For instance, check out a sequence where an animated chef is making sushi with a poisonous wasabi. Also, check out a depiction of a garbage bag filled with dumpster diving food. Finally, look for a sequence where a doctor persona is performing a blow-by-blow kidney transplant. Anderson is wise here to give us his signature camera shots from up above. It wouldn't work any other way. All in all, the characters in Isle of Dogs are voiced by the likes of Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray, and Liev Schreiber. Schreiber and Cranston handle the majority of the dialogue while everyone else sort of fades in and out. In truth, my favorite Wes Anderson film of all time has always been Rushmore. \"Isle\", with its beautified dirtiness, its form of deafening taiko drumming, its tongue-in-cheek squeak, and its V for Vendetta banality, comes in at a close second.

            "content": "It may have come out two weeks ago, but my theater finally received one of the weirdest movies to grace the theaters. Tonight, a friend and I hit the theaters to check out the critically acclaimed Isle of Dogs, a stop motion feature that looks to be part creepy, part weird, and 100% unique. What lies on the isolated Trash Island and its furry inhabitants? Please read on to hear my thoughts as I review: Movie Title: Isle of Dogs\nDirector:\n Wes AndersonWriters:\n Wes Anderson (story by), Roman Coppola (story byStars:\n Bryan Cranston, Koyu Rankin, Edward Norton \nLIKES: Animation: With computer graphics dominating the field, it's nice to see a deviation from the traditional Disney and DreamWorks presentation. Isle of Dogs unique design is the most recognizable component of the film, a well-crafted blend of various Japanese art styles cooked and mixed into a cuisine of delightful fun. All the characters have a variety of qualities and traits to their models, many standing out in some concept that defines the very character you get hooked on. The stop motion like quality adds charisma and comedy to the mix, giving the movie a nice originality. Yes, it is not the smoothest animation to come out of the woodwork, but all the personality behind it makes up for it. The Voice Acting: With the cavalcade of stars taking up ranks in the voice acting department, Isle of Dogs is well equipped for voicing their characters. Each star or starlet brings some component to the movie, be it comedic, blunt presentation, mysterious allure, or a heartfelt emotional speech to inspire and move. The writing set these unique cast members up for some hilarious bickering/bashing one another, developing a relationship that at times feels like a dysfunctional family of Full House and other times like Lord of The Flies. Certainly, this voice work deserves some award recognition, but enjoy everything it has to bring. The Comedy: My friend and I could not stop laughing at all the comedic relief packed into this movie. As mention previously, the voice acting has a lot to do with bringing the full comedic punch of the writing, with Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, and Bryan Cranston being my particular favorites. Past the writing, the movie's pokes at a lot of cultural stigmatisms, references, and stretches of the imagination that many animate features take. And even the sheer ridiculousness of the movie is fun to laugh out, classy jabs that work well and fit into the story. The Story/Culture: Isle of Dogs is certainly the odd story to say the least, the tale really has a lot of gusto behind it. Its presentation is certainly clever, feeling much like a TV soap opera with a little anime and political thriller all rolled into one. These genres may not seem like they would mix well, but Anderson and company have managed to tie these components together in an entertaining manner. As the Japanese culture of modern and ancient Japan clash, the various principles and ethic codes come to a full boil as Atari's Odyssey adventure progresses across the wasteland that is trash island. The emotional fire, the tension of friendship, and even the corruption that lies beneath it all, were all well-balanced to the point of keeping things engaging and entertaining. \nDISLIKES: (More like limitations)More Time with Other Characters: We got a decent balance of characters with this cast, but I would have liked more time with some of the other dogs. Chief and Spots have a majority of the screen time, and while the other dogs got their moments to shine, I wanted more of their involvement in the story. The ending in particular could have used their individual skills to get to the end game. The Pace: The movie has a little inconsistency in regards to how it moves when presenting the story. Some parts move excessively quick, while others are a little drawn out and oversaturated with their odd eccentricities and banter. Eventually the pace smooths out, but the movie took a little while find it's rhythm and get to the ideal mix of all the story qualities. The Limited Audience: This movie's uniqueness is not going to be for everyone and that limitation is going to be difficult to overcome. The Movie is not going to be for everyone, and if you aren't ready for odd criteria, specific cultural references, and drier senses of humor. So therefore, this movie is not going to expand to a lot of people and be lost to other, more widespread audience members. The VERDICT: Isle of Dogs is certainly one of the more unique movies to hit the silver screen, trading traditional presentation for an angle that most don't play. It's got culture, story, fantastic design, and voice acting that really pops, locks, and in many cases rocks. However, the movie is not going to be for everyone, as the odd style, dryer comedy, and cultural references may not be appreciated by many. For those liking this unique style though, this is the movie for you and certainly one of Anderson's better films to hit the screen. So definitely check this out in theaters while you can and enjoy getting creeped out by the penetrating gaze of most of the cast. My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0\nMovie Overall: 8.0",

In this case of this move, however, it is a fictional island opposite the Japanese metropolis of Megasaki City headed by a cruel mayor who expels all dogs from the city to the island on the ground that they are a health threat to local citizens. It's not difficult to see this as a liberal-minded allegory for how we threat any group in society which is seen as different.But this is not an overtly political film because of its utterly whimsical style - after all, this is a work directed and written by Wes Anderson who never does things conventionally and whose last production was the wonderful \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\". This time - as with his earlier \"Fantastic Mr Fox\" - the whole thing is a beautifully-rendered stop-motion animation with some striking visuals but, in spite of the certification and the involvement of a 12 year old pilot, this is not a children's film. It is just too quirky, with all the references to Japanese culture (including exciting taiko drumming) and the use of Japanese language (not always translated).The speaking cast is simply incredible with a dozen well-known actors voicing the different dogs, including Bryan Cranstan, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, and Jeff Goldblum plus (in smaller roles) Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton.

            "content": "GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An inventive animated film with much wit and a pedigree of mischief too.JIM'S REVIEW: I am enamored by animated films. As a child, I was amazed that a series of drawings was able to \"move\" and created an emotional story of worth. Back then, (we're talking the 50's / 60's), the animated full-length feature was a rarity with the Disney Studio being the primary source of that genre of entertainment. Nowadays, with computer generated and stop motion movies being more common, and many studios venturing into state-of-the-art animation techniques like the reliable Pixar Studio and Aardman Animations, among other lesser sources, the allure may have faded somewhat and the results from the many prolific studios vary in quality, if not quantity. It seems that either the visuals overtake the narrative or vise-versa. It is so rare that both meld successfully into the final product. Wes Anderson's quirky and clever animated feature, Isle of Dogs, almost makes that leap of story and visual balance. It has scenes of total brilliance and political satire done with imagination and flair, even if the story ultimately wears thin and settles for a contrived ending to please the masses.The simple tale relates the story of a boy searching for his lost canine friend. Set in the distant future in Japan, dogs have been banned and shipped to a trash heap island due to a contiguous outbreak presumedly caused by dogs. One of the first to be banished is Spots, owned by an orphan called Atari. This boy is determined to get his pet back and goes off to rescue him. He lands on Trash Island and is befriended by a quintet of raggedy mutts, namely, Rex, King, Duke, Boss, and Chief. All journey together to find Spots and uncover more than they bargained for.Written by Roman Coppola, Jason Swartzman, Kunichi Nomura, and the director, the film takes its storytelling quite seriously depicting a \"love cats, hate dogs\" polarized society, an Orwellian world that is controlled by a fascist dictator. The dogs are literally the underdogs representing the oppressed class. All of this dramatic structure is heavy-handed and in need of a few re-writes to clarify characters and the events that transpire. Still, the stop motion animation is most skillfully rendered, especially in its superb details of discarded refuse and hand drawn backgrounds. There is much to admire from its color palette, stylish compositions, and imaginative littered landscapes.Mr. Anderson's vision focuses on this dystopian place using aerial views, shadows, and lighting to maximum effect. He injects this adult-oriented film with subtle touches of unexpected wit and droll humor (ticks scurrying in the dog's fur to show the squalor, a boy's bloody face with a impaled metal rod becoming an annoying yet forgotten appendage, shadows of figures quickly traveling against mounds of detailed garbage, a dead fish head still moving on a nearby plate as lunch is being prepared, etc.) These slightly macabre moments give the film an indelible sense of glee and mischief and show off this off-kilter universe. Another clever conceit is that the human words, mostly spoken in Japanese, is explained through translation while the dog's \"barks\" are the main English dialog. Whimsy is Mr. Anderson's forte and his penchant for good spirited fun.The voiceover work is uniformly strong. Koyu Rankin voices Atari and Liev Schreiber is his friend, Spots. Vocal support comes from Bryan Cranston (displaying a wonderful tone of ongoing despair) Edward Norton, Bob Balaban, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Murray as the Canine Five. Other star-studded friends of the director add their talents in minor roles: Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson, Harvey Keitel, Greta Gerwig, F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, Courtney B. Vance, and Yoko Ono.Isle of Dog is a masterful m\u00e9nage of lovely animation and unique storytelling that make this movie going experiences a howling success.\n \nNOTE: The opening and closing credits of the ensemble taiko drumming is marvelous. Four paws up!",

I can see how a lot of younger kids would be bored by this movie though. Plot - In different hands, this movie could've been a dumb, goofy comedy, but the final result here is a very serious movie. It is extremely entertaining, but don't expect to be laughing too much. Most of the only jokes are in the trailer. The seriousness isn't a bad thing, just something to think about before you watch it. Animation - The animation is absolutely fantastic. Of the whole movie, there is only a single shot where the animation looks a bit dumb. Other then that, the whole movie looks awesome. Characters - Most of the characters aren't developed a lot, but its still entertaining. Voice Acting - Some people may find the flat line delivery boring, but I think it fits the tone of the movie and I enjoyed it.Everything about this move is extremely well done and I'd highly recommend it.",

The score feels dynamic, traditional and exciting - really adding to the emotions and pacing of the film.The story presented here is fantastic - simple enough for children to understand on a surface level but deep enough for adults, especially with the politics involved. It's emotional, relatable and lots of fun, even with its dark humour outlook of dispair and desperation.The attention to detail in this movie is astonishing - every shot is composed with purpose, every model is unique and the fluidity of scenes join together with a brisk pace that ties everything together nicely! The film changes animation style consistently in such a manner that it adds another layer to the film making.The voice acting was completely nailed by every actor/actress and it really added to the charm of the movie.Even as a certified Cat Daddy, I personally loved this movie, give it a watch.",

Alexandre Desplat's excellent and highly inventive music score adds much mood and movement to overall proceedings. While I expect, \"Isle of \"Dogs\" won't be everyone's choice of entertainment it will please and intrigue more than it may alienate.I had not read anything about this movie before watching and was convinced it was a Japanese production - only to be surprised at the finish to find it was mostly American. Highly recommended for a somewhat sardonic, dark and insightful journey into imagination and would expect it should garnish some attention at this year's Global Awards. The visuals by British cinematographer Tristan Oliver are standout.While not many may remember a British animated film by Richard Williams from '58 titled: \"The Little Island\" much of the humorous visual style of \"Dogs\" bears a resemblance, and makes this rare featurette worth seeking out - simultaneously very funny and serious.",

The story is also well structured with interesting twists and surprises even though the eventual climax - and its build-up - seem to lack clarity and excitement at times.But it stands out mainly due to its characters especially the dog Chief, voiced by Bryan Cranston. As the occasionally self-appointed leader of a gang of five male dogs, Chief stands out as he is a stray dog compared to his peers whose previous life circumstances were relatively privileged.

            "content": "A few years ago, I got on a Wes Anderson kick. I practically watched his entire filmography to that point in one long binge-worthy day. After catching up, I felt I truly appreciated his quirky, orthogonal cinematography and deeply complex characters. I've essentially been a fan of his since Moonrise Kingdom (2012), so I was looking forward to his latest work, Isle of Dogs(2018). After all, he had proven his skill at stop-motion animation with The Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) and had received nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) since then.Unfortunately, while Isle of Dogs carries Anderson's distinct style and charm, it felt a little watered down. Sure, the shots were full of their beauty and symmetry, and the story had its cute moments, but it mostly felt like he was on autopilot. Maybe the PG-13 rating was holding him back? I don't know. In most fiction, there is a suspension of disbelief, but setting this film 20 years in the future while still holding to the aesthetic of the antique (I doubt there will be nearly that many reel-to-reels in the future) seemed to backfire a little.I'll give Wes Anderson some credit, though: he did try something new by including the \"language barrier\" and adopting the Japanese style as much as he could. It also seems that stop-motion techniques have improved significantly since The Fantastic Mr. Fox, likely due to many of the same 3-D printing technologies used for Kubo and the Two Strings (2016). The mixture of 3-D stop-motion and 2-D animation in Isle of Dogs should also be commended. In the end, I think my main qualm with this film was that it was a smidge too predictable. Perhaps this was due to the standard McGuffin of the boy trying to be reunited with his dog.Full of Wes Anderson's charming cinematography but not too much else, I give Isle of Dogs 3.5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Whether he knows it or not, Wes Anderson is an animator trapped in a filmmaker's body. Like Tim Burton, he's a visionary director with a peculiar, oddball style of telling stories. But when he gets into the realm of stop-motion animation, there is no limit to where his imagination takes him. Isle of Dogs is one of the most spectacularly beautiful pieces of animation in a very long time. As to where this falls in Anderson's filmography, I'd put it near the top and quite a few spots above The Grand Budapest Hotel, a film that's perceived to be his masterpiece. It wasn't, but this one just might be it.From the opening shot, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. I let go of every perceivable reservation and let Anderson's entire universe overtake me. What a universe it is.Somewhere in the not so distant future, a Japanese city called Megasaki is run by cynophobic, cat supremacist, fascist, Mayor Kobayashi. He institutes extreme measures of quarantine and expulsion of dogs from his city after a curious case of dog flu threatens his citizens. The dogs, now stranded on Trash Island, forage and try to stay alive yet seem to communicate like self-aware entities in an old Woody Allen comedy. The five dogs we meet are voiced by Anderson favorites (Norton, Murray, Goldblum, Balaban) with the exception of Bryan Cranston, who plays the feral stray dog leader, Chief. The designs of these dogs all have something to gaze in wonder at. For example Boss (Murray) has dark button eyes and wears an adorable sweater as the former mascot of a local junior baseball team. Another dog we see later in the film named Jupiter, played by F. Murray Abraham, sports a canteen of \"turpentine brandy\" around his neck. All are furry and all are downright cuddly. Torpedoing from Megasaki is a stowaway child pilot named Atari Kobayashi, on a mission to rescue his beloved dog Spots (Liev Schrieber) from Trash Island. Meanwhile, an underground resistance of the Mayor and his iron fisted rule is growing in Megasaki. Leading it is an American foreign exchange student, Tracy, played by Greta Gerwig. I could only describe her as a cross between Norma Rae and Little Orphan Annie. She uncovers a conspiracy which proves indefinitely that the epidemic of dog flu was invented by the government in order to eradicate Dogs as a species, Nazi style.With an engaging plot like that and such richly constructed environments and characters such as these, nearly everything should go right and it does. It's 100 minutes of bliss. It never deviates from Wes Anderson's signature narrative style which at times has proven to be grating in live-acting. But in the world of stop-motion animation, it's enchanting and it fits him like a glove. I found myself to be the only person laughing out-loud in the theater, not because the movie is deliberately trying to make me laugh, but out of sheer joy at the amount of fun Anderson had in making this. But we had to wait 10 years to see him dare to venture into this world again. Here is a word of advice. Wes, animation is your greatest strength. Keep doing it.",

            "review_title": "Isle of Dogs is basically what would happen if Wes Anderson made a Studio Ghibli film. It's amazing",
            "content": "Wes Anderson has one of the most unique styles of modern cinema. His combination of specific color patterns, off kilter soundtracks, comedy, consistent still camera angles, and occasional reoccurring actors like Bill Murray and Edward Norton gives him the rare distinction of having movies that really don't resemble someone else's. I think that a lot of it comes from how even with a large cast, his movies manage to feel like small, unimportant independent movies...even though their still filled with passion. Wes Anderson has shown that he's not afraid to try out other genres ; his most prominent example being that of Fantastic Mr. Fox in 2009. Fantastic Mr. Fox was his chance to not only do something more family friendly, but was his first (and as of 2018, his only) adaptation of another story. But unlike other animation styles of Disney and DreamWorks, Fantastic Mr. Fox embraced it's identity by combining stop motion that looked intentionally unclean, but still kept a lot of the typical Wes Anderson traits. The movie came out great and I'd had always wanted him to do another animated movie. Not only is Isle of Dogs another stop motion story, but one that's also original. Set in the near future in Megasaki City, Japan, an outbreak of dog flu is spreading amongst the canine population. Mayor Kobayashi decrees that all dogs are to be quarantined to a nearby trash island until a cure is found. Six months later, the dogs have formed a variety of tribes and packs, with the only goal of surviving. In one group, we have the leader Chief (played by Brian Cranston), Rex (played by Edward Norton), King (played by Bob Balban), Duke (played by Jeff Goldblum), and Boss (played by Bill Murray). All except for Chief had lives of families, celebrity, and comfort. Chief was merely a stray that became leader. About six months after the decree, a boy Atari Kobayashi crash lands his plane on the island, looking for his bodyguard dog Spots (played by Live Schreiber). Though the dogs can't understand his Japanese, they understand what he's looking for and agree to try and find him. Meanwhile, back on land, there is a conspiracy that the mayor doesn't want a cure found and would rather exterminate the dogs. Transfer student Tracy Walker (played by Greta Gerwig) tries to get some answers for her school newspaper. I'm happy to say that not only is Isle of Dogs a great movie, but it's an improvement on Fantastic Mr. Fox. Even though I like that movie as well, the latter film suffers from a story that seems to be focused on trying to be a crowd pleaser. Isle of Dogs doesn't talk down to people. In fact, I'd say the movie is a combination Japanese samurai, political thriller, and a little bit of a Woody Allen comedy. And yet it all still feels like it fits into Wes Anderson's style. The animation, which is clearly representing something like Raken-Bass, keeps a lot of the roughness featured in Fantastic Mr. Fox. Though you can tell that some things were touched up by computers, this is an example of good C.G.I, when it's merely used to remove strings. It's never overpowering and it maintains the \"unclean\" look that's still intentional. Each of the dogs look different and make it easy to tell who is who. There are even similar breeds that stand out thanks to the voice acting.Let's talk about the voice-overs. Wes Anderson is an actors director, who knows how to take advantage of each persons skills. He gets a quality mix of Brian Cranston's eccentrics and stern demeanor. This develops into a character that's troubled, but someone who could still be redeemed. Though we certainly get plenty of time with the other animals, Brian Cranston's character gets the most focus and rightfully so. What about the humans? Wes Anderson made the interesting decision to keep the majority of human cast speaking Japanese. A lot of it isn't even translated and were simply supposed to figure out what their feeling or tying to get across. This will definitely stress some audience people that want something more straightforward, though this creates more of a visual experience. I'd compare Isle of Dogs a lot like a silent movie with dialogue. I'll give this ten robot dogs out of ten. Isle of Dogs is more proof on why Wes Anderson is one of my favorite directors. He's an artist whose not afraid to keep evolving his work to create something that's all his own. It's hard to imagine Disney or even Pixar making a story like this. It's heart felled, funny, interesting, and impressive. Go see this and then give our dog a hug.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson is quite the unique filmmaker who is well known for his distinct visual and narrative style, as well as his offbeat sense of humor. When he entered in the realm of animation, he delivered his lovable sensibilities and tropes into a stop-motion film adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox. So when it was announced that he was making another stop-motion animated feature, and his own original creation at that, it was a guarantee that Isle of Dogs would be a unique take on the talking dog movie, complete with huge admiration for the animal. Right off the bat, the animation is truly astounding from start to finish. Every frame has at least some attention to detail, complete with the fur moving as the characters move, water coming from the eyes, background sets and lights, aircraft, Japanese cultural architecture and art, and so much more. The designs of the characters look relatively simplistic but still look aggressive, rough and full of life, and their movements are well defined and energized, even when they're static. The way the animators were able to make the dogs talk is admirable enough, but the way they move as well is quite accurate given the limitations of real life dog movements. I'd say the opening does a great job bringing the audience into the experience, with Anderson's trademark framing establishing a great contrast between the fully lit Megasaki City and the heinous trash ridden island for dogs, and kudos to the small bits of hand-drawn animation done when the televisions are on.The general story itself centers around a young boy named Atari Kobayashi who goes in search of his dog Spots after all of the dogs in Japan are banished to an island from an illness outbreak. Along with a group of dogs who will do anything to not only help him but to also get off the island, the boy sets off on his quest to find his dog while the flu dilemma tries to be solved. If the visuals make one's eyes gouge, then the unpredictable outcomes of the story suck one in, as it's hard to figure out what will happen next, complete with flashbacks that unleash numerous upon numerous of layers nobody will see coming. There are several subplots that run afloat, such as a pro-dog activist group led by the stern foreign exchange student Tracy Walker, yet none feel out of place and are genuinely well woven together. In fact, when stakes and bloodshed do arise between the humans and dogs, one might reimagine the dark talking animal pictures Watership Down and The Plague Dogs, complete with the rough atmosphere and affection towards the animals themselves. From the heart, Isle of Dogs is truthfully about the bond between people and man's best friend, and when the dogs do interact with the good hearted people, it's hard not to just want to adopt a dog of your own those moments are so heartwarming.In addition, the humor is the usual deadpan dialogue common in Anderson's films, which help fit the cast. With a mix of Anderson's usual actors such as Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, Scarlett Johansson and more for the dogs, and a Japanese cast for most of the humans, they all bring their own distinctive voices for the characters they play without overpowering them. While the dogs are humorous enough, the one dog given the most development in the film is Chief, as his relation with Atari helps bring the raw emotions and heart the film displays in its love for dogs. On another added note, considering that most of the humans are Japanese, Anderson cleverly chooses not to use subtitles when they speak. You know you're fantastic at storytelling when even those who don't speak the Japanese language will still understand what is going on, treating the viewers with respect and sincerity.Over the years, we've seen live-action filmmakers experiment with the art of animation, and Isle of Dogs definitely stands as one of the best examples of succeeding in such a task. With a suspenseful and captivating story, phenomenally crafted animation, a great cast of characters worth rooting for and genuine love and respect for Japanese culture, Wes Anderson has showcased his love for the unlimited possibilities that the medium of animation can accomplish through visual storytelling. Using stop-motion requires the upmost patience and attention to perfect, making the final product all the more admirable. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson, animation, or dogs in general, seek this one out and give it your full love and attention, like any dog. Here's to more great animated features Wes Anderson hopefully makes in the future, and to more great animated films yet to come this year.",

            "content": "Isle of Dogs, from its first frame, oozes style. The amount of craft shown in this film is incredible, but even then, they still manage to tell an emotionally involved story.The film is set in Japan, but not in the real sense. 20 years into a dystopian future of a strange mix of different states of culture and technology. This strange and wonderful setting elevates the film in ways that weren't even necessary. You could have essentially told the same story set in the United States, or anywhere else for that matter, but instead they decided to put it in Japan, which gave them a tremendous amount of creative freedom to tell a story that is entirely unique in presentation.Some critics have complained about cultural appropriation, asking whether or not the representation of Japan in this film is fair or sensitive. I'm not Japanese, so I cannot answer for them, but I would hope these people would ask the number of Japanese people who worked on this film, from story to acting, and I'm sure they would have perfectly valid answers for the creative decisions made. This version of 'Japan' isn't meant to be real, it's meant to be a fantasy world inspired by Japan, a world where such a ridiculous story could occur. We don't hear people complaining about cultural appropriation and sensitivity in regards to Avatar: The Last Airbender, so they shouldn't be here.Now a decent criticism you could levy at this film is the severe lack of well developed female characters. There are five female characters with speaking roles. One is an interpreter, one is Yoko Ono, and the other three serve as romantic partners for the three major characters (Chief, Spots and Atari), and not very well developed ones at that. I'm not going to dock a star for this because I rate movies based on how much I enjoyed the experience, not based on any nitpicks or technical issues, but as a person who does care about positive and progressive representation of women and minorities, it is disappointing that the only real inclusion of female characters in this film were to fill in shallow, one dimensional romances in a story that didn't need them.That shouldn't affect your ability to come into this film and enjoy it though. This is an incredible film with a lot of value. The art design, direction and story are strong, funny and at times dark. This is an incredibly unique film that deserves all the money it can get.",

Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs is another fantastic film that is original, creative, and funny. The story is fluid and has a lot of humor throughout. The emotional parts are genuine and the theme of the film is very good. The visuals and stop motion are beautiful. The story is whimsical and a great piece of fiction.The voice acting is very good. Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Koyu Rankin, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, and many others perform very well. Jeff Goldblum's Duke is hilarious and Bryan Cranston's voice acting is perfect.The pacing is great and the film flows smoothly. The runtime is a little overlong.This film is not a masterpiece, but I do believe it deserves a good score because it is so beautiful to look and an because of originality.Pros: Great, whimsical, and funny story, great characters, amazing voice acting, Jeff Goldblum and Bryan Cranston's performance, good pacing, and a lot of good humorCons: The runtime is a bit overlongOverall Rating: 8.7",

In this case, of course, Wes Anderson, the director, quickly remedied the film with his own aesthetic, and added Japanese elements masterly in his personal style. Once again, the strong emotional expression and the serious metaphor in story are amazingly reflected in a infantile but deliberate way, like what he has perfectly done in Fantastic Mr. Fox. However, the unexplainable pain that runs through his previous works has been repressed and replaced with a benevolent understanding.",

The story is simple, delightful even. Boy seeks lost dog, on an island of dogs, that talk, live amongst garbage and oh some robodogs, from the municipal task force on the mainland that's looking for the boy, as are the slightly militant activists, that support the K9 uprising, see, simple!

            "content": "Isle of Dogs is a stop-motion animated film co-written and directed by Wes Anderson (Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel). Featuring the voices of Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, and Bill Murray, it is yet another quirky look into the mindset of the acclaimed director and further proves his versatility as a filmmaker.In a futuristic Japan, a serious virus spreads throughout its dog population and as a result, all dogs are banished to an isolated place called \"Trash Island\". One day, a young boy named Atari sets off to Trash Island to search for his dog Spots, who was the first dog to be sent there during the banishment.Despite its cute presentation, Isle of Dogs is not a kid's film. Some of its dark themes and plot elements would likely be too complex and intense for most children under the age of ten, but anyone older should find plenty to enjoy. The voice acting is terrific, especially from Bryan Cranston as the stray dog Chief, who is responsible for a great deal of the film's dry humour. At times, however, the pacing feels off due to some strangely inserted flashback scenes. In addition to this, the lack of subtitles during some Japanese dialogue can be frustrating to anyone who doesn't understand the language, as an interpreter's translation becomes quite distracting when trying to understand the story. Director Wes Anderson's trademarks are once again on full display; his use of symmetrical framing, his unique use of colour, his interesting oddball characters, truly one of the most artistic filmmakers right now. One can only hope he continues making stop-motion animation films like this and Fantastic Mr. Fox.I rate it 8/10",

            "review_title": "A scrappy, meticulously crafted animation from Anderson.",
            "content": "Stop motion animation is a painstakingly long process. In Laika's fourth feature, Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), a 16-foot skeleton was constructed over a 6 month period and took an entire year to film its sequence, resulting in 49.2 seconds worth of footage in the completed film. With facts like these, it's evident that stop motion films are true labours of love, involving countless animators to bring these visions to life. Wes Anderson's second foray into stop motion cinema (his first being 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox) is Isle of Dogs, set in Japan and boasting a large, impressive cast list. With fears of an outbreak of snout fever becoming overwhelming throughout Japan, Kobayashi, the Mayor of Megasaki City, banishes all dogs to an island of trash, ensuring the citizens that a cure is impossible. First on the list is Spots (Liev Schieber) the beloved dog of Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin), ward of Mayor Kobayashi. Several months pass, and Atari flies out to trash island in search of Spots, and is immediately joined on his quest by a ragtag group of dogs, including Rex (Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Boss (Murray), and Chief (Cranston). One of the most notable things about Isle of Dogs is the characteristics and expressions of the dogs. There is so much emotion and detail in their eyes, and the animation perfectly captures their mannerisms and provides the audience with a selection of lovable characters to spend time with on an island towering with garbage. Scrappy and rough, yet strangely beautiful, the films aesthetic is a certainly unique one. Anderson splits the film into two storylines that ultimately unite towards the end. The first features Atari and the dogs travelling across the island in search of Spots, and the second centring on Tracey Walker (Lady Birds writer/director Greta Gerwig) investigating a conspiracy surrounding Major Kobayashi. Whilst this secondary plot doesn't quite measure up to the strengths of Atari's quest, it still works and results in a satisfying conclusion to both arcs. One of the sweetest aspects of the film is the bond between Atari and stray dog Chief, who makes it clear on several occasions after Atari's unexpected arrival that he does not bow to any master, yet over the course of the film gradually eases up and becomes a loyal aid to his quest. A quirky, sweet tale of the bond between a boy and his dog, Anderson's second stop motion film is an enjoyable animated adventure that finds beauty in the unlikeliest of places.",

From individual hairs to random fleas that scurry, no piece of detail gets left out. Each scene is beautiful and stands out on their own. Colors and visuals and media styles mix and blend together to create a beautiful film. The animation is nothing less than captivating.But the film is more than a delight to the eyes, it's a delight to the ears as well. The music and sounds were perfect. Loved the music throughout. The voice cast was well selected. It's fun guessing which person is playing which character.The plot was unique and heartwarming. Who can't like a story about a boy and his dog? There are some suspenseful moments, it's a feel-good movie throughout.I enjoyed the nod to Japanese culture and Anderson's choice of not having subtitles. Though confusing at first, it increases the level of immersion. Double points for accurate Japanese.

The movie follows a boy named Atari as he aims to find his bodyguard dog that has been exiled to trash island following an epidemic. On the island, the boy finds a group of dogs that help him locate his lost dog.Isle of Dogs is a gorgeous movie to look at. Although the animation may be basic, the movie does a good job with the visuals. Every dog, smoke, human, and background look distinct. The voice acting is also impressive with the ensemble cast chiming in and delivering lines with emotion. This mix of clean and distinct auditory and visual experiences makes the movie engrossing to follow.The story is incredibly basic. From the beginning of the movie, the story is already told and it plays out mostly in the same way. The movie contains too many characters that distracts from its main story. One of these is the foreign exchange student, Tracy. I enjoyed her character but much of her story took time away from Atari and the dogs on trash island. The movie uses a lot of flashbacks and side stories. All of this is fine to anyone who enjoys Wes Anderson but to anyone viewing his movies for the first time, they may be taken off guard.Overall, Isle of Dogs is a recommended movie. It features many common styles from Wes Anderson and is one of his more approachable movies.Grade: B",

Their solution to the problem is to send all dogs to Trash Island where they can scavenge for themselves. A little boy from Japan named Atari, the mayor's son, flies over to the island to look for his dog, Spots, and a group of dogs journey in help to find him. So this movie had a limited release I think about a month ago. It was given a lot of praise and buzz so last week there was a little bit of a wider release. This week it finally got a wide release. This movie was great! Unique and original. All of the voice actor were amazing. It's almost like the characters they had were a reflection of themselves. The stand out for me were Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, and finally Koyu Rankin as Atari. I like Wes Anderson's idea for stop motion. This is his second stop motion movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox being his first. Alexandre Desplat creates a great score, like he always does. The only flaws I had were that there was a side plot with one character that wasn't necessary, but I still liked it. Some scenes dragged on just a little too. Other than that I thought Isle of Dogs was a great movie and people should go see it, as our theatre only sold 5 tickets altogether last night.\nMy Grade: A-",

The plot was a little thin, and several leaps (the sudden, easy political downfall of Kobayashi and the effect a couple kids had on the process, especially the hacker, seemed unrealistic), but I think with movies like this, you can't get bogged down in that and have to just appreciate the positive, fun movie presented.

            "content": "I adore Wes Anderson's films, yet I will admit Fantastic Mr Fox is perhaps my least favorite; something doesn't translate to animation for me. I was expecting to be transported or at least pleasantly entertained but a lot of the film irked me and thinking about it more afterward it bugged me even more. This is a beautifully animated movie and the visuals are pleasing as punch. However, the story seems to mean nothing and the characters are all flat.\n \nHere are some of my random complaints:1. The concept of having one of the main characters only speak in Japanese with no translation felt distancing and we only see one short scene of him bonding with his dog he supposedly loves enough to risk everything for.2. Women are an afterthought in this movie. They exist only as a nearly silent assistant (the tragically underused Yoko Ono!), a sexualized trophy wife dog (Nutmeg played by ScarJo), a pregnant dog with no lines, an interpreter with only 1 line of her own dialogue. The only female character with any kind of agency is the white foreign exchange student who is A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH 12 YEAR OLD BOY SHE HAS NEVER MET!3. The story is pretty brutal and realist about death, suffering and euthanasia and animal experiments but it told so flatly and matter of fact that it had no impact for me. Maybe I'm thankful they don't use the music and characters to really pull at your heartstrings since for the first half of the movie I was already questioning why I wanted to sit through a movie with so many dogs being tortured. Pretty bleak stuff. 4. The dialogue and characters have the Wes Anderson autistic flat affect where everything is delivered with the least amount of emotion as possible but taken to the extreme. This made me not really care about the kids or the dog.5. Deux Ex Machina to save the day at the end. The trials and tribulations of the main characters almost had no bearing on the resolution.6. Cats are given a pretty short end of the stick here. They are somehow benignly evil and there was something interesting to be uncovered there but the film just had them as background. I thought it was trying to avoid the cat vs dog cliche...but it didn't. The evil clan are the cat people.7. The had some real potential for dramatic adventure scenes but I never felt worried about the characters despite their head injuries, broken teeth, chewed off ears, missing limbs, etc. I'm usually a sucker for animals in danger but these characters all seemed to have the same personality. 8. I love Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and almost all the rest of the cast but they weren't allowed to really show off their voice acting talents. All the voices blended into one as the dogs were so dead pan. 9. And it did feel pretty white washed to have the cast be primarily white actors with the Japanese actors being untranslated. I wonder if in Japan they will subtitle or dub the dogs.In regards to the supposed political statements the film makes, they seem weak. Now he had set this in a more realistic version of say the Dog Meat Festivals in modern day China or had this be a story more closely analogous to refugees that would have been pretty bold.I can understand people enjoying this film but for me I just didn't understand what it was trying to say and it felt gimmicky and not like a Wes Anderson film. I read somewhere he directed the film in absentia, just emailing his notes for the animators and was pretty hands off for this film (unlike his auteurism on his other films).",

            "content": "It's hard to think how a film could be more \"Wes Anderson\" than Isle of Dogs, a uniquely animated film set in a stereotypical fictional Japan. The story at its heart is simple, but it is told with Anderon's signature style turning it into an unforgettable romp.It's the animation style that really draws you into this. It's not to everyone's taste, and that's understandable. It's more grey than Anderson's normal work (unsurprising for a film set on a trash island) but Anderson is able to find colour in all that bleakness. The characters, mostly dogs, are charismatic and full of life. The environments are depicted in such a unique way that makes them feel colourful despite their greyness. Landscapes are brought to life in delightful 2D, Anderson playing with space in his eccentric way. And of course, there's symmetry, everywhere.There's been a lot of controversy about the depiction of Japan but the intention here is to use the setting to give the film a unique feeling, which it definitely does. Sure, the plot could work in any other country but Wes Anderson chose to set it in Japan and there's nothing wrong with playing on it in an animation clearly not set in the real world. All in all, the depiction of Japanese culture is respectful. One interesting quirk is that the Japanese isn't subtitled, yet it's always so easy to understand the dynamic of a scene. Then there's the way rooms and stickers are labelled in English in a way that really obviously tells you about their function. That would be totally out of place in any kind of film other than this, but here it successfully communicates things to the viewer while generating a few laughs along the way.The characters all have interesting personalities, exaggerated by the goofy animation. Chief, a former stray voiced by Bryan Cranston, goes through the most interesting change throughout the film and many other dogs have interesting personalities too, although the other four of Chief's pack seem to be pretty interchangeable. Human characters are depicted well, the main one being a 12-year-old boy who is a bit cold on the outside but has a good heart. Meanwhile the villains are depicted with hilarious exaggeration, with delightfully insane faces when carrying out their evil plans.The main plot isn't that deep. It could be read as political commentary, but whether it is or isn't, it isn't particularly deep. It's best when simply admired for its eccentricity. Dogs being deported to an island! A flu invented specifically to make people hate dogs more! A dog genocide plan! It's crazy in a self-aware way. In the end though, it isn't the plot that makes Isle of Dogs so entertaining, but the way it's told.",

            "content": "It is no surprise that a Wes Anderson film is good anymore, because let's face it, the guy knows what he's doing.\nWhat I loved most about \"Isle of Dogs\" though, was the script. It is far more insightful than anything that's out there right now, because of the level of CARE that Anderson puts into the story, the characters and their development, and the MESSAGE he wants his audience to take home with them.\nOver the last few years there's been a lack of good writing in the movie industry (specially in Hollywood). This has not been true for TV, though. Although most serious screenwriters have moved onto television, this is not because they earn more money, or they can't get jobs in films, it is simply because TV producers are caring more about the scripts than movie studios.\nRemember when the story mattered? When it wasn't about visual effects or how many screens a distributor could get for your film? Well, for a moment yesterday, \"Isle of Dogs\" transported me to that era. The era of \"Shine\" or \"Jerry Maguire\"... when movies that made money at the box office actually struggled to get a lot of screens, but climbed their way to the top for one simple reason: GOOD STORYTELLING.\nNowadays, good vfx or good advertising have overcome good storytelling. Think about it. Do you really believe that \"Infinity War\" would have been more successful than, say, \"Schindler's List\" back when good storytelling was what made the difference? The more admirable production value \"Infinity War\" has is the gigantic distribution it was given. When you go to the theaters and all you can watch is the new sequel to the Avengers... you'll end up watching that because you have NO MORE CHOICES. But back then, when you actually had options, when your film was screening at the same time than \"The Fugitive\" or \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", it was a BIG DEAL to be number one at the box office, because it meant that your film was most likely, the best film screening at the time, and not the one with more money spent in advertising and distribution. All these new \"infinite sequels\" are doing is spoiling the audience's taste and right to cinematic cultural diversity.\nI'm not saying there shouldn't be any Avengers films. I'm simply saying there should always be more options for our audiences to watch, because, as you all know, once a film is cut out of the theaters, it most likely will never be screened there again. And when exhibitors permit that one film is shown in the vast majority of theaters, that means that a whole lot of good movies are going to be cut out, and people are going to lose a chance to watch them in the big screen.\nImagine if you never got a chance to watch \"Fargo\" in the movie theaters because \"Titanic\" was the only film showing. Imagine not being able to watch \"As good as it gets\" because the distributor for \"Men in Black\" kicked everything else out of the theaters. Thank God that didn't happen back then. Because they are all great films, and should be given a chance to be enjoyed by the audience. But nowadays, it seems that it's all about marketing and making money, and it is not about content anymore. It is not about the stories.\nIf you are a true believer in cinema, and in the power that a good film has to change, not only perspectives, but PEOPLE'S LIVES, then you should definitely watch \"Isle of Dogs.\" If all you care about are sequels and visual effects, and scripts without purpose or message, then this film will probably seem boring to you, but you should give it a chance anyway, because everyone else gives a chance to the movies you like (we mostly don't have a choice anymore.)",

This movie is a marvel to look at. Everything is so meticulously well constructed, every shot so detailed that the only bad thing I can say is that sometimes I longed for a pause button so that I could appreciate all the details he put into all the shots. But it's not only at a cinematography level that his movies work, I would argue that he excels at every aspect of filmmaking, like the use of music and editing to further enhance his vision. But all of this would be for nothing if the movie didn't work on a story level, and here is where some of his movies sometimes fail, but that is not the case here, as I found everything almost perfect with this near future tale of a boy trying to set things right in a world that wants to get rid of dogs.

Finally I managed to get round to watching the film and while it wasn't as good as FMF it was still a great time and another brilliant example of how stop-motion is such an underutilized medium.The story is weird, it's about Japan sending all it's dogs to an island due to an illness, the \"dog flu\", and a boy travelling there to try and find his lost dog. The story is, as I said, weird but nonetheless thoroughly entertaining, every scene is beautifully shot and the voice talent is highly enjoyable with some massive stars being a part of the cast. I will say that as the film is set in Japan some dialogue is in unsubbed Japanese, not huge amounts and not in a way that makes it difficult to understand the story but it does make me wonder if this may turn younger children off of the film. Still for me I though it was great at setting tone and demonstrated how brilliantly Wes could tell portions of the story through nothing but the visuals. The animation here is delightful, very similar in style to Fantastic Mr Fox but different enough that it doesn't feel like the same universe. A brilliant film with very few flaws overall, enjoyable for any age and a breath of fresh air in the genre of children's animation. 8/10.",

It focuses solely on a brief relationship between Chief and Atari, making it a lot more relatable and thus a much more accepted message.This was a movie that felt fun and exciting when dealing with serious issues, a trademark of Wes Anderson's cinema at this point.

            "content": "Wes Anderson is not a cult artist, he's a prolific maestro. His films always enjoy an added cachet that positions them far above many only-entertainment flicks, and his latest classical animated jewel meets perfectly what one would expect from an indie author who has erected his sublime filmography frame by frame. It's neither a blatant cultural appropriation of East Asian culture nor a scurrilous Japanese stereotyped assortment drawn by an injurious foreigner, it's a beautifully hand-made and delicate love story, a widely different, a fertile pic in visible and veiled exclamations on freedom, press, politics, principles, fear, transformation, friendship and human and dog's life which feeds off from a top-of-the-range vocal cast and a visual and technical section as eccentric and neat as every of the narrative ambitions of a filmmaker who not only sets up a baroque addition to his exquisite filmography and artistic growth but imbues this high-concept film, with some complacency, of a razor-sharp, sophisticated allegory that is clearly geared to the grown-up minds, those who resist to consider art as a channel of trivial thoughts, not as a mechanism of inescapable contact and advancement. There's no doubt that for Anderson's style newcomers the first thing they will highlight is tangibility of the pictures. Getting into the multiplex with a pre-established idea about how \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" director works is not helpful to prepare the senses, because it'd be minimizing part of their huge effort, every drop of beauty emerging from the screen is commendable, it's pure marvel. When the screening was over, the up-front reference that arose in my mind was the most recent piece of art of Laika Entertainment, \"Kubo and the Two Strings,\" not precisely by the concordance with the cultural basis or some moral similarities, but by the beautifully crafted creations, by being an invaluable gift for cinema, by the unspeakable visual prowess that hundreds of artists have built for us. The symmetrical compositions of the ever-perfectionist director who refuses to subdue his works under the phenomena of the digital age are straightforwardly glittering; a sharper aim to circumvent known superficialities and immerse it into the complicated, visually speaking, Japanese pulp places this film on a higher level in artistic terms, even unfolding the majority of the action on an adjacent island. Detail transmutes into obsession with the slightest manifestation of sumptuousness; the naturalness in its moves dazzles our perceptions which try to stumble upon a broken sequence, a malicious desire that, obviously, never will come true with Anderson at the helm. There are few human beings walking through the story because the canine leads are the ones who get most of the attention of the art departments; the dog's actions and activities enhance the progress of the plot thanks to the veracity of their behaviors, the domesticated animal par excellence is really here beyond the nearly human behavior given to them. More broadly, what decorates with personality the feast of strangely gorgeous frames is incredible and awardable cinematographer Tristan Oliver, rich in nuances and recesses endowing the pictures with irrepressible force which grows uncontrollably as the film runs, every frame is an authentic, finely crafted and shaped sculpture passing through the hands of hundreds of exquisite animators who with their talent, literally and figuratively, capture the obsessions of an animation maestro; a spellbinding experience. It's worth highlighting the majestic score by the most recent Oscar winner for Best Original Score Alexandre Desplat, who again is running for a golden nomination in the awards. Like Ludwig G\u00f6ransson for Marvel Studios' \"Black Panther,\" he's a composer who knows how to channel well traditional drum sounds and Oriental instruments in which the feature film develops, he mixes them with his own ideas, creating a portentous whole, here, musical accompaniment is vital for the sensory process in the cinematic experience; his score is volatile, energetic and powerful, but at the same time fine, sensitive and adequate, candid and completely exciting. \nAnderson isn't only known for his peculiar and unpractical but extremely gratifying filming method, the textual motives that mobilize such handmade constructions intervene in the success of the narrations. The script is written undeniable by the American director because the characteristics of a concise writer arise, sensitive in a given moment, but coolly manipulative when the film itself requires it. With regard to the dicey, well-intentioned plot, it's conceived by eight hands with own name and recognition: Kunichi Nomura, in his first work as a writer; Jason Schwartzman, in his third experience as a film screenwriter; Roman Coppola, in one of the greatest successes of his career; and Wes Anderson, a man who doesn't need a description, just run and get covered with his artistic visions. The perspective he gives the story is simply unique, social and pleasantly revitalizing not only due to the fussy field of animation but the drama genre lines it uses with an unusual confidence in levels of conviction and coherence with respect to a plot that doesn't set in an explicitly human context, in the strictest sense of the word. The spark of the script gives brilliance to the plot needs and intransigent twists, besides, comedy is handled surgically in the narrative, becoming it a crucial point on the mere fact that the gradual and unexpected humor threads compose and speed up the pace of a non-commercial film, one that does have to defend against other mega-budget opponents. The most unfocused and less determined who attend the multiplex will delight with the elements manufacturing a beautiful surface, however, the most observant and connoisseurs of the filmmaker's style will get out of the theater with a radically different perception, a sharper, more complicated and risky one that touched on polarizing and delicate current problems concerning the whole world. In addition to its frank animalistic message, the script keeps going its critical purpose in every approach it proposes, criticisms that never boss around the characters to get their tasks, but rather they boss around every spectator's intellect to try to play with what it considers to be right and wrong, ironically, expressed through a canine tale. \nGenerally speaking, Anderson delivers an editing style I have never seen before, telling his story in two languages (English and Japanese) and opposing completely to dubbing, he warns with complacency, after the unforgettable opening credits, the way how he will approach the narrative, presenting the rules of the universe he created and you have to accept to get lost in, whether you want or not. The film always gets a way to literally translate most of the foreign dialogue, however, it's here where his filmmaking method comes into play to underline that the most important characters are the animals, the Americanized canines, who capture all their attention and effort. It's also widely appreciated the work done by the incorrigible voices of post-modern American and European acting patrons and matrons- it's not really difficult to hide the disparity between men and women again. - Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Scarlett Johansson or important Oriental exponents such as Yoko Ono, Kunichi Nomura or young player Koyu Rankin perform a dubbing work motivated by dedication, enthusiasm and, of course, the pride of joinig forces with one of the most old-school and perfectionist directors currently working. The excellent vocal cast is undoubtedly one of the strengths and main thrusters for the organic, charismatic and dynamic functioning of the ambitious idea.\n\"Isle of Dogs\" by Wes Anderson mesmerizes from beginning to end, partly by its mania of playing with the high expectations always put on a director's job. Accessible and sophisticated, strategic and human, hilarious and dramatic, strangely beautiful and directed; this animated film is an undeniable love letter from the filmmaker to Oriental culture, canines and, beyond doubt, the recesses and perversities of the feelings, actions and inspirations of humankind; A feature film that produce juicy critical, controversial commentaries through generally opposed elements that are quickly woven on a story led by any manifestation of love, prioritizing narrative, technical and artistic fields with the proportionality only a maestro could handle. If you want to enjoy a good movie you will have many more options to choose from, but if you demand a top-notch film you will be welcome to watch as a stop-motion animation monster puts an actor, screenwriter, producer and director- uninterested in making movies for an Oscar - on the front page, a place he has never gotten out from.",

Isle of Dogs is an artistic vision that requires a very particular talent to construct, using Anderson's mastery of colour palettes to recreate a gritty, unclean world that still holds its charm. The story follows a group of banished canines helping a boy find his own dog, all whilst trying to avoid the extermination of their species. Set in a modern-day Japan (and on an island made exclusively of rubbish), stop-motion gives the film more refinement than you would be able to generate via GCI, enhancing the personal feel of the spectacle.It feels as if Anderson has pored over every frame, secreting hidden details to give the more attentive viewer a rewarding experience. Further to this, the use of authentic Japanese text and speech means the departure from the location isn't too extreme for a largely foreign viewership. Anderson's casts are always exemplary: Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson all lend their voices to various characters, each adding individual quirks to their respective roles. Their animations are all so clean and precise, highlighting the true quality of the animation team.Isle of Dogs caters for virtually any audience, containing elements to entertain adults and younger generations alike. The journey around this fabricate world is a story in itself, making Isle of Dogs a rare example of a film that creates a truly immersive environment, as well as delivering with a quality story.",

It's easy to get caught up in the eye candy, but what is truly revelatory here is the stunning audio that envelops the theatre. Remember all that fuss about surround sound? Well, we finally have proper use, and with several instances - a fabulous drumming sequence, and a haunting dog howling - it is glorious.Oh there's a story as well, which is the usual, meandering vehicle that strings together all the fun bits, and is perhaps the most traditional of Anderson's jaggedy plot lines. Plus it's full of dogs. Superb.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's homage to Japanese film animation certainly has its good points. It's visually elaborate and depicted in alternatingly desolate and pristine landscapes in fictitious places in Japan. The incredible thing about Anderson's work is that even a story about dogs being quarantined on a toxic waste island can seem momentous and even highbrow with his upright, stubbornly eccentric style of filmmaking.Initially, this wasn't quite my speed. I found the film's beginning a bit lacking in its emotional pull even with a fairly thorough backstory about the five dogs who become the pack at the center of the story and a boy who flies to the island where the dogs have been isolated. Fortunately, the film becomes considerably more compelling once it becomes clear what the boy's purpose is and how much he is up against. The plot aspect involving a corrupt, tyrannical mayor of a large fictitious Japanese city is one of the more enjoyable parts of the storyline.I was ultimately able to digest this film because I settled into it and just decided to run with its mad adventure and its dogged (no pun intended) fight against political corruption and anti-democratic practices. The political aspect of the story made this film more fascinating and worthwhile. Having said that, a couple of the human supporting characters are so cardboard and disposable that it might make the viewer regard Trash Island as more a refuge than a prison.My friend who saw this with me described the film as \"too precious\" to connect with (a common criticism that Anderson films sometimes run into) and concluded that it was ultimately \"superficial\" after a promising start. If you're not a Wes Anderson devotee, you might conclude that this film either squanders or redeems itself. In the end, I found it adequate enough to recommend.",

Wes Anderson's strongest selling point is normally his characters and he did not disappoint on this movie either. The voice acting was outstanding all around. Each character had a distinct voice and personality. The back-and-forth character interactions were probably the best part of the movie.Overall I really enjoyed it, but you have to be a Wes Anderson fan. His directing style is very distinct and follows a specific pattern. Isle of Dogs definitely did not break any new ground. His quirky directing style is a plus for me as a fan and the movie was fun all around. I really enjoyed it a 8.25 out of 10.",

It's no surprise artist continue to collaborate with him on projects. It reminded me off how dogs often times display more humanity than we do.

One would think a story so plain would need but one writer, yet we have four, which might explain why the movie is little more than a beautiful animation.No offense, Mr. Anderson, but Roald Dahl wrote better stories, and you're beginning to perfect stop-motion animation, with particular excellence for sushi, explosions, dog fights, and kidney surgeries. What's a bit strange is the relatively small number of types of dogs represented on Trash Island, nearly all of them male dogs, nearly all of them looking something like a terrier.There must be some sort of morality play going on with the legend of cats versus dogs, a beheading, and a link between ecology and disease. Or maybe it's something more current, some message about exiling unwanted animals akin to keeping refugees or immigrants at bay, away from us, hidden from view so we no longer have to deal with them, because they were never human in the first place.The voice acting is as good as you would expect, even with the clever casting of Yoko Ono as Assistant Scientist Yoko Ono, and even better use of F. Murray Abraham and Harvey Keitel. Although I love dogs, Isle of Dogs is not really about dogs at all, is it?",

These scenes also represent the discipline and search of perfection in which most Japanese do every task.The story is easy to comprehend. I didn't like that the original pack of dogs (Rex, Boss, Duke, King and Chief) looses their role as the film moves forward, with the exception of Chief, but that is for Spots to shine. The character of Atari was really ambiguous, sometimes I felt that he was evil as his uncle... maybe all dogs sometimes have that fear for their masters.I personally like the representation of the Japanese culture, but I believe it was exaggerated sometimes. Also, there were too many scenes in Japanese without translation and that made the movie a bit dense.Finall, I loved the reaction of the pack of dogs to the arrival of Atari, as it represents that a dog will never betray their masters, regardless what is done to them.

            "review_title": "Film Review: Isle of Dogs/www.nightfilmreviews.com",
            "content": "Audiences around the world go to see a Wes Anderson film for many reasons; imagination, creativity, wonder and most of all, amazement. A man who has crafted and added to, not only a branch of the film industry within the independent market, but an individual who arguable has his own genre of film, proves with his latest that you are able to make an independent success, commercial darling and fading animation style feature film revolutionary. After eight feature films which enrich the medium as a whole, Wes Anderson delved, for a second time, into the stop-motion foray with his ninth future film, and quite possibly his best yet with Isle of Dogs. You heard the rumours right? About Isle of Dogs? Sure, there are a ton of rumours, controversy and discussions about the auteur director's latest film, both positive and negative (which we will discuss further into this review) including some fun facts that if you say the film's title fast, it's actually the equivalent of saying \"I Love Dogs\", as well as arguments about cultural appropriation, hmmm.The fact of the matter is, first and foremost, Isle of Dogs is a film that pays tribute and homage to so many of the things that Anderson loves and hold very dear to his heart. From his love to canines, to his homages to legendary filmmakers and vanguards Hayao Miyazaki and Akira Kurosawa, to his love of stop-motion animation; Anderson's second venture into stop-motion animation is a film anchored by his passions, as well as a TRUE film for dog-lovers everywhere. DISCLAIMER: NO ACTUAL dogs were harmed during the making of this film-fact!Nevertheless, don't let the animation fool you, Anderson's Dogs is as convoluted a story and themed complexly as any other of his films.A true underdog story, the film follows a young Japanese boy Atari (Koyu Rankin) and his odyssey to save his beloved guard dog Spots (Liev Schreiber), a short-haired Oceanic speckle eared sport hound, who so happened to be the first dog to be sent to Trash Island, a fictional land outside of Japan's fictional Megasaki City twenty years in the future, although the story seems more relevant now than it may in twenty years. Trash Island was sanctioned by Atari's mayoral uncle, Mayor Kobayashi voiced by Anderson collaborator, who also served as one of the screenwriters, Kunichi Nomura. Kobayashi, following an age old dynasty that transgresses from his farthest ancestors, with strong pro-feline beliefs, sets course to sanction a law to deport all dogs to Trash Island, blaming \"snout-fever\" and \"dog-flu\" as an incurable disease for its people, despite two scientists (Ken Wantanabe and Yoko Ono) on the verge of a medical breakthrough with the cure.\"What ever happened to man's best friend?\" indeed becomes one of the driving forces of the film. While Atari steals one of his uncle's jets, the mayor himself Kobayashi, who serves as the boy's ward following his parents tragic death years before, become family members and foes overnight. Questions arise as to why Atari on a quest to save Spots and deliberately chooses to throw his comfortable life away, despite Spots being one-helluva cute dog? It hurriedly becomes apparent that not only was Spots Atari's loyal companion, but the pup also served as Atari's loyal and trusted doggie-gaurd, despite Atari's hesitations at first. Fast forward some time and Atari's crash landing onto Trash Island, a desolate, ugly, grungy and garbage-filled wasteland inhabited only by dogs, populated with the brittle bones of animal carcasses, leftover waste, as well as spoiled and half-eaten food of Japan's Megasaki, the journey becomes a young man's ode to self-discovery and his ultimate moral fibre. Anderson, who so wonderfully, brings to life fantastical worlds in true Wes Anderson-esque fashion, seemingly chooses this story to showcase a very different side of his of his visual, truly allowing garbage, trash and waste to serve as a beautiful and poetic backdrop to his newest canon of films. Adding signatures such as Anderson's symmetrical filming style, the use of pans and deep zooms, and Trash Island as well as the overly-populated Megasaki City fit right in with the rest of Anderson's highly staged universe's. It also becomes quite easy to see that Anderson is also pioneering himself into cinematic prestige; using Isle of Dogs as his Avatar, progressing and improving stop-motion, maturing the visuals of the medium as well as mastering the ways of its presentation, especially comparing it side-by-side to his first venture with the form in The Fantastic Mr.Fox.Once on Trash Island, Atari comes into contact with five courageous dogs who unflinchingly help the young boy; the koy and spoiled celebrity dog King (Bob Balaban), the bumbling team mascot Boss (Bill Murray), the dextrous gossiper Duke (Jeff Goldblum), the rationale Rex (Edward Norton), and of course, the leader of the pact and mangy stray Chief (Bryan Cranston). Together, the six travel to the depths and deep dark corners of Trash Island to find Spots. But like any other ferociously Wes Anderson film, on their way, they encounter a plethora of obstacles, including; a crew of cannibal dogs, some violent, Kobayashi made robotic replacement dogs and other outcasts sentenced to the depths of an unlawful prison. All of these challenges between Atari and his rag-tag bunch of scoundrels push the limits of what they all thought they were capable of, paying special attention to the relationship between Chief and Atari in compassionate fashion.There are many beauties that encapsulates a Wes Anderson film, especially with each and every new entry to add to his exquisite filmography. The director/writer extraordinaire is truly evolving in his craft, experimenting with style, tone, narrative and themes like he has never done before in his earlier work. Sure, it can be argued that Anderson has difficulty with female protagonists and female characters in general, but luckily enough, he never tries to mask this; his confidence with unfolding strong male characters suffering with strong familial mis-steps never miss a beat.Anderson also has this sensible touch to integrate real-world current issues into his films, without ever really spending too much time analyzing or harping extensively on these issues. With the quarantine that all the dogs must face upon being banished to Trash Island, it becomes clear that Anderson's allegory of real life politics, not just American, but worldwide, is being painted on, reflecting the state of these lovable human companions, to the current problems of immigration. Anderson's subtle yet explicit subject matter in Isle of Dogs advances towards his cinematic style, sheding a light and 'throwing-a-bone' to a light-hearted yet extremely relevant subconscious audience that is never ever really acquitted of, but coerced towards enjoying a highly stylized and whimsical feature film experience with real-world issues surfaced.Visually, there is no exception to a Wes Anderson film. Never opting out or showing his films in 3D to gain extra profit, Isle of Dogs is a 2D feature film with NO two-dimensional characters; whether they have a tail or not. While the film itself is an ode to dog-lovers everywhere, its also a human narrative about the perseverance and endurance of the spirit of goodness and selfishness and the labours of love. As Rex points out in the film, Atari is the first human to come to Trash Island to find his dog, hence why the raggedy group of dog misfits agree to help the young boy find Spots, including Chief, even though he has never been with a family or owner long enough to know what love is. As Chief proclaims, \"I am not a violent dog, I don't know why I bite\", it becomes clear that Chief's void for love for humans doesn't stem from hatred, but rather from a lack of affection. Once Chief and Atari begin their journey together and share progressive moments with each other, the narrative truly showcases the wonders of companionship that make all other dog-films seem cliche by comparison.Isle of Dogs is one of the first neat perfect films of 2018, undoubtedly. Right there beside Black Panther, the film is a true testament to the goodness of excelling cultural awareness and showcasing diversity.Yet, the day before the limited release date of the film, beloved and respected film critic Justin Chang wrote a review on Isle of Dogs speaking about the insensitivites of cultural appropriation in the film. While I am in no position to talk about the beauties of the Japanese culture since my ancestry doesn't steam from any parts of Japanese, nor have I ever been to Japan, I can offer my opinions based on the simple fact that I am also a film critic, dog lover, cultural enthusiast and human being. In Chang's review, he speaks about Anderson's 'highly selective, idiosyncratic rendering' of East Asia, as well as a failure of sensitivity. Furthermore, Chang goes on to discuss Anderson's 'weakness for racial stereotyping', deeming Anderson's take of the Japanese culture hurtful and somewhat violating. Other critics, upon Chang's review, have questioned as to why Anderson set the film and Japan, and why certain characters speak Japanese with no subtitles, while the dogs ONLY speak English if they are in fact suppose to be from Japan, and why there is an American translator (Frances McDormand) only for the political segments of Isle of Dogs. Is this all too convenient and superlative to Anderson's story being told?Firstly, it is in my sincerest opinion that, Anderson, who wrote the script of Isle of Dogs, with Japanese actor/writer Kunichi Nomura, as well as Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman, had no intention of the film being cultural insensitive or offensive. Nomura, who is of Japanese decent, had an integral part of the script's fruition, as well as providing the voice of a major character in the film.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson has made quite a name for himself with his unique style of filmmaking, which has been brought to animation once with Fantastic Mr. Fox in 2009. Set in a future Japan, Anderson returns to the world of stop motion with Isle of Dogs. Stop motion animation isn't seen very often in movies anymore, so it's always a treat when it does. The animation is one of the movie's strong suits, with the amount of detail put into the dogs, the backgrounds, and the character animation. Of course, Anderson's famously quirky style is seen here. The animation helps some of these effects, like how some scenes appear to happen on a 2D plane. The distinct Wes Anderson style is also seen in the English dialogue (more on that later), with many jokes and humorous lines delivered in monotonous, deadpan voices. The film is set in Japan in the late 2030s, where dogs have been deported to Trash Island in the fear of spreading disease, and a young boy named Atari seeks to rescue his dog from the island.The movie has a whole host of characters. The main character is Chief, one of the dogs who used to be a stray before being deported to Trash Island. He works alongside several other dogs to help 12-year old Atari find his missing dog. The rest of the dogs, King, Rex, Boss, and Duke, are really more comic reliefs that anything else. On the mainland, there are really too many characters to count. Mayor Koboyashi is the film's main villain, and the uncle of Atari. There's Tracy, an American exchange student who knows something is up with Koboyashi, the scientist, who works on curing the disease that's been infecting the dogs, Nutmeg, a dog who values the relationship between humans and dogs, and many, many more. There are enough characters to the point where it becomes a problem with the movie. The hacker was a Deus ex Machina. What's interesting about this movie is that the human characters speak entirely in Japanese, with no subtitles included. Some of the more vital scenes have an English speaking translator talk, like for a news report. It works, though. Having much of the dialogue in Japanese adds a sense of authenticity to it, given that that's how those characters would really speak.By the way, am I the only one who doesn't find the dogs creepy at all? Everyone online seems to think so.",

Beyond a complex plot, that it's at the same time made light by Anderson as he often does, what's very fascinating is the typical Anderson geometric setting of shots (with also games with split screens and field corrections) unified with a kurosawaian reminiscence that gives to the movie an epic tone, also due to a powerful rhythmic soundtrack, immediately diminished by ironic situations.

We have the tale of dogs shunned by future Japan and exiled to a figurative Hell, the dystopian society of Megasaki led by one who wants to decimate the dog population, and that man's adopted son who journeys to the island to find his long lost guide and friend. Despite having enough material for 3 film plots, Anderson blended them together so intricately that one may just forget, in all the thrills and laughs, how complex the story becomes. Being my first Wes Anderson movie, I can't say much about his style of humor except that for this film, it works. For the characters, I did end up getting confused in Part 4 when it comes to the feud between Kobayashi and Domo, since we didn't get much development of the latter's character enough to understand his view on the dog epidemic. For the rest of the characters, I can say that they fit their purposes in the plot excellently, be they the main characters or the kind who are just slightly more useful than comic reliefs. The blend of stop motion and traditional animation is rather strange, especially when the traditional animation isn't in a more anime style like I would expect for a Japanese setting. That's not to say the animation is disappointing, especially when it pulls off nice effects with stop motion that I would actually compare to Kubo and the Two Strings. The character designs and animation do offer in creativity and do complement the setting well. This is a movie that I am sure most older families would enjoy. If children are able to get past the offensive and violent language, they could take something away from this as well. People who like dogs or futuristic settings would be the most likely to enjoy this movie, but for a general audience, I would overall find this a safe bet for pleasing. A bit confusing, but in a way that puts us in thought. After all, one aspect that makes many animated films great is that they get us to ponder their messages, especially more contemporary ones. For this, there isn't much of a deviance from that, so see it and be prepared to encounter (the good kind of) complexities.",

Ever since my lord and savior, Bryan Cranston, played Hal Wilkerson in the early 2000s American sitcom, Malcom in the Middle,I knew he could turn any trash into treasure. Chief showed me true bravery. After being an active marine for 30 years I thought I knew what bravery was, but boy was I wrong.

Even if it's not easy to describe the atmosphere of his movies, believe me, there is only one like him. He's a true film auteur and an artist, not just a director.If you want to have a clue about his film-making style (but nothing more, since you have to watch his movies to feel it) here are some of his trademarks: a unique colorful scheme that is really bright and uplifting but finds itself in opposition to the mental state of the characters (this creates a comedic effect for me); a certain kind of nostalgia, a childlike feeling floating through the air; a witty, ingenious sense of humor for both older children and adults; children or animals that present a more mature behavior than grown-ups and many other aspects that I'll let you discover.Coming back to ''Isle of Dogs'', his latest future and second animation, I can confirm it has everything listed above and something more. It has several bits of high-quality, fable-like parody of human behavior and character. It's not that he lacks that in his overall work, it's just that here the information and the humor is slightly easier to assimilate and this without ever feeling like lazy-writing (there are a couple clich\u00e9s here and there, but they are handled in a way that doesn't make them seem typical).Another thing that I think he gets right (and even if just partially right) is the cultural element. I don't recall him trying to include another culture in his movies and as a fan I have to say this only added to the bizarreness and exotic character of the movie. There was a sushi scene where I was laughing out loud with my father at the ''sick'' humor of seeing some aquatic beings being chopped while still living (it's not what it seems from my description, just watch it).In the end, I'm awaiting to see Wes Anderson's next feature film, ''The French Dispatch'' and hope I'll be pleasantly surprised once again.A 9,5 out of 10 from me.",

            "content": "'Isle of Dogs' is, with no surprise, directed brilliantly by Anderson, with every shot in the film feeling meticulously crafted. His attention to the characters positioning is more than prevalent here as how each interaction feels highly stylised. The visuals and stop motion animation is truly incredible here with every dog feeling rough, rugged and rich with detail, down to every strain of hair. The lush and smooth camera work is very Anderson-esque, with everything in frame and long panning shots matching the speed of the characters walking. Technically, this film couldn't be more immaculate.Voice talents across the board are great, in particular Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton and Bill Murray who are all spectacular with their voice work. Each of the character designs felt matched to their voice, almost made for the actors. The adventure with Atari and the dogs through trash island is very entertaining, and provides each dog with a distinctive personality, as well as their strong bond with Atari. The pure atmosphere of Megasaki City is wonderful and just presents a lovely aura with each of the scenes involving it, in contrast to trash island, while beautifully crafted, feels grubby and scruffy which is translated fantastically.When a character was speaking in Japanese, there was either subtitles, or Frances McDormand's character as an interpreter who would speak over what was being said into English, and usually drowning out the Japanese language entirely. This was slightly off putting, and would have been an advantage for the film if only subtitles were provided. This as well takes away from the lovely Japanese atmosphere of the film, as well as its cultural nuances. The eventual finale of the film felt a tad rushed, with little leeway given, and in hindsight being slightly forgettable. 'Isle of Dogs' is a stunning piece of stop motion animation with frenetic energy, wonderful atmosphere and delightful characters. Aside from the Japanese monologues drowned out, and the slightly rushed third act, Anderson's craft is strong with this one, as a beautiful work of animation mastery.",

            "content": "If there is a director who knows how to make a great animated movie, it's Wes Anderson. Although he perviously made only one animated movie almost ten years ago which was \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", I remember it being so funny, clever and very well animated that I wanted to see more from him. Now we have another one called \"Isle of Dogs\" and I'll just get this out of the way right now. This is a great movie. Every thing that was so great about \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" has been stepped up big time in this movie with a very clever and charming story, brilliant and flowing stop motion animation and characters that are made memorable due to their brilliant voice over work from a wide cast of Oscar nominated actors. Before we get into why you should go out of your way in see this movie, here's my brief plot synopsis.In the country of Japan not to far in the future, a dog flu has begun to spread throughout the community. Wanting to protect the citizens of Megasaki City, the corrupt Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura) issues an order to banish all canines onto a trash island away from the country with the first dog to be banished being his nephew's guard dog Spots (Liev Schreiber). In a matter of six months, the young nephew named Atari (Koyu Rankin) decides to rescue his dog by stealing an airplane and crashes on the island. There he meets five dogs, four of whom use to belong to masters and one a stray. While the four named Rex (Edward Norton), Boss (Bill Murray), Duke (Jeff Goldblum) and King (Bob Balaban) are willing to help, the stray named Chief (Bryan Cranston) is initially reluctant due to his prejudice against humans. The six then set off on a journey to find the lost dog traveling through many abandoned areas along the way. Back on the main land, an American exchange student named Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig) has begun to suspect that a conspiracy is ongoing a proceeds to investigate while coming across details involving a group of scientists (Kunichi Nomura and Yoko Ono). I could list more details like say what other fantastic actors are in this movie, but I dare not spoil anything.Throughout my viewing of the movie, I was marveled by the immersive work that Anderson and his team put in this film. The story created by him, Jason Schwartzman, Roman Coppola, and Kunichi Nomura was very original and clever. Similar to \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", the screenplay written by Anderson was top notch quality with the dialogue being very smart and clever. Though unlike the former, this film doesn't hold back on the cussing as the characters actually fully on say the words without having it being replaced with the word \"cuss\". As for the animation, it's also fantastic. The movement of the characters as well as the human designs have really been improved from \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" and I really have got to appreciate the style that Anderson puts into the visuals. He claims to have been inspired by the work of Akira Kurosawa and the holiday Rankin-Bass specials (both of which were made in Japan) for this film and it clearly shows though it isn't without his typical trademarks like his symmetry framing and quirky dialogue. As for the characters, I really liked how captivating they are. You can tell that the actors in this film were allowed to be themselves and were able to put what makes them charming in real life into their performances. Bryan Cranston in particular was a highlight. He was able to sell the character of Chief starting off as very unlikeable and then develop into a likable character by the end of movie which is something that I love seeing movies do. Even the score by recent Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat was once again fantastic and helped impact the story like great scores do. I don't think I have any complaints for this movie. It's that good.If you love movies, go support \"Isle of Dogs\". This is something that people who love movies should see with it's intruding story, beautiful animation and captivating characters. This is a film that was well worth the wait. I'm glad I saw it, and I'm certainly looking forward to seeing it in the near future.P.S. Also, I really got to thank a few of my friends for convincing their manager at the movie theater they showed the film in for screening it there. Had they not, I would have been forced to see it an hour away from where I live.",

It's slowly being released to theaters nationwide and I finally got to see it alongside some friends of mine. It's about a boy named Atari Kobayashi who hijacks a plane and heads to Trash Island, which now acts as an island that is inhabited by the exiled dogs of Japan. While there, he encounters a pack of dogs lead by a stray and journeys with them to find his dog Spots.One of Isle of Dogs' biggest strengths for me is that the movie works off the generic \"adventure to find something\" movie. There are so many movies with this premise, and Isle of Dogs works off of it by exploring the lore and the world as it goes on. It explains the dog epidemic, what's being done about it and the perspectives of both the opposers and supporters of Mayor Kobayashi's decision of exiling the dogs.Speaking of which, this movie does have a lot of political commentary surrounding it. I don't wanna get into spoilers, but all I can say is that it tackles topics like censorship, political opposition and exilation. For the most part, they're done very well.The Japanese people in here all speak their native language, and they don't use subtitles to translate the dialogue. Instead, they use Interpreter Nelson voiced by Frances McDormand as the translator...some of the time. It uses her to translate Mayor Kobayashi's dialogue but virtually nobody else's. Elsewhere, we don't have any idea what they say. While most people may have a problem with it, I found this an interesting choice since it relies on show, don't tell if you're not a Japanese speaker.The visuals are obviously gorgeous, not to mention painstakingly handmade. From the faces, to the fur on the dogs and even the backgrounds, the team behind the animation process made sure to put in every little detail into the animation. The voice acting was also perfect; I couldn't think of any bad performance in here. Finally, the musical score really helped deliver the tone and tension of the story, and what's interesting is that they mostly consist of drums.If I could point to an aspect of the film that could've been better, it would have to be the pacing. To me, the movie movies too fast at times, and it gives less time for plot development and for us, the viewers to sink in the moment. I feel like if the time had been dragged on for a few more minutes, then that would solve that issue.Isle of Dogs is another fantastic Wes Anderson movie that brings out great storytelling, thought-provoking political commentary and gorgeous animation. I suggest giving this a watch if you're a fan of Anderson's work, a fan of stop-motion or a fan of movies in general.9/10P.S. Try saying Isle of Dogs fast, it sounds like you're saying I love dogs.

The animation is truly amazing and I am blow away by how well Anderson can block and stage scenes in the stop motion style. This film looks beautiful start to finish and is a treat to watch for that. The voice cast is also pretty interesting as it made up mostly of well known actors with recognisable voices playing to their public image. Every word said be Goldblum or Murray especially feels exactly like what you would expect real word Goldblum and Murray to say. My only real criticism is that despite being really charming, this movie does not make a lick of sense and fails to build a solid word with it's own internal logic for this story. I found myself often taken out of the film when something would happen that just didn't add up, I guess with this being more of a family film it doesn't matter too much and there is enough to enjoy without thinking too hard about the plot.

If you like Wes Anderson's genre, you certainly will enjoy Isle of Dogs. For someone like myself, who never truly understood the Wes Anderson hype, it was an enjoyable movie. It's corny jokes made me laugh, and the way dogs acted like humans (but still acted like dogs) kept a grin on my face. The way I would describe how dogs acted in this film resembles how Brian from Family Guy does, doing things only humans do, but at the same time would chase a squirrel. Another technique used in the film which I was able to appreciate, was how instead of everyone speaking English the whole time, Wes Anderson chose to have the film take place in a non-English speaking country (Japan), and lack subtitles, in order for us to connect more with the dogs (who spoke English) than the humans. The only flaw this resulted in was that it prevented us from seeing much depth in the big human characters. I however do appreciate that this tactic shows us how much you can get out of a foreign language speaker just from their tone of voice.\n \n Another complaint I have is that this movie really is only for people who love dogs. I'm even hearing people calling the movie \"I Love Dogs\" (say Isle of Dogs out loud if you don't get it), which really does say something about the movie's fanbase. For one, I hate cats, and I mean \"I hate them!\" (<--Know what I'm quoting?) If the movie were Isle of Cats I would have left the theater afterwards complaining about how awful it was (I know that's kind of biased, but this movie was quite literally all about dogs, so if you dislike dogs you probably will be bored). In conclusion, if you are a Wes Anderson fan, totally see this movie, you'll eat it up (especially if you love dogs). If you don't love Wes Anderson, you definitely can enjoy it, but you won't be referring back to it in the future.",

            "content": "'Isle of Dogs' is going to most readily be compared to 2009's 'Fantastic Mr. Fox', Wes Anderson's first stop motion picture, and given that the former is Anderson's second time trying his hand at stop motion, one would expect both the technical and artistic aspects of the film to be of greater sophistication. Simply put, Anderson succeeds on both fronts.Setting the film abroad in Japan poses numerous language and translation issues that have to be addressed throughout the film, and Anderson nimbly uses it to his advantage. Furthermore, each of the dogs is given a meaningful amount of depth and characterization. That being said, there were a handful of times I felt my attention drifting throughout the movie, and I found myself less emotionally invested in the plight of the characters as the film went on. In the end, Anderson has brought to us another prototypical Wes Anderson film, a unique combination of his particular form and function that we've come to know and enjoy, so while I certainly recommend seeing the film, I think it would really take being a dog lover to really love this movie.",

It comes with all the quirks and distinctive style we've come to expect from him, and it works on an amazing level. The most amazing thing about this film are the visuals. Everything is meticulously crafted and done in such a way that you can't look away from the screen. The movements of all the characters along with the settings look spectacular, and the stop-motion style animation only makes it more pleasing to watch. All the visuals cleatly had an immense amount of work poured into them, and it definitely paid off. The dialogue is just as witty and entertaining as any other Wes Anderson movie, and most of the characters are perfectly-cast. Although the story is simplisitc, it doesn't really negatively affect the movie because everything else is done in such a fantastic manner. The cinemotography is just as aesthetically pleasing as any other Wes Anderson movie, with plenty of symmetrical shots. The score by Alexandre Desplat is also incredible, as it fits the tone and feeling of the movie very well. On occasion, some Japansese characters speak Japanese without subtitles, although simply a personal preferance, that would be my only criticism of the film. Overall, this film is incredibly enjoyable and well-made, and it is a must-watch for everyone. If you love filmmaking as an artform, this is the movie for you. Go and watch it.",

Unfortunately, probably extremely few audience can recognize any of those actors doing the dub (partially due to heavy dramatization). Visually, on the other hand, all characters in the movie DO NOT resemble those actors' look or whatsoever, either. Hence my question: what's the point maneuvering such a great cast (including 85-or-so-years-old Lennon widow Ono) if no one sees those actors' face or acknowledges those actors' voice?There are more ill-logical issues in terms of production design. ISLE OF DOGS (2018) is meant to be a cultural hybrid. That's great. But the improper subtitles, or the lack of it, and tiny notes/markings on the screen make the viewing tiresome. The speed of some dialogue in Japanese is too fast for English audience, while some dialogue in English is too fast for Japanese audience.Well, IOD comes from Hollywood. Powerful guys there can play the game any way they want. IOD has the potential to earn 8 or even more stars from me. It's a pity that silver screen magnets are having fun while earning big bucks, but we the movie-goers are actually like stray dogs on the island consuming whatever given to us.",

            "review_title": "An unconventional children's film, but it's Wes Anderson so what did you expect?",
            "content": "Wes Anderson is probably, along with Spike Jonze, one of those directors that has such an extreme style that you know that when they have a new movie out you have no idea what it'll be like - just that you'll want to see it and you'll almost certainly like it.I really enjoyed The Fantastic Mr Fox and The Grand Budapest Hotel, and so for this I was interested for an angular, interesting take on the idea of the children's film. The dog angle also played a big part of my anticipation in the film, as I have had 4 dogs in the course of my life, and view them as my best friends in a way.The big thing about this film, much like other Anderson films is that there is no shying away from the fact that the animals in this film do suffer some harm. Bizarrely enough, despite there being instances in the film relating to suicide, cannibalism, starvation and - in a way - genocide relating to the dogs, the kids in my audience had zero issue with it. It was a \"think of the children\" moment that the children didn't care about, because within the context of the story, it functions perfectly for the narrative.Speaking of narrative, this film has a deeply tangent storyline, in which we follow the dogs on the Isle, specifically Rex, Chief and Spots, voiced respectively by Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston and Live Schieber. Then there's the attempts by Atari, voiced by Japanese actor Koyu Rankin, to rescue Spots and fly a prop plane to the Isle to do so, and also the similar endeavours of American exchange student Tracey, voiced by Greta Gerwig. The film is also told in an untraditional 5 act structure, which frequent flashbacks, stories retold from an altered perspective, and everything to make this an unconventional movie. The voice acting is a standout of the movie, with those names I've mentioned being real standouts, in particular Cranston, who does well with his tough guy stray persona that evolves into a softer, more caring character throughout, and Norton who delivers a side to acting we haven't seen before: delivering heavy, expositional, big dialogue in a rapid fire humorous fashion. Also shoutout to a small part voiced by Scarlett Johannson as a love interest for Chief, who provides a soothing quality akin to her voice role in Spike Jonze's film Her.The film's mystery and thriller elements are accessible to both older and younger audiences, and do make this, along with Kubo and The Two Strings, a film that would both test and extend the tastes of younger audiences. It certainly does merge into an element to the film I want to talk about with regard to how it is portrayed - the portrayal of the Japanese culture, and the \"white saviour\" character of Tracey. First and foremost, something cool about this film is that whenever there is a dialogue not in English, it isn't subtitled - really, only the credits have both the English and Japanese equivalents - and this is acknowledged: \"Man, I wish someone spoke his language\", among other things are said, and a healthy amount of visual storytelling is used. Secondly, the idea that Tracey is a white saviour is fairly misplaced, as whilst she does uncover a deeper mystery run by the Kobayashi government (itself, a callback to the Japanese coffee cup brand, and the alias used by Keyzer Soze's lawyer in The Usual Suspects, great touch) her findings are largely ineffective until Atari (another piece of Asian business and culture used sweetly and amusingly) gets involved. In fact, her involvement is entirely triggered by Atari's engaging in his quest.What we're viewing here is tantamount to healthy cultural, and bi-cultural conversation. It's not offensive, nor inoffensive, it's an integral part of a film I very highly rate and recommend. Oh, one last thing - Isle of Dogs, if said quickly, sounds very similar to \"I Love Dogs\". Again, really nice detail.",

It has a quality and creativity like no other of its type particularily because of the excellent animation it has, and the fact that it was filmed I think like 5 seconds per week makes it even more impressive.And the style of Wes Anderson is intact. Along with the script, the film portraits a scenario that, altough tragic and unfair for dogs and their lovers, it is full of heart and highly humorous situations in a way that only he can make. The strong soundtrack by the great Alexandre Desplat perfectly fits with what we are watching.The voice cast was great too. My personal favourites were Bryan Cranston, Scarlett Johansson and Edward Norton, but I think that everyone in the cast did a really good job. But of course, he who knows some of the work of Wes Anderson also knows that the cast of most of his movies is composed only by great actors.Overall, this is a great movie that probably is not for everyone, but if you're into realistic animated films that show you the world as it is, or as it will be, then enough said, this movie is for you. I think it completely deserves the Oscar for best animated feature next year. Parents, if you are thinking about taking your kids to watch this movie, please have in mind that this is a PG-13 rated movie that isn't really intended for children as there's a complex, dark and sometimes scary tone in it.Thanks for reading!",

This film may not recoup its production cost, so this level of dedication (I've visited most prefectures in Japan except the north) was a real treat to Japanese culture and animation fans.The group dynamics among the main dog characters who have been abandoned on the island were both hilarious and poignant satires about social inequality, isolation, public paranoia, scientific ethics, corruption, and urban pollution.

            "content": "Wes Anderson is a filmmaker that is very divisive. Some of his films are brilliantly written and have such a unique style that further analysis of his films are inevitable. This goes in particular for his recent film before Isle of Dogs, The Grand Budapest Hotel. Isle of Dogs is another stop motion animated film in the same vein as Fantastic Mr Fox. However the animation of Isle of Dogs makes Fantastic Mr Fox look like a mockbuster. In a futuristic Japanese city called Megasaki, dogs have been abandoned to a nearby island because of the viruses they carry that may perhaps infect humans. When one day a little boy named Atari lands on the island, he and a pack of dogs supposedly ran by Chief (Bryan Cranston) set out to find Atari's best friend Spots (Liev Schreiber). The film boasts an incredible ensemble cast, like many of Wes Anderson's films. The pack of dogs are voiced by the talented Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray and Jeff Goldblum. The rest of the cast also includes the talents of Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Yoko Ono, Tilda Swinton and Ken Watanabe. All these actors do fantastic jobs in adding character to each of their animated counterparts. Voice acting is a tough job because the actor has to add emotion using only his or her voice. Luckily everyone exceeds in this brilliantly, especially Bryan Cranston. He adds a grumpy personality that gives him a lot of authority, he stood out very well among all the other incredibly talented actors. Like most other Wes Anderson projects this film is hard to get into, the audience must be ready to watch a film like this. This goes especially for this, families might walk into this film expecting a nice family film, I will warn them right away, this is not a kids film. Children can certainly watch it (its rated PG), there is nothing overly gory, sexual or offensive about it. However most of the human characters speak Japanese (as the film is set there). There are no subtitles provided, either the dialogue is translated by someone or the importance of the scene is portrayed through visual storytelling. This certainly won't be too difficult to adults, however I can see kids struggling with that. There are also some very great parallels to totalitarian government and to things such as the holocaust. There is some definite deeper meaning to this film. The animation is as I mentioned before, spectacular. This is some of the best I have ever seen. The stop motion adds so much detail that it is honestly seamless, it adds a specific style, however never is there a scene where I went, that looks animated. Of course this being a Wes Anderson film, there will also be some criticism. I will also add that one particular character voiced by Gerwig felt slightly off, she didn't add much to the overall story and slowed the interesting aspects down. Overall there is not much to complain about for me. My most important recommendation is that you need to know what kind of a film this is. You need to be in the mood for this picture and not expect a harmless family adventure. However I can assure you at the end, if you love dogs, you wanna simply go home and cuddle it for hours.",

The voice cast is brilliant but the stand outs are defiantly Cranston and the narrator Courtney B. Vance (The Hunt for Red October) who delivered his lines with elegance. Finally, I loved the score by Alexandre Desplat (The King's Speech), but most importantly I loved the way Anderson and Desplat incorporated the music from one of my favorite films Seven Samurai (1954).In my opinion Isle of dogs is one of, if not the best films of the year.10/10",

Isle of dogs. his newest film, is undoubtedly an entertaining film, it's stop motion style is welcomed after a long drought since Kubo. The landscape is vivid and surreal. Dialogue snappy and stylish like all his other films.But watching the film, I couldn't help perceive a detachment between me and the film. That could entirely be me, but I felt that the characters weren't convincing enough. Most of them were one-dimensional, to serve the plot or to provide a quick remark there and now. Moreover, there are many characters and some of them do not even complete their arcs and even discarded in the end without resolution. This might be a byproduct of the ambition of the film to capture an adventure film with various plotlines, yet Wes Anderson had shown he could do it before. While the film is in no measure terrible, it had been caught in a more mainstream narrative of saving the day. One we have seen multiple times before.If this is your first Wes Anderson film I suggest you watch the Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel as I believe those are better substitutes.",

            "content": "A 12-year-old Japanese boy, with the assistance of a small group from the local canine population, journeys across a barren landscape in search of his beloved dog, Spots.A helpful opening title card explains that the Japanese characters in Isle of Dogs speak Japanese (mostly) untranslated, while the dogs' barks have been generously translated into English. The film keeps its promise - the only time a Japanese character's dialogue is spoken in English is when they're on TV with a translator - which means that some parts go over our heads as they do the dogs' (since an Alsatian can't understand Japanese either), but never enough that the audience is alienated or lose track of what's going on. Sadly, there's little to the story - travel here, get some advice, travel there - but the way the script reveals the pasts of the dogs, the 'little pilot' named Atari and the island means there's always something going on to keep your attention, although people who don't like slower films will be fighting off their heavy eyelids (at 102 minutes, this is the second longest stop-motion film ever made).The animation, as you would expect from Wes Anderson, is charming and endearing to the eye much like his last venture into Ray Harryhausen's domain, Fantastic Mr. Fox. However this isn't an especially pretty film; the harsh landscape of an island made almost exclusively from refuse isn't one that lends kindly to Anderson's trademark cutesy style and perfectly centred simplistic shots, though he certainly tries. Instead the charm comes from the doubtless talents of the animators in giving the dogs individual and collective personalities, while the cast of voice actors aids their efforts.The biggest disappointment (not that there are any others worth mentioning) is that the ending is one of those that just happens because 'reasons'; it washes over you and the entire status quo is flipped on its head without being entirely sure why. Isle of Dogs leaves you with lasting messages of the dangers of misinformation, the perils of unflinching obedience to authority, and that man's best friends are bloody awesome - after all, the title itself when spoken makes the person admit their love of dogs!Best Quote: (in Bill Murray's voice) \"I was the lead mascot for an undefeated high school baseball team. I lost all my spirit ... I'm depressing.\"",

The plot isn't much; it's there to frame the satire, which is rather heavier than W S Gilbert's. The list of famous voices may seem a bit much, but on occasion there's a real shock in hearing a familiar voice with a different face. The soundtrack is often inventive and dramatic -- and with more African-sounding material than in Black Panther. Won't go on my favorites list, but it was fun.",

            "content": "My ExpectationI had seen Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums and then his stop motion film Fantastic Mr. Fox, and I wan already into the movie watching the trailer. My hopes were really high considering it stared Bryan Cranston and Scarlett Johansson too, and was set in Japan (my top place to visit). So I had pretty much good expectations which were fulfilled from the movie. I wish I had seen it on a big screen though, instead of the flight.My ReviewFirst of all, the visual component of the movie is something especially new and crafted. One can find the typical Wes-Anderson style of stop motion animation and color effects, but the overall rough look of the characters with vivid colors lends it a completely different air compared to a Disney movie.Another notable thing about the movie is its background score. The score with colorful music and pronounced Asian tones and Japanese drums beating lends the movie a magical touch. The visual accompanied with the music makes the movie in itself something to watch and remember. Its an experience.Coming to the story, it's a new story and not easily predictable. The story has its ups and downs, and at a few places does get a little annoyingly slow, but overall the tone visual and music help carry it through those low moments. However the story is presented in a very smooth, fresh and unique way which never let there be a dull moment in the movie.Another great feature is that the Japanese dialogues are all in Japanese and haven't been translated. Only the important dialogues are either said in English or have subtitles. The dogs speak amongst each other in Russian but their dialogues are shown in English just for our benefit. So this uniqueness of retaining the language make it a more unique and absorbing experience.That said, the strongest thing (Aside from the animation) about this film is its subtle message it attempts to strike. This film is one about companionship and love, which is a feeling that often goes hand-in-paw with the subject of dogs and pets. If you have ever been a dog owner, this film WILL strike a chord with you, as it has some very important things to say about our relationship with them that I think often goes understated.Dogs are a connection. Dogs are a beacon of loyalty and family. \"Dogs\" don't need to be dogs. Dogs are man's best friend.How could you not love dogs?How could you not love a Wes Anderson film ABOUT dogs?",

            "content": "The animation is not bad at all, it is the only positive point that can be found in this film. The scenario is predictable as hell and the fact that the story takes place in Japan brings nothing to the film but racist stereotypes about Japanese and Asian people in general, white saviorism (stinking of colonialism and American imperialism) and cultural appropriation, all sprinkled with a bit of sexism. The film is also outrageously speciesist while it is supposed to take the defense of dogs...\nNow, here are the spoilers to illustrate what I am saying.\nIn this movie, Japanese culture is reduced to samurai, sumo, sushi and wasabi sauce (the poison used to murder a 'pro-dog' scientist and to exterminate dogs is the 'Wasabi Poison'...). In addition, the Japanese main characters are either completely hysterical corrupt politicians, or too stupid / soft to organize their resistance without the help of the white American student (color blind bonus: white blonde with an afro cut...). The white American woman speaks loudly for everyone to hear, while the little Japanese people are discreet and only serve as Japanese tokens (whenever there is a talk with important claims, it is she who is in the center of the image and who uses the megaphone, yes it is really painful to watch). A scene particularly representative of the racist violence of this film: the white American violently shakes a Japanese scientist, screaming at her, while she is mourning. It embodies the various racist stereotypes and domination relations that this film promotes: Americans who know what is good and take what they need by force, respectful discreet Japanese who let themselves be violated without retaliating (when we have in mind what Americans did to Japanese, it is an even more violent image...). The only important female character is the white savior and I wonder if it is not to better pass the pill of all the violence she symbolizes. The other female characters are bitches (literally, female dogs) completely useless to the scenario. In addition, Wes Anderson has chosen to make Japanese people speak Japanese without subtitling them so the only people we understand are the white American and the dogs who speak English, which makes Japanese people even more strange and incomprehensible to the audience.\nIn terms of speciesism, we are also served. In an imaginary Japan, Japanese people have an unexplained hatred for dogs while they love cats. The evil Japanese politician with the support of his degenerate barbarian people decides to get rid of all dogs by sending them on an island - open garbage dumpster. Then, one might think that they will question the status of human mastership and rebel. But the only character who could have led the revolt against human domination is a stray dog who will eventually become a bodyguard dog for a politician... Humans remain masters and dogs remain nice servile little doggies.\nWe are in 2018, this kind of film is still praised by the public and its director is glorified as a creative genius.",

The work that went behind the stop-motion is admirable and quite finely detailed too but when it comes to draw the emotions out from the screen, it isn't utterly adequate. The writing is strong, witty and fast paced (especially in its first act) which should have come off in its favor, but due to multiple characters and their sub-plots that it has to cover in such short runtime (around 100 minutes), there is very little space for the audience to breathe in. Wes Anderson's world is definitely different than its usual features and the irony in here is that, \"this\" is a simpler and asymmetrical one . A decent job on giving the voice by the star cast to these eerie characters and so was the choice on casting them. Isle Of Dogs is an intriguing feature to encounter where the execution is genuinely effective and lures you in within few minutes making the audience work for it and sweeps away its runtime like a charm but the only thing that itches you throughout the course is the writing which unfortunately isn't as convoluted as the makers think.",

            "content": "On Saturday I went to go see my first Wes Anderson film, and I really enjoyed it. Isle of Dogs is a lighthearted animated comedy film that doesn't require too much brain power and keeps you entertained the whole way through. While the comedy may have been well timed, at best it was a hit or miss. This was made up for with a great score and overall good design.The first thing I'd love to talk about is the music. This, I enjoyed most about Isle of Dogs. The Japanese-inspired score of deep drums opens and closes the film, while also complementing it throughout. It's expertly timed with both the comedy and general story of the movie so one can, at certain points, simply sit back and melt into the grove of the film.There wasn't much I didn't like about the design in Isle of Dogs, and a lot I did. My main complaint is there is an excessive use of crying in the film. While I have no problem with emotions or anything of the like being put anywhere, the animated effect they used for the tears was first fascinating but quickly irksome. Otherwise, the characters, sets and editing in the film all added up perfectly. Greta Gerwig as Tracy Walker was certainly my favorite character but all the dog characters certainly deserve great praise for their design and voice work.Thematically and comedically, the film has a mixed performance. The comedy was at times funny and at others simply fell flat. I did however appreciate the tone of the film. Never does this film ask to be taken seriously, nor does it ever ask the viewer to take its very seriously flawed logic into account. The film simply just is how it is. This, combined with a great soundtrack, good acting and set design made for great viewing. The story itself has decent themes but overall I found it to be necessarily hollow.Overall, I'd day the film is a perfect one for an easy night where you just want to sit back and enjoy. The film has depth, but to a large degree is simply consumable at a surface level. Go and check it out, 8/10.",

It came out in the first of what would be two years of amazing animated features, and lost its nominations to Pixar's first Best Picture nominee, \"Up.\" While most critics looked favourably on \"Fox,\" what with it gaining a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, it flopped at the box office, earning a measly $46.5M on a budget of $40M. That, and despite its praise, \"Fox\" fell into a more cult classic pile of animated films, like most of its stop motion comrades, and indie films such as \"The Secret of Kells,\" which was released the same year. I, for one, was one of the few that preferred Anderson's take on Roald Dahl's book more than \"Up\" (which I love, but not nearly as much). Even though it strayed from the source material, it still kept with the quirky storytelling and wistful nature of the book, and was funny, relatable and gorgeously animated. Needless to say, when Anderson announced that he was working on another animated film, about my favourite animal, I was excited. \n\"Isle of Dogs\" may not be as colourful as \"Fox,\" but it's still jovial despite its sombre story and messages. It takes place in the distant future, in Megasaki City, Uni Prefecture in Japan. The corrupt Mayor Kobyashi has all the city's dogs exiled to Trash Island due to outbreaks of Snout Fever and Dog Flu, which has started to spread to humans. The first dog to be sent away is Spots, the body-guard dog of Mayor Kobayashi's distant nephew and ward, Atari. Six months later, Atari flies a dinky little plane to Trash Island, where he enlists the help of a group of former pets, and one stray, to help him find his best friend.\nI loved this movie. I loved the characters, the animation and the overall look and feel of the film. I like the way the story was told. It isn't perfect, but I had a huge smile on my face at the climax, and I didn't want the film to end. There's something inherently special about this film. There is so much passion and effort put into every minute detail, that too many may go unnoticed. When Jeff Goldblum makes his characteristic \"uh\" (\"uh, you heard the rumour, right; about her and Felix?\"), they took the time to animate the very thing that the actor is known for. The sneezes are composed of cotton wool and sugar. Each bit of hair (Alpaca, by the way) was attached to the puppets one by one. The fur moves so realistically that it's both mesmerizing and disconcerting in the most glorious way possible. Each shot, each movement, each camera angle ads so much verve and pop to what is basically a film set in a dump. The anatomy of the dogs, the way they move, is spot on (there is only one scene that made me go \"uhm?\" but it was an aerial shot of Chief running, and one or two little quirks only ads to a film that breathes individuality). This film is gorgeous. I'm partial to the stop motion films where you can be both immersed in the world, and sense the work the very touch of human hands helped create. \nThe story, at a glance, is rather predictable. However, much like \"How to Train Your Dragon\" and \"Coco\" the filmmakers manage to elevate the story so that the familiar story beats feel energized and new. While it is an A to Z search party plot, the film sports an interesting commentary on the corruption of society by higher power, the fear of the Other and the use of innocence to slap authority in the face. Some people will see this as a nod to immigration, others to snobbish politicians, and some will see it as a fun romp with five dogs and a boy. Fun, you say? The plot sounds grim; it's about dogs fighting to stay alive. It is grim, and harkens back to a similar film from 1982, \"The Plague Dogs.\" In Rosen's animated feature, based on Richard Adams' book, two dogs must fend for themselves after escaping a vivisection lab, while avoiding capture from authorities who think they have the plague. The difference here is that the equally fantastic 80s film holds little humour, save from the Geordie fox. Anderson's film is peppered with tongue in cheek dialogue (\"I'm fetching it because I feel sorry for you,\" \"I wish somebody spoke his language\"), an ironic sense of cheerfulness and, of course, dog jokes (\"you son of a bitch!\") From the dogs talking about their favourite food, to Oracle thinking she's psychic (\"she just understands television\"), to the dark humour, there's so much joy and verve in what can be considered so bleak. This is a film where the characters talk about suicidal ideation, where one pro dog person is murdered, and where many dogs cry salty tears over missing their owners, or having to eat their friends, and yet it feels so jovial and bright. This is all thanks to the witty dialogue and fantastic acting. The film knows it's serious, but can have fun with itself. It's refreshing, and breathtakingly authentic.\nSome have taken issue with the Japanese elements of the feature, such as the use of mushroom clouds, wasabi as a weapon and implementing Haiku as a narrative device. While I can see how this will bother some people, as a random European person who just wanted to see a good film, I wasn't bothered by the nudges towards Japanese culture. In fact, it felt more like a tribute to Japan than anything else. The Japanese characters speak in their native tongue, with no subtitles save for a few occasions, and are voiced by Japanese actors and actresses. One of the writers, who also voices the mayor, is Japanese. It feels more like a friendly nudge-nudge than slander, as if Anderson is toasting to an old friend. \nTo touch again on the use of Japanese language, some have also criticised how it was often left untranslated (save for scenes with an interpreter), saying that it removed part of the human's character, and left them unrelatable to the audience. That and it silenced Japanese people. I fervently disagree, but I do see the point some are making. Much like YMS, I would like to experience the entirety of a film I adored, and wouldn't mind if there was an option to watch the film with the Japanese language subtitled on the Blu-Ray. However, I feel that this may remove some of the artistic value and over all vibe of the film. I liked not completely understanding the humans; the focus was on one human and a group of dogs. Said human is a twelve year old boy, and children need not speak much to be understood. Somehow, the intuitive knowledge of the dogs and the boy's understanding of them was enough for me. \nThis leads unto the characters. I adored them. The dogs are all so likable and scruffy, each with their own personalities that is their own, but still infused with the actors that voiced them. Each quirk was endearing, even Duke's running gag, which I taught I'd tire from, but ended up laughing at when he did it yet another time (\"uh, did you hear the rumour?\") Each dog is just lovely. Atari, the boy, is likable and tenacious. However, the main character here is Chief, the ragamuffin Tramp of the pack who has never had an owner, and fervently distrusts humans, stating that \"he bites.\" From the scene where we see all the dogs sitting before Atari, but Chief lying down, we know that the two will form a bond. Predictable? Yes, but the unfolding of events and how they are handled makes the bond seem very amiable. The only issue I had in regards the characters is with Tracy and Spots. I can't go into Spots, due to spoiler reasons, but let's just say that I felt that he really was a \"son of a bitch.\" Tracy just seemed gratuitous to me; it seemed as if Anderson felt the need to have a saviour, when we already had ones in Atari and the dogs. I didn't hate her character or plot line, but I did feel that if she were removed, it would make no difference. The dogs and Atari were more than enough to carry the plot forward.\nDespite my minor gripes, I found \"Isle of Dogs\" to be absolutely fantastic. I said when it was over; \"I think this is one of my new favourite films.\" There's an odd, quintessential charm that makes it infectiously likable. This film is a very good boy.",

Following in the future where dogs are banned for having a disease and a little boy sneaks out to find his lost dog that is on Trash Island which is renamed to Isle of Dogs. Wes Anderson wrote and directed this amazing film about trust, leadership, corruptness, love, and friendship flawlessly with it's various morals and fantastically smart dialogue woven into this breathtaking film. First the stop motion in this film is some of the best stop motion I've ever seen in my life, I thought Tim Burton's stop motion effects were good but this takes the cake as the best stop motion to ever exist in a film. With it's brilliant direction as well and Anderson putting his signature spin on it his direct center focus and simplistic but super effective filming style makes the film easy to watch and easy to understand. And with the various use of english and Japanese dialogue throughout the film it makes it a load of fun to watch with McDormand and Gerwig doing the majority of narration in it. This has been some of the tightest written dialogue in a single film of animation than any other film ever. That does include Pixar and Disney sadly. The voice acting is some of the best voice acting as well. Cranston takes the stage as Chief with his harden shell over his character and his beautiful arc as well alongside with the majority of his fellow Alpha Dog group that he has formed. The Japanese voice acting as well is brilliant too and along side with beautiful animations again made me forget at a few points that I was watching a stop motion film and that I was watching a live action one. I waited a day to write this review because I wanted to think on if there are any errors in this film or any negative aspects to it and I can't think of a single thing to this masterpiece of a film. Isle of Dogs gets a 10/10",

            "content": "\"Isle of Dogs\" provides one of the most unique animated film experiences in recent memory, combining technical awe, subtle humor, and heartstring-pulling to create an immediate classic that will likely never age.The story is set in future Japan where dogs have unfortunately come upon a disease that could threaten the human population. Seemingly to prevent this outcome, the mayor of Megasaki City bans all dogs to a trash dump island just off the coast to live out the remainder of their days. The son of the mayor takes it upon himself to go to the island to locate his lost dog (the first to be removed) and is helped by a small dog pack led by a stray street dog, who refuses to show any pity towards humans.The most notable thing right off the bat about \"Isle of Dogs\" is its excellent stop-motion animation. This is such a unique form of animation and, despite its rough qualities, it always provides a charm and basically never really ages. The visuals of \"Isle of Dog's will continue to appeal to viewers as long there is a copy of it in existence. There was a trailer before this film for Illumination's \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" which featured the typical modern 3D animation complete with an alarm going off playing \"Happy\" by Pharrell Williams. Gee, I wonder what's going to be dated in less than a year? With competition like that, it's easy to see why \"Isle of Dogs\" steals the show in American animation.Wes Anderson is easily one of the most unique directors out there. At first glance, all his stuff seems like a comedy, but this film is only that in a subtle manner. Jokes are blunt, dry, and fast. Honestly, there are very few \"jokes\", most are just based around the execution of the film. This is assisted by a perfect ensemble voice cast including Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and Scarlett Johansson. Expect more chuckles rather than knee-slapping laughter. The film holds a great dramatic core around the concept of man's best friend. If you don't like dogs, this film may change that.The use of Japan as a location gives the film a fresh cultural look both in regards to visual and sound design. The soundtrack is one of the most memorable I have heard in some time. Take note Hollywood: the world could use more taiko drumming (On second thought, you might screw it up so don't bother). Anderson's use of symmetry is so appealing to the eyes that you question why more filmmakers don't try to imitate this particular style. You can clearly see thought and effort was put into every shot. Or rather every frame, considering this is stop motion.The only complaint I could find would that the 3rd act is arguably story-heavy or, in other words, there was a lot being dumped on the audience at once. I won't go into what happens, but the simple story of dogs helping a boy find his favorite pup does develop into something bigger. Most of this is caused by flashbacks, which the film does actually make enjoyable via stylistic choices. (The movie literally indications when it is a flashback with a text card and they tell you when it is over with the same effect). However, unlike many other films, I can forgive this little issue because the effort and overall style of the film just overshadow it.Finally, I should indicate that while this is an animated film, that doesn't mean it is for little kids. There is nothing too graphic (there is a bloody ear) or profane (B-word used hilariously) in the film, but the storytelling isn't really designed for little kids. The film is rated PG-13 after all. When I saw the film, a family containing about 6 or so little kids entered the theater and they were clearly not interested in what was going on and thus started running around all over the place making noise. The family left halfway in and I am sure they likely wasted 50 plus dollars (probably closer to $100 if they bought snacks). This is not a film to distract and/or amuse children.For those old enough to appreciate it though, you will enjoy one of the most unique films you will likely see in theaters this year. In many ways, films like this are best because they really make you think \"how did they do that\"?",

            "content": "It's pretty hard to dislike Wes Anderson's style or at least accredit him for practically branding it, especially when it's fused with a visual storytelling method such as stop motion. I don't think Anderson was breaking any boundaries with Isle of Dogs; it was somewhat safe and delivered on what many fans would expect from his style of filmmaking, which makes for a great time. Nothing groundbreaking, but fun. The snappy dialogue, humorous quips, likable characters, and visuals all help make Isle of Dogs more enjoyable with its simple premise.I had some reservations though, with all the talk about the political subtext and culture stuff. There is really nothing to gain by complaining about whitewashing in Hollywood, to reduce this film to pure whitewashing in its attempt to use the Japanese setting as an interesting backdrop would be a disservice to it in itself. I'm glad to say that I also wasn't bothered by the politics of the story. There is definitely time given to develop that aspect of the overall narrative but I never felt that showing the events outside of the trash island detracted from the central story. Although if this film turned out to be just about a boy and his dog, I probably would have liked it more.The voice cast is pretty crazy. There are a lot of big names, some recognizable from Wes Anderson's older films, but my favorite performance was Bryan Cranston's Chief. He has a raspiness and deep tone to his voice that really helps him command screen presence when he needs to. Cranston is also good at comedy; his timing and attitude at times made Chief my favorite character by the end.Isle of Dogs is not your typical Disney kids movie. I hate that I had to sit in an auditorium with some kids and their negligent parents. Wes Anderson's style is not the most mind blowing thing ever seen on the big screen but in the end it really is an art form that has touched a lot of people in a lot of ways. Consuming Isle of Dogs and all of his other recent films shouldn't revolve around just observing the pretty visuals but also how they help tell the story and define its characters.One of my favorite parts about this movie is the sushi making scene. There's something about the way the stop motion was done for that part that made it so satisfying to watch.",

The main human antagonist, Atari visits the island in search of his lost dog \"Spots\". Atari also happens to be the nephew of the current Japanese leader Megahashi, with spots being Ataris old support dog. As Atari sets off in search of his dog, his plane crash lands and is found by Chiefs pack. From thereforth, he befriends the group of dogs and they help him search for his pet. Chief is at first reluctant to help the boy due to being the only stray whom does not believe in human ownership, but the development of his and Ataris relationship is one of the most important and heartwarming moments of the story. Half of the film also focuses on mainland Japan as a group of protesters uncover a government conspiracy directly relating to dog flu, including the discovery of an antidote which has been hidden from public eye due to the leaders diastase for dogs. Overall, cannot fault this movie much and have watched it twice already. I reccomend watching it at least once over for the visuals alone. I expecially enjoy the Japanese text and dialogue as I studied the language at university.One thing I do question is why they didn't choose Japanese breeds for the dog characters, although I suppose they would be limited and some audiences would not recognise them. There are also some parts which are not translated, but I think this is more artistic choice and to express how personal some conversations between Spots and Atari are supposed to be.",

Charming and well conceived.I'm not a Wes Anderson devotee or distractor - I simply enjoy well crafted movies. This is certainly a hit for my particular biases. I would hope that humans would behave as well as these dogs.Some of the unexpected harder themes - I won't mention, might be spoilers - were unexpected, but handled very well.

            "content": "Isle of Dogs: from the stylised and distinct mind of Wes Anderson comes his most pleasantly charming movie yet, in a wonderfully worked stop motion animated style. In the near future a dog flu is on the verge of the human transition so a city in Japan decree that all dogs are to be quarantined and exiled to 'Trash Island', and a small boy travels to the island to find his dog.... There's also a conspiracy theory by a cat loving government whose hatred for dogs goes back generations, oh and robot attack dogs (it's certainly a different take on the relationship between master and pet). It's obvious that Isle of Dogs is a labour of love for Anderson bringing in his enthusiasm for all things- not least dogs. His sets are of course lathered with all manner of details that's it's entirely possible to lose yourself in them for hours and you'd still miss some small details. Being set in Japan means all the human characters are speaking Japanese (without subtitles) but all the dogs speak in English. That may sound a tad confusing and distracting but it works surprisingly well for the movie, because you never really need to know what the humans are saying; all their motives and emotions is conveyed through the way the are animated. And the focus isn't so much to connection between humans and dogs, but more dogs and humans. It's works really well. Isle of Dogs is also extremely fast paced which again works in the movies favour, but it stops just enough to ponder on our characters and their emotional connection to their masters. The dog cast is also stellar, with the talents of Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and Jeff Goldblum (who I hope plays a stop motion talking dog in all of his movies from now, including Jurassic World- I would pay a stupid amount to see that). Isle of Dogs is Wes Anderson's second trip into stop motion animation, a style which I do hope he continues with, as it works well within his distinctive style of offbeat humour. But for some reason I found myself admiring Isle of Dogs rather than outright loving it. And I don't know why. \nAnywoo, nonetheless I give Isle of Dogs an A-",

And a really petty criticism? The dog names are so basic and boring. This movie felt SO LONG too. I started checking the time only 35 mins in. However, the most disappointing thing is that the film seems written by people with no love or understanding of dogs. They're just annoying, unoriginal human characters that happen to be drawn as dogs. The stray dog Chief is especially tiresome, plus Bryan Cranston does not elicit any charm in the role. And the heavy-handed sociopolitical metaphors are just...sledgehammered in. It's no Animal Farm.",

            "content": "Just to get it out of the way right from the start: Of course, the visuals are stunning. Only Wes Anderson could make a stop-motion animation where the dogs' hair blows in the wind. It makes you forget about how it was made from the first minute on. Cinematography is right up there quality-wise, another Anderson-trademark. Perfectly pulled off, as always.\nNow on to what really fascinated me about this movie: That it is so deeply funny and serious at the same time, and that on unfathomably many levels.\nIsle of Dogs is fast, like any Anderson movie. It reminds me of slapstick, where you really have to keep up with the pace of narration in order to not miss anything. At the same time, while being so fast-paced, Anderson manages to bring so much depth to the story and characters, thus generating an unparalleled level of empathy inside the viewer. You end up leaving the theater somewhat confused. Confused about how you could care so much about a story that has been told (in part) in a seemingly unemotional way. Just scene after scene, dialogue after dialogue, immediate changes in scenery and so on; Towards the end there might be a little too much of everything, but that's critique on a very high level. \nWhile enjoying the depth and technical expertise put on display, you're also reminded to laugh at many points. A subtle, yet very pointed and incredibly dry humor adds another level entertainment to Isle of Dogs. The humor and occasional light-heartedness in an otherwise more seriously-themed movie finish of Wes Anderson's latest work and make it a true masterpiece that will live on for its ability to induce thought, open eyes and really just entertain all at the same time; Which is a thing I cannot point out often enough: It's such a serious movie done in such an unorthodox way. Yet, while being exquisitely unusual, not for one minute does it fail to do what every movie should do which is simply entertain an audience. It now stands alongside some of the finest works of art in filmmaking history, that is of course Anderson's very own catalogue.\nI can't wait to see what he comes up with next, so far Isle of Dogs ranks #2 behind Grand Budapest Hotel as my favourite Wes Anderson flick.",

The claymation in this film is phenomenal, although the character designs might discomfort many younger children. The use of color gives me a post apocalyptic vibe that you really wouldn't expect in an animated film. Its rare for an original concept to have an all star cast, but this isn't a surprise since Wes Anderson usually casts A-listers like Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston, Owen Wilson (who doesn't appear in the film), Bob Balaban, Tilda Swinton, and you get the point. So, the cast in this film did a pretty good job with the source material they had, and the score by Alexandre Desplat is perfect.I do have one con, and that is the unnecessary 'love interest', who is given nothing to do, and I wasn't impressed with Greta Gerwig's voice acting. I've heard she's a phenomenal director, and I hope to see Little Women sometime in the future, but her character just didn't work for me.Anyways, I did this review because I'm bored as hell and I have to keep myself isolated because you know why. Also, I haven't since this film in 2 years, so I might do a re-review of this when I watch it again.For now, I'm gonna give 'Isle of Dogs' a 7.5/10.",

However, whereas that film was Anderson's first venture into animation, which can be considered experimentation in the medium, 'Isle of Dogs' is undoubtedly a perfection of the medium. This film is a living, breathing piece of art in its highest form, in its highest quality. It is obvious that every single frame has been painstakingly crafted to gorgeousness, as there is always something just as interesting happening in the background as there is in the foreground, whether it be split-screen photography, the visual translations of the Japanese dialogue, the ingenious use of hand-drawn animation for monitors and TV screens, or even the simple mannerisms of the dogs themselves which make them feel so lifelike. This creates two intrinsically unique settings; the desolate wasteland of Trash Island, and the dystopian metropolis of Megasaki City, both as enthralling to watch as each other. As per usual in an Anderson film, the main plot focuses on the developing relationship between a small group of individuals, such as father and son or concierge and lobby boy. In this case, it is the unique bond shared between a master and their dog, encompassed by Atari Kobayashi and Chief, who is given an emotive vocal performance by Bryan Cranston that perfectly contrasts with the monotone impassiveness of the rest of dogs celebrity voices. Chief's character arc from a vicious stray to a loyal loving accomplice to Atari is what forms the heartwarming, bittersweet emotional centre to the film's cold, calculative execution. Unlike an Anderson film though is the tone, as while it is unquestionably still quirky, it trades his typical whimsy for a constant sense of danger and paranoia created by the journey the dogs are on, which allows for various instances of deliciously dark deadpan humour. Thus, 'Isle of Dogs' appropriately seems like one of Anderson's darker films. There are particular issues with pacing and story structure, specifically in the first act, however, I found this to be miniscule when compared to the continuous grand sense of awe that was continuously delivered by the visual splendour on-screen. Definitely the most delightfully enjoyable experiences at the cinema this year.",

            "content": "Isle of Dogs is yet another excellent stop motion film by visionary director Wes Anderson. All the dogs from Megasaki City have been exiled to a vast garbage dump called Trash Island and the movie follows a 12 year old boy trying to find his lost dog with the help of a pack of exiled dogs.Wes Anderson brings his distinct visual style and hilarious characters all with some amazing stop motion animation. The film balances some mature themes with rib-tickling deadpan comedy and gorgeous visuals.The films voice cast is filled with plenty of big names from the likes of Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and so many more. Bryan Cranston is stunning as always as Chief and it was touching to see his relationship with Atari played by Koyu Rankin grow into one of mutual respect and camaraderie.\nThe film has many deeper themes like animal cruelty but the film balances these darker themes with the a light hearted tone which is something Wes Anderson has done well several times before with films like The Grand Budapest Hotel and Fantastic Mr. Fox.It was a visual treat to watch this film and although the pacing slows down sometimes and I didn't love it as much as I loved Fantastic Mr. Fox it still is a wonderful film and I cannot praise the stop motion animation enough. Stop motion is a very underrated art form and I highly recommend people to go watch these kind of movies and support them.",

Incredible. Every frame a work of art. Truly. What about story? Haha. It's a Wes Anderson film. Story is not what matters. I'm already contradicting myself! Shows how unique he is really. Truly. Characters! Characters though. He know how to do characters.Yes all his characters can feel same to those found in his other films but they are all unique even if they are similar. Haha. Another contradiction. This reviewing is harder than I thought!I must say that I am a fan of Wes Anderson but I am not a 'fanboy'. I do not like everything he has done. I don't care for Life Aquatic and was let down by his other animation Fantastic Mr Fox. Not a bad film, just not how I imagined a film from reading the book. My point is I am not obsessive about him like many of his fans. I do have objectivity. I think. Haha. Everybody thinks that! Isle of Dogs may be his very best. Which is saying a lot as he has made some of the best films. 10/10. Wonderful. Hope my English is okay. Not my mother language.",

Moreover there are tasteful nods to Andersons Japanese inclusivity by using a translator directly in the film. Additionally the main characters are unabashedly using Japanese; Anderson is putting himself and the audience in the Japanese world appose to a white washed American voyeur experience that this films risks. The dogs speak in English but dogs are free game to speak any language.Of course this film has been critiqued for cultural appropriation however it is my believe that Anderson has shown us how to tastefully use cultural aesthetics that arent inherently yours to make a good movie.",

I have to wonder why Bill Murray and Jeff Goldblum signed on, because any meaningful dialogue disappears for them at this point.I was underwhelmed by the theatrical trailer but, thought why not when home release was made available. My original summation was proven correct in that this piece is style over substance. The plot in the latter stages becomes somewhat convoluted or perhaps I was too bored to concentrate. As other reviewers have asked 'Who is the target audience?', I am left with the same quandary - too dark for kids, too predictable and unchallenging for adults.This production appeared rushed. All the animation was excellent but it hung off of a script that felt it was at first draft stage. Not recommended.",

He is assisted by five Island dogs in his journey, that eventually shapes the narration of this movie.This movie is headlined by a stellar voice cast.

The film is another one of his stop-motion movies, after the excellent Fantastic Mr. Fox in 2009.The good news is that this film is just, if not more, visually striking. Wes' level of detail, in everything from the backgrounds the fur of the protagonists, is amazing. The dialogue, characters and story are top-noch as ever...even if they're a tad predictable by this point.The star-studded cast (including Bryan Cranston, Scarlett, Johansson, Ed Norton, Jeff Golblum, Bill Murray, Anjelica Huston, etc.) does a fantastic job, as do the lesser-known actors The soundtrack is fantastic, nearly all of it consists of Taiko percussion. However, this also leads into a criticism that may be minor or major, depending on how woke you consider yourself to be.I'll get right to the point: the film is guilty of using Japanese stereotypes. Atari saves the day with the power of a haiku. Kobayashi changes his mind over the fact that \"he has no honor\". It's not exactly nuanced, nor is it justifiable. However it doesn't come across as malicious or even intentional either. It doesn't ruin the movie, but it is worth mentioning.Other than that, the only other 'real' criticism is the movie isn't as laugh-out-loud funny as Fantastic Mr. Fox. But that doesn't bother me. Besides, it's less funny because there are less jokes, not because the jokes aren't funny.On the whole, Isle of Dogs is a fantastic, if slightly insensitive, movie that anyone who loves great independent films should watch.",

The plot of this film has a pretty large scope for a stop motion film, covering an array of characters and subplots, with lots of heart and character development naturally integrated into it. The director seems to have struck a good balance between story and art. The characterisation of the dogs fit perfectly with the actual voice actors, with some of the dialogue feeling like they were tailor-made for Jeff Goldblum's or Bill Murray's character. The musical score adds an extra layer of lightheartedness to the overall feel of an already humorous and entertaining film. However, I do believe that there are deeper underlying themes surrounding political propaganda and how they can incite xenophobic fear and hatred. Is it any coincidence that this film was in development during the rise of Trump's presidency? In any case, Isle of Dogs can be viewed multiple times for its immaculately detailed aesthetics (as it is so detailed you will never see everything upon the first viewing) or you can simply enjoy it for a heartwarming tale of the endearing relationship between a boy and his dog.

It is more political than some of Wes's other films but in my opinion it just adds to the story. It is rare that a movie has such a clear vision and Wes Anderson's is nesr perfect. I have 2 major complaints: first off, Tracy Walker feels very unnecessary. I understand why she is in the movie, but she really doesnt seem like she needs to be here. Also, any pans look unfocused to me primarily because everything is in focus and moving. They usually dont last long but everything moving in focus looks as if nothing is in focus.

            "content": "Precocious young protagonist with missing parent/s?CheckMeticulously crafted symmetric shots full of detail?CheckDeadpan humour?CheckHuge star studded cast that includes Bill Murray?Check\nWes Anderson is probably my favourite film maker working today so when I heard he'd be returning to the screen with the stop-motion animation, Isle of Dogs, I couldn't wait to see it, even going to my first advance screening to catch it. He did not fail to disappoint.Set in a near-future Japan, due to an outbreak of dog flu and populations of dogs reaching \"epidemic proportions\", on the orders of authoritarian mayor, Kobayashi, every dog in the city Megasaki has been captured and quarantined on a nearby landfill site named 'Trash Island'. In response, Atari, a 12 year old orphan, crash-lands on the island to find his beloved dog, Spots, accompanied by a pack of grizzled canines. Like most Wes Anderson films, the plot details are not what makes the film great, more so its characters, the comedy and the world created.From his beautiful usage of Japanese ukiyo-e illustrations to the thunderous taiko drumming, Isle of Dogs is steeped deeply within Japanese culture, with most of the Japanese dialogue even left untranslated. Moreoever, Anderson takes this opportunity to pay homage to the Japanese greats of Hayao Miyazaki and Akira Kurosawa. Coupled with the meticulously crafted, symmetrical visuals of abandoned urban landscapes from sun dappled sake glasses to towering valleys of waste, these details come together to form a compelling, beautiful world for his characters to inhabit.\nVoiced by a truly astonishing cast of actors and actresses from Bryan Cranston to Scarlett Johansson, Yoko Ono to Edward Norton, Greta Gerwig to Harvey Keitel and of course Bill Murray, Isle of Dogs perhaps possesses one of the greatest casts assembled. Unfortunately though, Anderson struggles to deal with such a rich and varied cast. Although the main characters of Chief (played by Bill Cranston) are dealt with well, none of the characters possess the charm of previous Wes Anderson creations such as Grand Budapest's Monsieur Gustave or Rushmore's Max Fischer. Instead what we receive are loose subplots that tarnish an otherwise great film.Despite its faults, as with every other Wes Anderson film, it is immensely funny, full of small details that you may only catch on a second or third viewing such. I've always had a soft spot for stop-motion animation and the enormous level of work that goes into it and the same goes for Isle of Dogs. The level of attention that goes into filming a bead of sweat rolling off the forehead of a drummer or a chef making sushi never fail to leave me impressed.\nAlthough Anderson is often criticised for simply being style over substance, I never truly understood the argument for it. If you disregard the fine artifice that layers each of Wes Anderson's films (with the exception of perhaps Bottle Rocket), there lies a great deal of depth. In the case of Isle of Dogs, the kids adventure movie about dogs also explores darker themes such as The Holocaust, identity, free will and morality, but in a manner that does not take the audience as stupid.Although Isle of Dogs may not be Anderson's strongest film, it is one of his most endearing and beautiful films. Behind the stunning visuals, is a story full of heart, a story about a dog, man's best friend, and his master.8.4/10",

It's been many years since I last saw an animated movie, and I have to say that this one was the best so far.

I don't see this as racist however because They depict stereotypical Japanese culture like sumo wrestling and stuff but I didn't see that as racist as it's still just kind of a thing in their culture and it's nit racist to show it in a movie.

A star-studded cast lose none of their quality performing as voice-actors, this film is simply brilliant. Without a doubt this is now one of my favourite animated features ever. The animation although unorthodox is intriguing and different, the breath of fresh air often displayed by Anderson continues to breathe, and long may it continue.\nDifferent isn't always good, but in Wes Anderson's case, different is absolutely fantastic.\n(By the way...

Most of Wes's films are comedies, but I find this one to be more of a drama. The untranslated Japanese offers actually made me connect MORE to the characters, because I can relate through more subtle means. This is a very subtle movie, so if you like blockbusters a lot, you'll probably hate this. The political allegory is very strong and relevant and capturing it through the lens of a 12 year old helps understand it from all point of view's. Atari's story has a happy ending, but the movie makes clear that the dog flu isn't the only political conspiracy in Japan. I loved all the characters, but Chief seemed to represent most a great character journey. He goes from being a stray, and hating humans, to starting to like Atari, to becoming his new dog at the end. It was a very interesting character journey, especially since Chief spoke in English. I loved the movie. Highly recommended",

Lack of subtitles was annoying in some parts, but translations were there when necessary. When there weren't any, like with most of the government leaders dialogue, they did a good job of displaying his emotions which still got out the main points.Plot: Worked very well with the setting/art style. Pseudo antagonist redemption at the end felt rushed but was understandable. Beginning was focused on Main character with the group of five dogs. Second was focused on secondary character (Afro girl) and Atari fighting (separately) against government as well as the dog brother subplot. Ending was cute and did a good job of taking very subtle plot points and bringing them to the fore front (hacker dude from Afro girls high school for example)Characters: The kid and the Main dog had a surprisingly good chemistry that kinda came out of nowhere towards the end. The scene where they first get separated from the rest of the group is one of the best. It's the biggest character developing section and does a good job of showing why they become so close towards the end. The other dogs in the group served there purpose, but were somewhat forgettable in the third act. The Afro girl wasn't exactly necessary, but was a definite net positive on the movie.+Art Style\n+Performances\n+Directing\n+Solid Character Chemistry\n=Average sounds design\n-Disregard of Characters in the Third Act",

Isle of dogs is no exception. But! This is a movie made by men for men. Lead and most supporting characters are male. Animals that usually have no sex are male. The owl is referred to as he, almost all the dogs have male voices. There are only three female dogs, first is the beautiful show dog, the second the motherly dog that instantly gets pregant and whos only role is to nurture, build a family and admire the male family dog, the third is the so-called oracle who only watches TV all day and stands next to the bigger, respected organising alpha male dog.Then there are three female human characters. One girl that actually says that she is in love with Atari although that contributes nothing to the story, the female scientist who can't manage her life without her male achiever colleague who commits suicide and the female translator who, well, at least works and does not talk about men and their superiority/manlihood all the time but also doesn't contribute anything to the progress of the movie other than commenting and translating to the audience.Wes Anderson knows better to write for stronger, more diverse roles. The actors/voices (Scarlett, Tolda, Greta - really?) know better to demand better female roles and dialogs.

His films always enjoy an added prestige that places them far above many films of mere entertainment, and his latest stop-motion gem fulfills perfectly what one would expect from an indie author who has erected his sublime filmography frame by frame. It is not a shameless cultural appropriation or fetishization, much less an orgy of Japanese stereotypes marked by a foreign bear, it is a beautiful and delicate love story, a widely different one, rich in visible and veiled exclamations about freedom, the press, politics, principles, fear, transformation, The friendship and the human and canine life that feeds on a first-rate vocal cast and a visual and technical section as eccentric and verbose as each of the narrative ambitions of a filmmaker who not only builds a complex addition to his exquisite filmography and artistic growth but imbues with a certain complacency a sharp and intelligent allegory into a high concept film that is clearly aimed at older minds, Those who resist to think of art as a channel of insurmountable thoughts, not as a mechanism of unavoidable contact and advancement.",

            "review_title": "Isle of Dogs",
            "content": "Wes Anderson proves his newly-discovered talents for blending animation and storytelling, comedy and relevance, heart and humour in his second stop-motion picture. 20 human years into the future (not certain about dog years) a breakout of dog flue in the Japanese city of Negasaki has 'forced' the government to banish all dogs to Trash Island. There, the dogs form their own savage society until Atari (Kuyo Rankin) tumbles in in search of his dog.What is perhaps most wonderful about this film is the beauty of it. Each and every dog has been given equal care and effort in creation and each look is scruffy yet loveable. The audience therefore, cannot help but fall in love with each K-9 character they meet. Hearing the words 'Trash Island' used to describe the film's setting would usually be enough to put anyone off yet Anderson surprises audiences. The trash is colour correlated and arranged in such ways that resemble the beauties of modern society and bring a strange charm to the world of the film. A cave the leading dogs have built for themselves comes to mind; the whole thing built out of empty bottles of various colours. This makes it resemble a jewel cave or something even more wonderful. Such care in setting is accommodated by a carefully chosen cast. Actors such as Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum and Tilda Swinton allow themselves just enough freedom to develop individual characters. We hardly have time to get to know anyone with the speed of the film, yet the independent quirks of each dog allow just enough life and wit to be given. Most of the humour derives from rather dark jokes bordering around animal cruelty and certain injustices in Japanese culture. An example being a chef preparing sushi dinner and, in the process, carving open the head of a still-alive crab. Another being the dogs gossiping about the miserable and suicidal way that one of their comrades lost his life. These quirks seem like Anderson's way of making small statements about human's powerful ability to be cruel to creatures we deem as less powerful than ourselves. After all, what's crueller than abandoning sick puppies on a dirty and disease-ridden island? Anderson still pays tribute to the culture he toys with by presenting Kabuki dances and having his human characters speak their native tongue. Their own injustices are still there however, and its evident the thesis he attempts to present about human nature.Of-course not all the jokes are this dark. Most of the humans in the film are presented as silly using fast-paced slapstick actions. Most of this humour derives from its own unexpectedness and thus, should not be spoiled in a review. The quirks balance out the darkness in the film and ensure that the audience keeps laughing and involved in the film. All other social statements aside, this is a tale about a dog's loyalty to his master. Watching the friendships develop between the dogs and Atari demonstrates this love and ties together all other themes explored. Ultimately, leaving audiences with a sense of hope as they leave the cinema. The only downside to the film is a somewhat abrupt and unrealistic ending. The ending does tie up loose ends yet gives everything to its main characters from basically nothing. Does this contribute to any morals or themes of the film? It'll need to be up to the audience to tell. Wes Anderson is famed and glorified for his strange and unique creative style. Isle of Dogs is perhaps his strangest and yet one of his best. With humour and flair, the film speaks up for those who cannot speak for themselves and ensures laughs from audiences pro-dog and not. Out of Five: 4 StarsDid you know: Jeff Goldblum recorded his lines over the phone due to scheduling conflicts with another film.",

In an era of big budget superhero movies dominating the box office, it is refreshing to see someone with such a unique vision continuing to thrive. His latest effort, Isle of Dogs, is no exception to his commitment of great film making. Anderson's style translates extremely well to this type of story; simple yet entertaining at its core. His technical precision, comedic timing, camera movement, and quick editing elevates a timeless plot into something truly captivating. The star of the show is the quality of the animation. This is Anderson's sophomore effort into the medium (the first being 2009's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\") and he has yet again achieved something remarkable. His team's effort to make the animation look flawless absolutely translates to the screen while viewing this film. The voice acting for the most part is done well. While I take some issue with almost exclusively casting well know actors to play these characters, overall they did a good job. Bryan Cranston is the real standout here, as his gravely voice and intensity fits the character he is playing. He voices a dog named Chief and his character arc, as well as his relationship with the young protagonist, Atari, are the emotion core of the movie. Their dynamic has been seen before but is really well executed through the animation and voice performances. Despite these positives and my overall enjoyment of the movie, there are some negatives to the movie. The dialogue can very often fall into the cliche or hokey category which is not atypical for a Wes Anderson film. He writes his films purposely deadpan which is acceptable but this, however, causes some of the jokes to misfire or completely miss the mark and could be solved with a change in style. That being said, I did laugh a few times throughout the movie, with some of the visual gags being quite funny. There is a subplot involving a foreign exchange student character (played by Greta Gerwig) that I found to be distracting. Every time it cut to this character, I was just hoping it would return to the main characters as soon as possible. They are the real heart of the story. I also found some of the editing choices to be awkward, possibly relating to this being stop motion animation and hence, being more difficult to edit. It is possible, but I am by no means an expert in the field. I did overall enjoy the film despite is flaws in the writing, editing and overall simple story. The quality of the animation and the emotional core of the movie kept me engaged throughout the run time of the film and I would definitely like to see this again in theaters with some friends to gauge their reaction to the film. I would recommend the film to Wes Anderson fans, who will probably get the most enjoyment out of the film. The general audience I viewed the film with seemed to enjoy it so I would also give it a recommendation to the wider public as long as you keep an open mind to different styles of film making.

The plot is good and expands a bit more throughout the story past what you know from the trailer - but not to the point of confusion or thorough thought. \n The animation and characters and scenery were amazing. I already want to watch it again since we had to sit front row so that made it hard to take in all the detail on the big screen being so close.\n I wouldnt bother bringing any kids under 13 or so, as it deserves the PG-13 rating. Some adult talk, a few swears, some blood and depiction of injuries, ect. \nHowever more important, this isnt a knee-slapping comedy kids movie. It has a good pace and I was never bored, but the pace may be just a bit too slow, and comedy lacking for young kids. However, adults will appreciate this film, especially if you have a thing for stop motion. \n If you are a feminist or critical of cultural references, maybe dont bother as this movie shows people in their \"typical\" roles and one of the main heros is an American trying to sway the masses. I hate that I have to mention any of that...just enjoy the great movie!",

Doesn't Direlle off too much in to any small points or subplots no time is wasted on any others stories other then the 3 or so main characters. The core of the story is quite simple, and the situation everyone else is in is well explained. At first I was a little frustrated there wasn't subtitles for the Japanese characters, but soon realized it doesn't matter. We're only given the necessary information. Any additional information could have distracted and/or confused me. The style of animation is pleasing to the eye, with its atension to detail, for even the shortest segments. Additionally the cartoonish style on the televisions add a funny component to the whole film.Stop animation almost always gets extra points in my book. With how much more care and craft, is put in to each and every frame. You can't help but appreciate the film, even with a less then Ideal story.Everything is accompanied by a intense and compelling musical score. That really brings you in to this world.\nIn short it's a fun and enjoyable film with a gently delivered message that isn't shoved down your throat.Would highly recommend to animation lovers.",

The animation style has certainly improved since his first stop motion feature, Fantastic Mr Fox, but Anderson's familiar and much loved directing traits remain. The cinematography is absolutely extraordinary, which is complimented by a range of quirky, funny and well developed characters- despite not being able to understand any of the Japanese characters, it is still easy to empathise and understand the motivations of these characters. The story, though not overly complex, is still intelligent and engaging.\nThe film may at first appear, especially from the trailers, to be a fun family jaunt in a quirky animation style, but within minutes it is established that relatively mature themes will be explored throughout, which they are, often with explicit detail. This, however, does not harm its availability to younger ages. \nI would thoroughly recommend this film to everyone and hope that none will miss this fantastic film.",

The humor has a perfect balance of cute and dark humor it's a weird mix.

Through the whole film this idea of conformism is presented through how the Japanese citizens all simply given to the mayors hate for dogs and conform. Other art values include the sound/audio techniques used in the film. Every voice and sound effect lines up perfectly with the kind of animation they used. Entertainment wise it didn't seem to be the most popular film that ever come out in theaters, but it was popular enough. Powerful scenes included whenever the Dog Chief or the main character Atari discovered something new having to do with Atari's dog and Chief's brother Spots. Those scenes seemed to add more excitement and interest in the film. A morale message that can be seen in the film is don't just conform to those in power and their ideas, think for yourself and what you believe is right. Scenes that reinforce this message are whenever Tracy Walker fights for the cause to save the dogs or stands up for what she believes is right. Internal conflict increases well in how Chief has pride in knowing that he must help Atari, but will not until a certain point. External conflict develops in the fight between the main good characters and society. Their will to bring back dogs is against what their society now traditionally believes in. All in all it was a wonderful Wes Anderson movie, some of his best work in my opinion and I think if I had watched this movie as a child I would've loved it even more.",

            "content": "Bursting full to the brim of mouth watering visuals, stunning production and flawless stop motion animation, Isle of Dogs shines as one of the best animated films ever crafted technically, and possibly the best film by unique and stylised filmmaker Wes Anderson. The film executes an unexpectedly complex story somewhat well, although it doesn't really focus on a main protagonist. Characters like Atari and Koboyashi lack personality, not only due to the language barrier and Anderson's common blank slate characters but also because there is not enough time spent exploring them compared to other supporting roles. I felt if the film was even 10 minutes longer, we could have seen relationships thicken and characters explored more than they were, rather than devoting time to supporting characters who felt more like protagonists as well, thus making the film full of side characters and no focus. Despite this, \"Isle of Dogs\" still feels special, gorgeous, inspired and heart-warming. The dogs are likable and appealing, and every frame of the film feels as though all the care in the world has been put into it. The astonishing production team has to be commended. Every performance was well done, including the child actors. Although Isle of Dogs features a cute array of animals and a whimsical, childish appearance, it is certainly not a film for young children. With most of the engagement coming from the dialogue driven plot, and an overall dark tone with references to cannibalism, suicide, euthanisation and concentrated genocide - don't take your 7-year-old to this movie but do take your teen to see it. In conclusion, Isle of Dogs is a sweet, aesthetically driven, technical masterpiece which, while lacking in character depth and a consistent tone (like most Anderson flicks), is still a must watch for film lovers and teens and up alike.I would recommend Isle of Dogs.",

The bad things in this film are very small and not very important but can bring something down. The twist were the main dog that they are looking for (spots) is found out to be the pack owners brother. The twist annoyed me but it would have been better if the main dog was spots because it would make out that this character that is tough and violent was a kig caring pet that forgot the luxury days of his life.

It has enough lighthearted character to make it a genuinely enjoyable theatre-film, but also enough interesting shots and subtext to warrant a second viewing. Though I wouldn't recommend this to someone who doesn't already enjoy Wes Anderson's style, or to anyone under the age of 12 for fear that it would just go over their head...

Thus the magic of having a human who understands SADB (Standard American Dog Bark)...oh that would be me...to bring this crisp content to non-canine moviegoers...virtually anyone. #sweartogod)Straight away I admit to mixing a cocktail of both regard and rebuke for Isle of Dogs (referred to hereafter as IOD to cool my boiling carpal tunnel).Doesn't that beg the question \"What is this movie NOT about?\" Decidedly not whale migrations, failed PHD theses, or the lack of a good cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e in Oklahoma. And yet, in spite of the myriad topics not presented, the membrane (synonym for film) is an allegory. We posit good versus evil. Has that clash yet to receive a full treatment in any art or literature? That is question 6 on your homework assignment. So we have a megalomaniac running Megasaki - appropriate. He sends the infected dogs to quarantine on Trash Island. (Bakersfield with a lean shellac of animation.) Imagine conjoining \"101 Dalmations\" with \"Schindler's List\". All right don't. But when I think about IOD, mostly during the time I spend spinning in three circles before I lay (laid? lain?) on my Pendleton shirtish bucket by the fire (I know it's July but light it anyway), I face plot holes so substantial and off-white that no matter or radiation can escape. I scraped that from Wikipedia but it somehow works. Or doesn't. You decide. You can stop reading now. Go ahead I dare you. And I will scratch up some dirt on you and yours.Aside: somebody just came up to me, I'd been drowsing, and said \"Where's the ball?\" Really? So I am supposed to look keen and spirited? You know where the ball is. You pushed it under the couch. :end of aside.Just a few of the miscalculations from Wes Anderson and the other writers:-- How could a band of renegade pups not take a licking? Isn't that what they crave? Unto themselves and each other?\n-- How fur can you go with the \"Abused Dogs Stage Coup\" device? \n-- Notice the cut-rate \"Canine Ex Machina\" in the trending1 \"bucket on a wire\" scene. (1Wes bought 1.5 million Twitter followers from Cambridge Analytica.)\n-- Think on Rex, King, Duke, Boss, and Chief. Why didn't they flea when presented the opportunity?End of miscalculations.I don't want to kibble on small points but the leash I could do is scratch a hole in the new carpet. (There was something alive under the pad #sweartogod squirrel most likely). \nI discussed this for seven and a half hours with the other dogs on the block that comprise our karass. Our managers were all out \"working\". Right. So we talked and Gunner said that the one actress put the poo in poodle. Fair? Probably not. Other views held her to be fetching. Bear said that the mayor was so simple he should have been put into a witless protection program. My tenet was empathy for the mentality of the pack. Seeing them eat garbage reminded me of trying to find any watchable shows on DirecTV.Other principles we noted: inside every black dog is a white dog waiting to be shampooed and announced.I lift my leg and give IOD 4 Hydrants and a patch of grass.

An example of this is the recent movie hit Avengers Infinity War, which took so much time just to make a part one as well as took many movie actors hours and hours of practice just to do one scene. Isle of dogs is different in the way that it uses clay figures and use animation to make them move which is a very unique way to film, that many directors just do not do. The thing about this movie is the art of its simplicity, especially in their storyline. The movie is basically all about Japanese people hating dogs because of a corrupt dictator from the cat army who decided to put a disease in a dog which spread fear into the people, giving him power to kick out all dogs. A young boy named Atari is not happy about this, so he decides to leave the country to find his servant dog who was with him during his injury. I love the Visual Design aka Mise en sc\u00e9ne of the movie. The actions are so well timed, the characters are simple yet beautiful,and even the storyline, although somewhat clich\u00e9, it doesn't take away the beauty and overall greatness of the movie.Isle of Dogs is unique in the way that even though the language is Japanese, and dubbed to English, there are still parts that are in Japanese. Mr. Anderson was very wise in this decision as those words that are in Japanese hold a very deep meaning that I'm dubbed, could make the viewers not fully grasp the intention of the words used. What it lacks however is that it doesn't fully develop the side characters as when Atari was in trash island, he met a dog and his squad, and after some character development, he gets close with the one dog that doesn't really like him, but after some time and some problems happen, and the other dogs are in danger, and released, their story ends there. The ending doesn't even reveal how they ended up. Basically, what I just stated was merely nitpicking and that didn't really affect my overall perspective on the movie, which is it is great. I actually enjoyed the movie from start to finish and I would definitely recommend other people to watch it if they have the opportunity to.",

            "content": "Criminally underrated and one of the best stop motions films alongside fantastic mr Fox, Isle of Dogs deserves more praise from critics and audiences alike. Most critical reviews rightly compliment that Beauty Wes Anderson produces. I would say it's his most visually stunning film, beating out all his other visually masterful films which says a lot to how great this movie is crafted. The critics of the film come with the characters and stories themselves:. The consensus seems to be that the story and characters whilst good don't make you connect with them like a Mr Fox or Gustave for example. Though I agree those characters are more relatable and engaging the characters and story here is still no doubt fantastic. There's no real protagonist, we have the pack of dogs Chief being the main leader and the boy who all adventure together to find his old dog spots. The lack of a dead set protagonist is in my opinion not harmful at all. It's true that the rest of the dogs in Chiefs pack are underdeveloped but was there any need to develop them? They are there for comical effect but they needed no either purpose in the narrative. Chief and the boy hold the narrative up incredibly well enough, rounding the story in satisfying character arcs and a great ending. Overall I think isle of dogs story and characters of Chief deserve more respect alongside the beauty the film presents with all the hand crafted sets and characters etc. A criminally unappreciated fantastic movie.",

It's not bad animation, just different.\n\nIt's a pretty sad first act. It pulls you into the story quickly because you wanna know what's going to happen next but it honestly breaks your heart in the process. Trust me when I say that it gets so much better. At certain points in the film you're overcome by emotion, you laugh, you gasp and your eyes widen, and so much more. Definitely worth the watch!\n\nA stacked cast and amazing attention to detail, what more could you ask for in a stop motion film? Andy Gent, Anderson's \"right hand man\" is a master at his craft. The fur on the dogs and the movement of everything is beautiful. This is probably my favorite stop motion film I've seen because there are just so many amazing moments like when a dog is staring into the ocean and their fur is blowing or when a tv screen shows a computer generated character\u2026 it's gorgeous.\n\nIt has it's moments of comedy too. There's a few times where I laughed out loud at unexpected jokes which I loved! It's not a full on comedy movie, but the times when they do slide a joke in there is hilarious. Thank you Jason Schwartzman (honestly, he probably didn't write those jokes but I like to believe that he did)\n\nTHE BENTO BOX SCENE! This will go down as the most satisfying scene I've ever watched in an animated film. I watched it once, then played it over again, just to see it one more time. So gorgeous.\n\nMy one and only critique is that it drags on for just a little too long. There were points that could be sped up and the movie could've ended a lot sooner\u2026 towards the end I kept clicking to see how much time was left. Feel good ending though so it was worth the wait! So enjoyable!\n\nLast thing I'll say (reiterate), the look of this film is wonderful. Once you get past the people, that is. Every scene had me saying wow under my breath because it's just so intricate and beautiful. Really enjoyed watching this, probably wouldn't watch it alone again just because it's not something that generally intrigues me but it was good! Only two more Wes films until I've finished his entire filmography!!",

It was a visual treat - I noted to myself multiple times throughout the film that some frames would look lovely on my wall. There's a picturesque beauty in the grimy garbage heaps and derelict structures that are the backdrops of the film. The voice actors were phenomenal, giving the dogs rich personalities that I like to imagine are how my animals might sound when I'm not around (oh, come on - you do it, too...right?) They are helped by dialogue that is snappy and well written. It's not quite funny enough to me - I like the deadpan sense of humor, but in this case it was in a way that you sort of chuckle and move from on rather than really deeply enjoy, like a series of witty Sunday comic strips tied together. The story is an initially breezy, and later exciting, brand of fun as it follows a young boy who, with the help of a pack of feral dogs, searches for his lost pet. There are welcome hints of noir influence as it deals with the political intrigue surrounding the circumstances of the dogs quarantine from society. Anderson's eccentricity and style can be a bit much as it teeters on the brink of self-indulgence, but this time he pulls it off with the right combination of talent, imagery, and lovable puppers.",

Everything was beautifully textured, but many times there was a very creepy feel to how some of the scenes were framed in ways that you're taught not to use in photography or film or art lessons.  I think it felt creepy just because the shots were done in ways that just simply aren't done because directors or photographers are taught 'THIS IS WRONG!  NEVER DO THIS!'.  Like having all the subjects facing directly at the viewer shoulder to shoulder close together like you might see in a high school yearbook from 1980 for 'senior chess club'.  I found those creepy feeling scenes to be very compelling though, and they certainly stick out in my mind as the most memorable moments in this beautiful film.",

The films intricate fast-moving plot is well supported by a lush, compelling background score from Alexandre Desplat. Like the screenplay in any Wes Anderson film, the dialogues are hilarious, witty and fast-paced. The fight scenes seem like they have been picked out of from a comic strip so as not to seem too violent, I liked this a lot. Bryan Cranston's voiceover was the standout for me moving from strong and authoritative to soft, caring and lovable. Edward Norton's voiceover was refreshingly funny. The most unprecedented factor in this movie is the exceeding relevance it carries in todays society. The themes range widely from moronic politicians to pollution and its adverse effects. The film subtly hints at the future of the Earth through the vast amount of garbage in the movie and says how that will be our situation soon if we don't take actions. Overall even with the cute dogs and several heartwarming moments, this film will appeal more to adults rather than children.",

The story follows Atari, the mayor's son, as he escapes home to save his lost dog, Spot. The government has banned all dogs from the city after a deadly strain of snout flu breaks out. The script is mediocre, however, the overall look of the movie more than makes up for it. Since this is an animated movie, Wes Anderson is able to play with a much larger scale than all of his other movies. This is done by making the film more of a science fiction, large scale, action film. As mentioned, the movie is visually spectacular. This movie isn't Wes Anderson's first attempt at an animated feature, Fantastic Mr. Fox was (for lack of a better term) fantastic, and this movie has a very similar quality. The art takes a key element from Japanese culture, which made the movie world very vibrant and exciting. A lot of the voice acting is wonderful, Bill Murray and Edward Norton being stand outs. The language barrier between the dogs and Atari was different from other movies featuring the same kind of language barrier. The dogs have a hard time understanding Atari, ergo allowing us to connect more with the dogs. The dogs themselves are all very unique, and each one ends the perfect way. Though, as I mentioned, the script is only mediocre. The dialogue certainly wasn't the best of Anderson's movies, although dialogue has never been one of his large strengths, though don't get me wrong, I wouldn't call any of the dialogues in his films \u2018bad.' I'm not okay with admitting how long it took me to figure out the pun in the name, but it was worth it. In the end, Isle of Dogs is a wonderful, fantastical, animated movie by Wes Anderson. And while the script isn't always the best, nearly every other aspect of it is really enjoyable. It's a very fun watch, and I would highly recommend it. 8.2/10 from me.",

From individual hairs to random fleas that scurry, no piece of detail gets left out. Each scene is beautiful and stands out on their own. Colors and visuals and media styles mix and blend together to create a beautiful film. The animation is nothing less than captivating.\n\nBut the film is more than a delight to the eyes, it's a delight to the ears as well. The music and sounds were perfect. Loved the music throughout. The voice cast was well selected. It's fun guessing which person is playing which character.\n\nThe plot was unique and heartwarming. Who can't like a story about a boy and his dog? There are some suspenseful moments, it's a feel-good movie throughout.\n\nI enjoyed the nod to Japanese culture and Anderson's choice of not having subtitles. Though confusing at first, it increases the level of immersion. Double points for accurate Japanese. That's one area most American filmmakers neglect.\n\nI don't think any animated 2018 film could have topped this.\n\n5/5. I loved it. Sorry, cat-lovers.",

It was a visual treat - I noted to myself multiple times throughout the film that some frames would look lovely on my wall. There's a picturesque beauty in the grimy garbage heaps and derelict structures that are the backdrops of the film. The voice actors were phenomenal, giving the dogs rich personalities that I like to imagine are how my animals might sound when I'm not around (oh, come on - you do it, too...right?) They are helped by dialogue that is snappy and well written. It's not quite funny enough to me - I like the deadpan sense of humor, but in this case it was in a way that you sort of chuckle and move from on rather than really deeply enjoy, like a series of witty Sunday comic strips tied together. The story is an initially breezy, and later exciting, brand of fun as it follows a young boy who, with the help of a pack of feral dogs, searches for his lost pet. There are welcome hints of noir influence as it deals with the political intrigue surrounding the circumstances of the dogs quarantine from society. Anderson's eccentricity and style can be a bit much as it teeters on the brink of self-indulgence, but this time he pulls it off with the right combination of talent, imagery, and lovable puppers.",

The movie loses some stream along the way with some choppy pacing and a couple redundant story elements.

It's not like someone who's painfully unfunny, it's just . . . whatever. He manages to pull together some good casts, I'll say that. Lots of well-respected white people work with Wes Anderson.

Much like his previous stop motion animated film Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) Isle of Dogs is a very charming story with some really great voice acting. Set in the near future in Japan Isle of Dogs tells the tale of a Japan that has been overrun by a canine influenza that has affected all the dogs on the island. Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura) signs a bill that sends ll the dogs to Trash Island to keep them isolated from humans. Six months go by and a young boy named Atari (Koyu Rankin) crash lands onto Trash Island looking for his dog Spots (Liev Schreiber). He befriends some stray dogs on the island named Chief (Bryan Cranston), Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum) & Boss (Bill Murray). Together they guide Atari through the island searching for Spots and along the way discovering a conspiracy about what's really going on. The film looks great. The use of the stop motion here is perfect and gives it a very distinct style. In a very Wes Anderson kind of way the film blends story, music and cinematography to give it the vibe you may be familiar with if you're a fan of Anderson's films. The film has a lot of little quirky moments and although I wouldn't say this is better than Fantastic Mr. Fox I did find it very close to that one and enjoyed it. Plus come on it's a movie about dogs that talk and have a witty sense of humor what's not to like. This is a solid film that I really enjoyed and would recommend checking out!",

It's all there in the name - if you haven't caught it, the title is a homonym of sorts for \"I Love Dogs\"... and indeed, I do love dogs!  Now, you don't have to love dogs to love this movie... but even if you don't, I'll bet you that by the end of this movie, you'll love them a little more.  It is just delightful.   This is a Wes Anderson film, so you know even before it starts that it's going to be chock full of charm, whimsy, and symmetry, and it does not disappoint on any of those counts.  Anderson is one of the most original and innovative filmmakers working today; he has become a master of the medium and uses it in ways that no one else does, creating films that are always uniquely his.  Though this is an animated film, it's a pretty adult movie with mature themes - I would say it's probably not the best choice for small kids, but it's great for older ones.  The whole film is an allegory for xenophobia and the disenfranchisement of marginalized populations (the film is ostensibly set in bizarro-world Japan, but I would argue that the attitudes of the people in this film are more similar to American culture right now).  That's a lot going on for an animated film, but its genius is that it's also really funny, sweet, and surprisingly sentimental.  This is a film that brilliantly toes the line between darkness and lightness, illustrating serious themes with humorous execution.  For some reason, the way the characters all look straight into the camera creates such a comedic effect.  The reaction shots alone are priceless... and those little dog-sneezes!  Adorable!   The ending is a little contrived, but whatever, I wanted the happy ending and was willing to sacrifice realism to get it.  This is definitely my favorite movie of 2018 (so far), it is such a joy.  He is a smart and clever man, that Wes Anderson, and he has made a smart and clever movie that is massively appealing while also delivering a potent message.  Standing O.",

The first time through, I felt dragged; I was a toddler walking a mastiff. Gags and goofy lines like \"beheaded the head of the head of the Kobayashi clan,\" kept me from being left in the stop-motion cotton ball dust, but I kept a far better pace the second time through. The atmosphere these shots provide is a perfect launchpad for most of the rest of the film, but a too-long ending sees that plane set a little too soon. Isle of Dogs is best when this momentum is present.\nIsle of Dogs splays out some harsh realities of the world, starting with scheming, political corruption, and abandoning sick dogs to die on an island made out of trash. However, another point of view shows an Isle of Dogs about cat-lovers fighting dog-lovers with evil robot dogs and wasabi poison. It's childish, and that really makes the film. Even the animation contributes; it's a cartoon! Complete with explosions and dustball brawls. Just look at the title. These two faces play brilliant foils for one another, which becomes clearer and clearer as the film goes on. Atari risks everything to save the last friend he has. Mayor Kobayashi hates dogs because he's with the cats and cats must hate dogs. Atari hijacks an airplane to go visit an island full of dogs. Mayor Kobayashi struggles with the burden of following his family's way. All of the human plot-movers in Isle of Dogs are children acting like adults or adults acting like children.\nThe human cast of this movie may have a lot going on, but this movie stands on more that two legs. This movie is also about dogs, and in this case, outcasts. Many of the Isle's dogs lead lives  very human lives back on the mainland; they were mascots, actors, bodyguards, and show dogs. Chief, our main pooch played by Bryan Cranston, was a stray. Before Atari's arrival and the subsequent adventure, a brief glimpse shows how life happens on the Isle of Dogs. Roving packs fight for every meal. It's dog-eat-dog anarchy. However, the pack we follow has built within itself an order. They're a democracy. There's no leader; they're all leaders. They vote one way while Chief disagrees and begrudgingly follows. When they all decide to help the little pilot, Chief growls and stands off. \"I bite.\" he says when Atari tries to pet him. It might seem like being shipped off to a trash island might be an equalizer for the dogs, perhaps with the survival-savvy strays coming out on top, Chief is still in some ways the outcast of the party. Deep down, he does want to help Atari find his dog; in the same way, he wants to find a home too, however reluctant he is to admit it. So, when in the middle of another vote a trolley unexpectedly splits leaving Chief with Atari, it's one of the most interesting points of character development in the film. Chief has lost his pack, the only home he's ever known up until that point, and he's stuck with this kid who want him to act like his pet, which goes against everything he stands for. Eventually though, Chief finds his home through Atari. They play fetch. Atari gives Chief a comically effective bath. When they finally regroup with the rest of the pack for the main adventure to resume, we have a much better understanding of both Chief and Atari.\nWes Anderson's Isle of Dogs meticulous scrolls through a thousand beautiful dioramas. The stop-motion is immersive and the characters are full of life. Expect droll humor, novel shots, and visual gags. Under the surface? It's got themes and motifs worth gnawing on for a while.

            "content": "Director Wes Anderson's latest film is a stop-motion animated curiosity taking place in a miniature version of future Japan (capital city, Megasaki).  Taking inspiration from the Rankin-Bass Christmas specials (e.g. Rudolph), this is a fun (but grown-up) adventure, telling how a dog-hating mayor evicts all canines to \"Trash Island\" where they are left to die, suffering from dog-flu and snout-fever and all manner of other ailments.  It is Anderson's renowned attention to whimsical detail that sees his characters perpetually sneezing throughout the film - but of course, that's just one small example.  Although the dogs speak in English, most of the other characters speak in Japanese, only occasionally translated (by a variety of interpreters or electronic translating machines).  The human hero of the tale, a 12-year-old boy named Atari (voiced by Koyu Rankin), flies a small junior aircraft to Trash Island to find his former pet bodyguard, Spots (voiced by Liev Schreiber).  He is assisted by four former pet dogs (voiced by Edward Norton, Bob Balaban, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Murray) and a stray (voiced by Bryan Cranston).  They have quite the adventure.  A teenaged human exchange student (voiced by Greta Gerwig) also helps by fighting the corrupt government and exposing an evil conspiracy.  Along the way, Anderson enjoys spoofing and/or paying homage to Japanese culture.  There is probably too much to look at or to take in for just one sitting. The music is less song based than in other Anderson features - for example, some of the music is apparently drawn from Seven Samurai (1954) -- but there is also the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band's \"I Won't Hurt You\" (which certainly fits with what we know of Anderson's musical taste).  Harvey Keitel, Scarlett Johansson, Yoko Ono, and F. Murray Abraham also lend their vocal talents, along with an array of Japanese actors.  As with Anderson's other output, you really need to be on his wavelength to appreciate this - and I was (and have been).  So, if you have liked his other films, you won't be disappointed with this one.  I found it silly but highly enjoyable.",

            "content": "Strengths: It reminds me of Fantastic Mr. Fox in the best possible way. The animation style is unique and allows the movie to stand out. There are quirks throughout that make this special. Many of the scenes are handled with creative care. The voice cast is stellar. Bryan Cranston (Chief) is outstanding. He\u00e2(TM)s kind of the lead, playing the dog who changes the most over the course of the film. There\u00e2(TM)s a lot of emotion to his story and the way he bonds with Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin). Edward Norton (Rex) is fun, Bill Murray (Boss) is his usual great self, and Jeff Goldblum (Duke) is a blast with his constant \u00e2rumors.\u00e2? That\u00e2(TM)s not even including the smaller voice roles by Frances McDormand (Interpreter Nelson), Scarlett Johansson (Nutmeg), Courtney B. Vance (Narrator), and more. There are heartwarming moments sprinkled in throughout, and an adventure that really tugs at your emotions. The script gives us big moments, strong characters, and natural dialogue. I also thought it was cool how some characters don\u00e2(TM)t speak in English and we don\u00e2(TM)t get to understand them because the dogs don\u00e2(TM)t understand them. It puts us right in their shoes. There are plenty of laughs and a surprisingly large amount of plot twists that add up to one hell of a ride.\n\nWeaknesses: This movie doesn\u00e2(TM)t fully work as a kid\u00e2(TM)s film. It\u00e2(TM)s kind of marketed towards them, but there are some violent moments that are a bit much for children. Some of the characters feel a bit underused. Nutmeg is one who could\u00e2(TM)ve done more and had a more established relationship with Chief. It was just kind of glossed over, so it didn\u00e2(TM)t fully click. Most of the soundtrack seems to miss the mark.\n\nOverall: The criticisms I found were mostly nitpicks. This movie is incredible. It\u00e2(TM)s creative, fun, witty, and heartwarming. It only ranks behind Avengers: Infinity War for the best of the year.",

The cinematography also made scenes more impactful especially those in which strong emotions like humor and anger are involved.\n\nAnother thing that I found very interesting in the movie was the way Japanese was used. With a Western and English-speaking audience, it would be assumed that Japanese be subtitled by Anderson in order for viewers to understand what these lines mean, but then, to my surprise, he didn't. There must be a reason behind this, and I believe that this measure was done in order to make the audience think. Viewers are used to having information served onto them on a silver platter but then having un-subtitled Japanese forced viewers, forced me to pay attention to every single minor detail in order to use them as context clues to decipher the hieroglyphics that is Japanese. This really helped me appreciate the stop motion animation and the movie as a whole.",

            "content": "Dogs are often called a man's best friend. But, what if the opposite were to happen and dogs became man's worst fear? Witty, adventurous, and eccentric. Wes Anderson creates yet another masterpiece which is his latest film. Like most Anderson films, the protagonist/s is often set upon a wild long journey. Whether its a journey of self-discovery, resolving of family issues, or just adventures in general. Isle of Dogs takes the same classic signature Anderson elements but develops these into a new and refreshing idea that does not fail to entertain the audience once again. The story revolves around the lives of dogs in Trash Island after being exiled from Megasaki City. They journey within its grounds after the governor's son arrives here in search of his dog and how they are able to return back to their homeland. The film pulls viewers into its story through its unique storyline and characters. Dogs are normally not protagonists of films. But, the fantasy-based plot leaves viewers strapped to their seats, wanting to see the next events that will happen in the film. Anderson utilizes his fictional ideas, placed into film to create a one of a kind story, making us invest in the film, which is typical of Anderson's films. The unique story of this film makes this piece a movie to watch for all people wanting something new to add to their collection of movies. \n\nMajority of the film, the dialogue between the dogs and humans are separeted by the language barrier of the English speaking dogs to the Japanese dialect the humans speak in. When watching the film, the viewer is left without subtitles for these parts. Some people might say the subtitles were left out because it helps us to pay more attention to the film and try to grasp the meaning of those scenes. Some people might say that it represents the reality of our relationship with dogs and how we as the viewers are placed in the shoes of the dogs in the film. I believe that Wes Anderson intentionally left out the subtitles for the Japanese parts because he wants the audience to interpret his film in their own way and how they see and understand it. There is no right or wrong interpretation of his film but rather it is left to audience to discuss and understand his film in their own way and what they see as best fit to them.",

            "content": "Let me start this by saying that I have literally never been more excited for a movie in my life. The only other occurence I can think of is my pre-teen mind going wild to see The Hunger Games back in 2012, but believe it or not, I've changed over the past six years. Ever since the first social media postings, and the release of the first trailer- cut to \"I don't think i can stomach anymore of this garbage\"-  I've been hooked. One of my favorite kids' movies has always been Fantastic Mr Fox, a movie that I believe demonstrates that kids movies can be an art, and don't have to be dumbed down and pointless; so seeing Anderson return to stop motion warmed my pre-teen heart and made me really nostalgic. Upon first look at the trailer, one thing can be immediately seen. The animation.\n\tHoly shit, the animation. While Fantastic Mr. Fox's animation was choppy and a bit awkward, Isle of Dogs is fluid, absolutely ridiculously detailed, and so gorgeous, it's hard to believe that they didn't have a constantly rotating group of animators due to jumping out the damn windows from boredom-caused insanity. Wes was dipping his toe into the pool of stop motion, testing the waters, seeing how things felt. In Isle of Dogs, Wes say his faults in animation, had a stronger budget, and took a complete cannonball, soaking the deck of the pool, and pissing off the neighbors' kids as he did so.\n\n\tIsle of Dogs is a refreshingly original story in a time where all movies seem to be adaptations, sequels, or reboots; and where all kids movies seem to be Sherlock Gnomes. It tells the story of a pack of dogs exiled to Trash Island, due to the demands of a totalitarian leader Mayor Kobayashi, who wishes to eradicate all dogs through manipulation of the public, lies, and violence; even going so far as to work with the Yakuza, a notorious transnational organized crime group in Japan. More specifically, it follows the mayor's distant nephew, and ward to the Mayoral Household, Atari Kobayashi, who was orphaned three years before the story takes place due to a devastating train derailment. He was gifted Spots Kobayashi, his personal bodyguard dog, upon entry to the Brick Mansion. To kick off the dog displacement, and just to show he really means business, Mayor Kobayashi sends off Spots as the very first dog to be exiled, Dog Zero. The movie follows Atari, and his search for Spots, with the help of Chief, a rough stray dog from the streets of Central Megasaki, Rex, a wiry haired and quirky dog owned by a schoolmaster, Boss, the mascot of the Megasaki Dragons baseball team, Duke, a gossip loving husky, and King, the famous Doggy Chop dog.\n\tWhile the trailer may seem to show that the dogs will perform as an ensemble cast, the real limelight goes to Chief, who's aggressive and rude demeanor contrasts with the hopeful and determined dog lover Atari. Their growing friendship and teamwork is wonderful, and something I'll cover later in the video. The truth is, Rex, Boss, Duke, and King really disappear halfway into the movie and don't show up until much later, leaving the real character development to be with Chief and Atari. This does bring up a bit of a problem, since while we see a character arc and lots of personal development with Chief, the other dogs are merely decorations to the story, whether it be Rex, to be the social leader of the group, calling upon them to take votes,  King, to do really nothing but occasionally add to the discussion, Duke, who adds a typical Jeff Goldblum-esque comic relief, or Boss, a character that even after four viewings, I still struggle to see his purpose. Chief is the emotional drive, and the others are simple characters to accompany and garnish.\n\tIsle of Dogs tells its story in a series of chapters, flashbacks, going back and forth in time freely, and switching from the characters on Trash Island to the characters back on Megasaki. While it would seem that juggling so many different times and places would surely cause the story to collapse into a confusing mess. Wes Anderson manages to bridge them all in an easily accessible way, where you always know where, when, and why you are in a certain place. If you were seeing this film for the first time, you would have absolutely no problem figuring out what was happening. I have to give props to the storytellers for being able to constantly say things like \"Three Years Earlier\", \"End of Flashback\", and \"A Few Months Earlier\" without sounding like the French title card narrator from Spongebob Squarepants.\n\tOne departure that Isle of Dogs took from the other works of Wes Anderson is that the story is full. There is not much to be left up to interpretation, it doesn't end on an ambiguous note, and it certainly doesn't have the audience guess and theorize what the ending could be. As a matter of fact, the last ten minutes or so of the film go into detail how the story concluded, and what the characters are up to now. With that being said, Isle of Dogs leaves the viewer feeling satisfied, almost as if the movie was a storybook. I found this particularly interesting considering that this is a Wes Anderson film. In Fantastic Mr. Fox, the animals make their home burrowed under the Boggis, Bunce, and Bean supermarket, a lucky instance, but not without the grim reminder that they are still living underground, and they can't steal from the same place forever. In Moonrise Kingdom, in an ending that made me cry for about two hours, Suzy and Sam are allowed to stay together, however it is hidden to all except Captain Sharp, who drives Sam to and from Suzy's house for their daily visits. In The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Author moves off to South America, never to return to the hotel, and the fate of Zero is completely unknown. In Isle of Dogs, Atari becomes the mayor, he gets the girl, keeps the dog, and everyone lived happily ever after.\n\nI love the story very much, but good god, the sets, character designs, and camerawork are just so wonderful. Fans and parodyers alike of Wes Anderson are highly familiar with his esoteric style of centering shots, rather stilted dialogue, quirky stories and characters, and meticulous effort into perfectionism. I am happy to say that Isle of Dogs may very well be the most Wes Anderson thing to ever come out of Wes Anderson. I would highly suggest you watch the \"making of\" videos released by Fox Searchlight. These videos go in depth and provide us a look into the development in this film, and if you don't believe every shred of my voice when I say that this movie took a shit ton of effort, just watch a second of any of these videos.\n\tI really believe that Isle of Dogs is a significant step forward in the animation medium. The sad truth is, that most casual movie viewers see animation as a kids medium, something that only children can enjoy, and something that can only convey a silly story. Isle of Dogs is political corruption. It's dark, it's morbid, and it's mature. What animation fans and animation itself both need is more movies like this.\nAll in all, I truly believe that Isle of Dogs is something special. I'm glad to have been following it for so long, and I truly believe that it was worth the wait. You best believe I'm gonna buy the blu ray as soon as it comes out. And on the chance that it's still in theatres when you see this video, definitely treat yourself, and check it out.",

Coupled with his iconic cinematography style and you have a movie that's uniquely Wes Anderson. \n\nHowever, some points to note is the  intention of portraying Japanese culture towards Americans in such way that it loses authenticity when shown to Japanese. Though, the intention of not adding English subtitles to Japanese dubbed sections of the movie may present itself as being in one with the Japanese and (in turn) be a way to improve its art authenticity among viewers of a certain calibre.

It's fun to think of all the symmetry while watching it, it's making it impossible to miss and really impressive. There are several known voices lent here.

Anderson showcases his phenomenal talent that is worth an oscar or two.\n\n \"Dogs\" is an incredibly detailed stop-motion film about a Dystopian Japanese archipelago 20 years into the future. The setting takes place in a fictional city named Megasaki. When an unknown cause of dog flu breaks out into the city, all canine species are banned by the government to Trash Island, which is exactly what it sounds like. In attempt to find his beloved dog, a young boy, Atari Kobayashi sets out to Trash Island and becomes acquainted with a pack of exiled Alpha dogs who have no leader among them. The dogs are all played by American actors and have very American personalities. At first, the dogs are stunned when they find something alive on the island, and take a vote whether they should eat him or not. In an unanimous vote to not eat the boy, the Alpha dogs then decide to team up with Atari and look for his dog, Spots. While Atari and the Alphas are searching the island, back in Japan are a group of pro-dog students and scientists searching for a cure and fighting for their pets lives. I won't spoil the outcome, but if you pay close attention at the beginning of the film, Anderson spoils the whole plot in the first five minutes. He starts out with a narrator telling a story of the Megasaki ancestors. This story is a parable for everything we are about to see in the next hour and forty minutes.\n\nThe cleverness of the film can be seen even in the title of the movie. \"Isle of dogs\" said out loud matches \"I love dogs\", which by the film we can see that Anderson really does love dogs. The creativeness of the storyline lets us see a fusion of Japanese humans and American dogs and it also allows us to see the difference of Japanese and American culture. In the scene when Atari crashlands on Trash Island, the dogs (who only speak English), are extremely confused when Atari (who only speaks Japanese) tries giving them commands. One dog comments \"I wish somebody spoke his language.\" This part is not just to show the linguistic barriers between dog and human, but also between most Japanese and American citizens. The Japanese humans in the film only speak in their native tongue and are not given subtitles. Besides an occasional on-screen translator and an American foreign exchange student, no other humans in the movie speak English. This is a way of obviously showing one difference in American and Japanese culture, and also one creative way of letting the audience know what it is like to be a dog and not understand what they are being told most of the time.\n\nThroughout the incredibly creative story, we watch beautiful and eye-pleasing art in motion. Following four prominent themes- dogs, trash, facial expression, and Japanese aesthetic, Anderson's film shows how much he has grown as a director. The clean lines and symmetrical shots are just the beginning of the genius mind of Anderson. The movie has the same comedy and cleverness of his fan-favorite, heart-warming 2009, Fantastic Mr. Fox, but this time, Anderson has pulled out all the stops and has held nothing back. He uses outstanding detail in all the stop-motion puppets. Each one is uniquely crafted to fit the personality of the character. The dogs are all given specific looks and show some sign of trauma in their eyes. Let's not forget the outstanding sets of each shot. Trash Island is beautiful. Sounds ironic given the name of the island, but when you notice the detail of each piece of trash and the color scheme of it all, it really comes to life. The facial expressions tell much of the story. Since a lot of the movie is in Japanese, the body language of the characters does an adequate job of telling the story. The whole vibe of the movie is very Japanese. The music and colors used all give off the Japanese film feel. Anderson does a great job in showing his well-known love and respect for Japanese film and culture.\n\nAlthough the story on the surface is a simple tale of a boy and \"man's best friend\", the detail of the script and set are extremely political. Like Anderson's other films, the characters in Isle of Dogs follow a pattern of revolt. In this story the pro-dog students, scientist, dogs, and Atari are all revolting against their government and the act that banned the dogs. The film shows aspects of very American styled protest. In one very political shot, the pro-dog students protesting against the government and are shown with one fist in the air like the American Black Power group. If you look closely the students are all wearing pins that say \"Pro-Watanabe\". (Watanabe is the scientist finding a cure for dog flu). The unique thing about these pins is that they are all red white and blue. The colors of the American flag are used very wisley. If the pins were any other colors, they would not give off the patriotic, protesting, rallying-the-troops sort of feel. If these two details do not represent an American style of revolt, I don't know what does. I give my kudos to Wes Anderson and congratulate him on how much his growth as a director shows in this film. I also thank him for the breath of fresh air this film has given me from what I have seen in the theaters this year.",

When all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to vast Trash Island, Atari sets off in search of his bodyguard dog, Spots. With the assistance of his newfound mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.\n\nReview:\nI'm usually a big fan of Wes Anderson movies but I really struggled with this one. The cast was amazing but the storyline was overcomplicated when it didn't have to be. He obviously didn't make this animated film about talking dogs, for a young market because I really can't see the political element being entertaining for kids. I did enjoy the emotional content, between the dog and the child, and the animation, which is the same as the Fantastic Mr. Fox, was unique but I did get a bit bored of the plot after a while. Anyway, the movie is set in the near future in Japan, were a canine flu virus spreads across the population, with a risk of crossing to humans. The mayor of Megasaki City, Kobayashi, signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, despite a scientist named Professor Watanabe insisting he is close to finding a cure for the dogs. The first to be exiled is Spots, who belonged to Atari Kobayashi, the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor. Six months later, Atari flies to trash island to try and find spots but his plane crashes, and a pack of dogs, led by Chief, rush to his rescue. When Atari tells the dogs about Spots, they agree to help him on his mission but Chief, a former stray, is reluctant to help humans. Chief decides to follow them on there journey and to seek advice from Jupiter and the Oracle. Meanwhile, Professor Watanabe finds a cure for the dog-flu but Kobayashi refuses to lift the dog ban. After criticizing Kobayashi's decision, Watanabe is put on house arrest and is killed by poisoned wasabi in sushi. A radical American exchange student, Tracy Walker, suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate. Kobayashi claims that Atari was kidnapped by the dogs and vows to kill them as punishment. During there journey, Chief and Atari are separated from the others, and they bond close together after Atari gives him a bath. When they finally rejoin the rest of the group, they come across a cannibal tribe of dogs but are ambushed by Kobayashi's men. Spot arrives with an army of dogs, and they fend off the assailants together. Spot reveals that he was rescued by the tribe, and he has become their leader. He has also mated with a female, who is pregnant, so he doesn't want to leave with Atari, even though he has risked his life to rescue him. He then reveals that Chief is his brother, so he transfers his protection duties for Atari, to Chief, even though Spot still loves Atari. The people of Megasaki believe that Atari is dead, and Kobayashi plans to exterminate all of the dogs in Trash Island, so when the dogs find out what is happening from a mysterious owl, they decide to make there way back to Megasaki. Meanwhile, Tracy is given the cure from Watanabe's ex-assistant, Yoko Ono, who confirms that her suspicions are correct about the corruption in office. When Tracy confronts Kobayashi with the evidence, he dismisses all of her information, and he orders her expulsion from Japan, back to the United States. When the dogs finally arrive at Megasaki, they prove that the cure works, which puts Kobayashi to shame in front of all of his supporters. He then revokes his decree but his right-hand man, Major Domo, insists on triggering the extermination. A fight then breaks out between Kobayashi and Domo in which the execute button is pressed but the poison backfires on the captors, thanks to some help from a hacker friend of Tracy's. Now you see what I mean about the movie being over complicated! With this amount of A Class actors, it didn't really smash the box office, and with the amount of hard work that goes into this type of animation, the movie should have been much better. The critics have given it high praise, and I personally haven't heard a bad word about it but it still wasn't my cup of tea. Dog lovers will be able to relate to the film in many ways, especially the relationship between Akira and Spot but I haven't got, or ever had a dog, which explains why I didn't get it. On the plus side, I did find some of the scenes funny, especially the smoked out fight scenes and some of the narrating but I expected more from this, somewhat warped minded director, who usually produces great work. Average!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Wes Anderson, who also brought you Bottle Rocket in 1996, Rushmore, the great Royal Tenebaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, the enjoyable Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom and the brilliant Grand Budapest Hotel. He's not one to release movies often, so when he's working on a project, he really does give it his all. He has directed some of my favourite movies, which is why I was really looking forward to this film but it let me down, just like the Fantastic Mr. Fox did. Although his films don't smash the box office, he has the ability to get some of the best actors in the world, due to his unique and fun style, which will stand the test of time.  \n\nBudget: N/A\nWorldwide Gross: $63million\n\nGenre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy\nCast: Bryan Cranston, Koyu Rankin, Edward Norton, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson, Harvey Keitel, F.

When this movie was nearing release, it was then that I realized that Wes Anderson is a man who likes his frames to be symmetrical. I thought it was just a stylistic choice for Fantastic Mr. Fox due to the fewer limitations of animation, however tedious stop-motion may be. Turns out I was wrong and it was present in his live-action films as well. Isle of Dogs shows that animated movies can have a rating stronger than PG without resorting to vulgar, South Park-style humour. Isle of Dogs is a charming, detailed adventure.

Highly ambitious, technically proficient occasionally brilliant., but oddly not very emotionally engaging.  While a quest for a boy for his dog, and the dog's loyalty to his master has many options to explore the reason for their mutual loyalty, it is strangely aloof.  The length is excessive and would have benefited from the same editing and brevity of a previous work, \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\".  Wes Anderson also seems to have gone to the well of excess found in most of Ralph Bakshi's work, Mighty Mouse being a notable exception.  More clipping and less padding would have been very welcome.  The voice work is fine, almost gifted, but much of the dialogue  seems stilted and forced to make a point.  This is a work worth a look but doubt if it will enter my rotation of repeat viewings.",

My only issue with the film is that the Japanese characters lack subtitles.

This movie gets bogged down by Wes\u2019s forced whimsy and smugness. The film seems more integrated to show you how clever it thinks it is rather than actually tell a compelling story. What a shame!

Needless to say, I was very much in the bag for the auteur's return to stop-motion animation after the delightful excursion that was 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox. And so, the question then surpasses that of expectation dictating the perceived outcome of a certain film, but rather to be that of if there is already this acceptance of quality due to the understanding of the passion, time, and care committed to a project then just how good is it exactly? Where does it rank among the director's already impressive catalogue? As the credits rolled on the brief feeling, but wholly satisfying Isle of Dogs it became infinitely more clear than it had a moment earlier when still in the midst of the film that while this may be Anderson's most outright imaginative take on a motion picture it is also the one that is most vague in regards to its intentions. Maybe memories of Fantastic Mr. Fox escape me or maybe I missed a thesis that Isle of Dogs states throughout its rather straightforward narrative, but what seems most likely is the fact Anderson intended this to be as simple as it could possibly be so that individual movie-goers might make of it as they please with the filmmaker himself only taking credit to the extent the experience of watching his film brought excesses of escapism and joy. There isn't a single aspect of that previous sentence I would disagree with in terms of how easy it is to be swept up in the world of Isle of Dogs and how effortlessly enjoyable the movie is, but there is no sense of real emotional investment to be conjured either. It's not a mandate that Anderson's films be emotionally involving which is to say the meaning of his movies rarely take center stage, but often times it's hard to avoid such because of the natural investment made in the compelling characters. In Isle of Dogs we have a pack of abandoned canines and a twelve year-old boy who doesn't speak English whom Anderson gives no subtitles and thus there is something of a disconnect, but despite these small quibbles (and trust me, that's all they really are) Isle of Dogs is a meticulously crafted, beautifully rendered, and pitch perfect Wes Anderson movie that positions the water cooler conversations to not be about what the film is discussing, but what the film is; not what it says, but how it makes you feel.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

            "content": "Isle of Dogs is director Wes Anderson's second venture into stop-motion animation following 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox and from a technical standpoint it's everything you expect. The story follows a young boy by the name of Atari (Koyu Rankin) who with the help of five dogs goes in search of his long lost dog Spots (Liev Schreiber) on Trash Island. When it comes to the animation, the cinematography, and the score this movie is exceptional and I expected nothing less from one of Anderson's films. He has a very specific quirky style that he brings out in each of his stories and it's what sets him apart from a number of other directors. However as far as the story and characters are concerned I wasn't really hooked throughout this entire film. I didn't feel much of a connection to the characters and the relationships and I didn't get enough from the story to really grab me and hook me in. There are some nice story beats here and there but for the most part I just personally couldn't get into it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLets begin with the cast because the list of A-list voice talent in here is so extensive I could go on for ages listing off everyone. There are strong performances from Jeff Goldblum (Duke), Bill Murray (Boss), Edward Norton (Rex), Bryan Cranston (Chief), Scarlett Johansson (Nutmeg), and Greta Gerwig (Tracy Walker) amongst others and everyone plays their role really well. As an ensemble they're a very talented bunch and each performance compliments the next to where there isn't really a clear standout role. And I actually like that about the film, of course some of the dogs get more screen-time and development than others but overall I remembered characters as part of a group as oppose to as individuals. So in terms of the storytelling don't get me wrong, it is very easy to follow, it's well written, theres the element of this dog and owner bond that works, but I personally wasn't extremely invested in what was going on. I don't think it has to do with Anderson's style of filmmaking or the stop-motion animation genre specifically as there are a films in both of those realms that I love. It might just be a combination of things from those realms and the way the story is told that I just didn't really gravitate towards. There is heart in the story and I feel like a lot of people will respond to that especially if they have experienced a strong bond with a dog in their life. As a whole however it didn't hit for me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut as I mentioned, from a technical standpoint this movie is exceptional. Everything is done with Wes Anderson's style in mind and it connects everything from the score to the cinematography and set-design in a fantastic way. This is always the clearest identifier to me that Wes Anderson is a phenomenal director in the way he manages to bring all of these departments together and express his unique style concurrently through all these avenues. Tristan Oliver is the cinematographer here who has worked on a number of stop-motion features including Anderson's last venture into the format, and his work is exceptional. Oliver applies his experience working on stop-motion projects and brings out that Wes Anderson quirkiness in every shot and scene transition, making the most of the format by executing things that can't be done in live action. Anderson re-teams once again with Alexandre Desplat who helms the score and it's a very playful and hard-hitting score that links with the tone of the story really well. It's such an integral part of each and every scene that it's almost impossible to ignore.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo, in the end Isle of Dogs is a film that as far as the story goes I personally didn't resonate with it as much, but on the technical side of things it's very meticulously crafted across a number of departments. Wes Anderson brings everything together and makes it all feel like a unified project with a single consistent tone evoked through the score and cinematography specifically. Fans of Anderson's work will no doubt get a lot out of this film including the story which I don't think is necessarily bad it just didn't work with me, and I know I'm in the minority there.\u00a0\n\n6/10",

As always, Mr. Anderson assembles a voice cast that perfectly characterizes his writing, translating whatever some might have considered pretentiousness into charming dictation and life.

Normally Wes Anderson's films are always full of heart and quirkiness, and his greatest works would occur when he could achieve a perfect balance between his warmhearted approach to the subject matters (even the darkest ones, some of which are heavily implied in this film) and his tendency to mark the subtlety of his film with bizarre characters, sentimental stories, and sometimes hilarious plot devices. This film leans a little bit to the quirky side, partly due to the somewhat limitation of the stop-motion format of this film in depicting human emotions, and also due Wes Anderson's over-reliance on playing with words and languages. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this film thoroughly for its amusing characters and chaotically optimistic plot, but more importantly, I admire Wes Anderson for his smart and surprisingly humanistic sarcasm while dealing with such poignant and relevant themes like racism, discrimination, public manipulation, propaganda, and desensitization of animal cruelty. A serious and frank depiction of tragedies is important, but a lighthearted caricature of the truth that can both entertain and evoke emotions from the audience is even more difficult, and sometimes more useful.",

            "content": "This canine-themed stop-motion beast wags its tail because of Anderson's filmmaking loftiness\n\nWes Anderson is not a cult artist, he's a prolific maestro. His films always enjoy an added cachet that positions them far above many only-entertainment flicks, and his latest classical animated jewel meets perfectly what one would expect from an indie author who has erected his sublime filmography frame by frame. It's neither a blatant cultural appropriation of East Asian culture nor a scurrilous Japanese stereotyped assortment drawn by an injurious foreigner, it's a beautifully hand-made and delicate love story, a widely different, a fertile pic in visible and veiled exclamations on freedom, press, politics, principles, fear, transformation, friendship and human and dog's life which feeds off from a top-of-the-range vocal cast and a visual and technical section as eccentric and neat as every of the narrative ambitions of a filmmaker who not only sets up a baroque addition to his exquisite filmography and artistic growth but imbues this high-concept film, with some complacency, of a razor-sharp, sophisticated allegory that is clearly geared to the grown-up minds, those who resist to consider art as a channel of trivial thoughts, not as a mechanism of inescapable contact and advancement. \n\nThere's no doubt that for Anderson's style newcomers the first thing they will highlight is tangibility of the pictures. Getting into the multiplex with a pre-established idea about how \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" director works is not helpful to prepare the senses, because it'd be minimizing part of their huge effort, every drop of beauty emerging from the screen is commendable, it's pure marvel. When the screening was over, the up-front reference that arose in my mind was the most recent piece of art of Laika Entertainment, \"Kubo and the Two Strings,\" not precisely by the concordance with the cultural basis or some moral similarities, but by the beautifully crafted creations, by being an invaluable gift for cinema, by the unspeakable visual prowess that hundreds of artists have built for us. The symmetrical compositions of the ever-perfectionist director who refuses to subdue his works under the phenomena of the digital age are straightforwardly glittering; a sharper aim to circumvent known superficialities and immerse it into the complicated, visually speaking, Japanese pulp places this film on a higher level in artistic terms, even unfolding the majority of the action on an adjacent island. Detail transmutes into obsession with the slightest manifestation of sumptuousness; the naturalness in its moves dazzles our perceptions which try to stumble upon a broken sequence, a malicious desire that, obviously, never will come true with Anderson at the helm. There are few human beings walking through the story because the canine leads are the ones who get most of the attention of the art departments; the dog's actions and activities enhance the progress of the plot thanks to the veracity of their behaviors, the domesticated animal par excellence is really here beyond the nearly human behavior given to them. More broadly, what decorates with personality the feast of strangely gorgeous frames is incredible and awardable cinematographer Tristan Oliver, rich in nuances and recesses endowing the pictures with irrepressible force which grows uncontrollably as the film runs, every frame is an authentic, finely crafted and shaped sculpture passing through the hands of hundreds of exquisite animators who with their talent, literally and figuratively, capture the obsessions of an animation maestro; a spellbinding experience. It's worth highlighting the majestic score by the most recent Oscar winner for Best Original Score Alexandre Desplat, who again is running for a golden nomination in the awards. Like Ludwig G\u00f6ransson for Marvel Studios' \"Black Panther,\" he's a composer who knows how to channel well traditional drum sounds and Oriental instruments in which the feature film develops, he mixes them with his own ideas, creating a portentous whole, here, musical accompaniment is vital for the sensory process in the cinematic experience; his score is volatile, energetic and powerful, but at the same time fine, sensitive and adequate, candid and completely exciting.  \n\n\nAnderson isn't only known for his peculiar and unpractical but extremely gratifying filming method, the textual motives that mobilize such handmade constructions intervene in the success of the narrations. The script is written undeniable by the American director because the characteristics of a concise writer arise, sensitive in a given moment, but coolly manipulative when the film itself requires it. With regard to the dicey, well-intentioned plot, it's conceived by eight hands with own name and recognition: Kunichi Nomura, in his first work as a writer; Jason Schwartzman, in his third experience as a film screenwriter; Roman Coppola, in one of the greatest successes of his career; and Wes Anderson, a man who doesn't need a description, just run and get covered with his artistic visions. The perspective he gives the story is simply unique, social and pleasantly revitalizing not only due to the fussy field of animation but the drama genre lines it uses with an unusual confidence in levels of conviction and coherence with respect to a plot that doesn't set in an explicitly human context, in the strictest sense of the word. The spark of the script gives brilliance to the plot needs and intransigent twists, besides, comedy is handled surgically in the narrative, becoming it a crucial point on the mere fact that the gradual and unexpected humor threads compose and speed up the pace of a non-commercial film, one that does have to defend against other mega-budget opponents. The most unfocused and less determined who attend the multiplex will delight with the elements manufacturing a beautiful surface, however, the most observant and connoisseurs of the filmmaker's style will get out of the theater with a radically different perception, a sharper, more complicated and risky one that touched on polarizing and delicate current problems concerning the whole world. In addition to its frank animalistic message, the script keeps going its critical purpose in every approach it proposes, criticisms that never boss around the characters to get their tasks, but rather they boss around every spectator's intellect to try to play with what it considers to be right and wrong, ironically, expressed through a canine tale. \n\n\nGenerally speaking, Anderson delivers an editing style I have never seen before, telling his story in two languages (English and Japanese) and opposing completely to dubbing, he warns with complacency, after the unforgettable opening credits, the way how he will approach the narrative, presenting the rules of the universe he created and you have to accept to get lost in, whether you want or not. The film always gets a way to literally translate most of the foreign dialogue, however, it's here where his filmmaking method comes into play to underline that the most important characters are the animals, the Americanized canines, who capture all their attention and effort. It's also widely appreciated the work done by the incorrigible voices of post-modern American and European acting patrons and matrons- it's not really difficult to hide the disparity between men and women again. - Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Greta Gerwig,  Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Scarlett Johansson or important Oriental exponents such as Yoko Ono, Kunichi Nomura or young player Koyu Rankin perform a dubbing work motivated by dedication, enthusiasm and, of course, the pride of joinig forces with one of the most old-school and perfectionist directors currently working. The excellent vocal cast is undoubtedly one of the strengths and main thrusters for the organic, charismatic and dynamic functioning of the ambitious idea.\n\n\n\"Isle of Dogs\" by Wes Anderson mesmerizes from beginning to end, partly by its mania of playing with the high expectations always put on a director's job. Accessible and sophisticated, strategic and human, hilarious and dramatic, strangely beautiful and directed; this animated film is an undeniable love letter from the filmmaker to Oriental culture, canines and, beyond doubt, the recesses and perversities of the feelings, actions and inspirations of humankind; A feature film that produces juicy critical, controversial commentaries through generally opposed elements that are quickly woven on a story led by any manifestation of love, prioritizing narrative, technical and artistic fields with the proportionality only a maestro could handle. If you want to enjoy a good movie you will have many more options to choose from, but if you demand a top-notch film you will be welcome to watch as a stop-motion animation monster puts an actor, screenwriter, producer and director- uninterested in making movies for an Oscar - on the front page, a place he has never gotten out from.",

Hell, every Wes Anderson venture gets assigned the same dozen adjectives, including \"whimsical\" and \"fairy-tale-esque.\"  I prefer another word.  Brilliant.  Set in a dystopian Japan, where Tokyo is being governed by a pseudo-fascist mayor with a vendetta against dogs, all canines are exiled to a hellish island.  The mayor's nephew goes on a quest to find his own dog and comes across a gang of mutts with goals of their own.  Interestingly, a good chunk of the film's dialogue is in unsubtitled Japanese, as spoken by the humans.  Our canine protagonists speak English and it is quite clear from this forced perspective (at least for Western audiences) that we are to view things from their point of view.  Isle of Dogs is a stop-motion animated movie, and while one may jump for joy that we have an animated children's movie that is not Pixar-style CGI, it's hard not to draw comparisons to Fantastic Mr. Fox.  Fox was a bit deeper and bolder, but Isle ends up being more entertaining and approachable for children.  The voice cast is EXACTLY who you would pick considering who shows up for 90% of this director's filmography and they are superb.  But it's Bryan Cranston who does a lot of the heavy lifting and I would include this among his best work in the last few years.  Yeah, I said that.  Isle of Dogs is a smart and funny movie for older children and a probably a welcome relief to their parents, if they so choose to put this up on Netflix in a few months.  Oh, and play it back to back with Moonrise Kingdom.  That's still Wes Anderson's best wide release.",

Many of the issues are ones that our society is dealing with today. Racism, Immigration, Fake News, Proporganda, and the power of the youth are all present here. Wes Anderson absolutely knows that parents and teenagers do pay attention and understand these issues. Themes and issues aside, Isle of Dogs is also a pretty great film. The art direction is beautiful as is the cinimeatography too. Each shot can be bleak with grayness, then the next shot can be bursting with color and a feast to the eyes. The characters are also greatly expanded on but my only issue was the reliance on flashback scenes. It\u2019s not a big flaw, but it did take my expeirence down a few noches. Isle of Dogs PG-13 rating also comes with plenty violence to be thrown into the mix as well. In conclusion, Isle of the Dogs is a new style of animation tackling our society\u2019s biggest issues while still offering a action packing thrilling and colorful adventure the whole way through",

The work that went behind the stop-motion is admirable and quite finely detailed too but when it comes to draw the emotions out from the screen, it isn't utterly adequate. The writing is strong, witty and fast paced (especially in its first act) which should have come off in its favor, but due to multiple characters and their sub-plots that it has to cover in such short runtime (around 100 minutes), there is very little space for the audience to breathe in. Wes Anderson's world is definitely different than its usual features and the irony in here is that, \"this\" is a simpler and asymmetrical one . A decent job on giving the voice by the star cast to these eerie characters and so was the choice on casting them. Isle Of Dogs is an intriguing feature to encounter where the execution is genuinely effective and lures you in within few minutes making the audience work for it and sweeps away its runtime like a charm but the only thing that itches you throughout the course is the writing which unfortunately isn't as convoluted as the makers think.",

At the same time the very Kurosawa-esque film feels like a foreign language film especially for it's foreign setting and use of the Japanese Language contrasting with a lot of English dialogue too, but it's very effective as I also don't think cultural contextualization and appropriation isn't antagonized or dissuaded as the setting and civilization serves the film well. Every shot is like a painting or a piece of authentic Japanese puppetry, beautifully detailed and constructed as if I'm almost watching a piece of Anime or Kabuki put together in such vivid and ecstatic composition.

Here's what made this movie so incredible:  the cinematography was purposely innovative that the times I had to blink were inconvenient given I did not want to look away for a single second,  the plot was so heartfelt and relevant that even the most cynical viewer would be hard challenged to not be engrossed by the uplifting nuances, and finally the editing, tone, and pacing were masterfully accomplished to savant proportions of skill.  I am always pleased when my expectations as a viewer are surpassed and I expected nothing less from Wes Anderson.

            "content": "WARNING, this review would contain some spoilers:\n\nAnimation was pretty good, but the story lacked heart and the ending felt like Pitch Perfect 3's. It felt really rushed. It's as if SOMETHING had to be neatly wrapped up in the last few minutes and then it just did. Not only did the ending feel forced and awkward, the romance and the characters themselves felt that way too. You know, \"She fell in love, one teardrop\". This movie is definitely a Wes Anderson movie, and I'm saying that in a mixed way.  It's as if I've seen the movie before, but it feels like a rerun rather than a nice warm familiar feeling, like seeing an old friend. Isle of Dogs has a Wes Anderson style, which is recognizable, it's good! But it also follows the Wes Anderson format of \"deadpan character with one spunky love interest\" too closely. Unlike Fantastic Mr. Fox, the mood just did not work as well as that film did. For example, the love between Mr. and Mrs. Fox was already well established, and Ash's character worked quite well. Unique names, like Kristofferson, fit since it felt like a fun kid's movie. Unfortunately, Isle of Dogs didn't do quite do so well with that because of several reasons. It's rated PG-13 and some scenes are a bit awkward to watch with your kid. Mixing those scenes up with \"lighthearted names and exaggerations\" made the mood feel very out of place, and not in a good way. It feels as if someone wanted both \"realistic\" and \"stylized\" gesture and the figure turned out to have wrong proportions. The exaggeration also come in forms of cheap stereotypes. The Japanese characters themselves felt like they were reduced to stereotypes at times. Like for instance, the scientist's wife was named Yoko Ono, the mayor is named after the hot dog eating champion, the kid's name was named after a video game console... It's like naming someone John Lennon, Bay, and XBox, it's kinda awkward... It has the campiness but not the charm as other Wes Anderson movies had. Not to mention Kobayashi says \"Risupekuto\" a lot. It's kinda a bit like Apu's \"Thank you, come again\" catchphrase. Again, really awkward, and we need to address that. Not to mention it was very reminiscent of Logan Paul yelling \"Japan is all about respect\" while disrespecting everything about the country. While not to that caliber of Logan Paul of course, it is reminiscent and it felt like Japan was more a playground than anything. Some of the usage of the iteration marks and the kanji was wrong and plainly used for aesthetic. It's like the graphics department went to Google Translate and went \"okay that looks like a newspaper ad!\" You know, how JRPGS and Anime have really awkward English wording and something doesn't feel quite right? It's very much like that. Pretty awkward. Also... Megasaki... omg... Bluntly put, this movie felt as if Coachella was an indie film. Or more accurately a movie version of Panda Express, it's kiiinda like Asian food, there are Asians working there, but you know something feels a bit off. Japan felt like it was used as a prop. I can't even hear some of what the Japanese characters are saying because it's muffled more than the English voices. However,  the movie does provide a little bit of humor for people who can speak Japanese and does give some familiarity, such as what news anchors say when moving onto new topics. But, for the most part, Japan felt like it was used as a backdrop and very much as if it was \"wonders of the orient\" than it being an actual country with actual people. His storytelling was all over the place. Combined with the Wes Anderson style, Isle of Dogs felt as if someone locked eyes with you as they told a long story with many run-on sentences. The animation however, was pretty good, and the artistic choice of not using subtitles made it feel more wholesome, I'd admit. I also got to give props to giving the Japanese characters actual Japanese voice actors. However, most of the culture was caricatured and not handled that well and some parts needed to be handled a little better. I personally do not mean to be viewed as an attack on Wes Anderson, I think he's a very hard-working director, but there are many issues we must address in future movies to come. Technical and cultural. For that I must rate it 1 and a half stars, sorry.",

This beautiful stop-motion film inhabits the dog world of Japan. More specifically Trash Island where the canine population have been dumped and isolated due to a corrupt local government intent on eradication. What ensues is a fight for survival as the barely surviving dogs band together to gain their life back with the help of some eager young people who are on their side. It's film with that subtly lovely humour we are familiar with plus great melancholy and also sadness. A great and huge cast voice superbly and of course the score and production design are totally on point. It also sends a very strong message about the dangers of exclusion, inclusion and discrimination. It's a film that whilst it unlays its pleasures will also make you think.",

This film is one for all the people, die-hard Anderson lovers and people who just want to be entertained.

By decree of the mayor, all dogs get exiled to Trash Island, but what is to happen when the mayor's son (Koyu Rankin) stages a rescue mission so as to be reunited with his lost dog?  Now my friends never really understand this about me, but I do not consider myself to be all that big of a fan of Wes Anderson's library.  I tend to appreciate almost all of his movies, I just don't share the same rabid passion that most of his fans seem to carry for his films.  My wife, on the other hand, has been a fan since the beginning.  Either she has rubbed off on me or I've just changed my opinion since The Grand Budapest Hotel, but I was really excited for Isle of Dogs.  I did not leave the theater disappointed.  Now while this is animation, you shouldn't be fooled into thinking that this is a kid's movie.  While this is always a comedy, there are darker moments that are ever present.  These dogs have all seen better days, so they deal with fighting, missing body parts and even death, so smaller children might get disturbed by this.  Like Fantastic Mr. Fox, this is stop motion, which is a mind-boggling amount of legwork.  When combined with a director that is so obsessed with visual perfection like Wes Anderson, I can't even begin to fathom the number of man hours that went into this.  The proof is in the pudding, and the movie ends up largely succeeding on the whole.  All of the voice acting is well done from a star-studded cast, but Bryan Cranston turns in especially good work as the lead dog, Chief.  I know I wasn't all that positive about Kung Fu Panda 3, but this makes me want to see more of him in animated films.  He ends up holding the movie together, and I especially liked the relationship between him and the kid.  They also made the gutsy choice of not giving subtitles for the Japanese characters.  They wanted to stress the communication between species without fully understanding what the other is saying, and that isn't something that most movies would even dare attempt.  Even though this is an abbreviated 101 minutes, I did feel the length, and it ends up feeling about 15 minutes too long.  It's all good material that was crafted by a man who holds his creation precious and dear to him, so it is not that much of a detriment, but it still could have potentially made this movie a classic if it had some tightening up.  Isle of Dogs isn't a movie that is necessarily for everyone, but you should at the very least be able to appreciate the artistry and craft behind it.",

            "content": "Not since I saw Joel and Ethan Coen's Hail, Caesar! have I felt so baffled by a prominent director's meticulously detailed passion project. Now, in both instances, I have almost come to resent them for it. Both films are about so many things, but drawn along their respective existential narratives they fail to evoke any sort of emotional response. The significance of their setting and characters seem both essential and pointless at the same time. However, where there at least seems to be a thesis hidden inside Hail, Caesar!'s disjunctive series of homages to golden-era Hollywood amidst black-lists and red scares, Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs is either too simplistic a story for its rich Japanese dystopian fantasy setting or a high concept puppet show strung thin by too many stylistic diversions.\n\nThere are two main decisions that Anderson has made that I find fascinatingly off-putting. The first is that, amidst this exquisitely crafted stop-motion film, he has intercut layers upon layers of alternate forms of animation. Some of it is hand drawn or painted, some is CGI, and some of it is cut-out. All of these mediums are usually found sparingly in other features as well, but here they are jarringly, seemingly arbitrarily spliced in, sometimes tastefully and sometimes, it appears, because it would be too much hassle to do stop-motion. For instance, Atari's showdown with the robo-dogs at the sluice would have probably been a nightmare to frame, choreograph, and pose. I can look past this jarring effect by explaining away that if any filmmaker has ever had a clear cut vision of his composition it would be Anderson, and that was his intended purpose. I can certainly appreciate if he is trying to break out of his usually style of doing things, but I don't know if that's necessarily a good decision.\n\nThe other decision is that of setting it in Japan, with only occasionally translated Japanese dialogue, in homage to centuries of Japanese theater and art, then utilizing that as a fetishistic  backdrop to a completely predictable adventure plot. There's the language barrier which he dispatches with all manners of convoluted devices for basic storytelling necessity, some more absurdly frustrating than they're worth. Compounding this is Anderson's trademark twee, existential emotionality to and from his characters, that coldness that makes the whole production feel like a science fair display. In many of his films this works to the advantage, offering levity to a dark situation or a clinical edge to an otherwise emotionally uncomfortable subject. Here it just accentuates how these lifeless simulacra are going through the motions of telling a story you've heard before. You could set this movie anywhere but Japan, but you wouldn't be able to appropriate the entirety of Japanese culture for your grotesquely cute doll/dog house film.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something vital to the concept of the film, but it almost seems exploitative to set a movie in what is for all intents and purposes Fukushima when the characters simply inhabit that wasteland without engaging with it politically. Sure, the concepts of media manipulation, environmentalism, and political opportunism are woven into the framework, but something is missing in this fertile metaphoric territory. Man's best friend being relegated to an island of trash could point to any number of ideas, or nothing at all. I'm not asking for a map, but it just doesn't make a statement. What are we supposed to connect with here? The boy and his dog? The political struggle? The eccentric cast of English speaking dogs? This clash of western and eastern seems urbane yet pointless...except it's a great opportunity for Anderson to cram Kabuki, Katsushika Hokusai, samurais, Godzilla, sushi, Yasujiro Ozu, and Akira Kurosawa references into one film. It's impossible to discard the amount of care and craft that went into the visual elements of this film, but the intellectual core of the film is nebulous.",

I didn't even try who was voicing what character because I was too busy looking at them.\n\nThe story is really simple as basically all dogs are banished to a garbage dump island and a boy goes looking for the one who was his special pet.\n\nUpfront I am not a Wes Anderson fan and he wrote and directed this film but it is the animators who really deserve all the credit along with the production designers who make each dog expressive, interesting and fun to watch.\n\nNot mentioning names but I do know someone who saw it and fell asleep a few times more than he normally does-and, no, it's not Allen! Unless you love dogs and animation \"Isles of  Dogs\" is not a film for you.",

The film's ensemble voice cast includes Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Courtney B. Vance, Fisher Stevens, Harvey Keitel, Liev Schreiber, Bob Balaban, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, F. Murray Abraham, Frank Wood, Kunichi Nomura and Yoko Ono. (Wikipedia)\nThis film is a thing of beauty the amount of work that goes into Stop-motion is amazing. If you enjoyed Fantastic Mr. Fox or any other Wes Anderson films then you will love this as it follows the same style and humor. The story it tells is interesting and original\n. \nThis film is a must see I recommend seeing it in the theaters such as at your local Goodrich Quality Theaters. Its beauty is something to see on the big screen I have already watched it twice and it got better the second time. When it come to home video this will be a buy on 4K or blu-ray just so you can appreciate the amount of work that goes into these films and the details into how to achieve effects like a dust cloud from a fight that breaks out.",

His side to side camera sweeps and obsessive-to-the-point-of-insanity symmetry shots may be characteristic, but it also means that every single one of his projects looks the same, and carries the same tone. The story was mostly enjoyable, as was the voice acting from the stellar cast, but it failed to connect with me because the techniques employed always felt like self-satisfied quirks rather than methods of generating emotion. To me, Mr. Anderson always seems more interested in pleasing himself than pleasing us, and as such I feel I may never come to love, or even really like, any of his past or future endeavours.",

The comedy, the gags, and the visual style had me laughing right from the outset. It features some unusual techniques with split screens etc, and these all proved very effective. A surprising delight was also the music, which was played throughout most of the movie, and enhanced the suspense. Overall this was a very different, quirky but entertaining animated movie.

This sci-fi-comedy-adventure touches on topics like political corruption, media, oppression, and even the Holocaust. However, the Mad-Gab-esque title (\"I Love Dogs\") really lets you know what the film's aims are. A visually captivating and heartfelt stop-motion film, it's main goal and success is as an unabashed rub-on-the-belly for man's best friend. \nSet 20 years in the future, a young boy is goes searching for his beloved pet after all of Japan's dogs have been exiled to a garbage-dump-island. Full of deadpan humor and detailed history, the world-building is fantastic. As with many of Anderson's films, it's filled with small touches (hilarious haikus, surprisingly complex dog characters) that envelope an audience despite the intentional stiffness in the delivery. And of course, there's his signature visual style. Here we're given a technical adeptness in the animation styles that makes this even more aesthetically stunning than normal, along with the extreme symmetry and dry emotions.\nFor me, Anderson's style has always been one that I could never quite embrace the way others do. Where many see it as distinct and engaging, I often find it makes his films colder and more distant than they might otherwise feel. Those feelings still popped up here for me, an undeniable sense of cloying cuteness and self-parody. However, with Isle of Dogs those negatives only serve to highlight how great the visual achievements, subtle laughs and story constructs are here. Artfully attentive and original, this may not convert audiences either for or against Anderson, but it's still a cute entry into his unmistakable repertoire.",

This fact has the weight of history behind it and the science that has made this animal the most diverse on the planet.\n      Another is that those dog lovers intentionally, unintentionally, or unwittingly personify their dogs, interweaving unique canine traits with human strengths and frailties. \n      Wes Anderson (director), a probable army of creative geniuses, and talented (voice) actors (notably Bryan Cranston and Scarlett Johansson) used these characteristics to produce a compelling fable that combined both marvelous entertainment with thoughtful social issues (such as the power of propaganda and the devotion needed to overcome it).\n      By the dog's communications being the primary viewer understanding (it is pointed out at the beginning that all dog barking has been translated into English) and most of the direct human communication being in Japanese (which the dogs - and most viewers - don't understand), Anderson craftily places the viewer among the dogs. Dog personification doesn't get any better than that.\n      Add the adroit use of adorable dog mannerisms and stop-motion animation at levels that blew my mind (\"how do they do that\" echoed in my head throughout) there is no way a dog lover can leave that movie unsatisfied.  Or is there?\n     My wife responded to my plaudits as we left the theater, \"...oh sure you loved it, you love all that weird crap\". Yes, if you're looking for a Disney style of animation and story telling you might be in for sensory overload. However, if you open your mind I think this film will open your heart.\nhttps://winkyandstinky.blogspot.com/",

Thankfully most of us are in the audience instead, which means a totally opposite, enjoyable experience.\n\nAs with all past efforts, \"Isle of Dogs\" is a staggering visual feast, and because this is animation (a stop motion, retro futuristic, Japanese one), it is chock full of exquisite canvasses, complex graphics, and stunning originality. It's easy to get caught up in the eye candy, but what is truly revelatory here is the stunning audio that envelops the theatre. Remember all that fuss about surround sound? Well, we finally have proper use, and with several instances - a fabulous drumming sequence, and a haunting dog howling - it is glorious.\n\nOh there's a story as well, which is the usual, meandering vehicle that strings together all the fun bits, and is perhaps the most traditional of Anderson's jaggedy plot lines. Plus it's full of dogs. Superb.\n\n- hipCRANK",

The animation alone is worth seeing, and you can tell wes anderson and the entire team put a lot of effort and passion into the set pieces and animation.\n\nshifting to the story which is the main reason, then it's a solid story. it has a unique flare of a serious story, but with a lot of dry humor and over the top moments to make it feel light heart. what makes this story works so well is the characters. for starters the boy only speaks in japanese, and without subtitles. it's a risk wes took, and it works well. same thing for many of the japanese cast members, and it gives it a more unique flair how many don't, or rarely speak english. even when they speak english, then i can catch their accent which makes it feel real from personal experience. meanwhile the dog cast is amazing. bryan cranston puts in an amazing performance, and his character has the best development. it will make sense why he has the most development when you see it.  his supporting characters including Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, and bob balabon were amazing. they help drive the simple story of a boy finding his dog, but there is much more then that. i won't spoil it, but you'll see a well thought out story.\n\nfinally the music is amazing. the music is unique, and relies heavily on taiko drums which are amazing.

And this voice cast, my god this voice cast: Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Courtney B. Vance, Harvey Keitel, Liev Schreiber, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Yoko Ono, and many more. Everyone involved is amazing, and Alexandre Desplat's music here is magical each time you hear it. The animation style here along with the production design, absolutely stunning. And the fact that this is such a mature film, rather violent at times and clearly aimed at an older audience.\n\nThe dialogue and narration really stand out in this film. The Japanese characters speaking Japanese with no subtitles provided for the audience is such a great choice. This is done because the dogs are hearing the language but don't understand, so we are listening from their perspective. It's really well-done. There's a strange subplot involving Greta Gerwig's character, however, that doesn't do much for the main story. It really drags the film down quite a bit. There are also quite a few flashbacks thrown in at the most inconvenient times, as the plot tries to move along. Those are really the main issues with this film - pacing. But it is a wonderful story, with amazing animation and music. I highly recommend it.",

How the confusion of the characters allows us as the audience to think later on how that confusion came about is excellent storytelling and narrative. Wes Anderson's ability to beautifully tell a story is why I think so many people are drawn to his movies. However, the only thing that was missing here was the dark sarcastic comedy that you expect in these movies. The visual beauty and the dark story provide a certain equilibrium for Wes Anderson films. Here Wes Anderson had some subtle darkness which the protagonists seemed to cut through with little difficulty. So while I greatly enjoyed this film, I did not find it to be perfect.",

            "content": "Impressive animation film that tells a great story in a witty, light hearted way. \nBefore watching this film, my impression of it was so-so. It didn't have really crazy explosive animation. The trailer was overly simple and didn't give much of a preview at all. After watching the film, I have to say this is an unforgettable film and I can watch it again next week. \nImmediately in the open, you will realized the music is extremely captivating. The Japanese big drum (tai-ko) was so much fun to watch and listen to. Picture to music is seemlessly put together. Appropriate sound track with each moment and each scene. Everything flows really well, from one to the next! Each scene, the music conveying an emotion before the dialogue. This really helps with the some of the parts that did not have a translation, because music is universal language; the thrill, darkness, loneliness, romance, dangers...etc. were exact and correct feelings that it's trying to convey. Can't wait for the original sound track in my Apple Music ! \nGreat visual, character design and development! First of all, I didn't know the style of this type of animation is called \"stop-motion animation\". Instead of drawing or illustration, they use puppets or action-figure for each second in motion, which is very impressive. The personification of each doggie, you can definitely see the social references. Chief, Rex, King, Boss, Duke are speaking in English the whole time, and they use democratic voting system formed a pact in order to survive in the abandonment island. Within the pack, Chief is the stray dog, who never has a master, of course never bathed or loved also. Therefore he is very rebellious and doesn't wanna be obedient. Rex is an indoor territorial dog with a nice life. King is popular commercial acting dog. Boss is the sportsman. Duke is high maintenance social elite. Nutmeg is the show dog/showgirl, later on has a romance with one of the pact member. The dialogue among these little creatures are fast, funny and packed with content and details. You immediately can find all these characters in our current society perhaps in ourselves as well! Director Wes Anderson and the other writers must have very in-depth knowledge of different and current social groups. Within the dialogue there are really sensitive informations and feelings, the writers use clever ways to carry these out without being offensive and degrading. I loved it! \nThe storyline or actually storylines! Yes I think there are many stories actually are happening at the same time. The complications and intricacies of writing is shocking! I think there are: 1. Political line(the mayor with cat business) 2. Hero line(Atari saving his pet) 3. Romance line(Nutmeg and Chief) 4. Camaraderie line(the pact of 5 dogs) 5. Long lost sibling line(Chief and Spots) 6. Leader follower relationship line(Atari and the dogs) 7. Conspiracy Theorist line(Tracy Walker of the student protestors). And the whole movie ended on the next generation of a new beginning! From prologue to the body, and to the end, every of storyline is entangled and intertwined with each other, scene after scene. Crossover with forward development and revealing stories one after another, pushing into a very explosive climax in part four: Atari's lantern. Okay that's it for now, I don't like spoilers. \nTempo is perfect. Most of the Japanese hybrid production normally has really good speed. There are a lot of slow vs. fast to create dynamic moments. Powerful ability in picture telling stories. Everything is calm and balanced, at the same time dynamic and dramatic. It really shows how can a few pictures tell more than thousand words. That's another reason why I think the non-translated parts were not an issue. It's fun to watch, easy to understand everything and I really enjoyed this great piece of art work!\nIn cinematography, there are a lot of balanced shot throughout the movie. The amount of balanced shots are actually at an OCD level. This is definitely a good thing for this animation film. There are a lot of content in each picture, especially the background design and illustration are so amazing. You get to sit back, relax and enjoy the story and the beauty uninterruptedly. Great way of presenting a motion picture in such way. The screen can be attractive to audience without being obnoxious or overly in your face. Parts of the film reminded me of \"Kill Bill\". The by-parts way of telling a story, music, scene style, whistling, zoom-in in the eyes with dramatic emotions. Overall it's highly artistic!\nThe social and cultural stories embedded much deeper than the animation. The gullible citizens just do what the government promotes. The government's  hidden \"kitty business\". People fight for the loved ones. Student protestor whose looking for the truth. All these are carried out by 5 cute little abandoned pets, who are the voiceless victims! It revealed a lot of stories and issues to mass audience on a witty simple level. \nI would give this movie a Solid A!",

I loved some scenes and endured others, but overall it was a pleasant surprise, far exceeding my admittedly low expectations.\n\nAs one might expect, there are a lot of dogs. We're told the dogs are barking like normal dogs but that their barks are conveniently translated into English. They aren't wise-cracking dogs like those in kids' movies and they aren't dogs-in-name-only like Brian on \"Family Guy\", but rather they're dogs who act like dogs but have human-like personalities.\n \nThe plot involves dogs being banished to a place called \"Trash Island\", purportedly because a dog flu is spreading through a large Japanese city, but also because the evil mayor's family has been nursing a dog-hating grudge for centuries. The first dog to be sent away is Spots, the guard dog of Atari, a 12-year-old orphan who's the mayor's ward. It seems strange that the mayor would give Atari a dog in the first place if he so hates dogs, but most of the details of this film are best not thought about.\n\nAnyway, six months after Spots gets sent away, Atari manages to steal a small plane and fly it to the island, where he crash lands. There he meets a pack of five dogs (voiced by famous human actors who I don't feel like listing), and upon showing them a picture of Spots, they agree to help search for him. \n\nI forgot to mention that the movie is set twenty years in the future, which mostly manifests itself in the form of enhanced weaponry and vicious robot dogs that are sent to retrieve Atari. The fight scenes are boring and stupid, except for the big gray ball of cotton fluff with dog appendages jutting out at various angles which is used to depict the melees, and that is only amusing the first time. \n\nWhile the dog pack and Atari search for Spots, there's also stuff going on on the mainland. A scientist and his assistant search for a cure for dog flu while a young foreign exchange student with a blonde afro heads up a pro-dog movement\n. \nPretty much everything on the mainland feels unnecessarily complicated and confusing and not even worth trying to make sense of, though it's sometimes visually interesting. By contrast, the stuff involving Atari and the dogs is funny and charming and occasionally even touching. If only Anderson could just keep things simple and stop trying so hard to impress.\n \nFor me, the good far outweighed the barely tolerable with my love of dogs tipping the scales in the movie's favor. Two opposable thumbs up.",

            "content": "Isle of Dogs confirms that in animation form, Wes Anderson can truly let his quirky sensibilities cut loose. His latest film is bursting with brilliant sight gags and tangible animation. Each frame is packed with detail and the film absorbs you right into its world. And while the animation and the director's witty humor, which is at peak power here, are both great, the story here is also powerful in ways I wasn't expecting. Politically fueled, the narrative concerns a young Japanese boy and his search on a trash island with hundreds of dog exiles, and what could have been a simple charmer, is actually a biting satire of the follies of leadership from those not fit to be in power. All of this is told with a light, albeit scolding finger wag, and Anderson makes sure the delightful characters and charm come through most. What results, if one can see past some questionable cultural adaptation, is a joyous and bittersweet adventure that highlights man's best friend. If the story wraps up too briskly, the film's images will be floating around the mind for a while. Already a strong contender for Animated Feature at the Oscars. Rating: 86",

Of course, the real star is Wes Anderson's writing/directing, who crafts a strange but beautiful world that makes great use of the stop motion techniques (perfect to Anderson's perfectly placed scenes).  It also has the right mix of humor & heart, as their are plenty of eccentric jokes but also a great story about a boy who loves his dog.  It should be  noted this film is a PG-13 for a reason, and clearly aimed for adult audiences, but if you are a Wes Anderson fan, this just might be his best film yet.",

Their solution to the problem is to send all dogs to Trash Island where they can scavenge for themselves. A little boy from Japan named Atari, the mayor\u2019s son, flies over to the island to look for his dog, Spots, and a group of dogs journey in help to find him. So this movie had a limited release I think about a month ago. It was given a lot of praise and buzz so last week there was a little bit of a wider release. This week it finally got a wide release. This movie was great! Unique and original. All of the voice actor were amazing. It\u2019s almost like the characters they had were a reflection of themselves. The stand out for me were Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, and finally Koyu Rankin as Atari. I like Wes Anderson\u2019s idea for stop motion. This is his second stop motion movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox being his first. Alexandre Desplat creates a great score, like he always does. The only flaws I had were that there was a side plot with one character that wasn\u2019t necessary, but I still liked it. Some scenes dragged on just a little too. Other than that I thought Isle of Dogs was a great movie and people should go see it, as our theatre only sold 5 tickets altogether last night. My Grade: A-",

            "content": "\"Isle of Dogs\" reminds me of a mountain of rich chocolate ice cream: it's tantalizing to look at and you can't wait to dive in, but after you get two thirds of the way through, brain freeze and the overwhelming sweetness cause you to push the dish away. The cloying saccharine feeling comes in the form of the film's script, a disappointing case of too many cooks in the kitchen (with four \"story by\" credits, including director / screenwriter Wes Anderson, Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman, and Kunichi Nomura), but the cherry on top is Anderson's signature meticulous visual organization and balanced, proportional order that won't disappoint his longtime fans.\n\nThis beautiful looking film is absolutely pitch perfect in the classic Anderson style, brimming with a symmetrical, colorful, indie hipster aesthetic. Everything here is astonishingly stunning to look at, from the charming stop-motion animation jerk of a dog's strut to brief forays into chromatic-hued, hand drawn sketches to a character's perfectly lopsided freckles. This movie is not only stunning, it's the best looking film since last year's \"Blade Runner 2049\" (although in a completely different, winsomely twee way).\n\nComplementing the knockout visuals is a charming story about a young boy's undying devotion for his dog and a dog's everlasting loyalty to his master. It's a real love letter to our four-legged friends and may bring tears to the eyes of anyone who has ever lived with a companion animal.\n\nThe film is set in Japan with a large amount of dialogue spoken in the native tongue (the barks from the dogs, a title card teases, have been translated into English). After an outbreak of canine flu leads to all dogs being quarantined on Trash Island, a heroic young boy named Atari (Koyu Rankin) commandeers a plane and crash lands on the island to rescue his dog Spots (Liev Schreiber). Atari seeks help from a pack of exiled canines including Boss (Bill Murray), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Rex (Edward Norton), and Chief (Bryan Cranston). As the gang of misfits traverse the landscape and news of their adventure reaches the mainland, they inspire a group of pro-dog student activists to help uncover and expose an evil government conspiracy.\n\nThe voice talent is tremendous and no one, not even Murray or Frances McDormand as a narrator called Interpreter Nelson, feels like a case of stunt casting. Cranston again shows there's nothing he can't do well, lending a stark and poignant empathy as the voice of Chief. Harvey Keitel, as penitent, remorseful dog Gondo who is forced to turn into something horrific as an act of mercy, is another surprising standout in a crowded cast of accomplished performers. (The time to remind parents that this is not a film for the kiddos is now). The only real acting misstep comes from Greta Gerwig's robotic and stiff turn as unlikely exchange student turned revolutionary Tracy, a small yet meaningful character who could've (and should've) been so much more.\n\nAnderson's detail oriented direction often makes me unconditionally giddy and this time around is no exception. Every little clothes button and curly hair and old timey microphone is so reverently and affectionately placed that you'd have to watch this film at least a dozen times to fully appreciate the utmost care and meticulous precision that is on display. This works tenfold when it comes to the visual creativity, but it also is something that hurts the film's narrative.\n\nThe screenplay feels like it was diagrammed and workshopped to death, rigid and tense, planned out and so carefully plotted to the point that it loses all of its thunder. The social commentary sadly becomes tiresome, and the witty cleverness is drowned out by the oft-putting smugness and pretension. The only thing that's truly disappointing about \"Isle of Dogs\" is the long-winded script.\n\nWhile it may not be one of Anderson's very best works, it's still a brilliant, charismatic, beautiful looking movie. The stop-motion on display here is an achievement of the highest order, and anyone who adores animation as an art form should flock to this film.",

Each character is unique and fun; of course, the dogs were my favorites.

Watching Atari and the dogs stumble through trash island is intriguing as you never know what is going to be around the corner. There are small twists in the story which will keep you captivated, and just in general, the story is winsome and compelling for all ages; who knew the idea of combining political conspiracy with man's best friend could work so well?

Stop-motion has a wonderfully tactile and woebegone appreciation that furthermore seems like a natural fit, and 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of Anderson's best and most enjoyable films. If it were not for the considerable time it takes to make animated films, I'd be happy if Anderson stayed in this realm. Isle of Dogs is about a future where dogs are blamed for an infectious disease and as a result are banned and quarantined to a garbage island off the coast of Japan. One little boy dares to venture to this island to find his beloved missing dog. From there, he's escorted by a pack of dogs, led by Chief (voiced by Bryan Cranston), across dangerous tracks of the island while avoiding the boy's adopted family, the mayor of Nagasaki. This is a whimsical, beguiling, detail-rich world to absorb, but it also has splashes of unexpected darkness and violence to jolt (though the dark turns are consistently nullified). It's a highly entertaining movie although the characters and story are rather thin. The different dogs are kept as stock roles, and the main boy, Atari, is pretty much a cipher for dog owners. However, the film can tap into an elemental emotional response when discussing the relationship between man and dog. If you're a dog person, it's hard not to feel a twinge of emotions when a dog is given a loving owner and sense of family. There is one element of the movie that feels notably off, and that's the fact that the dogs speak English and the local Japanese characters speak their native tongue but without the aid of subtitles. it doesn't exactly feel like Anderson is doing this as a source of humor, but I can't figure out a good alternative reason for it. I'm sure Cranston's distinctive growl would have sounded just as good speaking Japanese. Regardless, Isle of Dogs is a mid-pack Wes Anderson fantasia of inventive imagination and well worth getting lost within.\n\nNate's Grade: B",

            "content": "After his first successful outing with 2009's Fantastic Mr Fox, director Wes Anderson returns to animation with Isle of Dogs, a delightfully unusual affair accentuated by its textural design and dry wit. I enjoyed Isle of Dogs thoroughly; Anderson's film is intelligent, profound and above all unique, sufficing as a very entertaining film, if only for those open-minded to the director's quirkiness. \nThe film find its primary strength in its visuals and animation design; the stop-motion animation lends itself perfectly to the film's odd and often ghoulish imagery (as expected of Anderson, symmetry and prolonged facial close-ups are ubiquitous). Everything from character design to camera angling perfectly combines to create a movie which is beautifully shot and admirably detailed. \nThe plot itself is charming, using its dystopian setting of a Japan where dogs have been banished to a trash island to prevent the spread of dog flu to create a sweet story of young Atari who travels to the so-called Isle of Dogs to find his lost dog Spots (voiced with gravitas by Liev Schreiber). Merged into this tale, however is a political thriller, charting the corruption of the Kobayashi government and their sinister methods to be re-elected and eliminate canine life from the archipelago once and for all. Whilst I appreciate Anderson's detail and maturity in approach to what could have been a simple film, I found the scenes with Atari and the dogs on the island far more interesting; slowly but surely the film becomes more about the politics than the pooches and the film does slightly suffer from it. The film rambles to a weak and frankly dull climax, which is a shame as there are some golden scenes in the film, which showcase charming and witty writing and execution. The A-list cast are mostly wasted in small roles, but Bryan Cranston and Edward Norton give fledged and masterful performances, with Cranston managing to emanate profound humanity even through his canine mouthpiece. The majority of the human cast speak in Japanese, with Frances McDormand dubbing over in her role as Interpreter Nelson. Much of the Japanese dialogue is completely untranslated; Anderson was adamant that the audience feel the emotion coming through the characters and they did not need to speak English to do that. Whilst this is a nice idea and adds something to the authenticity of the film, it is something of a hindrance and certainly doesn't make the parts of the story away from the Isle of Dogs any more enjoyable; perhaps some subtitles would suffice, Wes!\nOverall, Isle of Dogs is a confident and boldly different effort by Wes Anderson, whose style, while indisputably odd, creates some moments of sheer cinematic majesty and delight for the audience. The film may not be one of his masterpieces, but Isle of Dogs remains a largely enjoyable and creative movie that can be appreciated solely for its flair",

            "content": "With a stacked cast of several talented actors, Isle of Dogs delivers a unique blend of quirkiness and wit seldom seen in most modern films. The juxtaposition of both the English spoken by the dogs (And some bilingual characters) and the Japanese spoken by most of the human characters, along with the occasional subtitles, help the viewer appreciate and understand the life and culture of the people of Japan. The true brilliance of Isle of Dogs is seen during the many fast paced scenes of the story's progression. Since the film is marketed to an American/European audience, it is assumed that the average viewer does not speak Japanese. Therefore, many plot points become a matter of show, don't tell, as the characters shown speak to each other (and therefore the audience) in Japanese without subtitles. This is done deliberately, so that the viewer understands the story based on the character's actions, rather than through dialogue. Much of the humor comes from the dogs themselves, with excellent performances from Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, and Liev Schreiber in particular. There are no hysterical, fall-out-of-your-seat moments or one-liners that everyone will repeat for days on end. Instead, the vastly deadpan style humor is fast paced to accommodate the quick nature of the story progression, with ironic quips, cleverly written dog jokes, and subtle jabs at Japanese culture. The stop-motion animation style is done remarkably well, and lends itself to the film's unique aesthetic. Each sequence is shot and edited smoothly, with no discernable lag or stuttering whatsoever. Those who enjoy the Rankin-Bass stop-motion films from the 1960s and 70s will appreciate the style of animation, of which director Wes Anderson has said were the inspiration, in addition to the filmography of the legendary Akira Kurosawa. While Isle of Dogs will most likely fall under the radar due to the competition from much larger scale Spring flicks, it easily cements itself as one of the best films of 2018, with an amazing cast, fluid and unique animation style, wit and dry humor, and enjoyable quirkiness. This is a one-of-a-kind movie that cannot be missed.",

            "content": "(Quick Disclaimer: Saw an\"early\" screening locally for the film at my AMC theater ahead of the films major release in other theaters on April 6th) As a hit or miss fan of Wes Anderson, one thing i cannot deny about his filmography is both his quirky and super on point executed writing and his knack for attention to framing and directing. When he's overboard with it, it still manages to be a fun ride, when it isn't it's still a fun ride; Basically, there's always something you can get out of his films whether you like him or not. And that's no different with Isle of Dogs, another practical stop animation film by the same team behind Fantastic Mr. Fox (which is actually one of my favourite 'growing up' films and absolutely get a lot of inspiration from) and completely written and directed by Wes himself. And after waiting patiently for it to come out (because honestly I was immediately hooked to the film by the marketing and first clip shown), I can proudly say a lot of my waiting was well worth the wait, because Isle of Dogs is both another home run for Wes Anderson and somehow manages to be on the same quality (and be almost a bit better) than Fantastic Mr Fox.\n\nNow with that said that doesn't mean there are issues with the film, for example the writing while does compliment the must be emphasized fantastic cast and story and structurally wise its well done unfortunately some of the character dialogue (especially in the beginning) gets a bit too on the nose and painfully forced and often has a bit of Wes Anderson's annoying uses of 'quirky' jokes that get used too repetitively and also suffers from not being able to flesh out a lot of its characters fully, these are all only can hurt the film slightly. But other than that, a great and energetic cast (both from the dogs playing off each other and japanese humans who are really well structured and written) that do such a good job in their respective roles, the surprisingly really engaging story that sure doesn't do a lot of in terms of twists and conflict but more than makes up for that in personality and a good character driven narrative, a wonderfully authentic soundtrack that I'm so glad Wes Anderson made sure to be as distinct and memorable as possible and composer Alexandre Desplat for just absolutely nailing out of the park composing the melodies and motifs, wonderfully quirky humour that adds a lot of personality to the film and its characters, the really refreshingly interesting dystopian world building that really sets this apart of most films Wes Anderson has done before that adds a lot of personality to the filmmaking craft,  and of course worth mentioning the incredibly animation that Wes Anderson and his team must be appreciated for putting so much attention to detail with even with scenes going on in the background.\n\nSo in case the point wasn't hammered in enough, definitely go and see Isle of Dogs. I was absolutely floored and delightfully happy to walk out of the film loving it, and is deserving of a lot of rewatches. Great job Wes Anderson, here's hoping for a Oscar nod next year and really hope you're able to keep hitting from here on out.",

Set in a futuristic Japan, the dog-hating Mayor of Megasaki City decrees that all dogs are to be exiled to Trash Island as a result of Dog Flu and it is up to the Mayor's ward, 12-year-old Atari, and a bunch of young activists to save the canine population from total annihilation even after a cure was found but suppressed. A bold and perhaps idiosyncratic move is to have the humans speak in their native tongue (i.e. Japanese), and translated organically only when available, while the dogs' barking are dubbed into English. Anderson regulars (Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton) as well as newbies (Bryan Cranston, Scarlett Johansson) lend their voices to the fluffy band of four-legged reprobates but the true star here is of course, Anderson, who dreamt up such an incredibly imaginative original story and tells it in a mischievous and unmistakably Andersonian manner, with stunning visuals that are meticulously rendered in great details, where every frame is as gloriously sumptuous as it is dryly funny. Some of the Japanese characterizations may border on stereotypes and the story unravels a little towards the end, leaning a bit too much into the fantastical and perhaps twee side, but it only diminishes marginally my enjoyment of this exquisite film in which people in power conspiring to commit election fraud via lies and propaganda is ultimately defeated by both science and a group of compassionate and energetic younger people galvanized to do what is necessary to overcome a tyrannical authority and reunite us with our best (canine) friends.",

This was my introduction to Wes Anderson's style and quite frankly, if this is a decent representation of how he direct, then it's not for me.\n\nThe dogs held no emotion and their dialogue is contradictory. A character randomly decides she's in love with another without any semblance of this aside from a swoon seconds prio to her declaration. I couldn't even appreciate the Japan aesthetic because it was Wes Anderson's vaguely racist perception of the culture rather than a direct unadulterated translation.\n\nThe film's plot unfolded in such a way that it felt as though it was being written as the movie progressed. This also left me with the irritating sensation of having my hand mercilessly and patronizingly held throughout the experience.\n\nIts only redeeming feature is the vastly more compelling music, which coupled with the painstaking animation style is very likely what seems to have pulled the wool over many a critic's eye.\n\nIf I could give it a rating, it would receive the lowest possible.",

The main reason most likely being that the overall tone of this film is very different and much more dark. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely not as light-hearted as other Wes Anderson films. The voice actors are all great and I enjoyed trying to match all the great actors to their characters.

A boy (voice of Koyu Rankin) journeys there to rescue his dog Spots (Liev Schreiber), and gets help from a pack of misfit canines who have also been exiled. His quest inspires a group of dog lovers to expose a government conspiracy. The voice cast also includes Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Bob Balaban, Greta Gerwig, and Yoko Ono.\n\nI had been meaning to watch this film for a long time, but it was in limited release for a while and it seemed like the wide release kept getting pushed back. Granted, I didn't look into it so I have no idea what the circumstances were or if I'm just dumb but either way, I was able to finally watch \"Isle of Dogs\". And to no surprise, I had so much fun with this film! It was an experience I'm glad I had and with no further ado, let's get into this. \n\n\"Isle of Dogs\" is a beautifully animated, stop-motion piece that looks stunning. If anything else, I highly recommend watching this film because it is beautiful and the process behind making this film was so fascinating. It was awesome to be able to see this props come to life and just how much detail was put into each one. There was so much attention to detail in every shot and every little aspect that it just left me in awe. I give a lot of credit to Wes Anderson and the entire crew that was able to make this happen. They did an amazing job and they spent a lot of time trying to create something that they'd be proud of. \n\nThis film is hilariously dark, emotional, and even funny. It was a combination of all these different elements that came together so well. I didn't really have any expectations but the trailer doesn't do this film justice. Story wise, there were so many different things that drove this film. There were a lot of big elements accompanied by smaller things that made the entire thing what it is. I thought the story was really simple and clear, yet there was so much depth behind it. I think that everything came together exactly how it needed to and I thought the overall execution of the story was great.\n\nIn all honesty though, I don't have a lot of gripes about this film. I may be rushing this review because I'm about to go see \"Avengers: Infinity War\", but \"Isle of Dogs\" was certainly one of my favorites of the year so far. I highly recommend seeing it if there's a theater near you and one things for certain, Isle of Dogs. Say it out loud if you don't get it.",

            "content": "March 23, 2018\n\nThe more I think about \"Isle of Dogs,\" the more I like it, and the more I want to see it again. There's just something about this film's tone, dry humor and visual beauty that make it uncommonly soothing, especially for an animated film. Granted, it's stop-motion animation, versus the predominant 3D computer-animated kind, so perhaps the long, slow process it took to make it contributed to its tranquility, but whatever the case, in an era when so many movies, animated or not, feel the need to throw so much action and effects on the screen all at once, here is a film that takes a quieter, more patient and calming approach. As you sit back and admire it, it simultaneously puts you at ease.\n\nIn addition to its format and style, perhaps another reason \"Isle of Dogs\" is so reposing is because there's nothing terribly complicated its story. When I first saw the trailer, I didn't know what to make of it. Is it meant to be a comedy, a drama, a family picture, a social commentary, all of the above? After seeing it, I'm still not sure to what genre it officially belongs, but after thinking about it for a while, I figured director Wes Anderson and his team probably weren't trying to make a bold political statement or argue a certain point of view with regard to the plot. Sure, the film has moderate ties to real-world news and history, but these ultimately only serve as a backdrop to a simple yet effective story about companionship and loyalty, and because I didn't think the filmmakers were pushing a more important agenda, I didn't go seeking one. I simply let the film relax me. It may not be intellectually stimulating, but you'll nonetheless leave the theater feeling joyful and content.\n\nThe setup is rather straightforward: Twenty years into the future, Mayor Kobayashi (voice of Kunichi Nomura) of the fictional Japanese city of Megasaki, bans all dogs to Trash Island, citing the unwanted spread of an outbreak known as \"dog flu.\" Despite what he tells the press, Kobayashi's motivations for such a decree extend beyond his fear the virus will soon \"enter the human disease pool.\" His bias against dogs actually dates back to feudal Japan, \"before the age of obedience,\" when the cat-loving Kobayashi dynasty fought battles to prevent dogs from continuing to roam free around the earth.\n\nNow, amidst the recent epidemic, he has an excuse to deport dogs completely, starting with his nephew Atari's faithful companion and bodyguard, Spots (Liev Schreiber). On the rubbish-filled colony, Spots and his canine brethren are forced to survive on garbage as the flu and \"snout fever\" trigger symptoms such as moodiness, narcolepsy, acute sneezing, color changes and fur loss. When Kobayashi refuses to listen to Professor Watanabe (Akiro Ito), who insists a cure is imminent, 12-year-old Atari (Koyu Rankin) steals a plane and flies to Trash Island in hopes of finding his best friend.\n\nAfter crashing landing, he meets the story's main pack of characters, a group of mostly mellow yet burned out alpha dogs who decide to take Atari under their wing and help him on his mission, not least because it would remind them of what life used to be like and the important role dogs used to play in humans' lives. The diverse group includes the irascible and scarred Chief (Bryan Cranston); the master-longing Rex (Edward Norton); King (Bob Balaban); Boss (Billy Murray); and Duke (Jeff Goldblum). Because of his rough history, Chief is hesitant to befriend any human but is encouraged to show his gentler side by Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson), a purebred show dog who's every bit as graceful and limber and she is classy.\n\nOther members of the all-star cast include Tilda Swinton as an owl-eyed pug and Harvey Keitel as a supposedly cannibalistic half-breed, along with Greta Gerwig, Yoko Ono and Frances McDormand as some of the film's other human characters. McDormand particularly stands out as an English interpreter who delivers the play-by-play of Megasaki's mayoral election, the outcome of which could seal the fate of all dogs going forward.\n\nAnderson's screenplay, from a story by Anderson, Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and Kunichi Nomura, uses its light setup and colorful characters mostly to express affection and compassion toward any creatures (including humans) who may be shunned for reasons outside their control, as well as to highlight the importance of pets, family and loyalty, and to showcase beauteous imagery. And even though it's obvious they're present, it merely plays with the ideas of authoritarianism, dictatorship, prejudice, segregation, government corruption and moral rectitude; it doesn't exactly analyze them. If Anderson ever wanted to make a more politically charged film, I'm confident a storyteller of his caliber and style would really dissect the given themes and examine their complexity, making the narrative that much more biting.\n\nBut with \"Isle of Dogs,\" I'm pretty sure he just wants to engage us with charming dogs, deadpan humor, and, above all, sharp, picturesque imagery. Tristan Oliver's cinematography, with its heavy hues such as red, yellow and orange, which fill the background of Trash Island, combined with Andy Gent's exquisite, meticulously crafted models and puppets (of which there were over 500) make the film almost tangible and it inundates us like a vivid dream. We lose ourselves so much in the pacifying frames that the story becomes secondary, and while I do think the film's hesitancy to take narrative risks and make bolder, more polemical statements about its political and social themes prevents it from reaching greater cinematic heights, it still wonderfully utilizes the basest qualities of the medium, namely visuals, to lull us and take us away. It's in our best interest to simply let it.",

They are voiced by Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bob Balaban, and Bill Murray\n\tAtari: He's a kid voiced by Koyu Rankin.\n\nPlot Summary\n\tThere's a disease going about in a Japanese city - one that is being spread by dogs.  The mayor of that city has ordered all dogs to be sent to a nearby island filled with trash to live out the rest of their lives.\n\tBut one boy can't stand losing his doggie friend - Atari.  He takes a plane and flies off to the island (at twelve years old? Really?)  Once on the island, he teams up with the Duke and his buddies to find Spot (that's the name of Atari's dog).\n\tBut it's not an easy task because other dogs and a robotic police unit get in the way  And there's something odd going on with the city's mayor that troubles several citizens of that city.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tAtari's great as the innocent kid who just wants his dog back.  And a few of the dogs have good chemistry with Atari.  But the four dogs could've been cut down to two and it would've been just as engrossing.  SCORE: 7\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tThe ladies are not well represented in this movie.  Most of them are just interesting in following the guys (or falling in love with them.) This is especially true for the female dogs that get exiled to Trash Island.  SCORE: 5\n\nPlot\n\tThe events that Atari and his newfound dogs friends go through on the island are interesting - and it has a good buildup to a thrilling climax.  \n\tBut there's a huge language barrier here.  Atari only speaks Japanese, the dogs and some humans only speak English and some animals don't speak any words.  This can make the dialogue tough to follow. SCORE: 6\n\nOriginality\n\tThis could've been your average kid and a pet film, but Atari and the main cast really put a nice spin on it.  SCORE: 8\n\nViolence Factor\n\tThere's a lot of ludicrous cartoon style fighting - the dogs rush into each other and a huge cloud covers up the fight.  And there's no real injures from any of these fights.\n\tBut Atari gets the worst of everything.  He gets badly hurt when he crashes his plane on Trash Island (which is why twelve year olds don't fly.) \n\tAnd there's an operating scene that's not for the squeamish or the youngest viewers, but it was needed.  SCORE: 8\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film is about how differing sides can come together to face off against a common enemy.  \n\tBut there's a trio of love stories that felt like they were not needed.  SCORE: 7\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 41\t\t% Score: 68.33%\n\tAn interesting film - but it would've been more enjoyable without the clashing languages and some of the sub plot lines.",

Out of all the nominees, I would like to see this movie take the prize despite the fact that it is not perfect, but I think it is safe to say that \"Incredibles 2\" will take the Oscar though \"Isle of Dogs\" is a much better movie.  Wes Anderson's second stop montion animated movie is a dramatic improvement over the extremely dull \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\".  It has a much better story with a well written script and some very compelling and interesting characters.  The voice cast does a terrific job in my opinion and the movie is beautifully animated.  In fact, much better than \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\".  However the movie is not without its problems.  The captioning is very small, so small in fact that I had to sit close to the television in order to be able to read it.  Also, I had to pause the DVD I was watching in order to read most of the captions because they are on screen for a very short time.  Also, I had trouble believing that Atari (That name brings back memories.) can survive for as long as he did with a piece of metal lodges in his skull.  That being said I think \"Isle of Dogs\" works very well and I am keeping my fingers crossed it wins the big prize.",

            "content": "ISLE OF DOGS 3/31/18\n\nAnyone who knows me well is aware of my complicated feelings toward dogs. Due to irrational fear, I like to observe them from a distance...I like them better when I am comfortable in their presence and they do not bark or jump on me...I like them best when they are sweet and quiet and most of all when there is a movie screen between us. In Wes Anderson's new animated film, situated in a futuristic Japan, titled ISLE OF DOGS there are images that delighted me; patterns of color and shapes that filled the darkened theater with a playful ambiance. The dialogue is witty - humor is both visual and aural which is why I revere the eccentric director, Wes Anderson who treats his dramatic personae (be they animals or humans) with a caress of gentleness endowing them with compassion, rebellion, ferocity and affection, laced with a dollop of irony. Wisdom is never absent in his films - kooky, crazy wild truths.\n\nDog vs cat enthusiasts are pitted against each other with the leading political authorities being cat proponents. Canine cleansing is the final solution to a contagion of dog \"snout\" disease that has become rampant in Megasaki City and all-powerful Mayor Kobayashi has decreed the forcible exile of hundreds of thousands of dogs to a remote place - Trash Island - a place filled with garbage and scurrying rats. There is some political opposition to the corruption of the ruling autocracy but it is barely a whimper.\n\nWe meet the hero - the intrepid Atari, who due to the death of his parents becomes the 12-year-old \"ward\" of the Mayor (a politically cynical, ennobling move) and is given a dog, SPOT to protect the young lad and be his companion. Sadly Spot is the first dog to be carted off to Trash Island and Atari is hell-bent on finding his loving friend. He hi-jacks a plane which sputters and crashes into the wasteland of filth and muck - the detritus of human civilization - where painfully skinny dogs roam about and survival of the fittest is literally the only means of existence.\n\nISLE OF DOGS is the magically heroic tale of the search for a lost and adored partner.  During the pursuit, Atari who often rails in Japanese (no subtitles -  but we get the idea ) teams up with the Alpha dogs on the Island - each having his/her own back-story; one being an ex-show dog; a house pet; another successful in advertising doggie food, and most importantly the powerful stray, Chief (voiced by Bryan Cranston) who has never trusted the fickleness of people-masters, bitterly independent as well as being the most ferocious fighter of the bunch. Imagine dogs with the peculiarity of biped's personalities, infused with charming dialogue filled with teasing jabs and dulcet flirtations. ISLE OF DOGS  creates an enchanting adventure, which is both stunning and daunting.Through surrogates, we see the nature of power and the absolute degradation of the spirit when faced with starvation, weakness, and disorder.\n\nThere are many subplots in the movie that occur in Megasaki City - but none held my interest in the way the events on Trash Island did. Communities (packs of dogs) are created in the direst of circumstances - alliances are forged and trust is built with courage as a  prime motivator for survival - a morality fable for our time.",

There are some good jokes from the pack of dogs but to be honest you see most of those in the trailer anyway. And the obvious social commentary makes you want to roll your eyes. Parading them in your film in an atypical way doesn't suddenly make it a masterpiece. And to be honest the whole message seems a bit skewed by the fact that the resolution of the movie is for the ostracised dogs to return to owners who it seems didn't care much for them in the first place and to once again become their obedient pets. I don't think this film ever really knew what exactly it was doing and it shows, especially during the ultra quick and messy end act. Wry jokes and witty quips only get you so far.

This film was so intelligent and unique, it's unlike anything I've ever seen with it's great combination of mystery, comedy, and heart. It's beautifully done. Isle of Dogs was also surprisingly thrilling, the themes of scandal and mystery are beyond intriguing.

And, of course, Isle of Dogs, as any Wes Anderson movie, has what distinguishes it from any other Wes Anderson movie. In fact, there are three new pluses here. First, and foremost, the visually storytelling. Yes, I know it's not a new thing to say about a Wes Anderson movie, but there is no Wes Anderson movie, nor any stop-motion animated movie that has used its visuals to tell its story in this way. Specially, when you know that this movie has many scenes where there is no dialogue in English, just in Japanese, or where there are just Japanese subtitles!\n\nThe second great thing about Isle of Dogs is the voice cast. Sorry Fantastic Mr. Fox, I love you even more, but here the cast really adds up to the movie. The cast isn't star-studded just because it's a Wes Anderson movie, but every single actor, or actress, really made every character feels distinctive. Bryan Cranston, who voices Chief, is easily the best. His vocal performance here is undeniably one of the best in any animated movie from the last, say, five years. But really all the cast shines in this movie. Edward Norton is my second favorite.\n\nAt last but not least, comes the music score from the Oscar winner, Alexandre Desplat. It has some Western touch in it, along with a traditional Japanese music. What a wonderful soundtrack! It really sticks in my mind long after watching the movie!.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I prefer Fantastic Mr. Fox to Isle of Dogs. That's because Isle of Dogs, unlike any other Wes Anderson movie, is convoluted for its own good. That didn't hurt the movie as whole, except at the third act, which is quite rushed and messy. Also, I wanted the character of Atari to feel more life-like person. Because I felt he was overshadowed by the dogs. Nevertheless, Atari is a well-developed character.\n\nIsle of Dogs may didn't live up to my expectations, but still it is my favorite animated movie of 2018 so far!\n\n(8/10)",

I had never seen it before but it had been recommended to me to watch before going to see Isle of Dogs. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great movie and it really did prepare me for the style, the stop motion and the stories that Wes Anderson tells. Isle of Dogs did not disappoint on any of those.\n\nThe stop motion animation is the selling point for this movie as it is potentially the best stop motion animation we have seen on the big screen to date. There was times in the movie that I completely forgot I was watching stop motion, and assumed it was normal 3D or traditional animation. That is a complete disservice to the animators of this and it's also the best compliment I can pay. Fun fact, I actually have a degree in Animation so I understand the process that was undertaken to get to this quality. It's not just the animation however, it's the painstaking detail of the sets and the cinematography has to just be admired. There will be times where you are in awe of some of it but not even realise you are doing that.\n\nThe story itself is crazy as it can be with talking Dogs and a dystopian Japan who has banished them onto an island. They've been banished because of dog flu and a government conspiracy in wanting to keep them there. The story didn't really grasp me as it should have. I was more interested in learning more about the dogs but there were times we got a lot of what was happening with the cure and the re-election. It served its purpose of the story and with Wes Anderson's style of storytelling, to be expected.\n\nThe voice acting is a real strength of the movie with Bryan Cranston voicing Chief, the main dog. There's fun comedic moments that aren't forced and little traits like the constant sneezing, that keep the movie entertaining. I've read a few reviews saying that it's an insult that the dogs talk English yet the humans talk Japanese, except most of it is translated via a translator. The movie blatantly makes this abundantly clear that this is the case, even making a bit of a joke about it, breaking the fourth wall a touch. It's in no way insulting to the culture and I enjoyed the culture of it. The fourth wall breaking wasn't excessive and was just the dog's turning to face the screen a couple of times, it was fun and it involved the audience. My favourite has got to be the Oracle, such a great character and when you see it, you'll know why.\n\nDIAGNOSIS - INPATIENT CARE\n\nI feel I haven't even discussed most of this movie but that simply because it's going to take a couple of watches to fully appreciate everything in it. You can't help but admire the quality of the movie and the uniqueness of it. You'll never see anything like this in the cinema and it's Wes Anderson at his finest. \n\nMatt",

The dog pack is fun enough, but there's a scene midway through where they basically get killed. They turn out to have had a miraculous mistake, but they have no role from then on. I genuinely think they were meant to die there in a passing joke and never come back. Even the hero boy Atari didn't seen noble, just stubborn. He bosses the dogs around like he's their king and forces them to play fetch. That might be because we can't understand him (in one of the film's more amusing conceits the dogs bark in English while everyone else speaks in Japanese) but I don't think so.\n\nIn fact, the emotional heart of the film seems awfully dark. The dogs are basically slaves. We see precious few signs of affection from their masters so is the fact that the dogs are eager to return to the masters who willingly abandoned them really sweet, or is it just that they've been conditioned over years of slavery to only find satisfaction from obedience to their masters. I'm not alone finding that uncomfortable, right? I suppose this is a common issue with talking pet movies, but it's pretty blatant here that they obey not through love but by their very nature.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs is a movie to be reckoned with. This incredibly unique piece of stop motion animation is totally different from the norm of today's films. Written and directed by Wes Anderson, it stars the voices of Bryan Cranston as Chief, Edward Norton as Rex, Bill Murray as Boss, Liev Schreiber as Spots, Bob Balaban as King, Scarlett Johansson as Nutmeg and Jeff Goldblum as Duke.  It also stars Koyu Rankin as the young boy, Atari. It is the second animated film from Wes Anderson, after the wonderful Fantastic Mr. Fox.\n\nIn future Japan, where dogs are viewed as savage and disease ridden creatures, a young boy, Atari, searches for his dog, Spots. This dystopian world, created by his guardian, Mayor Kobayashi, disparages dogs but worships cats. Atari defies his guardian and along the way befriends some loyal, passionate pooches who help him on his fateful journey of finding his lost dog. \n\nOne thing I particularly adore about Wes Anderson's filmmaking is his irreverent humour and creativity. It's almost as if Anderson has a patent on an new genre of filmmaking, that's entirely his own. During the making of this film, Anderson was influenced by his love for Japanese cinema and two of the most monumental Japanese directors - Akira Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki. In an interview about his many influences for the film, he states \"with Miyazaki you get nature and you get moments of peace, a kind of rhythm that is not in the American animation tradition...\". Later on, Anderson explains that during the scoring of the film he and his composer, Alexandre Desplat, had to rethink their approach to the soundtrack because the movie longed to be quiet. He later specifies that this aspect of the film also comes from Miyazaki. \n\nThe stop motion animation style pairs perfectly with the pure grittiness of its creativity. In most animated films you don't hear the roughness or coarseness of the actors' voices, but in Anderson's film you do and it is the most lifelike.  Also, despite the humor, Anderson doesn't sugar coat the seriousness of the story. His films are always truthful and cut to the heart of the matter. \n\nI recommend Isle of Dogs for ages 12 to 18, due to its violence and sophisticated humour. Younger kids might not understand the ironic tone. I give it 5 out of 5 stars for bringing an incredibly unique vision to the mostly mundane animation of today. \n\nREviewed by clayton p., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

I remember the round eyes that all varied in colors in the dogs. I remember the wind that ruffled the furs and feathers, and slightly crooked little teeth of humans and dogs. Whistling of Atari, Chief and hooting of the owl were refreshing were smoothing and chilling kind of like the first lick of mint on my tongue. \n\nThere's a bit of political nuance that seems timely. Humans got manipulated by an alpha male who's hungry for power but funny enough, the dogs found order even in the banishment on the trash island voting for decisions, respecting one another as all equal alpha dogs, and maintaining integrity even when they found themselves a large piece of fresh meat, Atari. \n\nLiving in today's world does feel like we're under Kobayashi's regime. Students who corrected this course of history in Megasaki echoed The March for Life that took place this weekend. This charming plot somehow instilled hope in me and I walked out of this theater filled with joy. \n\nThis movie was beautiful in every way (even typography and graphics of the posters too!).

If you want a film that's so well composed that it is almost like watching  art in the making with social commentary, comedy, and heart rending emotion so infused it's hard to parse your emotional response, then it's for you -enjoy. You'll probably need to see it twice or more to see it all.",

Produced with gorgeous stop motion animation Isle of Dogs is a feast for the senses. Edits and cuts, scene changes, composition, coloring, and framing are all deliberately chosen to create a beautiful oriental adventure with man's best friend. The voice talent on display is also top-shelf stuff and seemingly endless. Cranston, Norton, Schreiber, Murray, Johannsen, Goldblum, Murray Abraham - the list goes on and on, and so much of the talent is used to produce witty, rapid-fire jokes and expertly paced character development. Desplat's score deviates from his lush, melodic norm to deliver an aggressive and traditional Japanese musical score, while also delivering those classic moments with untraditional instrumentation. It may be Anderson at his most self-indulgent, but this is what I love about his films. Every time a Wes Anderson film comes out I look forward to seeing how he takes a long standing, traditional medium and puts his own spin on nearly everything, from camera work to storytelling. He takes film and molds it to fit his unique style and quirks, and it's always a treat to witness. Isle of Dogs is a wonderful and artful film that still proves Wes Anderson's one of the most creative directors out there.",

The story is entertaining. I was invested throughout. However, the film felt a little too long. There were some plot issues that I won\u2019t delve into because of spoilers. Anderson made a certain choice that I do not understand. Also, Anderson plays it way to safe. He does everything typical of a Wes Anderson film, but not overly much else.

            "content": "Wes Anderson films are often viewed as pieces of art that transcend the medium's limitations, moving paintings brought to life by a one-of-a-kind brushstroke. They're rarely perfect (or perhaps just a little too perfect), but always rewarding and enlightening, mostly because of their relentless honesty and commitment in showing the benefits of unexpected spurts of violence is such proper worlds. And isn't that most people's lives, an existence governed by rules enhanced by moments of pure, unadulterated rebellion? No other movie in Wes Anderson's canon embodies that sentiment so effectively as Isle of Dogs, the filmmaker's returns to stop-motion animation almost ten years later. If Fantastic Mr. Fox had shown the potential of such playground for someone with Anderson's obsessively detailed vision, Isle of Dogs is a fully realized utopia. At once an apt metaphor for today's political instability, and a touchingly dark narrative of loss and acceptance, the film's craftsmanship is unlike anything seen before. From the lush, textured character design to the transfixing beauty of the miniatures, the film's able to create a meditative-like experience, a stunningly harmonious blend of drama and comedy, sadness and ecstasy, indifference and nostalgia. In that regard, Anderson's awe of Akira Kurosawa is noticeable: the fundamental 'human' decency, the damaged people looking for their place in the world, the ethically driven narrative. This is all deconstructed in a simple tale of a boy looking for his lost dog, or, a dog looking for his lost boy, depending on you choose to interpret it. Either way, attached there's a deeply sentimental love letter to true friendships wrapped in a cunning satire, and it's gripping all the way through. Isle of Dogs is a career-defining achievement by any metric, and quite possibly, the filmmaker's best.",

            "content": "A delightful adventure with dogs!\n\nWes Anderson has directed another sweet, yet mature movie. Isle of Dogs is not as whimsical as Fantastic Mr. Fox, but it surpasses expectations with a quirky story filled with wild characters. The stop motion animation and clay-mation is immaculate. Anderson refined his animation style from Fantastic Mr. Fox, while sacrificing compelling storytelling. The plot of Isle of Dogs unfortunately meanders its way to the finale. Audiences will have fun the whole way through, even with the slower pace. But I think most viewers will find Isle of Dogs confusing or alienating in its odd, yet charming approach.\n\nThe voice acting is excellent overall. I am particularly pleased by the vocal work of Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, and Harvey Keitel. Greta Gerwig and Scarlett Johansson are alright at their line delivery, but they feel a little forced. Yoko Ono surprises with a few choice lines. The Japanese voice actors all deliver believable dialogue even though I cannot understand them. The choice to not use subtitles is off putting as well as funny at times with the interpreters throughout. Wes Anderson's all star cast will impress most viewers with their perfect delivery, but I suspect others will be turned off by how recognizable all the voice actors are sonically. I liked them though!\n\nOne thing Wes Anderson continues to excel at is his symmetrical framing. Every shot finds itself in the ideal visual setup. Figures and backgrounds are aligned for optimal visual equality. Isle of Dogs is certainly visually appealing. All the colors, movement, and juxtaposition are meticulously detailed and lifelike. Isle of Dogs is peak precision in animation.\n\nNotably, I think audiences should disregard the various criticisms of Isle of Dogs as racist, insensitive, or cultural appropriation. I keep waiting for something offensive to happen while watching Isle of Dogs and only found strange delights and fun times. Any outrage at Isle of Dogs is grossly misplaced. This is a fun little animated adventure for adults to enjoy. It has heavy political undertones, but it is not racist. Isle of Dogs is good fun in good taste in my opinion.\n\nLastly, I'd like to mention the traditional Japanese score from master composer Alexandre Desplat. His use of drums are massive in sound. As are Desplat's reaching for cultural authenticity with his utilization of traditional Japanese instruments. The only other music is indie rock songs scattered here and there during the dog bound journey.\n\nIn short, I think most people that undertake the joyous ride that is Isle of Dogs will come out entertained, but not mind blown. Wes Anderson continues his hot streak of excellent quality films. See Isle of Dogs for some levity this tiresome year.",

They survived, mostly liked it, and I suppose that'll be the case for the kids I saw in the theater for Isle of Dogs. Maybe Wes Anderson isn't entirely responsible for the way his films are marketed. His features are made for a very quirky adult audience. I get that, and I like his work, but there's something a little off since with relatively few tweaks, this one could actually be a good movie for kids. It's got a nice message. The weird, dry humor isn't going to work for most adults or kids. Sometimes I think Wes Anderson is purposefully weird just to be weird, and while that can be amusing, it can be a weakness too.",

            "content": "Great interesting stop motion animated film directed by one of the greatest directors of all time Wes Anderson starring everybody that's normally in a Wes Anderson move like Bill Murray and Edward Norton. I was surprised that Jason Schwartzman wasn't one of the stars in the movie and the Frances mcdormand had more lines than Jason. Bryan Cranston and Jeff Gollum Goldberg goldblum were also in this film and they were fantastic and I forgot to mention greta gerwig from lady bird and Frances ha. She was good and the little boy who is on trash island with the dogs who spoke Japanese in this film, I forgot his name but at first I hated his character telling dogs what to do and Bryan Cranstons character was angry that a human was telling a dog what to do and I agreed with him that dogs should be their own leaders and that's why I hated the little Japanese kid for the first 35 minutes of the film but then when him and Bryan Cranston s character gets along with him then I start to like him. Another thing is that this movie is PG 13, I thought this movie is PG like fantastic Mr fox but nope, this movie has blood and some swearing and that surprised me because I thought all of Wes Anderson s animated movies were PG and it connects in the end. The art style and all the colors of a Wes Anderson movie are present and their great, and I like how wes Anderson mixes both English and Japanese into this film and saying at the beginning that the dogs are being translated to speak English so that's a funny scene but this movie is a pretty serious movie. Blood, death, and suicide are common themes in this movie and I sorta like it but I sorta don't. I like it because it's a serious animated movie but on the other hand serious animated movies are weird like 2009s 9. That was a serious animated movie and I hated it, this feels like at some times a little too serious but overall a enjoyable movie. If I could give an honest rating I would give this movie a 4.25 out of 5 because it's too serious at times and some story lines are too jumbled up and too many characters doesn't make the film consistent and feels that it should have been longer by a good 45 minutes to make the storylines flow without any problems. I can't wait to see what Wes Anderson does next and he here has another Oscar nomination with this movie for best animated movie but their is some competition between incredibles 2 and wreck it Ralph 2, who will win.",

In this film, the dialogues adhere to the reality of our relationship with dogs, but we can understand it thanks to a meticulous analysis and a fluid connection between the characters in the film. The film itself sometimes feels like a documentary, but it does not affect its premise at all, and the interventions of the character of Greta Gerwig were unnecessary, but they have a greater contribution in history, besides leaving a great message about how we relate with the dogs and how we treat them.

And, of course, Isle of Dogs, as any Wes Anderson movie, has what distinguishes it from any other Wes Anderson movie. In fact, there are three new pluses here. First, and foremost, the visually storytelling. Yes, I know it's not a new thing to say about a Wes Anderson movie, but there is no Wes Anderson movie, nor any stop-motion animated movie that has used its visuals to tell its story in this way. Specially, when you know that this movie has many scenes where there is no dialogue in English, just in Japanese, or where there are just Japanese subtitles!The second great thing about Isle of Dogs is the voice cast. Sorry Fantastic Mr. Fox, I love you more, but here the cast really adds up to the movie. The cast isn't star-studded just because it's a Wes Anderson movie, but every single actor, or actress, really made every character feels distinctive. Bryan Cranston voices Chief, who is, by the way, could be considered to be the real protagonist, and Bryan is GREAT! Easily the best. But really all the cast shines in this movie. Edward Norton is my second favorite.At last but not least, comes the music score from the Oscar winner, Alexandre Desplat. It has some Western touch in it, along with a traditional Japanese music. What a wonderful soundtrack that sticks in our mind long after watching the movie!As I mentioned above, I prefer Fantastic Mr. Fox to Isle of Dogs. That's because Isle of Dogs, unlike any other Wes Anderson movie, is convoluted for its own good. That didn't hurt the movie as whole, except at the third act, which is quite rushed and messy. Also, I wanted the character of Atari to feel more life-like person. Because I felt he was overshadowed by the dogs, nevertheless, Atari is a well-developed character.Isle of Dogs may didn't live up to my expectations, but still it is my favorite animated movie of 2018 so far!(8/10)",

The plot of this film has a pretty large scope for a stop motion film, covering an array of characters and subplots, with lots of heart and character development naturally integrated into it. The director seems to have struck a good balance between story and art. The characterisation of the dogs fit perfectly with the actual voice actors, with some of the dialogue feeling like they were tailor-made for Jeff Goldblum's or Bill Murray's character. The musical score adds an extra layer of lightheartedness to the overall feel of an already humorous and entertaining film. However, I do believe that there are deeper underlying themes surrounding political propaganda and how they can incite xenophobic fear and hatred. Is it any coincidence that this film was in development during the rise of Trump's presidency? In any case, Isle of Dogs can be viewed multiple times for its immaculately detailed aesthetics (as it is so detailed you will never see everything upon the first viewing) or you can simply enjoy it for a heartwarming tale of the endearing relationship between a boy and his dog. Isle of Dogs gets an 8.5/10.",

A man who has crafted and added to, not only a branch of the film industry within the independent market,Audiences around the world go to see a Wes Anderson film for many reasons; imagination, creativity, wonder and most of all, amazement. A man who has crafted and added to, not only a branch of the film industry within the independent market, but an individual who arguable has his own genre of film, proves with his latest that you are able to make an independent success, commercial darling and fading animation style feature film revolutionary. After eight feature films which enrich the medium as a whole, Wes Anderson delved, for a second time, into the stop-motion foray with his ninth future film, and quite possibly his best yet with Isle of Dogs. You heard the rumours right? About Isle of Dogs? Sure, there are a ton of rumours, controversy and discussions about the auteur director\u2019s latest film, both positive and negative (which we will discuss further into this review) including some fun facts that if you say the film\u2019s title fast, it\u2019s actually the equivalent of saying \u201cI Love Dogs\u201d, as well as arguments about cultural appropriation, hmmm.The fact of the matter is, first and foremost, Isle of Dogs is a film that pays tribute and homage to so many of the things that Anderson loves and hold very dear to his heart. From his love to canines, to his homages to legendary filmmakers and vanguards Hayao Miyazaki and Akira Kurosawa, to his love of stop-motion animation; Anderson\u2019s second venture into stop-motion animation is a film anchored by his passions, as well as a TRUE film for dog-lovers everywhere. DISCLAIMER: NO ACTUAL dogs were harmed during the making of this film\u2013fact!Nevertheless, don\u2019t let the animation fool you, Anderson\u2019s Dogs is as convoluted a story and themed complexly as any other of his films.A true underdog story, the film follows a young Japanese boy Atari (Koyu Rankin) and his odyssey to save his beloved guard dog Spots (Liev Schreiber), a short-haired Oceanic speckle eared sport hound, who so happened to be the first dog to be sent to Trash Island, a fictional land outside of Japan\u2019s fictional Megasaki City twenty years in the future, although the story seems more relevant now than it may in twenty years [hopefully]. Trash Island was sanctioned by Atari\u2019s mayoral uncle, Mayor Kobayashi voiced by Anderson collaborator, who also served as one of the screenwriters, Kunichi Nomura. Kobayashi, following an age old dynasty that transgresses from his farthest ancestors, with strong pro-feline beliefs, sets course to sanction a law to deport all dogs to Trash Island, blaming \u201csnout-fever\u201d and \u201cdog-flu\u201d as an incurable disease for its people, despite two scientists (Ken Wantanabe and Yoko Ono) on the verge of a medical breakthrough with the cure.\u201cWhat ever happened to man\u2019s best friend?\u201d indeed becomes one of the driving forces of the film. While Atari steals one of his uncle\u2019s jets, the mayor himself Kobayashi, who serves as the boy\u2019s ward following his parents tragic death years before, become family members and foes overnight. Questions arise as to why Atari on a quest to save Spots and deliberately chooses to throw his comfortable life away, despite Spots being one-helluva cute dog? It hurriedly becomes apparent that not only was Spots Atari\u2019s loyal companion, but the pup also served as Atari\u2019s loyal and trusted doggie-gaurd, despite Atari\u2019s hesitations at first. Fast forward some time and Atari\u2019s crash landing onto Trash Island, a desolate, ugly, grungy and garbage-filled wasteland inhabited only by dogs, populated with the brittle bones of animal carcasses, leftover waste, as well as spoiled and half-eaten food of Japan\u2019s Megasaki, the journey becomes a young man\u2019s ode to self-discovery and his ultimate moral fibre. Anderson, who so wonderfully, brings to life fantastical worlds in true Wes Anderson-esque fashion, seemingly chooses this story to showcase a very different side of his of his visual, truly allowing garbage, trash and waste to serve as a beautiful and poetic backdrop to his newest canon of films. Adding signatures such as Anderson\u2019s symmetrical filming style, the use of pans and deep zooms, and Trash Island as well as the overly-populated Megasaki City fit right in with the rest of Anderson\u2019s highly staged universe\u2019s. It also becomes quite easy to see that Anderson is also pioneering himself into cinematic prestige; using Isle of Dogs as his Avatar, progressing and improving stop-motion, maturing the visuals of the medium as well as mastering the ways of its presentation, especially comparing it side-by-side to his first venture with the form in The Fantastic Mr.Fox.",

Wes Anderson has once again created a masterpiece of cinema that skillfully combines the highest comedy and the lowest tragedy into a delight for the soul. This is the best movie I have seen in theaters thus far in 2018, and one of the best animated films I have seen in recent memory. I can't recommend Isle of Dogs enough!The stop motion animation is charming and beautiful. The art direction and design is so specific and intricate that you'll find new things in each frame every time you watch the movie. There is beauty in the desolation of Trash Island, and the characters feel alive and real.Speaking of characters, the voice acting in this film is truly incredible. The Wes Anderson staple of a highly talented, highly acclaimed ensemble cast is in full effect here. Bryan Cranston and Greta Gerwig shine as the rough-around-the-edges stray turned pack leader and the American exchange student with a conspiracy theory respectively. The banter between Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, and Bob Balaban as the pack of alpha-dogs is simply delightful. Every single cast-member gets their moment in the spotlight, and it's a joy to watch.In terms of direction, there is simply no director like Wes Anderson. The man is a modern-day auteur, and every film he's ever made is unlike anything I've ever experienced. Isle of Dogs is hilarious, somber, whimsical, melancholic, and utterly beautiful. There is something for everyone in Isle of Dogs, from kids, to animation fans, to Wes Anderson fans, to the average movie-goer. If you get a chance to see Isle of Dogs in theaters, GO. Do not miss this one!",

When one boy comes to rescue his pet, it starts a journey that ends in the expected. As is usually the case with Anderson, the art direction is imaginative, inventive and delightful. The story starts with a quirky energy that's fun, but about half way thru, things get a bit precious and the pace starts to lag. This is filmmaker with a singular style, but it sometimes becomes too self-indulgent.  Still, Anderson showcases his unique approach to storytelling, character and visual style.",

Wes Anderson is not a cult artist, he's a prolific maestro. His films always enjoy an added cachet that positions them far above many only-entertainment flicks, and his latest classical animated jewel meets perfectly what one would expect from an indie author who has erected his sublime filmography frame by frame. It's neither a blatant cultural appropriation of East Asian culture nor a scurrilous Japanese stereotyped assortment drawn by an injurious foreigner, it's a beautifully hand-made and delicate love story, a widely different, a fertile pic in visible and veiled exclamations on freedom, press, politics, principles, fear, transformation, friendship and human and dog's life which feeds off from a top-of-the-range vocal cast and a visual and technical section as eccentric and neat as every of the narrative ambitions of a filmmaker who not only sets up a baroque addition to his exquisite filmography and artistic growth but imbues this high-concept film, with some complacency, of a razor-sharp, sophisticated allegory that is clearly geared to the grown-up minds, those who resist to consider art as a channel of trivial thoughts, not as a mechanism of inescapable contact and advancement. There's no doubt that for Anderson's style newcomers the first thing they will highlight is tangibility of the pictures. When the screening was over, the up-front reference that arose in my mind was the most recent piece of art of Laika Entertainment, \"Kubo and the Two Strings,\" not precisely by the concordance with the cultural basis or some moral similarities, but by the beautifully crafted creations, by being an invaluable gift for cinema, by the unspeakable visual prowess that hundreds of artists have built for us. The symmetrical compositions of the ever-perfectionist director who refuses to subdue his works under the phenomena of the digital age are straightforwardly glittering; a sharper aim to circumvent known superficialities and immerse it into the complicated, visually speaking, Japanese pulp places this film on a higher level in artistic terms, even unfolding the majority of the action on an adjacent island. More broadly, what decorates with personality the feast of strangely gorgeous frames is incredible and awardable cinematographer Tristan Oliver, rich in nuances and recesses endowing the pictures with irrepressible force which grows uncontrollably as the film runs, every frame is an authentic, finely crafted and shaped sculpture passing through the hands of hundreds of exquisite animators who with their talent, literally and figuratively, capture the obsessions of an animation maestro; a spellbinding experience. Anderson isn't only known for his peculiar and unpractical but extremely gratifying filming method, the textual motives that mobilize such handmade constructions intervene in the success of the narrations. The script is written undeniable by the American director because the characteristics of a concise writer arise, sensitive in a given moment, but coolly manipulative when the film itself requires it. With regard to the dicey, well-intentioned plot, it's conceived by eight hands with own name and recognition: Kunichi Nomura, in his first work as a writer; Jason Schwartzman, in his third experience as a film screenwriter; Roman Coppola, in one of the greatest successes of his career; and Wes Anderson, a man who doesn't need a description, just run and get covered with his artistic visions. The perspective he gives the story is simply unique, social and pleasantly revitalizing not only due to the fussy field of animation but the drama genre lines it uses with an unusual confidence in levels of conviction and coherence with respect to a plot that doesn't set in an explicitly human context, in the strictest sense of the word. \"Isle of Dogs\" by Wes Anderson mesmerizes from beginning to end, partly by its mania of playing with the high expectations always put on a director's job. Accessible and sophisticated, strategic and human, hilarious and dramatic, strangely beautiful and directed; this animated film is an undeniable love letter from the filmmaker to Oriental culture, canines and, beyond doubt, the recesses and perversities of the feelings, actions and inspirations of humankind; A feature film that produces juicy critical, controversial commentaries through generally opposed elements that are quickly woven on a story led by any manifestation of love, prioritizing narrative, technical and artistic fields with the proportionality only a maestro could handle. If you want to enjoy a good movie you will have many more options to choose from, but if you demand a top-notch film you will be welcome to watch as a stop-motion animation monster puts an actor, screenwriter, producer and director\u2014 uninterested in making movies for an Oscar \u2014 on the front page, a place he has never gotten out from.",

What should be mentioned are the pros of this very movie. And, of course, Isle of Dogs, as any Wes Anderson movie, has what distinguishes it from any other Wes Anderson movie. In fact, there are three new pluses here. First, and foremost, the visually storytelling. Yes, I know it's not a new thing to say about a Wes Anderson movie, but there is no Wes Anderson movie, nor any stop-motion animated movie that has used its visuals to tell its story in this way. Specially, when you know that this movie has many scenes where there is no dialogue in English, just in Japanese, or where there are just Japanese subtitles! The second great thing about Isle of Dogs is the voice cast. Sorry Fantastic Mr. Fox, I love you more, but here the cast really adds up to the movie. The cast isn't star-studded just because it's a Wes Anderson movie, but every single actor, or actress, really made every character feels distinctive. Bryan Cranston voices Chief, who is, by the way, could be considered to be the real protagonist, and Bryan is GREAT! Easily the best. But really all the cast shines in this movie. Edward Norton is my second favorite. At last but not least, comes the music score from the Oscar winner, Alexandre Desplat. It has some Western touch in it, along with a traditional Japanese music. What a wonderful soundtrack that sticks in our mind long after watching the movie! As I mentioned above, I prefer Fantastic Mr. Fox to Isle of Dogs. That's because Isle of Dogs, unlike any other Wes Anderson movie, is convoluted for its own good. That didn't hurt the movie as whole, except at the third act, which is quite rushed and messy. Also, I wanted the character of Atari to feel more life-like person. Because I felt he was overshadowed by the dogs, nevertheless, Atari is a well-developed character.Isle of Dogs may didn't live up to my expectations, but still it is my favorite animated movie of 2018 so far!(8/10)",

If the government decided to pass such an act in real life, it\u2019d be no laughing manner. However, Wes Anderson\u2019s Isle of Dogs explains his own unpleasant reality for the near future in a strong sense of repugnantly clever dark humor.You maybe heard Japan historically made holy good fortune symbols out of cats: the maneki-neko (Fortune Cat) and the \u201cNambu Jinja\u201d (Cat God Shrine) to name a few, well once upon a time, feline lovers declared war on canines, beneath Mayor Kobayashi\u2019s command, due to an incurable dog flu and snout fever conspiracy theory, alongside canine overpopulation. Therefore, those dogs must live off rotten apple cores in Trash Island while everyone pushing the quarantine strokes a stink-eyed kitty in his lap. In this ominous future, dogs behave like humans, and humans behave like dogs, all in an inventive level of turning dogmatic excrement into gold more movies should reach.The set pieces diverge across modern Japan\u2019s high-contrast imagery that brims the manageable branding of Har\u014dkiti (Hello Kitty) into the monotone, not-so Kawaii (A Radiant Face) Trash Island with many garbage cubes signifying ultimate imprisonment. Green shows up almost nowhere in this feature, causing the entire island to glow of blood-stained muddy hues much like whatever your quadruped friend may have left on the front mat. If there is anything in the real world that would normally gag your reflexes, here, it instead exhausts beauty, say for instance, an illuminated glass bottle cave that silhouettes a dog pack who rest there for the night.Wes Anderson commands everything under his own mind game, as if he\u2019s adapting the wartime manga series \u201cNorakuro\u201d (Stray Black). Claymation cinematographer Tristan Oliver uses the light scheme to artfully mimic a spotlight on Mayor Kobayashi\u2019s control; the abandonment he details in each dense frame almost always positions pack leader Chief in center, the camera pivoting on an axis to draw our attention on each individual pooch.Chief leaves a greater impact than any other dog or human followed throughout the story, black from living through soot his entire life, zero nametag in sight. Each of the hounds\u2019 other nametags help you to identify their souls behind their fleas, not their imprisonment number tattoos, a lot like the following of typewriter names recorded as the holocaust victims state themselves in Schindler\u2019s List. One of these hounds, King, flaunts whiskers curled in a pompous high-class moustache fashion, just one small example of the stop-motion dolls\u2019 memorable designs. However, amongst the maggots Chief\u2019s pack must consume, they undeniably do little anything plot-productive. The standard American voice actors in part hurt it further, who never sound drunk off toilet bowl fluids as this film demands.Though Chief is an exception to the narrative flaws his pack carries; right from the start he needs a Hachik\u014d (Eight-Affection) type hero, until Atari, a twelve-year-old in search of his guard dog, Spots, triggers a change in attitude. Although Atari has few thoughts about each dog he meets, the main relationship between himself and Chief surprisingly sweet, topped off by some handsomely animated tears built to churn your pancreas in sorrow.In this Japanese fantasy-dystopia, captions in parentheses accompany Japanese text, dialogue mostly media translated. The dogs\u2019 barks are translated into English, ensuring easy international adaptation. To counteract the smog of pooch anti-paradise, familiar historical images of Japan include a Neko Jinja (Cat Shrine), Taiko boys, sumo wrestling, a N\u014d (Talent) production, and a humorously gross seafood bento box prep sequence.The Japanese murals here resemble toys recycled for affordable government-funded programs: a world where puppets control smaller puppets within perfect compositions that suggest political control upon whatever meticulous movement made. These fascist solutions, including robot canines built to replace regular canines, ends up less feasible than public lies, leading to few surprises why an Empire of Dogs might attempt rebellion toward the oppressive leaders\u2019 theatrical playset.Unlike most propaganda, Isle of Dogs turn the nation against itself in a weirdly entertaining way which safely repulses you enough to take initiative. In fact, the matter will get so out of hand as you watch this show, you\u2019ll need to go outside, vomit, regain yourself, then ask the nearest bystander out loud: \u201cWhatever happened to man\u2019s best friend?\u201d",

The writing is strong, witty and fast paced (especially in its first act) which should have come off in its favor, but due to multiple characters and their sub-plots that it has to cover in such short runtime (around 100 minutes), there is very little space for the audience to breathe in.

A decent job on giving the voice by the star cast to these eerie characters and so was the choice on casting them.

And sinks to darker depths than it can withstand. Isle of Dogs is a stop motion animated movie that looks and feels like Fantastic Mr. Fox and many other Wes Anderson movies. But Isle of Dogs leaves behind Mr. Fox's clever humor and goes full dark on the audience. The trailers made Isle look like a humorous animated kids movie about talking dogs with a simple boy searching for lost dog storyline. This was a gross misrepresentation. Isle of Dogs is a dark meandering conspiracy drama with no momentum. It bounces from title card to title card for an hour and forty minutes, never building up any sense of natural flow. This isn't due just to the choppy, symmetrical visual style. It's due to convoluted, broken storytelling that is confusing even for adults. Kids will not enjoy this movie. There are several adult themes throughout Isle of Dogs that are not suitable for children. The movie deals several times with suicide. I know that's a big deal in Japan, but it's a very serious tragic topic that needs to be delicately addressed. There are numerous depictions and discussions of graphic animal abuse to dogs. Early on we're shown a dog skeleton and led to believe that the boy just discovered his dead dog. There is also graphic violence, and a bloody surgery scene. The plot is really a massive mess of political/corporate conspiracies that overshadow the simple search for a lost dog. And we have to discuss the bilingual dialogue. Much of the movie is in Japanese. Only part of the Japanese dialogue has subtitles. Are you kidding?! This is an American movie released in America. It must be in English or have English subtitles. But even the English dialogue is lame, overcooking the Wes Anderson style. The visual style makes it hard to take anything very seriously, despite the heavy subject matter. But there is little else to lighten the mood. And without any likable or memorable characters, it's hard to stay engaged to the end. My advice is don't bother starting the trip to the Isle of Dogs.",

Chief's story arc was touching and so satisfying to see come full circle at the end of the film. The humour was scattered in bits throughout the film, Some of it was solid but some just kinda falls flat. I think Wes Anderson's humour is better off in live action because it just doesn't have the same impact when animated.A big issue for me was the plot. It wasn't interesting, It was too predictable and there were way too many subplots going on that they totally ignored the only decent thing about the film. Where this movie really strikes gold is when Atari is on the island with the dogs. That is where this movie is at it's best because you have an amazing cast, who worked great together, and you have a lot of touching, heartfelt moments during that short amount of time. Rather than deal with these stupid subplots featuring rather awful human characters, Wes should have focused more on the dogs because they're the best characters in the film.And I do agree with a few other reviews on here as well: This movie is quite boring at times and it can nearly put you or actually put you to sleep.",

It's also a\"Isle of Dogs\" is another artistically successful Wes Anderson production. It's a bit darker and more dramatic than I expected, but no less entertaining, and it's got standout moments of beauty and charm that will stick with me. It's also a fantastic showcase for the stunning medium of stop-motion animation.Bryan Cranston nails the key vocal performance as Chief, the stray dog who sticks out of the pack of alphas that hold sway over Trash Island. The other dogs have highlights and flesh out the world, but Cranston, who is at war with himself, is radiant, and almost singlehandedly sells the whole picture. Even though the premise of \"Isle of Dogs\" is so absurd, the story is rich in character moments and symbolism, and is structured like an epic. The point-of-view is more often than not from the dogs' eyes and ears, with much of the Japanese being untranslated, an interesting artistic choice that may come off as inspired to some and cloying to others, especially since the human element plays a rather large part in the plot.While Anderson has plenty of fun here with dog jokes and puns, he also manages to devote time to examining the age-old give-take relationship between humans and dogs, social and environmental issues, the increasing detritus and forgotten sins of the modern age (the price we pay for \"progress\"), the influence of media and the elite, and the pursuit of the higher self, all in the span of an hour and forty minutes.As Anderson yanks on heartstrings with close-ups of tear-filled human and dog eyes and emotionally rich scenes of great inter-species bonding and tribulation, he also pays homage to the old Japanese masters - Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, and Ozu are all referenced with gorgeous mise-en-scene, character and set design, story choices, and complex framing and tracking shots.Pay no heed to the \"professional\" critics crying \"cultural appropriation\". They are going out of their way to find fault here. I see nothing offensive in this intricate portrayal of a fictional, alternate-universe Japanese city in all of its beauty and complexity. This is a story that transcends cultural and linguistic boundaries and appeals to all dog lovers, even as it slyly comments on the elaborate fictions that we humans love to craft and live by. I'm really not sure how it will play to kids, though.Although \"Isle of Dogs\" wasn't the manic comedy I was expecting, and there are definitely pacing issues and missed opportunities, it really spoke to me in a way few films do these days, and in a manner and style that closely evokes Japanese cinema from the bygone eras of the 50s and 60s as much as it does the rest of Anderson's often-stellar oeuvre. I'm definitely seeing this one again.",

Surprising coming from Wes Anderson, but Isle of Dogs is a tribute to dogs! They are cute and loyal and possibly sounds like Jeff Goldblum if you are lucky!The stop-motion is beautiful! The movement is fluent and very accurate to how dogs move, and the designs are stellar! It's beautifully shot too, a trademark of any Wes Anderson feature, and the world is unique and lively. In terms of scale and even the actual method of animation, is surpasses Anderson's first animated feature, Fantastic Mr. Fox by a mile. The voice acting is top notch, with a major standout going to Bryan Cranston as the main dog Chief. It's one of the best celebrity voice acting I have heard in a long time! It does have the effect similar to James Franco in the Disaster Artist where he is doing such a good job that everyone else looks a lot worse by comparrison, as many of talented voice cast do more of the Wes Anderson monotone, however for the world that they inhabit they do match perfectly. And the friendship between Chief and Atari is cute and quite touching, albeit brief.The main issue does come into the use of Japanese language. This does tie into the controversy of cultural appropriation. While it is true that the Japanese setting is mainly for aesthetic purpose rather than a deeper meaning, I wouldn't say it's that big of a deal in terms of the film's quality. However when it comes to the language barrier, it is a problem. Often they do have either characters narrating over as translation, which is fine like the case with Francis McDormand's character, other times the film have other characters English-speaking characters narrate for no real reason. I wished that Wes Anderson either just had subtitles, or just not had any and let the actions of the Japanese characters speak for themselves without having any translations, as some of the best scenes of the movie use the visual storytelling of animation speak for the non-English characters. Also Greta Gerwig's character in the film is rather pointless with her ark having a bigger narrative that the film suggests but never having a satisfying conclusion, unless it is meant to be a subtle commentary on the white savior trope.Overall another fantastic film from Wes Anderson! Here's hoping for more stop-motion efforts from him!",

Simply put, Anderson succeeds on both fronts.Setting the film abroad in Japan poses numerous language and translation issues that have to be addressed throughout the film, and Anderson nimbly uses it to his advantage.  Furthermore, each of the dogs is given a meaningful amount of depth and characterization.  That being said, there were a handful of times I felt my attention drifting throughout the movie, and I found myself less emotionally invested in the plight of the characters as the film went on.  In the end, Anderson has brought to us another prototypical Wes Anderson film, a unique combination of his particular form and function that we\u2019ve come to know and enjoy, so while I certainly recommend seeing the film, I think it would really take being a dog lover to really love this movie.",

Plus, he still seems to be honing his craft and abilities. Isle of Dogs, in which all the dogs in a Japanese city in the near future are sent to a garbage dump island by a corrupt, dog-hating mayor when a disease breaks out, is his most impressive movie to date.Wes Anderson's films have always been visually arresting, but this one manages to beat all the others. The stop-motion format allows Anderson to control every angle, every visual in this detailed, fascinating-looking world that unfolds like a storybook come to life. Yeah, the human characters aren't the most polished-looking of stop-motion characters, but the dogss movement, including the wind in their hair, is really fluid. The story contains Anderson's traditional quirky, deadpan wittiness at full blast. The story is pretty inventive, there are even robot dogs!, while ultimately telling a heartwarming tale about loyalty to man's best friend. The ending is a bit rushed and resolved a little too easily if you ask me, though.Now if you don't like Wes Anderson in general than this won't be the film to change your mind. (He really doubles down on his style here.) But if you like something different from the usual film, than this is for you.",

He crash lands on the island, and a group of dogs decides to help him find his long-lost friend. Quite the adventure awaits. The story of Isle of Dogs is entertaining. There is subtle humor and quite a bit of world building that helped me become immersed in the world. But, if I'm being honest, the animation style is the main reason why I enjoyed this film so much. If this had been a live action film, heck, even if it had been a computer animated film, I don't think it would have connected with me nearly as much as it did. The animation style is just so unique that I was pretty invested from the get-go, and the story was serviceable enough to keep me invested. I do think that this is the type of film that's hard to generally recommend to everyone. Not everyone will like the story, and not everyone will like the animation style even if they typically like animated films. If you like Wes Anderson, you'll like this one. Otherwise, you may just have to give it a shot and see what you think.",

I feel that as much as the cure into it was plenty, it was mismanaged.I mean let's start with the talking dogs: the movie says that the movie is focused on the dogs dialogue first, with the humans mostly talking Japanese (mostly, because some don't, for some reason), and the reason I guess was to help us relate more with the dogs rather than the humans, to let us see the PoV of the dogs....but then there's a LOT of scenes with humans talking, introducing us characters we don't know (and most likely never will), and makes the whole dog talk a weird inconsistency. I think they should've made dogs silent instead, communicate with whines and barks instead, or perhaps have subs on THEM rather than the humans, or if you're going to put a foreign speech to make us \"separate\" from them, well, make their presence actually NOT matter! Secondly, the story is too messy to understand: there's this boy, called Atari, who wants to find his dog who was sent to this trash island. Why was it send to trash island? Because of a disease called dog flu that attacks all dogs. Why were they sent to the island? Because the bad guy hates dog and doesn't want to heal them. This is pretty much the plot btw and there's really not much else to say: the bad guy is there, he wants to look menacing, but there's really little of him, and the other protagonist, a girl which I don't even remember the name, wants to crusade against dog hate and is the ONLY other character that doesn't speak Japanese (alongside the interpreter...which again makes no sense! Are we supposed to be seeing the dogs PoV or not?!). I guess that, unsurprisingly, the best characters are the dogs but that's only because we get to see them more. And yet it feels lacking: the main 5 dogs are pretty bland and only the black dog gets any sort of character development, then you meet the other faction, outcasts or something, who were potentially great characters on their own, which I won't spoil but they could've made an entire movie on them ALONE!. But they appear only at the end, we barely even see them, except one or two, and then they disappear.I just don't understand what this movie was trying to do: the movie is kind of depressing but not in a good way, it just wants to be dark for the sake of dark, and the message it gives is quite mean and pretty cruel (although I'm sure that's not their intention). I assume there's a political message here but I guess I never understood it because when the movie ended I was just questioning \"what did I just watch exactly?\". I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either. I was hoping it was a good adventure movie about finding one's dog, with SOME human interactions and human side story. Instead if tried too much of both, but not enough in my opinion.I guess take a look but I'm not sure really. I'll probably forget it in a few days.",

The stop-motion animation only added to my enjoyment, giving the movie a hands-on and loving feel which demonstrates the amount of work, effort and time that was put into the film. The story was a fun and compelling narrative, and, despite being moderately similar to other works of Wes Anderson, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film. Even though the animation was a little bit stilted, as was the dialogue, I felt it had a charm to it and fit the style of the movie. The only voice actor that I felt could have done a better job was Scarlett Johansson, although I feel part of this was the somewhat diminutive manner in which women, and especially her character, were written into the film. Additionally, there were several moments wherein I felt not as if I were watching animated dogs but watching people voice animated dogs, something especially notable with Jeff Goldblum's performance. Despite this minor qualm, I still felt pleasantly satisfied with the voice acting in the movie, especially the ferocious delivery by the Japanese leader. The story is, as a whole very endearing and charming, with tones of redemption being very present. Note, this movie is not entirely a kid's movie, so one shouldn't approach it with solely such a mindset. Although it is PG in Canada and the UK, it is rated PG-13 in the states, which I feel adequately represents the film's nature. Wes Anderson's signature style is one of my favourites, with its wide, symmetrical shots, and its beautiful set pieces. These are things that aren't lost in this stop-motion film. I would recommend this film to anyone seeking either a fun theatre experience, a good art film, or a cute story about a boy trying to find his genetically-enhanced super bodyguard-dog.",

Others, I feel have looked too deeply into the political and racial aspects of the, at times, rather emotional situations covered by writer/producer/director Wes Anderson (even though there are certainly many astute observations to be considered).

The movie captivated me with its interesting story and beautiful set pieces. The animation in this movie is absolutely beautiful. I love the quiet scenes where they're all walking through beautiful environments, and the characters are black silhouettes. I'm also a big fan of the story, contrary to some other people. I love how this takes place in China and all the dogs are segregated to some remote island because of the disease their spreading. One thing I don't really understand and they might of explained in the movie is why Kobayashi or Major Domo hate dogs so much and want to kill them all. I guess its because there was a war between dog and cat dynasties at the beginning, but anyway i digress. Anyway, one other thing that I love about this movie so much is the colonization of the trash island the dogs were sent to and how they live. There is this one scene in the movie that i love and appreciate so much. Its when the owl comes to Spots and his tribe because he is the \"messenger\" of the island and the entire tribe gathers around the owl, and Spots says to the other dog, \"get this owl some sewer water\". As if these dogs are a real tribe giving a piece offering to this wise owl for sharing his information. There is a lot of good memorable scenes in this movie too. Again I like the quiet scenes where they are walking around these deserted beautiful set pieces. There is this where they are all building a boat which looks beautiful. A scene at the beginning where the dogs are fighting over a bag of garbage which is a great scene. I like how the 5 main dogs have to take a vote before they do something. The comedy in this film is alright, nothing that i laughed out loud at, but gave a little \"heh\" to. The humor is very visual comedy based, but there still is some witty dialogue in there as well. I want to talk about the animation again because it is so good! Wes Anderson and his team built figurines and small set pieces for them, and moved the figurines around frame by frame. You can really tell the amount of detail that went into the animation. I like when there is a fight in this movie, there is just a big cloud around the fight like an old cartoon, or how when a character is angry smoke will come out of there nose. Its those small details that really make me appreciate the animation. A flaw I have with this movie, is how some of the characters are just complete **** and not interesting at all. Like the stupid blonde afro girl who looks like she has smallpox, every scene she's in i just want to skip because she is just a boring, uninteresting character who tries to expose Kobayashi for the corrupt leader he is and what he's done, but she really just does nothing. She's just there as a sort of love interest for Atari. Speaking of love interest Scarlett Johansson's character is just another boring love interest for a main character and really adds nothing to the movie. Another character i'm not a fan of is Atari himself. He has a lot to do in this movie and has huge weight in the story. But he doesn't really do anything and just kinda speaks chinese the whole time, he's just not a very interesting character to me. All and all this is a good movie with a lot to like about, but I don't think this is Wes Anderson's best movie. It has beautiful animation, some interesting characters, and a compelling story. Honestly though I think anyone should see this movie just for the animation and beautiful visuals. 8/10 ****",

The movie's unique plot, combined with it's (sometimes dark) humor succeeded in keeping me engaged and entertained. One important thing to note about the movie is that Wes Anderson decided not to add subtitles to the characters who spoke Japanese. I think that this was because he wanted the audience to think. Wes Anderson wanted the audience to have their own interpretation of the film. Another reason may be that he possibly wanted the audience to feel like dogs, they can't understand human speech. This puts the viewer in the dog's shoes, and can help understand why despite the communication barrier, dogs are still considered man's best friend.",

I really appreciate the amount of sweat  and blood put into the creation of this film, being a stop-motion animated film. With that in mind, the cinematography in the film gave it a whole new effect and gave it a greater impact, which makes it so unique and fascinating. The combination of using cinematography techniques that is used in live action films and the animated characters and settings gives the film a sense of being \u201cother\u201d or makes it stand out.I find Wes Anderson\u2019s move to not subtitle the Japanese dialogue very interesting and brilliant; it allows the viewer to have a certain connection with the experiences of the relationship of the humans and the animals in the film. The humans can\u2019t understand the dogs as much as the dogs can\u2019t humans, and with the hope that a Japanese person doesn\u2019t watch the film, Wes Anderson planned to give the viewer the same feeling.",

And, of course, Isle of Dogs, as any Wes Anderson movie, has what distinguishes it from any other Wes Anderson movie. In fact, there are three new pluses here. First, and foremost, the visually storytelling. Yes, I know it's not a new thing to say about a Wes Anderson movie, but there is no Wes Anderson movie, nor any stop-motion animated movie that has used its visuals to tell its story in this way. Specially, when you know that this movie has many scenes where there is no dialogue in English, just in Japanese, or where there are just Japanese subtitles!The second great thing about Isle of Dogs is the voice cast. Sorry Fantastic Mr. Fox, I love you even more, but here the cast really adds up to the movie. The cast isn't star-studded just because it's a Wes Anderson movie, but every single actor, or actress, really made every character feels distinctive. Bryan Cranston, who voices Chief, is easily the best. His vocal performance here is undeniably one of the best in any animated movie from the last, say, five years. But really all the cast shines in this movie. Edward Norton is my second favorite.At last but not least, comes the music score from the Oscar winner, Alexandre Desplat. It has some Western touch in it, along with a traditional Japanese music. What a wonderful soundtrack! It really sticks in my mind long after watching the movie!.As I mentioned above, I prefer Fantastic Mr. Fox to Isle of Dogs. That's because Isle of Dogs, unlike any other Wes Anderson movie, is convoluted for its own good. That didn't hurt the movie as whole, except at the third act, which is quite rushed and messy. Also, I wanted the character of Atari to feel more life-like person. Because I felt he was overshadowed by the dogs. Nevertheless, Atari is a well-developed character.Isle of Dogs may didn't live up to my expectations, but still it is my favorite animated movie of 2018 so far!(8/10)",

However, I knew this was going to get some attention because of the animation which is reminiscent of Nightmare before Christmas, Fantastic Mr Fox, Wallace and Gromit and kubo. Little did I know how truly unique and abstractly beautiful this film was. For a film shot like this, it is remarkable the amount of movement in each scene. The unnatural angles, the sharp movements of the characters contrasted by gentle movements caused by soft winds, the comedic blocks of clouds and dust, all contribute to a fantastic charm which is not too distant from that often achieved in short films. There wasn't a wide variety of emotions experienced while watching this film, which is obviously the desired goal of a dystopian world. There is no real sense of dread and no real feeling of reluctant sadness of which clutters animated films, instead you watch every scene transfixed by the style, following the wandering characters and their minds.It really is a film to sit back and relax while watching. The smooth voices of the actors absorb you into the world and characters. There is no reliance on typical Hollywood tricks that is so formulaic at this point where music or poorly written dialogue is the only thing telling the audience what they should be thinking or feeling. Instead, in this film not all the dialogue is translated and whilst the soundtrack is beautiful it is not used to replace anything but it is used to compliment the story. Therefore, the audience feels engaged, they begin to think for themselves and makes you leave feeling you have experienced a truly authentic and unique film. My only real criticism is the childish minor plot detail of the whole cat versus dogs element that didn't feature heavily in the film, thankfully, but the fact it featured at all with little significance made that detail seem unnecessary and a bit predictable. Other than that this a really stylish mature film that can be both thoroughly enjoyed by both critic and audience, both old and young.",

I mostly give tons of extra points to stop motion films because, even if they are not good films in everything else besides the animation, I know what a pain in the a** making stop motion is. Not saying that 2D and 3D are easier (honestly any animation form has its level of difficulty) but stop motion requires a lot of extra work (Building the sets, the characters and all that). In that aspect, Isle of Dogs is great. I loved the visuals. I love the insane amount of detail in basically every single shot. It's really unbelievable. Not only the animation, but the style and the use of colors in general. The composition of each shot is also pretty good. Regardless of what you think about Wes Anderson, you have to admit that he knows what he is doing. I like the character design, specially the dogs. It's kinda refreshing to see a movie about dogs in which the dogs look...\"Ugly\". By that, I mean that the movie doesn't want you to care or to connect with the characters just because they are cute like most animated movies with animals as protagonists. Because they are not cute (They really aren't, they look terryfing but in a good way) the movie does a great job in making you like them in a different way: The writing.Now, I have mixed feelings about the writing. I thought that there were a lot of writing choices I just didn't agree with, specially plot points and character resolutions that I thought could've been written better. Also, most of the characters were very underdeveloped. I think that only Chief and Atari were the only characters that actually had a character. They were really well developed and fairly well written. The scenes between those two characters might be some of my favorite of the movie. There were other characters that I honestly think could've been completely removed, like the \"love interest\" of Chief. Many of the characters were one note and leave the movie halfway through. This is why I say that only Chief and Atari are the only actual characters because those are the ones that get the most screentime and actual relevance to the plot. Most of the acting was really bland. Maybe that was the direction that Wes Anderson gave them, but I honestly didn't like most of the acting. Most of the characters sound almost exactly the same. The only performance I liked was Brian Cranston's (who played Chief).I appreciated details in the movie as a whole, like when characters are speaking in japanese and there are no subtitles and the only way we get to know what they are saying is by an in-movie translator character or by an actual subtitle but when it's an important line. That was pretty cool, because, honestly I feel that many of the things the Japanese characters said were irrelevant. I feel like the \"gimmick\" of putting japanese text on the screen and underneath that text the english translation in a small font was cool at first but then starting to be overused to the point of feeling like the movie was doing it \"just because it looks cool\". Another issue I have, which is more of a nitpick is the fact that dogs speak in english. Why do they speak english? Do humans understand them? Do they actually talk or maybe it's just a metaphorical way of representing their thoughts? I don't know. But those are just nitpicks, like, the movie is not ruined because of that or anything. But what really stops this movie from being a flawless movie (which I think it could've been) is the writing and how some plot points are executed. This is still a great movie and while it's sadly not a masterpiece, it's really worth watching.",
